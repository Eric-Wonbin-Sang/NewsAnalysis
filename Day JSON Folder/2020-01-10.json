      "bodyText": "British officials have formally demanded that the wife of a US intelligence officer charged with causing the death by dangerous driving of the 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn be sent back to the UK to face trial. The Home Office has sent a request to the US government to extradite Anne Sacoolas, who has previously insisted she will not return to the UK voluntarily, over the case of the teenager who died in a collision outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August last year. A spokesman for the department confirmed the move on Friday evening, adding: \u201cThis is now a decision for the US authorities.\u201d However, the US state department called the request \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d. A department spokesman said: \u201cThe use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent.\u201d A spokesman for Dunn\u2019s family said that, while the move would not bring Dunn back, his relatives were nevertheless pleased at the extradition request and hailed it as a \u201chuge step towards achieving justice for Harry and making good on the promise that they made to him on the night he died that they would secure justice for him\u201d. The family\u2019s spokesman, Radd Seiger, said: \u201cDespite the unwelcome public comments currently emanating from the US administration that Anne Sacoolas will never be returned, Harry\u2019s parents \u2013 as victims \u2013 will simply look forward to the legal process unfolding, as it must now do, confident in the knowledge that the rule of law will be upheld. \u201cThey will simply take things one step at a time and not get ahead of themselves. However, no one, whether diplomat or otherwise, is above the law.\u201d In a separate interview with the BBC, Seiger said he was \u201c100%\u201d sure Sacoolas would return to the UK. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind and \u2026 there never has been. Whether it\u2019s today, or tomorrow, or in five years\u2019 time or in 10 years, Anne Sacoolas will come back, she has to come back.\u201d Dunn died after his motorbike collided with a car outside the RAF base. The 42-year-old suspect claimed diplomatic immunity after the incident and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international controversy. Dunn\u2019s family have initiated various legal proceedings against the Foreign Office, the US government and Sacoolas herself after their lawyers disputed the granting of diplomatic immunity. Under the treaty that exists between the two nations, the UK government is responsible for considering and forwarding extradition requests to the US state department once they have been certified by a judge. State department officials are responsible for determining whether or not they believe the request to be \u201cin proper order\u201d, before it is handed over to the department of justice and the US courts. The ultimate decision on whether someone is extradited lies with the US secretary of state.",

Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/20/tottenham-hotspur-jose-mourinho-named-new-manager-of-spurs\" title=\"\">taking over from Mauricio Pochettino on 20 November</a>, he has closed the gap on the top four from 11 points to six. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/20/jose-mourinho-jan-vertonghen-tottenham-toby-alderweireld\" title=\"\">Toby Alderweireld has signed a new contract</a> \u2013 saving the club a fortune on a potential replacement centre-half. And Dele Alli has rediscovered his form. Mourinho made the point that Hugo Lloris and Ben Davies would be back from long-term injuries by the end of the month, which would be like having \u201ctwo new players\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Mourinho\u2019s Happy One act was never going to last for the whole show and, equally, he knew that he was going to speak about Kane, not least because his audience would demand it. What he said caught the true mood at the club, one that has darkened significantly over the past few weeks and feels extremely edgy as the hierarchy attempts to navigate the transfer window.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have another one \u2013 there is not a striker in the squad,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWe have only one, he is not fit; we don\u2019t have another one. You know that you cannot play like we normally play when Harry Kane is not in the team. The only thing I can tell you is that, of course, we cannot do the same way [as we do] with Harry.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a remarkable state of affairs when a Champions League club has only one senior striker and Mourinho was not about to disagree. Pochettino usually turned to the wide forward Son Heung-min when Kane was unavailable but Mourinho is less comfortable with this arrangement.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a striker,\u201d Mourinho said of Son. \u201cDanny Rose can play right wing. But he\u2019s a left-back. It\u2019s as simple as that. Davinson S\u00e1nchez can play striker tomorrow but he\u2019s a central defender. A striker, what I call a No 9, a target man, Son is not.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome clubs have four and five [strikers]. If it\u2019s true that Inter Milan is buying [Olivier] Giroud [from Chelsea] \u2026 Giroud, [Romelu] Lukaku, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Alexis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 some teams, they have four. Inter is one example.

      "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho did not want to speak about Harry Kane. The pain of losing his talismanic striker to a hamstring rupture until April was too raw. \u201cIf I speak too much, I get depressed,\u201d the Tottenham manager said. \u201cAnd then you say I\u2019m miserable and in a bad mood. It\u2019s better to speak about things that make me laugh.\u201d Mourinho wanted to present an image of radiant positivity as he sat down to preview the visit of the Premier League\u2019s runaway leaders, Liverpool, in the Saturday\u2019s teatime kick-off. He was shaved and nicely coiffured, looking good. How was he feeling, one reporter asked. \u201cAmazing,\u201d he replied, flashing a full-beam smile. At one point, he draped an arm around his press officer and said the daunting challenge of Liverpool did not worry him. \u201cIn this room, only two persons think that we can win but we believe,\u201d he said, before turning to the press officer who, by now, was looking a little uncomfortable. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe, get out, man!\u201d So let\u2019s talk about the things that could make Mourinho smile. Since taking over from Mauricio Pochettino on 20 November, he has closed the gap on the top four from 11 points to six. Toby Alderweireld has signed a new contract \u2013 saving the club a fortune on a potential replacement centre-half. And Dele Alli has rediscovered his form. Mourinho made the point that Hugo Lloris and Ben Davies would be back from long-term injuries by the end of the month, which would be like having \u201ctwo new players\u201d. But Mourinho\u2019s Happy One act was never going to last for the whole show and, equally, he knew that he was going to speak about Kane, not least because his audience would demand it. What he said caught the true mood at the club, one that has darkened significantly over the past few weeks and feels extremely edgy as the hierarchy attempts to navigate the transfer window. \u201cWe don\u2019t have another one \u2013 there is not a striker in the squad,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWe have only one, he is not fit; we don\u2019t have another one. You know that you cannot play like we normally play when Harry Kane is not in the team. The only thing I can tell you is that, of course, we cannot do the same way [as we do] with Harry.\u201d It is a remarkable state of affairs when a Champions League club has only one senior striker and Mourinho was not about to disagree. Pochettino usually turned to the wide forward Son Heung-min when Kane was unavailable but Mourinho is less comfortable with this arrangement. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a striker,\u201d Mourinho said of Son. \u201cDanny Rose can play right wing. But he\u2019s a left-back. It\u2019s as simple as that. Davinson S\u00e1nchez can play striker tomorrow but he\u2019s a central defender. A striker, what I call a No 9, a target man, Son is not. \u201cSome clubs have four and five [strikers]. If it\u2019s true that Inter Milan is buying [Olivier] Giroud [from Chelsea] \u2026 Giroud, [Romelu] Lukaku, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Alexis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 some teams, they have four. Inter is one example. I can find more.\u201d For Mourinho, the problems have mounted, with Kane not the only new long-term absentee \u2013 Moussa Sissoko is also out until April after knee ligament surgery. The team have not played well since the 2-0 home defeat against Chelsea on 22 December. Defensively, they have been loose and error-strewn, which is un-Mourinho-like; there have been issues with the balance of the midfield and not enough penetration in the final third. Mourinho has brought a more direct gameplan, it remains a work in progress and it was revealing to hear Jan Vertonghen grumble after the New Year\u2019s Day defeat at Southampton that they had used \u201clong balls too quick\u201d. The situation has not been helped by Mourinho\u2019s lack of time on the training pitch, with this having been only his second clear week. \u201cIt has not been two months working with them, it is a few days,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cBasically, we don\u2019t train.

Their 4-0 win over Bournemouth was arguably their best fixture of the season, sealed by a brace from the talismanic Mark Noble and a much needed goal from Sebastien Haller, who started the new year with only one goal in his prior eleven games. Morale has risen and the squad is surely enjoying the fresh feeling of new beginnings, but today\u2019s clash with Sheffield United was always going to be a clearer reflection of where they are in these early days of Moyes\u2019 second reign. Moyes said as much in his press conference, preaching resilience and ruggedness ahead of their trip to Bramall Lane as he highlighted Pablo Fornals, Manuel Lanzini, S\u00e9bastien Haller and Felipe Anderson as some of the decisive players for his team in the coming weeks. Against Bornemouth, Moyes shifted from Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s trusted 4-2-3-1 in favour of a \u201csimple\u201d 4-4-1-1. He has still had almost no time to work with his new team, yet the Premier League waits for no one and we will again wait to see what he has to offer against extremely tough opposition.</p> <p>Sheffield United return to Bramall Lane under slightly different circumstances, having just reckoned with the most brutal pair of Premier League fixtures there are. United acquitted themselves well enough in their away games against both Manchester City and then Liverpool, but after being passed off the park by the excellent league leaders last Thursday, they will be relieved to be facing mere mortals again. Just a quick look at their position in the league (still 8th) and the number of goals they have conceded this year (still just 21, behind only the aforementioned teams) says plenty about the excellent season they continue to enjoy under the inventive and impressive Chris Wilder. For United, tonight presents an opportunity to return to winning ways in the Premier League after a difficult week.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "As Chris Wilder says that his team has \u201cdodged a bullet\u201d, here is Aaron Bower\u2019s report on Sheffield United\u2019s win. Declan Rice is understandably seething on Sky Sports. We\u2019re fuming, really. All the lads in there are livid. It\u2019s a tough place to come they\u2019ve been excellent all season and they grinded it out again. The goal at the end that\u2019s a tough one to take because a point on the road would have been very good for us... I\u2019m in a forward running motion and he\u2019s headed the ball to my arm. I\u2019ve not intentionally meant to handball it. It\u2019s a real kick in the teeth. I think it\u2019s the thoughts of every Premier League player, I don\u2019t think anyone wants VAR. I can\u2019t get over it to be honest, it\u2019s crazy. Looks like it will be another night of rage towards VAR! For the record, I\u2019m with Michael Owen here. The ball clearly hit Rice\u2019s arm. In this case at least, VAR simply enforced a questionable rule. John Fleck, one of the best players on the field today, is feeling very lucky: For the majority of the game we weren\u2019t good enough for the ball. I think we got lucky at the end. Goalscorer Oli McBurnie to Sky Sports: We\u2019re due one [favourable VAR decision]. We\u2019ve been done a couple of times this season and it\u2019s nice for one to go for us. The gaffer\u2019s got into us at half time. Fleck did magnificently and I think I tried my best to miss it at the end! With a late, dramatic VAR check, Sheffield United claw onto their victory. A tough, tight match decided by one moment of goalkeeping madness. Tenacious work from Declan Rice, who bullied Baldock off the ball and then found Snodgrass who slotted the ball home. But the ball hit Rice\u2019s hand in the build up and VAR makes no mistake. The new handball rules state that there can be no contact with the hand in the build up. Disallowed! Snodgrass levels at the death! 91 mins: As 3 minutes of added time are announced, Sheffield United drive at West Ham and Baldock forces a save out of Martin from a tight angle. 89 mins: Anderson doesn\u2019t exactly look great, but he is back on the pitch. 88 mins: Another free kick, another brilliant delivery from Snodgrass who immediately finds the forehead of Haller. Sadly for the Hammers, Haller\u2019s header was not nearly as good - he headed downwards and it bounced well away from the goal. A big chance there. 87 mins: After about 30 seconds of assessment, Anderson is up and walking gingerly as he goes off for some treatment. 86 mins: We have our first yellow card! Mo Besic hacks down Felipe Anderson and rightfully goes straight into the ref\u2019s book. Anderson is still down... 84 mins: A couple of substitutions for both teams as they both make their final changes. Billy Sharp replaces scorer Oli McBurnie for the Blades and Pablo Fornals replaces Manuel Lanzini for the Hammers. 82 mins: A huge chance for West Ham! I was just about to write about how careless West Ham were in possession, only for Egan to define carelessness by slipping with the ball and offering Lanzini a clear opportunity on goal. Lanzini shot hard at Henderson\u2019s near post and the Sheffield United keeper was once again equal to it. 77 mins: A lovely free kick from Lanzini! Sheffield United keeper Henderson hasn\u2019t had much to do so far today, but he awakens with a great diving save to keep the home team in the lead. Great work from all. More please. 75 mins: This game is finally opening up and starting to deliver on its promise. Sheffield United had the ball an advanced position, desperately trying to pick the West Ham defence open, but in the blink of an eye West Ham are now standing over the ball with a free kick in a dangerous area... 73 mins: Big chance for Sheffield United! Fleck sent Mousset clear with a glorious through ball. Martin somewhat redeemed himself with a great save from Mousset\u2019s low strike, but the Sheffield United striker really should have scored. 70 mins: Another change for Sheffield United. Besic replaces Lundstram. 69 mins: Snodgrass comes on and immediately whips in a beautiful free kick. Haller volleys it into the goal but it\u2019s a false alarm. Offside. 68 mins: A first change for West Ham. Robert Snodgrass, who scored in West Ham\u2019s home fixture earlier in the season, replaces Masuaku. Seems like West Ham are reverting to a back four. 64 mins: Quite a big chance for Sheffield United! They very nearly burnt West Ham with a brilliant, quick transition, but Ludstram\u2019s strike was just deflected for a corner. West Ham survive. 61 mins: That howler from David Martin was so dire that West Ham lost their composure in the immediately aftermath with too many panicked loose passes, but the game has now resumed its slow-burning tempo as before. Clearly, West Ham will have to be a little more adventurous. 59 mins: A first substitution for Sheffield United as David McGoldrick is off for Lys Mousset. Another game without a goal for the United talisman but also another decent shift. A complete howler of a goal kick from Martin finds Fleck, who calmly passed across the goal to McBurnie. The Sheffield United striker had the easiest finish he could ask for and he made no mistake. Truly horrendous goalkeeping. 49 mins: Big chance for Fleck to break the deadlock! A cross from the right flank evaded everyone and found the midfielder on the edge of the box. He absolutely obliterated a first-time left-footed strike which collided with Zabaleta. The rebound rolled straight back into his path and his second strike just flew wide. From Brian Withington: A pleasingly quiet first half from an away team perspective - nice to see Haller and Anderson putting a shift in. Yep, it has certainly been an organised and composed performance from David Moyes side so far. West Ham kick things off in the second half. Can they keep the home side at bay? The first half finished with 5 shots each from Sheffield United and West Ham United, but crucially no shots on target from either team. Gary Neville on Sky Sports is understandably disappointed with the home side: \u201cThey\u2019re not playing with any of the urgency we\u2019ve seen.\u201d From Ian Sargeant: \u201cIs this the first game where the summary of the first half contains 300 z\u2019s?\u201d Only 300? A half to forget. A couple of small chances from both teams, but not much else. You have to think that Moyes will be far happier with keeping a dangerous Sheffield United at bay but it wasn\u2019t exactly glorious from either team. 45 mins: Two minutes added on, but not much is happening here in truth. An incredibly important factoid. 41 mins: That was a decent period of possession from Sheffield United, with Fleck picking up the ball and dribbling in space before finding Norwood. Norwood flicked in a cross from the right towards McBurnie at the far post, but the striker just couldn\u2019t reach it. Again, their quality on the final ball is just lacking right now. 37 mins: Sheffield United win another corner and this time Lundstram manages to get his head on it but his header flies well wide of the post. We go on. 33 mins: Masuaku takes a pot shot from distance after a sleek interchange between Lanzini and Zabaleta, but his strike was well long. In truth, this has not been the liveliest half of football so far. Sheffield United have been better on the ball but have lacked quality in the final third. West Ham are slowly improving in possession but they need more. 30 mins: The corner came to nothing, only for West Ham to create their first big chance of the game! Egan misjudged his backwards header off a long ball from Martin. The ball found Anderson who took a couple of strides into the box before rolling his strike across the goal. Not good enough. 28 mins: West Ham are starting to find more of the ball in advanced areas and they have won their first corner after a deflected cross. Lanzini to take it... It is worth noting that Lukasz Fabianski\u2019s lengthy layoff with a hip injury earlier this season, which seriously hurt the Hammers, was also after a goal kick. If he is smart, we may have just seen the Pole attempt his final goal kick. From Peter Oh: From a club crest perspective, this match-up is about as tough as it gets. A crossed pair of swords versus a crossed pair of hammers. Hopefully the symbolism doesn\u2019t translate into bludgeoning football devoid of subtlety and flair. I second that. No bludgeoning please. 22 mins: A tough tackle from Lundstram on Cresswell and he is done for a free kick as the West Ham full back limps off the damage. Expect more aggressive tackling from the home team. 19 mins: Another big chance for the home side after Anderson conceded a free kick. Fleck\u2019s free kick rebounded to Lundstram in the box, who connected with a decent volley but he sent it straight at Martin who scuppered the danger. A confidence building save from the West Ham keeper. 17 mins: Another corner for Sheffield United comes to nothing. West Ham attempt to break, but Noble\u2019s attempt at a through ball sends the ball straight back to the home side. 15 mins: West Ham get their first shot of the day after Anderson picked out Haller with a divine ball across the field. Haller\u2019s attempt wasn\u2019t quite as pleasing, with it flying high into the crowd as he slipped onto his butt. 14 mins: West Ham United are forced into their first substitution as David Martin replaces Lukasz Fabianski. The Pole understandably looks distraught. 13 mins: Oh dear. Lukasz Fabianski, who only recently returned to injury, is down on the floor with injury. It seems like he pulled his quad after a goal kick. His game is already over. 12 mins: That was close. Norwood whipped in a lovely corner and it found the head of Egan, who just headed it over the bar. The first decent chance of the game. 11 mins: Sheffield United continue to command possession. A really nice turn from McBurnie, who picks out Stevens on the left. Zabaleta does just enough to get the ball out for a corner... 8 mins: The first corner of the evening goes to Sheffield United. Norwood\u2019s delivery came to nothing but United recycled their possession and moved forward again. Stevens whipped in a nice ball, but there was nobody in the box to get on the end of it. A nice period of possession for the home team. 5 mins: A weak backwards header from Baldock towards Henderson almost caused some problems for the Sheffield United defence. Manuel Lanzini chased it down and challenged Henderson, but he gave away a free kick in the process. Not too much happening early on. 4 mins: Things are just settling down here but Jack O\u2019Connell seems to have landed awkwardly after leaping for a header and he is limping a little. Hopefully he will run it off. Sheffield United kick things off tonight. Let\u2019s see how this one goes. Is it time? Chris Wilder spoke about his new contract and another new game on Sky Sports: Delighted to commit, it\u2019s a fabulous club close to my heart. We\u2019re going well and hopefully good times ahead. [On maintaining their position in the league] Onto the next game and see if we can get a result. We\u2019ve created this so you\u2019d rather have it this way than the other. Going into the premier league it\u2019s something you want more of. [On whether he believed his team would do so well] It\u2019s a lot of apprehension around and quite rightly so because of the lack of experience. I\u2019ve never managed at this level and the players, aside from Jagielka, haven\u2019t. Always the aim for a newly promoted team is to get a foothold in the division... But we want more and there\u2019s a lot of belief in the changing room that we can carry on into the new year. The team news: Just one change for Sheffield United, with Oli McBurnie replacing Lys Mousset in the starting eleven. Three changes to West Ham\u2019s starting eleven, with Pablo Zabaleta, Mark Noble and Aaron Cresswell all back. Robert Snodgrass, who scored against Sheffield United earlier in the season, and Issa Diop move to the bench. Ryan Fredericks is out with a hamstring injury. When asked if he had shifted from a 4-4-1-1 to a 3-5-2 in his second Premier League game, Moyes was pretty coy: \u201cI want to be flexible. I don\u2019t want to be tied down in any way. So, we\u2019ll see.\u201d The teams: Sheffield United: Henderson; Basham, Egan, O\u2019Connell; Baldock, Lundstram, Norwood, Fleck, Stevens; McBurnie, McGoldrick. Eastwood, Sharp, Mousset, Jagielka, Robinson, Osborn, Besic West Ham United: Fabia\u0144ski; Zabaleta, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Anderson, Rice, Noble, Masuaku; Lanzini; Haller. Martin, Cardoso, Diop, Ngakia, Rosa, Snodgrass, Fornals Sheffield United owner Prince Abdullah Bin Mosaad Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was just discussing Chris Wilder\u2019s new contract on Sky Sports: We are very excited. he has been a big part of the club\u2019s success. Stability is very important. I think we\u2019re very happy with Chris\u2019 record and we\u2019re looking forward to another four and a half years, with a fifth season optional. I told Chris when I met him that we will be coming to him soon before he approach[es] us with a new contract. I think he has earned it. Sheffield United have announced that Chris Wilder (and his assistant, Alan Knill) has signed a contract extension until 2024. And rightly so. May we also not forget that Sheffield United and West Ham United have some history. And here is Paul Doyle on David McGoldrick. Some required reading today: Jacob Steinberg\u2019s very nice interview with Michael Antonio. David Moyes could not have wished for a better first game back in charge of West Ham United on New Year\u2019s Day. Their 4-0 win over Bournemouth was arguably their best fixture of the season, sealed by a brace from the talismanic Mark Noble and a much needed goal from Sebastien Haller, who started the new year with only one goal in his prior eleven games. Morale has risen and the squad is surely enjoying the fresh feeling of new beginnings, but today\u2019s clash with Sheffield United was always going to be a clearer reflection of where they are in these early days of Moyes\u2019 second reign. Moyes said as much in his press conference, preaching resilience and ruggedness ahead of their trip to Bramall Lane as he highlighted Pablo Fornals, Manuel Lanzini, S\u00e9bastien Haller and Felipe Anderson as some of the decisive players for his team in the coming weeks. Against Bornemouth, Moyes shifted from Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s trusted 4-2-3-1 in favour of a \u201csimple\u201d 4-4-1-1. He has still had almost no time to work with his new team, yet the Premier League waits for no one and we will again wait to see what he has to offer against extremely tough opposition. Sheffield United return to Bramall Lane under slightly different circumstances, having just reckoned with the most brutal pair of Premier League fixtures there are. United acquitted themselves well enough in their away games against both Manchester City and then Liverpool, but after being passed off the park by the excellent league leaders last Thursday, they will be relieved to be facing mere mortals again. Just a quick look at their position in the league (still 8th) and the number of goals they have conceded this year (still just 21, behind only the aforementioned teams) says plenty about the excellent season they continue to enjoy under the inventive and impressive Chris Wilder. For United, tonight presents an opportunity to return to winning ways in the Premier League after a difficult week.",

It seems no Premier League game of significance is complete without a cameo from VAR these days \u2013 the fact that this intervention came deep into added time to deny West Ham an equaliser Moyes felt they deserved will have done little to appease him following the end of his unbeaten start in charge.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/10/sheff-utd-v-west-ham-premier-league-live\">Sheffield United v West Ham: Premier League \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Robert Snodgrass seemingly scored in injury time, it sparked chaotic scenes among both the away supporters, while Moyes raced down the touchline to celebrate what seemed to be another important point for his new side. However, with the much-maligned handball law enforced by VAR after determining Declan Rice had handled in the build-up, the goal was disallowed. Naturally, Moyes was unhappy afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a good goal to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like a law nobody is enjoying too much, but it looks like there\u2019s a few laws nobody is enjoying too much.\u201d But this was a night with other problems away from VAR too. Lukasz Fabianski suffering a recurrence of the injury which had kept him out for three months \u2013 again while taking a goal kick \u2013 would have been bad enough.</p> <p>However the fact that his replacement, and the man who is now their only fit senior goalkeeper, gift-wrapped Sheffield United the winner here will have been doubly hard to take. David Martin\u2019s rushed pass was intended for Fabi\u00e1n Balbuena; instead, it found its way to John Fleck who kept his nerve, squared for Oli McBurnie and allowed the Blades to move up to fifth with the game\u2019s only goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38676ef8b1e59cfd3d3d1e6b49d5cbf0014ffa24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38676ef8b1e59cfd3d3d1e6b49d5cbf0014ffa24/205_567_4393_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lukasz Fabianski injured himself while taking a goal kick for the second time this season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lukasz Fabianski injured himself while taking a goal kick for the second time this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest three points of the season,\u201d said Chris Wilder, who on the day of agreeing a contract extension to 2024, admitted he had sympathy for his opposite number. \u201cTo get to 32 points at this stage is great but I feel a bit deflated because that\u2019s happened to us two or three times this season. What their manager has felt, I\u2019ve felt.\u201d All that second-half drama, culminating in Snodgrass\u2019s disallowed equaliser, thankfully overshadowed a fairly forgettable first half.</p> <p>There were few gilt-edged opportunities for either side in the opening 45 minutes, with the best falling to Felipe Anderson, who fired wide after sneaking through on goal. Moyes had opted to match the home side up tactically and while it certainly produced some resilience, it ultimately offered little going forward.</p> <p>Fabianski\u2019s departure \u2013 \u201cIt looks like a recurrence of the same injury, we\u2019ll have to get the tests done over the weekend,\u201d Moyes said \u2013 was the one real talking point: and it turned out to be decisive. When Martin\u2019s sloppy pass led to McBurnie\u2019s fourth of the season, it forced the visitors into a tactical change. Snodgrass came on, West Ham reverted to a back four and with his first touch, his free-kick saw S\u00e9bastien Haller score \u2013 only to be disallowed by the offside flag. At the other end, Wilder\u2019s side had chances to kill the game, and their profligacy in that regard looked as though it would hurt them deep into injury time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rice surged forward, played in Snodgrass and he drove past Dean Henderson. That sparked delirium in the away end but of course, there was one final act to be written by Stockley Park. Moyes had barely stopped celebrating by the time VAR concluded that John Egan heading the ball into Rice\u2019s arm constituted handball, which in turn produced the loudest cheer of the night for home supporters.</p> <p>The night began with West Ham supporters taunting the home side with Carlos Tevez chants, owing to the infamous chapter of history <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/west-ham-carlos-tevez-javier-mascherano-sheffield-united-premier-league\" title=\"\">between the clubs over a decade ago</a>.

The fact the Hammers continue to pursue a return for Darren Randolph despite the Republic of Ireland international being injured perhaps emphasised Moyes knew the extent of those problems already, but either way, they were brutally laid out for him here. Of course that was not the whole story on a dramatic night at Bramall Lane. It seems no Premier League game of significance is complete without a cameo from VAR these days \u2013 the fact that this intervention came deep into added time to deny West Ham an equaliser Moyes felt they deserved will have done little to appease him following the end of his unbeaten start in charge. When Robert Snodgrass seemingly scored in injury time, it sparked chaotic scenes among both the away supporters, while Moyes raced down the touchline to celebrate what seemed to be another important point for his new side. However, with the much-maligned handball law enforced by VAR after determining Declan Rice had handled in the build-up, the goal was disallowed. Naturally, Moyes was unhappy afterwards. \u201cIt was a good goal to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like a law nobody is enjoying too much, but it looks like there\u2019s a few laws nobody is enjoying too much.\u201d But this was a night with other problems away from VAR too. Lukasz Fabianski suffering a recurrence of the injury which had kept him out for three months \u2013 again while taking a goal kick \u2013 would have been bad enough. However the fact that his replacement, and the man who is now their only fit senior goalkeeper, gift-wrapped Sheffield United the winner here will have been doubly hard to take. David Martin\u2019s rushed pass was intended for Fabi\u00e1n Balbuena; instead, it found its way to John Fleck who kept his nerve, squared for Oli McBurnie and allowed the Blades to move up to fifth with the game\u2019s only goal. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest three points of the season,\u201d said Chris Wilder, who on the day of agreeing a contract extension to 2024, admitted he had sympathy for his opposite number. \u201cTo get to 32 points at this stage is great but I feel a bit deflated because that\u2019s happened to us two or three times this season. What their manager has felt, I\u2019ve felt.\u201d All that second-half drama, culminating in Snodgrass\u2019s disallowed equaliser, thankfully overshadowed a fairly forgettable first half. There were few gilt-edged opportunities for either side in the opening 45 minutes, with the best falling to Felipe Anderson, who fired wide after sneaking through on goal. Moyes had opted to match the home side up tactically and while it certainly produced some resilience, it ultimately offered little going forward. Fabianski\u2019s departure \u2013 \u201cIt looks like a recurrence of the same injury, we\u2019ll have to get the tests done over the weekend,\u201d Moyes said \u2013 was the one real talking point: and it turned out to be decisive. When Martin\u2019s sloppy pass led to McBurnie\u2019s fourth of the season, it forced the visitors into a tactical change. Snodgrass came on, West Ham reverted to a back four and with his first touch, his free-kick saw S\u00e9bastien Haller score \u2013 only to be disallowed by the offside flag. At the other end, Wilder\u2019s side had chances to kill the game, and their profligacy in that regard looked as though it would hurt them deep into injury time. Rice surged forward, played in Snodgrass and he drove past Dean Henderson. That sparked delirium in the away end but of course, there was one final act to be written by Stockley Park. Moyes had barely stopped celebrating by the time VAR concluded that John Egan heading the ball into Rice\u2019s arm constituted handball, which in turn produced the loudest cheer of the night for home supporters. The night began with West Ham supporters taunting the home side with Carlos Tevez chants, owing to the infamous chapter of history between the clubs over a decade ago. As the home fans rounded off the night with renditions of \u201cVAR, VAR\u201d in reply, you suspected that while those deep wounds from the Tevez saga have not fully healed, this frenetic night under the lights will certainly have helped.",

      "body": "<p>After 50 years of writing more than 50 plays, David Williamson insists he is retiring from the theatre.</p> <p>Turning 78 this February, the Noosa, south Queensland-based playwright is about to see his last two new plays produced back to back in Sydney where he built his career, while his classic semi-autobiographical satire of the harbour metropolis, Emerald City, will be remounted in a new production in Brisbane and Melbourne.</p> <p>Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact he is widely regarded as Australia\u2019s most commercially successful playwright, with a loyal audience hooked on his naturalistic style of storytelling about the white middle class, Williamson\u2019s relationship with the people he sees as the cultural gatekeepers \u2013 theatre critics \u2013 has been fraught. Williamson says critics dismiss his work because it is popular, although the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-21/defending_david_williamson27s_critics/44338\">quality of his work</a> has also been questioned. He once accused the Sydney Theatre Company <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/the-removalist-no-room-at-wharf-for-my-stories-20090513-gdtj22.html\">of ignoring his plays</a> \u201cbecause I\u2019m not theatre with a capital T\u201d.</p> <p>Williamson argues his playwrighting has always examined human psychology and verbal self-deception. But he now says he wants to make way for younger voices, including the minority playwrights he acknowledges have been denied a platform, to tackle the many issues Australia is facing. He\u2019s had a \u201cdream run\u201d, he emphasises, and \u201ccan\u2019t whinge\u201d about his unabated box office success.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The whole process is stressful, from the writing of 12 or 15 drafts to the whole business of opening nights</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Williamson, who has five children and 14 grandchildren, retirement is also motivated by his health: he has a long-term heart rhythm problem and several years ago suffered a <a href=\"https://strokefoundation.org.au/About-Stroke/Types-of-stroke/Transient-Ischaemic-Attack-TIA\">transient ischaemic attack</a>, which temporarily paralysed the right side of his body. \u201cThe whole process is stressful, from the writing of 12 or 15 drafts to the whole business of opening nights,\u201d he says. \u201cFor many years, I couldn\u2019t even go to an opening night. I had to have Kristin [Williamson, his wife and a fellow writer] reporting to me how things were going.</p> <p>\u201cYou go to a brilliant opening night, you know it has connected, and then you think [of the critics]: \u2018Oh those fuckers\u2019. I remember one [review] line that said, \u2018I sat with a dark cloud hovering above me as people fell off their seats laughing around me\u2019. And you think, what is so terrible about that? Why did the black cloud descend upon him to see people enjoying themselves in the theatre?\u201d</p> <p>Famously, Williamson\u2019s writing has often been clearly drawn from his experiences. In the early 1970s, he left his then-pregnant wife for his current wife, who also left her husband. This became the basis for his early play Jugglers Three, a depiction of two marriages breaking up, rewritten many years later as Third World Blues in which a character called Elizabeth accuses a character called Neville, based on Williamson, of having a \u201chyperinflated ego\u201d.</p> <p>Is everything in his life playwriting material? \u201cWell, I have drawn on life. Any writer who says they don\u2019t is lying. But you do change and alter [the details].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84c29a2450a14e9a9ecfbc1d4962929ea0e01876\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84c29a2450a14e9a9ecfbc1d4962929ea0e01876/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Williamson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Williamson and his brother grew up in \u2018a house of perpetual drama\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her 2009 biography of Williamson, Kristin \u2013 who met the playwright when she was cast in one of his early plays \u2013 argued that the \u201coutraged letters and emails\u201d her husband \u201cfired off in fits of rage\u201d to critics, directors and producers were borne of a sensitivity that also made him an \u201castute dramatist\u201d who could perceive \u201cmalignant undercurrents in social behaviour\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/09/from-profane-to-profound-wil-anderson-on-the-changing-face-of-standup\">From profane to profound: Wil Anderson on the changing face of standup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We meet in the rehearsal room for his<a href=\"https://griffintheatre.com.au/whats-on/family-values/\"> new play Family Values</a>. Williamson stands more than two metres tall; he used to fantasise about being shorter so he wouldn\u2019t stand out so much. He is affable, sincere, a good listener, eloquent and forthcoming in his responses, although he brings up the critics of his work much earlier than I had planned: it\u2019s clearly a spectre that will always bother him, even while acknowledging he has overreacted on occasion.</p> <p>He agrees with his wife\u2019s take on his psychology \u2013 but adds the rhythms of the \u201cbitter fighting\u201d between his late parents, gregarious retail saleswoman mother Elvie and quiet accountant father Keith, also \u201cenormously\u201d influenced his work.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realise it at the time, but my brother and I grew up in a house of perpetual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was hardly a minute when they weren\u2019t having a go at each other. It wasn\u2019t until the age of 11 that I realised it was a bit more complex than that, when I caught my mother goading my father to the point of an explosion.</p> <p>\u201cHe was never a physically violent man, but finally he could be provoked into calling her names. I remember when my mother raced out to the laundry, and I followed her: she was chuckling away.\u201d A few years before her death, Williamson brought up the memory, and asked her what was going on. \u201cWell, it did get pretty boring in the country,\u201d she answered.</p> <p>\u201cShe was sparking the drama,\u201d he says now. \u201cI spent my young life wondering, \u2018How can I avoid this? Is this what marriage means?\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s almost painful to pick up the Murdoch press every day and see the blatant attack on social progressivism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Born in 1942, Williamson grew up in the middle-class suburb of Bentleigh, then on Melbourne\u2019s outskirts. The family moved when he was 12 to country Bairnsdale.</p> <p>At the time, theatres in Australia offered virtually no plays about contemporary Australian society. In 1964, Williamson became Monash University\u2019s first graduate in mechanical engineering \u2013 but as an assistant project engineer at General Motors-Holden he would read Chekhov under the desk.</p> <p>Williamson\u2019s subsequent study of psychology at Melbourne University would inspire him to think of himself as a \u201csocial scientist\u201d, and he began writing plays. In 1971, his middle-class suburban election night satire, Don\u2019s Party, was a hit at the Pram Factory, but the collective that ran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/21/la-mama-theatre-melbourne-fire-ravaged-ready-to-rebuild-after-raising-31m\">La Mama theatre</a> in Carlton thought it too bourgeoisie \u2013 so he wrote them a hard-hitting look at police and male brutality, The Removalists, which won him a prestigious award in London.</p> <p>Instead of moving his career there in the wake of this international attention, he sensed his continued connection to Australian place and vernacular was critical to his writing.

      "bodyText": "After 50 years of writing more than 50 plays, David Williamson insists he is retiring from the theatre. Turning 78 this February, the Noosa, south Queensland-based playwright is about to see his last two new plays produced back to back in Sydney where he built his career, while his classic semi-autobiographical satire of the harbour metropolis, Emerald City, will be remounted in a new production in Brisbane and Melbourne. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact he is widely regarded as Australia\u2019s most commercially successful playwright, with a loyal audience hooked on his naturalistic style of storytelling about the white middle class, Williamson\u2019s relationship with the people he sees as the cultural gatekeepers \u2013 theatre critics \u2013 has been fraught. Williamson says critics dismiss his work because it is popular, although the quality of his work has also been questioned. He once accused the Sydney Theatre Company of ignoring his plays \u201cbecause I\u2019m not theatre with a capital T\u201d. Williamson argues his playwrighting has always examined human psychology and verbal self-deception. But he now says he wants to make way for younger voices, including the minority playwrights he acknowledges have been denied a platform, to tackle the many issues Australia is facing. He\u2019s had a \u201cdream run\u201d, he emphasises, and \u201ccan\u2019t whinge\u201d about his unabated box office success. For Williamson, who has five children and 14 grandchildren, retirement is also motivated by his health: he has a long-term heart rhythm problem and several years ago suffered a transient ischaemic attack, which temporarily paralysed the right side of his body. \u201cThe whole process is stressful, from the writing of 12 or 15 drafts to the whole business of opening nights,\u201d he says. \u201cFor many years, I couldn\u2019t even go to an opening night. I had to have Kristin [Williamson, his wife and a fellow writer] reporting to me how things were going. \u201cYou go to a brilliant opening night, you know it has connected, and then you think [of the critics]: \u2018Oh those fuckers\u2019. I remember one [review] line that said, \u2018I sat with a dark cloud hovering above me as people fell off their seats laughing around me\u2019. And you think, what is so terrible about that? Why did the black cloud descend upon him to see people enjoying themselves in the theatre?\u201d Famously, Williamson\u2019s writing has often been clearly drawn from his experiences. In the early 1970s, he left his then-pregnant wife for his current wife, who also left her husband. This became the basis for his early play Jugglers Three, a depiction of two marriages breaking up, rewritten many years later as Third World Blues in which a character called Elizabeth accuses a character called Neville, based on Williamson, of having a \u201chyperinflated ego\u201d. Is everything in his life playwriting material? \u201cWell, I have drawn on life. Any writer who says they don\u2019t is lying. But you do change and alter [the details].\u201d In her 2009 biography of Williamson, Kristin \u2013 who met the playwright when she was cast in one of his early plays \u2013 argued that the \u201coutraged letters and emails\u201d her husband \u201cfired off in fits of rage\u201d to critics, directors and producers were borne of a sensitivity that also made him an \u201castute dramatist\u201d who could perceive \u201cmalignant undercurrents in social behaviour\u201d. We meet in the rehearsal room for his new play Family Values. Williamson stands more than two metres tall; he used to fantasise about being shorter so he wouldn\u2019t stand out so much. He is affable, sincere, a good listener, eloquent and forthcoming in his responses, although he brings up the critics of his work much earlier than I had planned: it\u2019s clearly a spectre that will always bother him, even while acknowledging he has overreacted on occasion. He agrees with his wife\u2019s take on his psychology \u2013 but adds the rhythms of the \u201cbitter fighting\u201d between his late parents, gregarious retail saleswoman mother Elvie and quiet accountant father Keith, also \u201cenormously\u201d influenced his work. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it at the time, but my brother and I grew up in a house of perpetual drama,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was hardly a minute when they weren\u2019t having a go at each other. It wasn\u2019t until the age of 11 that I realised it was a bit more complex than that, when I caught my mother goading my father to the point of an explosion. \u201cHe was never a physically violent man, but finally he could be provoked into calling her names. I remember when my mother raced out to the laundry, and I followed her: she was chuckling away.\u201d A few years before her death, Williamson brought up the memory, and asked her what was going on. \u201cWell, it did get pretty boring in the country,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe was sparking the drama,\u201d he says now. \u201cI spent my young life wondering, \u2018How can I avoid this? Is this what marriage means?\u2019\u201d Born in 1942, Williamson grew up in the middle-class suburb of Bentleigh, then on Melbourne\u2019s outskirts. The family moved when he was 12 to country Bairnsdale. At the time, theatres in Australia offered virtually no plays about contemporary Australian society. In 1964, Williamson became Monash University\u2019s first graduate in mechanical engineering \u2013 but as an assistant project engineer at General Motors-Holden he would read Chekhov under the desk. Williamson\u2019s subsequent study of psychology at Melbourne University would inspire him to think of himself as a \u201csocial scientist\u201d, and he began writing plays. In 1971, his middle-class suburban election night satire, Don\u2019s Party, was a hit at the Pram Factory, but the collective that ran La Mama theatre in Carlton thought it too bourgeoisie \u2013 so he wrote them a hard-hitting look at police and male brutality, The Removalists, which won him a prestigious award in London. Instead of moving his career there in the wake of this international attention, he sensed his continued connection to Australian place and vernacular was critical to his writing. Williamson stayed home and rode the 1970s Australian \u201cnew wave\u201d film industry resurgence, adapting many of his stage plays into successfully produced screenplays. In his youth, Kristin Williamson wrote, David \u201cbecame a zealous leftwinger, to the extent that he tried to convert his parents\u201d. Is he still politically to the left? \u201cOh yes,\u201d he says now. \u201cDespite what some of my critics have said about me being a social conservative, there is an underlying social concern in all but a few of my plays. I always hope to be entertaining on the surface, but saying something about the state of our society in the subtext. \u201cI haven\u2019t lost that. I am so angered by the growing injustices and inequalities in the world that it does still fire me up. It\u2019s almost painful to pick up the Murdoch press every day and see the blatant attack on social progressivism of any kind, the fervent belief in neoliberalism, despite the world heading towards a real catastrophe. \u201cThe honchos tend to be ageing white males, wealthy white males, who are incredibly threatened by the science of climate change, because it threatens their whole world view that neoliberalism has delivered huge prosperity to the world, that growth can go on forever, that there will be no evil consequences.\u201d Indeed, Williamson\u2019s final two new plays offer social critiques of Australia now. Family Values reflects the writer\u2019s disdain for Australia\u2019s refugee policy, and has an asylum seeker character. Mandatory offshore detention \u201chas been one of the morally despicable acts the Australian government has carried out, and both sides are guilty \u2013 Labor started it\u201d, he says. \u201cI fail to understand Jacqui Lambie voting against medevac because she said openly medevac is no threat to Australian security.\u201d The other play, Crunch Time \u2013 a blackly comic story of a father and son healing a relationship \u2013 carries the theme of assisted death. Williamson laments the failure of most states to adopt voluntary euthanasia laws. \u201cThe NSW Liberal party seems to be still in thrall of the religious right, and it\u2019s the lizard brain dictating the rational capacity of human beings; it\u2019s some emotional fear that someone is going to turn the switch off on them, or God wants to prolong our pain as long as possible before we have a decent death,\u201d he says. Would Williamson want voluntary euthanasia for himself, if it came to that? \u201cAbsolutely. I saw a friend die recently of pancreatic cancer, and they fade away to a human skeleton.

The Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said history had been made at the climax of the post-Christmas political negotiations at Stormont.</p> <p>The parliament will elect a speaker and nominate ministers to a devolved administration around Saturday lunchtime.</p> <p>Boris Johnson tweeted on Friday night that the prospect of the assembly and the cross-community executive getting back to work was a \u201cgreat step forward for the people of Northern Ireland\u201d.</p> <p>At the core of the deal was a plan by the British and Irish government to create two new \u201clanguage commissioners\u201d as part of a cultural policy to put Gaelic on the same legal standing as English while protecting Ulster British culture.</p> <p>The strategy pursued by London and Dublin ministers was a classic combination of carrot and stick. As well as the prospect of nearly \u00a32bn in extra cash for Northern Ireland\u2019s NHS, education system, infrastructure and police, the two governments warned that if parties failed to reach an agreement by Monday there would be fresh elections to a new assembly.</p> <p>The two main parties, the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in , suffered significant losses in the UK general election, particularly to the centrist Alliance party, which doubled its vote share on 12 December, and a resurgent nationalist SDLP.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/10/stormont-talks-will-power-sharing-return-northern-ireland\">Stormont talks: will power sharing return to Northern Ireland?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This week marked the third year since the devolved power sharing agreement collapsed. Sinn F\u00e9in withdrew from the regional government over the DUP\u2019s role in a controversial botched green energy scheme that wasted hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p>But other issues became even greater barriers to the restoration of power-sharing. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s key demand to re-enter a coalition with the DUP has been for a standalone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/27/irish-language-act-hampering-northern-ireland-power-sharing-talks\">Irish Language </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/27/irish-language-act-hampering-northern-ireland-power-sharing-talks\">act</a> that would put Gaelic on a par with English.</p> <p>Unionists opposed such a move but, in an effort to address their concerns, the two governments drew up plans for \u201can Ulster British language commissioner dealing with Ulster Scots language and associated culture and heritage\u201d as well as a commissioner to deal with Gaelic.</p> <p>Arlene Foster, the DUP leader and the previous first minister of Northern Ireland before devolved government collapsed in early 2017, described the new deal as \u201cfair and balanced\u201d and said it had addressed unionist fears.</p> <p>Before the DUP\u2019s ruling executive met in Belfast on Friday night, Foster also said: \u201cI think people will note that while there is a recognition of the facilitation of Irish language, there is also very much a recognition of those of us who are Ulster British and live here in Northern Ireland as well, and there are many mechanisms to strengthen the union.\u201d<br> Foster pledged to build a better relationship with their traditional enemies in Sinn F\u00e9in within the new regional government.</p> <p>Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader said: \u201cWe now have the basis to restore power sharing, and we\u2019re up for that.\u201d She confirmed that the party would nominate ministers for the new executive this weekend.</p> <p>McDonald insisted the party was still \u201ccommitted\u201d to Irish unification, although unionists and the new Tory government have made it clear that a border poll or referendum on Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional future is not on the agenda.</p> <p>The main parties came under fire from opponents within their respective communities. The Protestant Orange Order and the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice criticised the DUP for supporting legislation that would give the Irish language special legal status.</p> <p>But Sinn F\u00e9in was also attacked by the dissident republican party Saoradh. Davy Jordan, an ex-republican prisoner and Saoradh chairman, accused Sinn F\u00e9in of being \u201cfalse prophets\u201d who had been \u201cconsumed by the very system they claim to oppose.\u201d</p> <p>Criticism from their bitterest opponents is unlikely to throw either DUP or Sinn F\u00e9in off their course towards power-sharing government in Belfast.</p> <p>On Saturday the DUP will be able to take over three ministries, whileSinn F\u00e9in will run two devolved government departments.

      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly will reopen on Saturday after a three-year suspension following a historic deal that has resurrected power-sharing government in the region. The Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said history had been made at the climax of the post-Christmas political negotiations at Stormont. The parliament will elect a speaker and nominate ministers to a devolved administration around Saturday lunchtime. Boris Johnson tweeted on Friday night that the prospect of the assembly and the cross-community executive getting back to work was a \u201cgreat step forward for the people of Northern Ireland\u201d. At the core of the deal was a plan by the British and Irish government to create two new \u201clanguage commissioners\u201d as part of a cultural policy to put Gaelic on the same legal standing as English while protecting Ulster British culture. The strategy pursued by London and Dublin ministers was a classic combination of carrot and stick. As well as the prospect of nearly \u00a32bn in extra cash for Northern Ireland\u2019s NHS, education system, infrastructure and police, the two governments warned that if parties failed to reach an agreement by Monday there would be fresh elections to a new assembly. The two main parties, the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in , suffered significant losses in the UK general election, particularly to the centrist Alliance party, which doubled its vote share on 12 December, and a resurgent nationalist SDLP. This week marked the third year since the devolved power sharing agreement collapsed. Sinn F\u00e9in withdrew from the regional government over the DUP\u2019s role in a controversial botched green energy scheme that wasted hundreds of millions of pounds. But other issues became even greater barriers to the restoration of power-sharing. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s key demand to re-enter a coalition with the DUP has been for a standalone Irish Language act that would put Gaelic on a par with English. Unionists opposed such a move but, in an effort to address their concerns, the two governments drew up plans for \u201can Ulster British language commissioner dealing with Ulster Scots language and associated culture and heritage\u201d as well as a commissioner to deal with Gaelic. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader and the previous first minister of Northern Ireland before devolved government collapsed in early 2017, described the new deal as \u201cfair and balanced\u201d and said it had addressed unionist fears. Before the DUP\u2019s ruling executive met in Belfast on Friday night, Foster also said: \u201cI think people will note that while there is a recognition of the facilitation of Irish language, there is also very much a recognition of those of us who are Ulster British and live here in Northern Ireland as well, and there are many mechanisms to strengthen the union.\u201d Foster pledged to build a better relationship with their traditional enemies in Sinn F\u00e9in within the new regional government. Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader said: \u201cWe now have the basis to restore power sharing, and we\u2019re up for that.\u201d She confirmed that the party would nominate ministers for the new executive this weekend. McDonald insisted the party was still \u201ccommitted\u201d to Irish unification, although unionists and the new Tory government have made it clear that a border poll or referendum on Northern Ireland\u2019s constitutional future is not on the agenda. The main parties came under fire from opponents within their respective communities. The Protestant Orange Order and the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice criticised the DUP for supporting legislation that would give the Irish language special legal status. But Sinn F\u00e9in was also attacked by the dissident republican party Saoradh. Davy Jordan, an ex-republican prisoner and Saoradh chairman, accused Sinn F\u00e9in of being \u201cfalse prophets\u201d who had been \u201cconsumed by the very system they claim to oppose.\u201d Criticism from their bitterest opponents is unlikely to throw either DUP or Sinn F\u00e9in off their course towards power-sharing government in Belfast. On Saturday the DUP will be able to take over three ministries, whileSinn F\u00e9in will run two devolved government departments. The SDLP also confirmed that it will enter a multi-party, cross-community coalition, as well the centrist Alliance party. Each party will be entitled to nominate one minister each for the power-sharing executive. The Ulster Unionist party has yet to decide whether it will join the administration or become the largest opposition force inside the assembly. The UUP did back the New Decade, New Approach document drawn up by the governments to break the political deadlock. On Friday night the leaders of the four main churches \u2013 Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist \u2013 welcomed the agreement. \u201cToday is a sign of welcome progress that provides an opportunity for a new start for Northern Ireland\u2019s political institutions and one that can also offer fresh hope,\u201d the leading church figures said.",

The answer is always fudged, along the lines of \u201cindividual events cannot be put down to climate change, this is just an extreme of weather, only further research can tell if there is a connection.\u201d This proper and natural scientific caution has been reinforced by decades of attacks by the fossil fuel lobby, plus threats to remove grants and university tenure. The same cautious approach has also infected science journalists who repeat the same formula. But this mantra \u201cIt\u2019s weather not climate\u201d can now be discarded because Swiss scientists have shown that windstorms, floods, droughts and heat waves \u2013 events as short as a single day \u2013 can be placed firmly at the door of global heating. The weather will go on varying wildly from day to day but the Swiss have been able to prove that these swings are made worse by extra temperature and moisture in the atmosphere. In other words every extreme has been made greater by man-made climate change.

The exhibition, at the meticulously restored Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham, which was designed by Turner himself, was opened on Friday by Sir David Attenborough. The broadcaster and naturalist described Turner as \u201cone of the great figures of western painting\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a west Londoner,\u201d Attenborough said. \u201cI was born a few miles from here and I live a few miles from here and have done for getting on 70 years.

Ricky Pound, the director of Turner\u2019s House, said: \u201cA few years ago this house was essentially falling down.

Sandycombe Lodge was built in 1813 to Turner\u2019s designs and was a retreat from the pressures of the London art world. It also provided a home for his father, William, after his retirement as a barber and wigmaker in Covent Garden. Turner loved living so close to the Thames, which he considered a subject with endless possibilities. The restored Sandycombe has a telescope similar to one Turner would have used to look at the river, although the view today is obscured by housing. When his father\u2019s health deteriorated, Turner sold Sandycombe in 1826. Since then it has had multiple extensions, changes and exterior render to make it look like other houses in the street.

Chardi was born in the US, David in the UK, but they were both studying drama at Western Ontario university in Canada when they met in 1967. They were cast as the leads in a production of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Man and Superman, and just as in the play, ended up as a couple.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/04/relationships-tell-us-how-you-stay-together\">Relationships: tell us how you stay together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chardi remembers David making an instant impression. \u201c[I was] sitting there at this audition and I saw these two guys sitting down. And I saw the back of David and said to someone, \u2018That\u2019s the man I\u2019m going to marry.\u2019\u201d He was similarly struck by her. \u201cI was this classic, awkward, socially incompetent English person and [she was] a very outgoing American woman ... So it was a pretty unlikely [match] but I think I thought Chardi was absolutely charismatic from the word go.\u201d</p> <p>Their wedding day, in 1969, was a series of misadventures. Two days before the scheduled date, the registry office asked if they could postpone the wedding because the judge was \u201cmoose hunting in Sault Ste Marie\u201d. With overseas guests already en route, they refused and were told they\u2019d have to marry in a church instead. Reluctantly they agreed, hoping to keep the religious aspects to a minimum. But on the day the minister suggested the visiting archbishop marry them. While the couple cringed, Chardi\u2019s father was thrilled. \u201c[He] said, \u2018I asked God to do it right. But I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d bring an archbishop.\u2019\u201d To top it off, they\u2019d dissuaded the organist from playing wedding music, but just as they exchanged vows, wedding bells rang out in the church. \u201cWe both broke out laughing,\u201d says David. \u201cAnd had a great party that night.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/14/how-we-stay-together-understanding-the-other-person-is-trying-to-do-their-best-is-important\">How we stay together: 'Understanding the other person is trying to do their best is important'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not long after that, the couple moved to the UK so David could get his PhD in Russian history at Oxford University. Struggling financially and knowing only a few people, it wasn\u2019t a happy time. It took a toll on their relationship and they admit they don\u2019t know how they made it through those years. \u201cI think poverty helped, [having] a lack of choices,\u201d says Chardi. \u201cOur relationship was also a friendship \u2013 so that helped.\u201d</p> <p>During that time, they figured out how to live with each other. Both independent souls, they are happiest being in the same house but different rooms. \u201cI enjoy David\u2019s company but he does his thing, I do mine. We may not even talk all day, but there\u2019s a feeling we\u2019re together.\u201d They also learned to appreciate their differences. \u201cOpposites are quite interesting that way because the other person continues to be quite a surprise.

      "bodyText": "Names: David and Chardi Christian Years together: 51 Occupations: academic and author \u201cThe first 45 years were the toughest,\u201d says Chardi Christian with a laugh. \u201cAfter that, there\u2019s a point where it\u2019s easier.\u201d Late last year the author and artist and her husband, Prof David Christian, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Now based in Sydney, the couple has lived all over the world but celebrated with \u201can ordinary day\u201d at their favourite holiday cabin not far from Jamberoo \u2013 just the two of them. \u201cAnd it was just perfect\u201d, says Chardi. It\u2019s a world away from where they met. Chardi was born in the US, David in the UK, but they were both studying drama at Western Ontario university in Canada when they met in 1967. They were cast as the leads in a production of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Man and Superman, and just as in the play, ended up as a couple. Chardi remembers David making an instant impression. \u201c[I was] sitting there at this audition and I saw these two guys sitting down. And I saw the back of David and said to someone, \u2018That\u2019s the man I\u2019m going to marry.\u2019\u201d He was similarly struck by her. \u201cI was this classic, awkward, socially incompetent English person and [she was] a very outgoing American woman ... So it was a pretty unlikely [match] but I think I thought Chardi was absolutely charismatic from the word go.\u201d Their wedding day, in 1969, was a series of misadventures. Two days before the scheduled date, the registry office asked if they could postpone the wedding because the judge was \u201cmoose hunting in Sault Ste Marie\u201d. With overseas guests already en route, they refused and were told they\u2019d have to marry in a church instead. Reluctantly they agreed, hoping to keep the religious aspects to a minimum. But on the day the minister suggested the visiting archbishop marry them. While the couple cringed, Chardi\u2019s father was thrilled. \u201c[He] said, \u2018I asked God to do it right. But I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d bring an archbishop.\u2019\u201d To top it off, they\u2019d dissuaded the organist from playing wedding music, but just as they exchanged vows, wedding bells rang out in the church. \u201cWe both broke out laughing,\u201d says David. \u201cAnd had a great party that night.\u201d Not long after that, the couple moved to the UK so David could get his PhD in Russian history at Oxford University. Struggling financially and knowing only a few people, it wasn\u2019t a happy time. It took a toll on their relationship and they admit they don\u2019t know how they made it through those years. \u201cI think poverty helped, [having] a lack of choices,\u201d says Chardi. \u201cOur relationship was also a friendship \u2013 so that helped.\u201d During that time, they figured out how to live with each other. Both independent souls, they are happiest being in the same house but different rooms. \u201cI enjoy David\u2019s company but he does his thing, I do mine. We may not even talk all day, but there\u2019s a feeling we\u2019re together.\u201d They also learned to appreciate their differences. \u201cOpposites are quite interesting that way because the other person continues to be quite a surprise. David still is fascinating to me.\u201d During their time at Oxford, the pair had the first of their two children. \u201cHaving children was tough but absolutely transformative, I think in all sorts of very good ways,\u201d says David. \u201c[Here were] these two little completely helpless creatures and suddenly, you had to stop thinking about yourself so much.\u201d When David was offered a position at Macquarie University, the family moved to Sydney. Initially they planned to stay for a few years but quickly became attached to the city. The move meant that Chardi could return to studying while the children attended kindergarten at the university. It was a chaotic time, but it was worth the juggle for Chardi. \u201cI did find my children fulfilling \u2026 but I couldn\u2019t have done it without also doing study. And then I started a theatre and education company, and then I did storytelling in schools. So I was constantly developing my own interests and I think that helped the relationship because I wasn\u2019t the nag. I\u2019m not saying all mothers in their homes are nagging, but I wasn\u2019t someone feeling I had lost out on something.\u201d However there were times when the couple came close to splitting. They credit marriage counselling for helping them stick together. David remembers the counsellor telling them: \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to glue you back together, but ... I can help you clear away the habits or things that are poisoning the relationship unnecessarily.\u201d They both wanted it to work. Chardi remembers seeing many of their friends going through the same thing \u2013 and failing. \u201cOne of them was willing to work on the relationship and one wasn\u2019t. One was convinced it was all the other\u2019s fault. And they had principles. And that\u2019s just the way it was,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat was wonderful about David was that when we came to a real crisis in our marriage, he was willing to work. He was willing to go to counselling, he was willing to be open to the possibility that maybe a bit of the problem could have been him, it wasn\u2019t all me, it was mutual.\u201d Chardi realised that in order to survive, marriages have to change. \u201cSometimes marriages in the way they were when you were young \u2026 have to really die for another way of being together, where you really do celebrate each other\u2019s independence.\u201d And there\u2019s no point in trying to change the other person. \u201cYou have to find a way to love that thing you want to change most.

In towns from the Blue Mountains to the outskirts of Melbourne, communities were facing catastrophe. But there was something about the images from Mallacoota, the crowds of people and animals huddled on the sand in the eerie red light that somehow brought not just the scale but the uncanniness of the crisis home. \u201cWhen Brueghel meets the Anthropocene,\u201d a friend of mine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MireilleJuchau/status/1212657401679114240?s=20\">tweeted about similar scenes in Malua Bay.</a> More like Bosch, others replied.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MireilleJuchau/status/1212657401679114240\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When Brueghel meets the anthropocene.

Taken by Mallacoota resident Allison Marion, it showed her 11-year-old son, Finn, seated in the stern of a dinghy, one hand on the tiller of an outboard engine, his eyes above the mask that obscures his face wary and exhausted. Behind him the sky is deep orange, the sea barely visible through the murk. A decade-and-a-half ago the writer Robert Macfarlane <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview29\">wondered why the climate crisis lacked an iconography</a>. It has one now.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s difficult not to suspect New Year\u2019s Eve was also the moment many Australians realised we were in uncharted territory, that the future so many of us had feared for so long had finally washed over us, and we were completely unprepared.</p> \n<p>The catastrophe that is still playing out on the eastern seaboard, South Australia and Tasmania has been a long time coming yet still the sheer scale of it is difficult to comprehend. At the time of writing 27 people have been killed, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2019/dec/07/how-big-are-the-fires-burning-on-the-east-coast-of-australia-interactive-map\">an estimated 8.4 million hectares have burned</a> or are currently burning, an area larger than the whole of Ireland or Austria.

The National Farmers\u2019 Federation estimates in excess of 100,000 sheep and cattle have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more will have to be euthanised in coming days. The Australian defence force has been mobilised to deal with their carcasses \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-06/dead-animals-bushfire-biosecurity-emergency/11843428\">\u201cto dig the pits\u201d, as the federal agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, put it</a> earlier this week.</p> \n<p>But the human and economic cost of the fires is dwarfed by their ecological impact. <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/03/a-statement-about-the-480-million-animals-killed-in-nsw-bushfire.html\">Scientists estimate close to half a billion mammals, birds and reptiles have been killed in NSW alone</a>, driving threatened animals and birds closer to extinction. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/04/ecologists-warn-silent-death-australia-bushfires-endangered-species-extinction\">Speaking to Guardian Australia</a> on 4 January, Prof Sarah Legge, a conservation ecologist at the Australian National University, said: \u201cEven some species that are not snuffed out completely will struggle in the coming months.

Endangered plant species confined to small areas are likely to have been wiped out; likewise the sheer intensity of the fires will have destroyed not just the complex and highly diverse communities of organisms that populate the forest floor, but also the old-growth trees that shelter species such as gliding possums and provide nesting sites for many birds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/04/ecologists-warn-silent-death-australia-bushfires-endangered-species-extinction\">As biologist Prof John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University put it</a>: \u201cThere are no winners \u2026 These fires are homogenising the landscape.

But it gets worse. Because in order to have any chance of holding warming to 1.5C, net global emissions need to reach zero by 2050, with close to half that reduction taking place over the next 10 years. This isn\u2019t going to be achieved by installing solar panels or making meat-free Monday part of our lives. It demands the transformation of every aspect of our economies and societies in the space of a few years. In a world where emissions are still rising year on year, where rightwing populism is on the march and the international order looks shakier by the day, the odds of this happening look vanishingly unlikely.</p> \n<p>The brutal truth, in other words, is that things are going to get worse whatever we do. A lot worse. And probably quickly.</p> \n<p>None of this is a secret, yet individually and collectively we have grown skilled at not thinking about it. After all, how could we? Acknowledging the truth would demand we recognise not just the scale of the problem and its intractability, but also our part in it. The writer Amitav Ghosh has described this elision of reality as \u201cthe great derangement\u201d.

In any other field, people who knowingly ignored expert scientific advice would be held liable for the death and destruction that flowed from their actions. Yet our prime minister, the leader of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/15/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-your-government-sells-out-the-climate-for-votes\">a party that has done more to prevent action on climate change in this country than any other</a>, a party that systematically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/former-australian-fire-chiefs-say-coalition-doesnt-like-talking-about-climate-change\">ignored warnings from fire chiefs and scientific agencies in the lead-up to the disaster </a>and was, even as the country burned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/16/un-climate-talks-australia-accused-of-cheating-and-thwarting-global-deal\">working to reduce emission reduction targets at the Madrid climate summit</a>, refuses to countenance changes to his government\u2019s climate policies.</p> \n<h2>How do we live when reality sinks in?</h2> \n<p>But the real question is what do we do when the anger subsides?

As if to underline the historic failure of the federal government, it was ordinary people who stepped into the breach in the aftermath of the fires, offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/04/beautiful-gestures-the-good-news-stories-coming-out-of-australias-bushfires\">money, food, places to stay</a>.

The philosopher Donna Haraway speaks of the imperative of \u201cstaying with the trouble\u201d, of not shying away from reality but instead inhabiting the present in all its complexity, terror, hope and joy and recognising our kinship with those around us. Perhaps it is time we all learned to do that, time we learned to recognise our own hopes and fears in other people.</p> \n<p>Because that is what many of us glimpsed in the faces of the people on the beach in Mallacoota on New Year\u2019s Eve. We saw ourselves, our shared future, the terror and pain of what is coming.

      "bodyText": "When we come to write the history of climate politics in Australia, it\u2019s possible New Year\u2019s Eve 2019 will be seen as the moment everything changed. That was the day the nation \u2013 and indeed the world \u2013 watched in horror and despair as the people of Mallacoota fled to the beach to escape the wall of flame bearing down on their town. They weren\u2019t the only ones fleeing the fire that day. In towns from the Blue Mountains to the outskirts of Melbourne, communities were facing catastrophe. But there was something about the images from Mallacoota, the crowds of people and animals huddled on the sand in the eerie red light that somehow brought not just the scale but the uncanniness of the crisis home. \u201cWhen Brueghel meets the Anthropocene,\u201d a friend of mine tweeted about similar scenes in Malua Bay. More like Bosch, others replied. It\u2019s possible the reasons these images seem so resonant is the fact they are on a beach, a place that occupies a curious duality in Australian culture, serving as both the most potent symbol of our national myth of egalitarianism and a theatre for our deepest anxieties about both our nation\u2019s origins and the possibility of invasion, whether by aggressors or by refugees. As if to underline that ambivalence, another image appeared not long afterwards. Taken by Mallacoota resident Allison Marion, it showed her 11-year-old son, Finn, seated in the stern of a dinghy, one hand on the tiller of an outboard engine, his eyes above the mask that obscures his face wary and exhausted. Behind him the sky is deep orange, the sea barely visible through the murk. A decade-and-a-half ago the writer Robert Macfarlane wondered why the climate crisis lacked an iconography. It has one now. But it\u2019s difficult not to suspect New Year\u2019s Eve was also the moment many Australians realised we were in uncharted territory, that the future so many of us had feared for so long had finally washed over us, and we were completely unprepared. The catastrophe that is still playing out on the eastern seaboard, South Australia and Tasmania has been a long time coming yet still the sheer scale of it is difficult to comprehend. At the time of writing 27 people have been killed, and an estimated 8.4 million hectares have burned or are currently burning, an area larger than the whole of Ireland or Austria. More than 1,800 homes have been destroyed, along with many agricultural sheds and structures, and with them, lives and livelihoods. Thousands of people have been evacuated, and many more stranded for days or even longer with limited food, fuel or electricity. The impact on livestock has also been horrifying. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation estimates in excess of 100,000 sheep and cattle have been killed, and hundreds of thousands more will have to be euthanised in coming days. The Australian defence force has been mobilised to deal with their carcasses \u2013 \u201cto dig the pits\u201d, as the federal agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, put it earlier this week. But the human and economic cost of the fires is dwarfed by their ecological impact. Scientists estimate close to half a billion mammals, birds and reptiles have been killed in NSW alone, driving threatened animals and birds closer to extinction. Speaking to Guardian Australia on 4 January, Prof Sarah Legge, a conservation ecologist at the Australian National University, said: \u201cEven some species that are not snuffed out completely will struggle in the coming months. I think this is the end for a number of species.\u201d In many cases burned areas will never recover. Endangered plant species confined to small areas are likely to have been wiped out; likewise the sheer intensity of the fires will have destroyed not just the complex and highly diverse communities of organisms that populate the forest floor, but also the old-growth trees that shelter species such as gliding possums and provide nesting sites for many birds. As biologist Prof John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University put it: \u201cThere are no winners \u2026 These fires are homogenising the landscape. They benefit no species.\u201d Rolling disasters Away from the fires the impact has also been considerable. In Sydney, the city has been shrouded in smoke since early November, the stink of burning constantly in the air. Breathing masks have become a common sight on the streets. My younger daughter\u2019s school began keeping the children in at lunchtime. On one of the worst days a friend of mine who is an anaesthetist at one of Sydney\u2019s major hospitals texted me to say they had been forced to cancel his surgeries because the air conditioners were pulling too much smoke into the operating room. In the city, fire crews were run ragged responding to fire alarms set off by the smoke, sending office workers spilling on to the streets. In Canberra, where the smoke has intensified in recent weeks, things are even worse: flights have been cancelled due to poor visibility, government departments have told workers to remain at home, and the National Gallery was forced to close due to fears about the smoke\u2019s effect on its collections. Amid the rolling emergency of the fires it\u2019s easy to forget they are only the latest in a long line of disasters. Last summer fires tore through rainforest in north Queensland and devastated forests in Tasmania, while on the Barwon-Darling millions of fish and other riverine species died as a result of drought and long-term mismanagement of river systems \u2013 catastrophes that were followed by catastrophic floods in northern Queensland that killed four people and drowned up to half a million cattle. Overseas the story is the same. In the middle of last year, fires spread through the Arctic, igniting not just grassland but boreal peatlands dried out by unusually high temperatures in the region. In Brazil fires destroyed nearly 10,000 sq km of rainforest, prompting warnings from scientists that the Amazon is now close to a tipping point, beyond which its collapse will be unstoppable. In March Cyclone Idai left more than 1,300 people dead in Madagascar, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Indeed one report by British charity Christian Aid suggests the changing climate amplified the effects of no less than 15 major disasters in 2019, while in July last year the UN warned climate change is now causing an average of one disaster a week. There has been a lot of talk about adapting to the new normal in recent weeks. But this is not the new normal. This is just the beginning. The rolling disasters we are now experiencing are the result of 1C of warming above pre-industrial averages. Even if the commitments enshrined in the Paris agreement are met \u2013 something that looks extremely unlikely \u2013 we are on track for well over 2C of warming by the end of the century, while on current trends we are headed for 3C or 4C. A world that is 3C or 4C hotter will be almost unrecognisable. Large areas in equatorial and subequatorial regions will be effectively uninhabitable. Sea levels will rise by many metres. Ecosystems around the world will collapse, causing mass extinctions on land and in the oceans. Hundreds of millions of people will die, while hundreds of millions more will be displaced. Even at 2C our world will be irrevocably altered. According to the IPCC\u2019s special report, Global Warming of 1.5C, released in October 2018, 2C of warming will lead to significant increases in both the incidence and severity of heatwaves and extreme weather events, dramatically affect food production, especially in south-east Asia, south and central America and sub-Saharan Africa, leading to a \u201crapid evacuation\u201d of people from tropical countries. Tropical diseases will spread into formerly temperate areas. Sea levels will rise by up to a metre by 2100, and continue rising for centuries afterwards. The impacts on the natural world will be similarly devastating: extinction rates will soar, ocean acidification and warming waters will devastate marine life and coral reefs will disappear almost entirely within a decade or two. In fact, the IPCC\u2019s advice is that to have any hope of avoiding dangerous climate change, we must hold warming to only 1.5C above pre-industrial averages. At 1.5C, the world will be a much harder, less hospitable place than the one we once knew. Heatwaves, droughts and disasters like those of recent weeks will be more commonplace. Shortages of food and water will affect only half as many people as they will at 2C, and the number of people displaced might be held to only 50 million. Natural systems and biodiversity will be irreparably damaged, but we might save 10% of coral reefs, and sea level rise might be held to only half a metre by 2100. This is not an accident As best-case scenarios go, this is pretty bleak. But it gets worse. Because in order to have any chance of holding warming to 1.5C, net global emissions need to reach zero by 2050, with close to half that reduction taking place over the next 10 years. This isn\u2019t going to be achieved by installing solar panels or making meat-free Monday part of our lives.

In a world where emissions are still rising year on year, where rightwing populism is on the march and the international order looks shakier by the day, the odds of this happening look vanishingly unlikely. The brutal truth, in other words, is that things are going to get worse whatever we do. A lot worse. And probably quickly. None of this is a secret, yet individually and collectively we have grown skilled at not thinking about it. After all, how could we? Acknowledging the truth would demand we recognise not just the scale of the problem and its intractability, but also our part in it. The writer Amitav Ghosh has described this elision of reality as \u201cthe great derangement\u201d. Yet with each new freak weather event or shattered record or unprecedented disaster, it has become harder to keep pretending things are OK, harder to keep the sense of rising panic at bay. As the old joke goes, denial is a mighty river. Yet even it has its limits. Fifty years ago the American psychiatrist Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross identified what she believed to be the five stages of grieving. First comes denial, then anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance. These stages are not necessarily clear-cut \u2013 witness the growing anger of the millions of people who joined climate marches around the world in recent months \u2013 but I suspect that for many people New Year\u2019s Day was the point where denial finally stopped being an option, and their grief and terror finally coalesced into fury. We should be angry, of course. Incandescently angry. Because where we are is not an accident. It is the result of decades of inaction by our political leaders, of campaigns of lies and disinformation by fossil fuel companies and their enablers in politics and the media, of pandering to special interests and privileging greed over the futures of our children. In any other field, people who knowingly ignored expert scientific advice would be held liable for the death and destruction that flowed from their actions. Yet our prime minister, the leader of a party that has done more to prevent action on climate change in this country than any other, a party that systematically ignored warnings from fire chiefs and scientific agencies in the lead-up to the disaster and was, even as the country burned, working to reduce emission reduction targets at the Madrid climate summit, refuses to countenance changes to his government\u2019s climate policies. How do we live when reality sinks in? But the real question is what do we do when the anger subsides? How do we live once our disbelief at the scale of the disaster fades and we are left to grapple with the knowledge the world we knew has gone? Climate scientist Jo\u00eblle Gergis has written about her increasing tendency to burst into tears, as \u201cthe reality of what the science is saying manages to thaw the emotionally frozen part of myself I need to maintain to do my job. In those moments, what surfaces is pure grief\u201d. K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019 model grew out of her experiences with the terminally ill, but our predicament is not entirely dissimilar. There is no magic bullet or miracle cure that will save us. We cannot make this better. Instead we face a future in which the only certainty is uncertainty and loss, a future in which the choices we have made will shape the lives of generations to come for centuries, and mostly for the worst. Faced with this reality we can sink into depression and despair. Or we can go further, admit the old world has gone, and begin to fight to make things better. This will not be easy. As the intransigence of Scott Morrison and his government and the organised campaigns of disinformation about the causes of the fires already circulating on social media demonstrate, the forces opposing change are powerful, and will fight to the end. But there are other forces at work as well. As if to underline the historic failure of the federal government, it was ordinary people who stepped into the breach in the aftermath of the fires, offering money, food, places to stay. I can\u2019t have been the only one moved to tears by the sight of truckies and tradies gathering in Bairnsdale to help residents and holidaymakers stranded in the Gippsland, or the images of members of the Muslim community in New South Wales and Victoria who travelled hundreds of kilometres to cook food for exhausted firefighters and shattered communities. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight fires but we can put a barbecue on,\u201d one of the men told the ABC. Their actions are a reminder that if we are to find a way forward we will need kindness as well as anger, empathy as well as rage, humility as well as righteousness. Yet we also need to recognise that just as acceptance frees the terminally ill, it can liberate us to imagine a way forward. The philosopher Donna Haraway speaks of the imperative of \u201cstaying with the trouble\u201d, of not shying away from reality but instead inhabiting the present in all its complexity, terror, hope and joy and recognising our kinship with those around us. Perhaps it is time we all learned to do that, time we learned to recognise our own hopes and fears in other people. Because that is what many of us glimpsed in the faces of the people on the beach in Mallacoota on New Year\u2019s Eve. We saw ourselves, our shared future, the terror and pain of what is coming. And we could no longer look away. \u2022 This story was amended on 13 January 2020 to correct a statement that the National Library in Canberra closed due to air pollution. It has remained open throughout the bushfire crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Samira Ahmed\u2019s employment tribunal victory is the latest blow to the BBC in a gender pay gap row that has engulfed the corporation since it was forced to reveal the salary details of its top earners in 2017. Published at the behest of the government under the BBC\u2019s new royal charter, the list showed that only a third of its 96 top earners were women and the top seven were all men. The then prime minister, Theresa May, joined criticism of the corporation for \u201cpaying women less for doing the same job as the men\u201d, and some of the BBC\u2019s most high-profile female personalities wrote an open letter to the director general, Tony Hall, urging immediate action. Lawyers presciently warned that female stars could lodge claims of sex discrimination. Hall, while insisting the BBC was doing better than others, said he was committed to closing the gap by 2020. He commissioned a review of pay, published later that year, which showed the gender pay gap at the corporation was 9.3%. The review concluded that nearly 500 employees may have been getting paid less than colleagues in a similar role because of their gender but that there was \u201cno systemic discrimination against women\u201d. However, it did not include the vast majority of on-air presenters, editors and senior managers, meaning the validity of the report was called into question. In January 2018, the BBC faced further embarrassment when one of its most senior journalists, the China editor, Carrie Gracie, resigned over the gender pay gap, accusing the corporation of a \u201csecretive and illegal\u201d pay culture, which flouted equality laws. Already on the back foot, the BBC\u2019s efforts to address the increasing anger \u2013 many female journalists declared their support for Gracie \u2013 were made more difficult when John Humphrys, in a leaked off-air conversation, appeared to make light of her decision to leave her post. His exchange with the BBC\u2019s North America editor, Jon Sopel, which Humphrys later characterised as \u201cjocular\u201d, included the comment: \u201cOh dear God. She\u2019s actually suggested that you should lose money \u2013 you know that, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ve read the thing properly have you?\u201d The BBC has since made some progress on its gender pay gap, as a result of many leading male news and current affairs presenters being shamed into taking pay cuts, but it is still being investigated by the equality watchdog over claims men were consistently paid more than women for doing the same job. Even before the decision in Ahmed\u2019s case, the hearing was embarrassing for the corporation as its dirty linen was aired in public, including an allegation \u2013 denied by the BBC \u2013 that a senior executive told her it \u201cdoesn\u2019t do equal pay\u201d.

His killing provoked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/iran-mourns-suleimani-and-vows-dark-day-of-vengeance-against-us\">national mourning</a> in Iran, defiance from the regime and threats of fiery revenge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b926d384-5bf5-4618-af54-9966bf75a57c\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Qassem Suleimani, killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad, had become well known among Iranians and was sometimes discussed as a future president. Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Retaliation arrived in the shape of Iranian missiles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/suleimani-assassination-two-us-airbases-in-iraq-hit-by-missiles-in-retaliation\">launched against US military bases</a> in Iraq. Rockets crashed into a joint US-Iraqi facility in Erbil, in Kurdish northern Iraq, and at a US airbase in Anbar province. By design or accident, no one was hurt.</p> \n<p>In the immediate aftermath of these strikes Iran\u2019s armed garrisons must have been in a state of jittery high alert, wondering what the volatile Donald Trump might do next. Another US attack against domestic Iranian targets? A pause? Something else?</p> \n<p>It was against this war-like backdrop that the plane took off at 6.12am. It climbed rapidly, reaching almost 8,000ft (2,400 metres). Its destination was Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv. From there most passengers were heading off elsewhere. More than a third were Iranian Canadians, going to Toronto or Edmonton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/tehran_map-zip/giv-39022ZnjyFaRYCjK/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/tehran_map-zip/giv-39022ZnjyFaRYCjK/\">Map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Four <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/tributes-paid-to-three-britons-killed-in-ukraine-boeing-737-crash\">British nationals</a> were connecting to London. They included Mohammad Reza Kadkhoda-Zadeh, who ran a dry cleaning business in Hassocks, West Sussex; Sam Zokaei, a BP employee and Saeed Tahmabessi, an engineer.</p> \n<p>The plane would have appeared on the radar screen of Iran\u2019s Mehrabad air traffic control centre, which cleared the crew to ascend to 26,000ft. Staff should have identified the Boeing 737-800 plane as a regular civilian jet.</p> \n<p>Also tracking the skies over Tehran were American satellites. If further missiles were hurled at US targets in Iraq the US\u2019s Space-Based Infrared System would immediately detect them.</p> \n<p>At 6.15am the system picked up something ominous: the unmistakable heat signature of missiles freshly launched.</p> \n<p>An Iranian garrison on the ground, due west of the airport, appears to have mistaken the plane for a hostile American object. According to US officials, an Iranian anti-aircraft battery unleashed two Russian-made missiles. The US satellites recorded an infrared blip: an explosion.</p> \n<p>The results were immediate and catastrophic.</p> \n<p>Mobile phone footage captures the moment of impact: a white flash, flaring across the inky heavens. Twenty four seconds later the sound arrives \u2013 a boom and martial roar. Down on earth a dog barks. Further footage shot from a different standpoint shows the stricken plane hitting the ground, a burst of orange.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"218341da-72c3-44c4-9773-739907599b0e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M7r4VMTM2GE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The missiles would have exploded adjacent to the plane, sending a deadly hail of shrapnel into the fuselage. The pilots made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/iran-plane-crash-report-ukraine-boeing-flames-turn-back-radio-call\">a doomed attempt to turn back</a>, judging from the position of wreckage strewn across Tehran\u2019s outskirts. Take-off to crash landing was five minutes. The journey\u2019s last moments must have been ones of terror.</p> \n<p>As dawn broke, rescuers found an awful scene. Bodies, personal belongings, parts of the wing, oxygen masks were scattered over farmland. The dead were put into plastic sacks. As Washington, Ottawa, Kyiv and London demanded answers, and relatives began to grieve, the Iranian authorities said the incident was a tragic case of mechanical mishap.</p> \n<p>There were early hints, however, that this version of events might not be quite true. Ukrainian investigators and western journalists reported seeing men in uniform remove fragments of the plane. A bulldozer began to clear the site. Iran said it would not hand over the black box to foreign experts. This was damaged but intact.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, photographs circulated on social media showing what looked like a missile head \u2013 with cone and fins \u2013 lying in a nearby drainage ditch. A compelling clue or fake news? Initially, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the plane had crashed as a result of an accident. Within hours, his government deleted this statement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/iran_flightpath-zip/giv-3902o07DOhdsHd8y/\" data-alt=\"Map 2\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/iran_flightpath-zip/giv-3902o07DOhdsHd8y/\">Map 2</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Behind the scenes, western governments were carefully picking over the satellite record. It confirmed that the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Parandak garrison had used a short-range Tor-M1 missile system to bring down the plane. Seemingly, its nervous operators had confused it with a US military jet. Or a reconnaissance drone.</p> \n<p>In 2005 Tehran bought 29 Tor-M1s from Moscow. They consist of a missile launcher and radar in a single tracked vehicle. The weapon system is highly effective against short-range targets, with a range of 7.5 miles (12km), up to an altitude of 20,000ft.</p> \n<p>For Ukraine, these details were a grim echo of six years ago. In summer 2014, as part of a covert invasion, the Russian military smuggled a Buk missile launcher into rebel-held eastern Ukraine. Its Russian crew <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/24/mh17-downed-by-russian-military-missile-system-say-investigators\">accidentally shot down</a> an overflying civilian plane, Malaysian airlines flight MH17, killing all 298 people onboard.</p> \n<p>Dutch and international investigators subsequently confirmed Russia\u2019s role. Moscow rejected this. Ever since it has offered implausible counter-versions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5baf2945f74aad7e8fb116123ea8de7591f6012c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5baf2945f74aad7e8fb116123ea8de7591f6012c/0_136_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The tributes inside Boryspil international airport, Ukraine, for the flight crew of the crashed plane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tributes inside Boryspil international airport, Ukraine, for the flight crew of the crashed plane.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was clear that Tehran was going down the same road of denial. The head of Iran\u2019s civil aviation organisation said it was \u201cscientifically impossible\u201d that a missile could have hit the Ukrainian plane. Such rumours were \u201cillogical\u201d, Ali Abedzadeh told state-run media. In London, Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, accused the west and the UK of \u201cpoliticising\u201d the inquiry.</p> \n<p>Such assertions failed to convince.</p> \n<p>Western security officials began briefing on Thursday afternoon they suspected the plane had been accidentally shot down by an Iranian missile. Then Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/iran-plane-crash-canada-victims-trudeau-investigation\">made a sombre statement</a> saying his country wanted transparency and an honest reckoning. \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence,that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles,\u201d Trudeau said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/10/canadians-demand-justice-iran-plane-crash\">Canadians demand justice as they mourn victims of Iran plane crash</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By Friday the international consensus was clear. Iran had shot down flight 752 and now seemed determined to cover up much of the evidence. Boris Johnson said \u201ca body of information\u201d confirmed Trudeau\u2019s analysis.

What is clear is that Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate Suleimani had terrible unintended consequences.</p> \n<p>It set off a tragic chain of events, culminating in a disaster in which the victims were innocent civilians. In a region as bloody and unpredictable as the Middle East, further such episodes will surely follow.</p>",

A mother and a daughter \u2013 Sahar Hagjjoo and her eight-year-old child Elsa \u2013 posed for a photograph together after taking their seats. A sweet one, with the pair relaxed, smiling, a little tired from the early start. Everyone on the plane would have known of the strained diplomatic circumstances swirling before them. Three days earlier the Trump administration had assassinated the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a devastating drone strike, soon after he landed in Baghdad. His killing provoked national mourning in Iran, defiance from the regime and threats of fiery revenge. Retaliation arrived in the shape of Iranian missiles launched against US military bases in Iraq. Rockets crashed into a joint US-Iraqi facility in Erbil, in Kurdish northern Iraq, and at a US airbase in Anbar province. By design or accident, no one was hurt. In the immediate aftermath of these strikes Iran\u2019s armed garrisons must have been in a state of jittery high alert, wondering what the volatile Donald Trump might do next. Another US attack against domestic Iranian targets? A pause? Something else? It was against this war-like backdrop that the plane took off at 6.12am. It climbed rapidly, reaching almost 8,000ft (2,400 metres). Its destination was Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv. From there most passengers were heading off elsewhere. More than a third were Iranian Canadians, going to Toronto or Edmonton. Four British nationals were connecting to London. They included Mohammad Reza Kadkhoda-Zadeh, who ran a dry cleaning business in Hassocks, West Sussex; Sam Zokaei, a BP employee and Saeed Tahmabessi, an engineer. The plane would have appeared on the radar screen of Iran\u2019s Mehrabad air traffic control centre, which cleared the crew to ascend to 26,000ft. Staff should have identified the Boeing 737-800 plane as a regular civilian jet. Also tracking the skies over Tehran were American satellites. If further missiles were hurled at US targets in Iraq the US\u2019s Space-Based Infrared System would immediately detect them. At 6.15am the system picked up something ominous: the unmistakable heat signature of missiles freshly launched. An Iranian garrison on the ground, due west of the airport, appears to have mistaken the plane for a hostile American object. According to US officials, an Iranian anti-aircraft battery unleashed two Russian-made missiles. The US satellites recorded an infrared blip: an explosion. The results were immediate and catastrophic. Mobile phone footage captures the moment of impact: a white flash, flaring across the inky heavens. Twenty four seconds later the sound arrives \u2013 a boom and martial roar. Down on earth a dog barks. Further footage shot from a different standpoint shows the stricken plane hitting the ground, a burst of orange. The missiles would have exploded adjacent to the plane, sending a deadly hail of shrapnel into the fuselage. The pilots made a doomed attempt to turn back, judging from the position of wreckage strewn across Tehran\u2019s outskirts. Take-off to crash landing was five minutes. The journey\u2019s last moments must have been ones of terror. As dawn broke, rescuers found an awful scene. Bodies, personal belongings, parts of the wing, oxygen masks were scattered over farmland. The dead were put into plastic sacks. As Washington, Ottawa, Kyiv and London demanded answers, and relatives began to grieve, the Iranian authorities said the incident was a tragic case of mechanical mishap. There were early hints, however, that this version of events might not be quite true. Ukrainian investigators and western journalists reported seeing men in uniform remove fragments of the plane. A bulldozer began to clear the site. Iran said it would not hand over the black box to foreign experts. This was damaged but intact. Meanwhile, photographs circulated on social media showing what looked like a missile head \u2013 with cone and fins \u2013 lying in a nearby drainage ditch. A compelling clue or fake news? Initially, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the plane had crashed as a result of an accident. Within hours, his government deleted this statement. Behind the scenes, western governments were carefully picking over the satellite record. It confirmed that the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Parandak garrison had used a short-range Tor-M1 missile system to bring down the plane. Seemingly, its nervous operators had confused it with a US military jet. Or a reconnaissance drone. In 2005 Tehran bought 29 Tor-M1s from Moscow. They consist of a missile launcher and radar in a single tracked vehicle. The weapon system is highly effective against short-range targets, with a range of 7.5 miles (12km), up to an altitude of 20,000ft. For Ukraine, these details were a grim echo of six years ago. In summer 2014, as part of a covert invasion, the Russian military smuggled a Buk missile launcher into rebel-held eastern Ukraine. Its Russian crew accidentally shot down an overflying civilian plane, Malaysian airlines flight MH17, killing all 298 people onboard. Dutch and international investigators subsequently confirmed Russia\u2019s role. Moscow rejected this. Ever since it has offered implausible counter-versions. It was clear that Tehran was going down the same road of denial. The head of Iran\u2019s civil aviation organisation said it was \u201cscientifically impossible\u201d that a missile could have hit the Ukrainian plane. Such rumours were \u201cillogical\u201d, Ali Abedzadeh told state-run media. In London, Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, accused the west and the UK of \u201cpoliticising\u201d the inquiry. Such assertions failed to convince. Western security officials began briefing on Thursday afternoon they suspected the plane had been accidentally shot down by an Iranian missile. Then Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made a sombre statement saying his country wanted transparency and an honest reckoning. \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence,that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles,\u201d Trudeau said. By Friday the international consensus was clear. Iran had shot down flight 752 and now seemed determined to cover up much of the evidence. Boris Johnson said \u201ca body of information\u201d confirmed Trudeau\u2019s analysis. Zelenskiy spoke with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and confirmed US officials had passed on \u201cimportant data\u201d. The US president who had ramped up conflict with Iran \u2013 seemingly stepping back this week from full-scale war \u2013 said he had \u201csuspicions\u201d about the crash. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragic thing \u2026 somebody could have made a mistake on the other side,\u201d Trump said. The question of who bore ultimate responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s disaster was murky. Months of accusation and counter-accusation are now likely. What is clear is that Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate Suleimani had terrible unintended consequences. It set off a tragic chain of events, culminating in a disaster in which the victims were innocent civilians. In a region as bloody and unpredictable as the Middle East, further such episodes will surely follow.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI was born with a mind that is compromised by preternatural unhappiness,\u201d wrote Elizabeth Wurtzel in 2013, \u201cand I might have died very young or done very little. Instead, I made a career out of my emotions.\u201d It was a career that saw the author, who has died of breast cancer at the age of 52, catapulted to prominence in 1994 with her memoir Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America.</p> <p>Wurtzel\u2019s first book took readers to the heart of its author\u2019s seismic depression and its fallout of binges and broken relationships; it also documented the early days of an antidepressant revolution, in which sufferers glimpsed the possible benefits of pharmaceutical intervention. But Wurtzel\u2019s writing was never designed or able to be drily analytical \u2013 her default mode was one of what has come to be called, not entirely negatively, oversharing. As a memoirist never frightened to portray herself in an unattractive light, she was at the forefront of a new generation of life-writers whose willingness to reveal themselves delighted publishers who saw their work racing to the top of the bestseller lists. </p> <p>Her subsequent books Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women (1998) and More, Now, Again (2001) in part dealt with the complex interaction between that early success and the way in which society treats women deemed to be problematic and hard to categorise. Her freewheeling and often hyperbolic prose style was cited as evidence of narcissism at the same time as critics and readers pored over her excesses, failures and frailties.</p> <p>\u201cBy turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware, Prozac Nation possesses the raw candour of Joan Didion\u2019s essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath\u2019s Bell Jar and the wry, dark humour of a Bob Dylan song,\u201d pronounced Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times, and Plath \u2013 whom Wurtzel included in her lineup of difficult women in Bitch \u2013 was a recurrent comparison. In an interview she gave for that book, the author took a more pragmatic line on the emotional efficacy of her debut, saying: \u201cI was very upset that Prozac Nation didn\u2019t change my life.\u201d</p> <p>Wurtzel\u2019s life began in New York City. Her parents, Lynne Winters, a media consultant, and Donald Wurtzel, an IBM middle manager, divorced when she was two, and her relationship with her father was intermittent, culminating in his disappearance \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/12/elizabeth-wurtzel-on-discovering-the-truth-about-her-parents.html\" title=\"\">a \u201cdisconnected telephone\u201d, she wrote</a> \u2013 when she was 14. At the time of his death in 2014, father and daughter had not seen one another since 2001. In 2016 she discovered that a close family friend, the photographer Bob Adelman, was her biological father, having had an affair with her mother when they both worked at Random House publishers; he had just died. \u201cLife,\u201d Wurtzel wrote, \u201cis just a shock to the system.\u201d Her heritage had become of even more significance to her after she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and found to carry the BRCA gene.</p> <p>Wurtzel\u2019s mental health issues began when she was a child, and by early adolescence she was experiencing episodes of depression, self-harm and drug use. She had also written creatively since she was very young, excelled in her school work and was a champion speller.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI was born with a mind that is compromised by preternatural unhappiness,\u201d wrote Elizabeth Wurtzel in 2013, \u201cand I might have died very young or done very little. Instead, I made a career out of my emotions.\u201d It was a career that saw the author, who has died of breast cancer at the age of 52, catapulted to prominence in 1994 with her memoir Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America. Wurtzel\u2019s first book took readers to the heart of its author\u2019s seismic depression and its fallout of binges and broken relationships; it also documented the early days of an antidepressant revolution, in which sufferers glimpsed the possible benefits of pharmaceutical intervention. But Wurtzel\u2019s writing was never designed or able to be drily analytical \u2013 her default mode was one of what has come to be called, not entirely negatively, oversharing. As a memoirist never frightened to portray herself in an unattractive light, she was at the forefront of a new generation of life-writers whose willingness to reveal themselves delighted publishers who saw their work racing to the top of the bestseller lists. Her subsequent books Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women (1998) and More, Now, Again (2001) in part dealt with the complex interaction between that early success and the way in which society treats women deemed to be problematic and hard to categorise. Her freewheeling and often hyperbolic prose style was cited as evidence of narcissism at the same time as critics and readers pored over her excesses, failures and frailties. \u201cBy turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware, Prozac Nation possesses the raw candour of Joan Didion\u2019s essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath\u2019s Bell Jar and the wry, dark humour of a Bob Dylan song,\u201d pronounced Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times, and Plath \u2013 whom Wurtzel included in her lineup of difficult women in Bitch \u2013 was a recurrent comparison. In an interview she gave for that book, the author took a more pragmatic line on the emotional efficacy of her debut, saying: \u201cI was very upset that Prozac Nation didn\u2019t change my life.\u201d Wurtzel\u2019s life began in New York City. Her parents, Lynne Winters, a media consultant, and Donald Wurtzel, an IBM middle manager, divorced when she was two, and her relationship with her father was intermittent, culminating in his disappearance \u2013 a \u201cdisconnected telephone\u201d, she wrote \u2013 when she was 14. At the time of his death in 2014, father and daughter had not seen one another since 2001. In 2016 she discovered that a close family friend, the photographer Bob Adelman, was her biological father, having had an affair with her mother when they both worked at Random House publishers; he had just died. \u201cLife,\u201d Wurtzel wrote, \u201cis just a shock to the system.\u201d Her heritage had become of even more significance to her after she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and found to carry the BRCA gene. Wurtzel\u2019s mental health issues began when she was a child, and by early adolescence she was experiencing episodes of depression, self-harm and drug use. She had also written creatively since she was very young, excelled in her school work and was a champion speller. She became an undergraduate at Harvard, where a piece that she wrote about Lou Reed for the student newspaper the Harvard Crimson won the Rolling Stone college journalism award. She went on to an internship at the Dallas Morning News, although her spell there ended when she was accused of plagiarism; she subsequently worked as a music critic for the New Yorker and New York magazine, with mixed success. But Wurtzel\u2019s most fruitful subject was to prove herself, beginning with Prozac Nation, which she had begun writing in 1986, while still at Harvard. Neither Bitch nor More, Now, Again \u2013 the latter capturing Wurtzel\u2019s struggle to write the former, including her withdrawal from heroin and consequent addiction to Ritalin \u2013 enjoyed quite the success of Prozac Nation, which in 2001 was made into a film, with Christina Ricci in the lead role, but Wurtzel was undaunted. In 2004 she became a student again, this time at Yale Law School, where one of her contemporaries was Ronan Farrow. \u201cI met Lizzie in law school,\u201d Farrow wrote on Twitter when she died. \u201cShe started mid-career as I was starting young. We were both misfits and she was kind and generous and filled spaces that might have otherwise been lonely with her warmth and humour and idiosyncratic voice.\u201d Wurtzel passed the New York bar exam in 2010 and went on to work for the firm Boies, Schiller and Flexner. She described this second career iteration as the result of a lifelong ambition to go to law school, rather than to practise as a lawyer, and she left the firm in 2012 to focus on her writing. \u201cI may be the only person who ever went to law school on a lark,\u201d she wrote. Having written extensively about failed relationships, Wurtzel expressed surprise to have married, in 2015, the photographer and writer James Freed. The couple separated in 2019. \u201cI have spent my whole life driving people crazy,\u201d she wrote in 2018. \u201cIf you should not say it, I can\u2019t wait to scream it out the window. I am impossible. I never understood why I was so wild. I never knew how come I had to be a firebrand. I thought there was something wrong with me. Then I realised there is something right with me. Now I know I was born this way.\u201d She is survived by her mother. \u2022 Elizabeth Lee Wurtzel, writer, born 31 July 1967; died 7 January 2020 \u2022 This article was amended on 14 January 2020.

I&#39;ve always promised that I would do my best to listen and make the right choice for him when this time came. It became clear in recent weeks that he was not going to be able to return to his usual top form in 2020.  While nothing makes me happier than watching him play in his field and take him for hacks, it is still a very new and very sad realization for me that this journey has reached its end.  This horse not only achieved every goal we ever set, but he fulfilled dreams that I never knew I had. Not always the easiest, it was his generous heart and incredible sense of loyalty that made him one of a kind. Every time I sit in his saddle, I continue to feel honored and humble that he allowed me to be his person. We have travelled the world together, many times over and cut our teeth at some the world&#39;s greatest competitions. While it will not be the same loading up the trailer without him, I am very much looking forward to the next chapter of my career with a stable full of young horses.  I would like to express a deep love and appreciation for so many people, without whom, this horse would never had made his way to the world stage. My family, especially my mom, who selected Diddy with her keen eye and supported us even when everyone said we were crazy. My soon to be husband, Curt who is always my biggest fan and never questions my need to care for our animals. Debbie McDonald who gave us time when no one else would and believed in our ability to be great. Betsy Juliano who has been by my side through the ups and downs of this rollercoaster and made so much possible for me. Emmalie Clapp my amazing groom who always cares for my horses like her own. Our talented and dedicated team of veterinarians and farriers who kept this boy in top shape for so many years. Robert Dover, Hallye Griffin, US Equestrian and the USET for giving us the opportunity to represent the USA. Lastly, the biggest thank you to Verdades, Diddy, Diddyman, Bugs, my buddy for the joy you have brought to so many.</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lauragravesdressage/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Laura Graves</a> (@lauragravesdressage) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-01-08T18:34:58+00:00\">Jan 8, 2020 at 10:34am PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Graves\u2019 love of horses was kindled when she was a toddler and her parents traded in a washing machine and a tumble-dryer for the two ponies they had been boarding for a family friend.

Anyone who ever believed the Windsors might be easily prised from the public imagination, that Britons would be relaxed about dumping the royal family in favour of an elected head of state, has surely been divested of that delusion this week. Since Wednesday\u2019s announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan plan to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-say-they-are-stepping-back-from-royal-family\" title=\"\">step back</a>\u201d from frontline royal duties, the media coverage has been wall-to-wall \u2013 you had to reach page 17 of Friday\u2019s Daily Mail to read about anything else \u2013 and it\u2019s been a staple of conversation across the country. Remember, this is a move that has no constitutional implications, involving a man who is only sixth in line to the throne. And yet it has swept aside almost every other concern.</p> <p>On Thursday, for instance, the bill withdrawing Britain from the EU was passed in the Commons with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/09/boris-johnsons-brexit-bill-heads-for-lords-after-mps-vote\" title=\"\">majority of 99</a>.

      "bodyText": "If you think remain is a lost cause, you should try republicanism. Anyone who ever believed the Windsors might be easily prised from the public imagination, that Britons would be relaxed about dumping the royal family in favour of an elected head of state, has surely been divested of that delusion this week. Since Wednesday\u2019s announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan plan to \u201cstep back\u201d from frontline royal duties, the media coverage has been wall-to-wall \u2013 you had to reach page 17 of Friday\u2019s Daily Mail to read about anything else \u2013 and it\u2019s been a staple of conversation across the country. Remember, this is a move that has no constitutional implications, involving a man who is only sixth in line to the throne. And yet it has swept aside almost every other concern. On Thursday, for instance, the bill withdrawing Britain from the EU was passed in the Commons with a majority of 99. You might have missed it because, in contrast with last year\u2019s knife-edge, late-night votes \u2013 John Bercow screaming \u201cDivision!\u201d and the Parliament Channel notching up record ratings \u2013 this one barely got a mention. I don\u2019t pick that example at random. Part of the appeal of the Tories\u2019 election-winning slogan of \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d was the promise that we could, at last, talk about something else. Some hoped that would mean a serious, long-overdue focus on, say, the climate crisis. Instead, after last week\u2019s fears that an assassination ordered by Donald Trump might spark world war three, the Brexit vacuum has been filled with Megxit. I suspect this is, in part, a reaction to a year in which the country felt constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown, watching as high-stakes decisions about the nation\u2019s future were taken \u2013 or, more often, delayed \u2013 by razor-thin margins in a hung parliament.

Viewers who might only ever have known the current crop of characters can now see their backstories unfold, as they are simultaneously granted a look at the older generation in their prime. The Crown has served as a lavishly produced, three-series-long \u201cPreviously on\u2026\u201d segment for the latest evening news. With Coronation Street, only longtime viewers can fully grasp the connection between Peter Barlow\u2019s multiple affairs and the serial infidelities of his father, Ken.

The Kenyan, who also won major marathons in Berlin, New York and Tokyo and is the only man to beat the world record holder Eliud Kipchoge over 26.2 miles, has been formally charged according to the AIU\u2019s website. Under anti-doping regulations, athletes have to inform testing authorities of their whereabouts for a one-hour window every day and three failures \u2013 not being present at the said time within 12 months \u2013 lead to an automatic ban. The 37-year-old, who has a personal best of 2hr, 3min, 13secs, making him the equal sixth-fastest man in history, will face a hearing conducted under the rules of World Athletics Anti-Doping. Speaking in 2015, Kipsang said he believed that \u201cmaybe 99%\u201d of the country\u2019s athletes could be trusted. However, he has now become the latest high-profile Kenyan to come under suspicion. In 2017 Jemima Sumgong, whose Rio 2016 victory was Kenya\u2019s first Olympic gold medal in the women\u2019s marathon, was banned after testing positive for the blood-booster EPO. The former Olympic 1500m champion Asbel Kiprop has also tested positive for EPO, along with the former three-times Boston Marathon champion Rita Jeptoo. Between 2004 and August 2018, 138 Kenyan athletes tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, according to a Wada report published in September 2018. Last month Kenya said it planned to impose criminal penalties \u2013 including possible jail terms \u2013 on athletes caught doping by the summer of 2020 in a bid to get to grips with the problem.",

The Chiefs have lost on their two previous Champions Cup visits to Glasgow, including two years ago when they missed out on a place in the quarter-finals on the final weekend, but at stake this time is a home draw in the last eight. The Scotland second row Jonny Gray, who is joining Exeter next season, is in the home side\u2019s pack while the Chiefs are without their boilerhouse regulars this tournament, Dave Dennis and Jonny Hill.

Both should qualify for the quarter-finals and it is about securing home advantage. Clermont have scored 105 points in their two home matches in Europe this season and put 38 on Ulster two years ago. Morgan Parra leads the side on his 250th appearance and Nick Abendanon returns at full-back while Jordi Murphy and Marcell Coetzee return for Ulster who are defending a 100% record.</p> <p><strong>Bath v Harlequins </strong>Friday 7.45pm<strong> </strong> <strong>Clermont v Ulster </strong>Saturday 1pm</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/10/sam-warburton-i-want-to-be-king-of-the-jungle-but-ive-got-zero-credibility-as-a-coach\">Sam Warburton: \u2018I want to be king of the jungle. But I\u2019ve got zero credibility as a coach\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Pool Four</strong></h2> <p>It is the most tightly fought group with three teams having a chance of finishing top, although Racing 92 will secure that position if they defeat Munster on Sunday. Racing, whose home form in the Top 14 has been inconsistent, are close to full strength while Munster, who would face missing out on the quarter-finals if they lose and Saracens win at Ospreys, have recalled eight players who were rested for last week\u2019s match against Ulster. Sarries have rested most of their England contingent for the trip to Swansea to face a side that has only won once this season. George Kruis starts in the second row while Alun Wyn Jones returns for the home side who have picked George North in the centre.</p> <p><strong>Ospreys v Saracens </strong>Saturday 1pm <strong>Racing v Munster </strong>Sunday 3.15pm</p> <h2><strong>Pool Five</strong></h2> <p>Toulouse need two points to top the pool but will be wary of Connacht in Galway, where they lost three seasons ago. The Top 14 champions have six of their eight players who were this week named in France\u2019s squad for the Six Nations in their 23 while World Cup final try scorer Cheslin Kolbe is on the wing.

Leinster v Lyon Sunday 1pm Northampton v Treviso Sunday 1pm Pool Two Exeter need a point to secure first place in the pool and have Stuart Hogg at full-back to face his former club. The Chiefs have lost on their two previous Champions Cup visits to Glasgow, including two years ago when they missed out on a place in the quarter-finals on the final weekend, but at stake this time is a home draw in the last eight. The Scotland second row Jonny Gray, who is joining Exeter next season, is in the home side\u2019s pack while the Chiefs are without their boilerhouse regulars this tournament, Dave Dennis and Jonny Hill. La Rochelle\u2019s clash with Sale on Friday night is little more than a mathematical curiosity. La Rochelle v Sale Friday 7.45pm Glasgow v Exeter Saturday 3.15pm Pool Three The top two in the pool meet in Montferrand with Ulster going into the match one point ahead of Clermont Auvergne. Both should qualify for the quarter-finals and it is about securing home advantage. Clermont have scored 105 points in their two home matches in Europe this season and put 38 on Ulster two years ago. Morgan Parra leads the side on his 250th appearance and Nick Abendanon returns at full-back while Jordi Murphy and Marcell Coetzee return for Ulster who are defending a 100% record. Bath v Harlequins Friday 7.45pm Clermont v Ulster Saturday 1pm Pool Four It is the most tightly fought group with three teams having a chance of finishing top, although Racing 92 will secure that position if they defeat Munster on Sunday. Racing, whose home form in the Top 14 has been inconsistent, are close to full strength while Munster, who would face missing out on the quarter-finals if they lose and Saracens win at Ospreys, have recalled eight players who were rested for last week\u2019s match against Ulster. Sarries have rested most of their England contingent for the trip to Swansea to face a side that has only won once this season. George Kruis starts in the second row while Alun Wyn Jones returns for the home side who have picked George North in the centre. Ospreys v Saracens Saturday 1pm Racing v Munster Sunday 3.15pm Pool Five Toulouse need two points to top the pool but will be wary of Connacht in Galway, where they lost three seasons ago. The Top 14 champions have six of their eight players who were this week named in France\u2019s squad for the Six Nations in their 23 while World Cup final try scorer Cheslin Kolbe is on the wing. Jack Carty and Bundee Aki return for third-placed Connacht, who are battling for the runner-up position with Gloucester. The Premiership side face weakened Montpellier at Kingsholm. Louis Rees-Zammit returns on the wing while there are six changes at forward from the side which beat Bath last weekend, including a new front row. Connacht v Toulouse Saturday 3.15pm Gloucester v Montpellier Saturday 5.30pm",

      "body": "<p>Parliament sat again this week, and there was a real back-to-school feeling in Westminster.

Even at this early stage, you get the feeling that the Johnson premiership is going to offer so many understudies their chance to shine while the star is indisposed. In literally every respect bar all the obvious ones, the prime minister is like a sleek, very highly strung thoroughbred racehorse, who must be rested and pampered and indulged in order save his energy and nerves for the equivalent of the big races.

As for his attitude to scrutiny, the UK government will soon be making all briefing announcements direct and unmediated on Instagram stories, like a Kardashian.</p> <p>It\u2019s tough to pick a favourite part of Cummings\u2019 recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\" title=\"\">call for weirdos</a> to come and work with him in Downing Street, but let\u2019s go for the bit where he said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7846317/Boris-Johnsons-aide-Dominic-Cummings-posts-bizarre-job-advert.html\" title=\"\">frankly it will be hard</a>\u201d for his new assistant to have a girlfriend/boyfriend. To which the only possible reply is: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Don\u2019t worry on that front, dear. Saying they can\u2019t have a girlfriend is a bit like saying they have to masturbate to Game of Thrones, or self-ID as a black belt in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)\" title=\"\">Risk</a>. Pretty sure these things already come as standard in all candidates.</p> <p>Meanwhile, how are you enjoying Labour\u2019s unsparing self-examination? With a couple of exceptions, it feels like the least convincing period of reflection since Michael Jackson\u2019s Man in the Mirror. If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make that change. If, however, you want to stay in Neverland, then you should definitely do as sometime leadership frontrunner Rebecca Long Bailey did this week, and go on the telly and give Jeremy Corbyn \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/rebecca-long-bailey-defends-corbyns-legacy-as-she-launches-labour-leadership-bid\" title=\"\">10 out of 10</a>\u201d as party leader.</p> <p>Or do as Barry Gardiner did <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/barry-gardiner-labour-party-general-election-abu-dhabi_uk_5e170963c5b61f701949e10c?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADtLz0d3aesk6yzYXOzrOSItXQLxNrxfurqXsnCj6UgeVL47MWEf36WxXH1sBV9tBFCrUi_Z5Syl9nSuwnDAjFxZ-N0FDYz61jUcYZejEsZjgEnzHoHMFIJk59nAlVD62Gn_l7mVPQ2Rs-PLpG0djZvOaZcA5OpBRZbN22usHyCk\" title=\"\">on Thursday</a>, and dial in to the UK to announce: \u201cI believe I would have the best chance of winning at a general election.\u201d Like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9gQ3N2qv-k\" title=\"\">old advert</a> says: If \u2026 you\u2019re drinking Bacardi. Which, I guess, Barry may well have been. He was speaking from a resort hotel room, having been flown all the way to Abu Dhabi for a climate change conference (I honestly just can\u2019t). We\u2019ve all done some mad things on holiday, but Barry\u2019s nine-hour leadership bid is the new benchmark.</p> <p>Of course, like the rest of the country, I am here for every breathlessly covered second of this three-month leadership contest, which in no way feels like tuning into the soap opera of a faraway ant colony. I was intrigued to learn during the election campaign that in many ways it wouldn\u2019t matter whether Labour won or lost, because they\u2019d redefined something or other. Hopefully you remembered this when you read this week\u2019s abysmal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/09/ae-staff-despair-as-nhs-delays-are-at-their-worst-ever-level\" title=\"\">A&amp;E statistics</a>, or heard the abject tales of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/10/one-in-four-children-with-mental-health-referral-rejected-nhs\" title=\"\">youth mental health provision</a>, or watched the Tory majority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/mps-vote-to-drop-child-refugee-protections-from-brexit-bill\" title=\"\">whisk through a vote</a> denying unaccompanied child refugees the right to be reunited with their families after Brexit. Alternatively, you might conclude that there is a particular stripe of Labour self-indulgence that has simply redefined what it means to be an absolute shower of shits.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of the election result, then, it is difficult for those leadership candidates who are closely associated with Corbyn to strike the right balance. Specifically, the right balance between wearing the mark of Cain and wearing an albatross round their neck. If you need any more detail on how leading Corbynites should be wearing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatross_(metaphor)\" title=\"\">dead seabirds</a> this season, the creature should be putrefying to the point of driving all sensible voters away from their orbit, forcing the candidate to follow them apologetically while saying: \u201cPlease forgive me, but I am bound to tell you the story of how I shot the Labour party.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, the real shite starts now. However mirthlessly, you do have to laugh at the various Corbyn outriders who\u2019ve now been wrong for two elections \u2013 in most cases for three \u2013 but have not even broken stride since the biggest defeat since 1935 before turning up with some more advice for what Labour should do next.

      "bodyText": "Parliament sat again this week, and there was a real back-to-school feeling in Westminster. Private schools have much longer holidays, of course, which is why it was fine for Boris Johnson not to turn up to the Iran crisis till its first phase was basically over. I think Matron had given him a chit for a few more Caribbean cocktails. So cometh the hour, cometh \u2026 hang on, let me get my reading glasses on \u2026 ah, cometh Ben Wallace, who\u2019s apparently secretary of state for defence. Even at this early stage, you get the feeling that the Johnson premiership is going to offer so many understudies their chance to shine while the star is indisposed. In literally every respect bar all the obvious ones, the prime minister is like a sleek, very highly strung thoroughbred racehorse, who must be rested and pampered and indulged in order save his energy and nerves for the equivalent of the big races. Driving a digger through a polystyrene wall, for instance, or holding a big fish. And so to Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s tracksuit grise. Just as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is popularly held to keep the pressure off his players by acting like an arse and diverting attention to himself, so Cummings may be gouging eyes and threatening civil servants in order to spare Johnson. As for his attitude to scrutiny, the UK government will soon be making all briefing announcements direct and unmediated on Instagram stories, like a Kardashian. It\u2019s tough to pick a favourite part of Cummings\u2019 recent call for weirdos to come and work with him in Downing Street, but let\u2019s go for the bit where he said \u201cfrankly it will be hard\u201d for his new assistant to have a girlfriend/boyfriend. To which the only possible reply is: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Don\u2019t worry on that front, dear. Saying they can\u2019t have a girlfriend is a bit like saying they have to masturbate to Game of Thrones, or self-ID as a black belt in Risk. Pretty sure these things already come as standard in all candidates. Meanwhile, how are you enjoying Labour\u2019s unsparing self-examination? With a couple of exceptions, it feels like the least convincing period of reflection since Michael Jackson\u2019s Man in the Mirror. If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make that change. If, however, you want to stay in Neverland, then you should definitely do as sometime leadership frontrunner Rebecca Long Bailey did this week, and go on the telly and give Jeremy Corbyn \u201c10 out of 10\u201d as party leader. Or do as Barry Gardiner did on Thursday, and dial in to the UK to announce: \u201cI believe I would have the best chance of winning at a general election.\u201d Like the old advert says: If \u2026 you\u2019re drinking Bacardi. Which, I guess, Barry may well have been. He was speaking from a resort hotel room, having been flown all the way to Abu Dhabi for a climate change conference (I honestly just can\u2019t). We\u2019ve all done some mad things on holiday, but Barry\u2019s nine-hour leadership bid is the new benchmark. Of course, like the rest of the country, I am here for every breathlessly covered second of this three-month leadership contest, which in no way feels like tuning into the soap opera of a faraway ant colony. I was intrigued to learn during the election campaign that in many ways it wouldn\u2019t matter whether Labour won or lost, because they\u2019d redefined something or other. Hopefully you remembered this when you read this week\u2019s abysmal A&amp;E statistics, or heard the abject tales of youth mental health provision, or watched the Tory majority whisk through a vote denying unaccompanied child refugees the right to be reunited with their families after Brexit. Alternatively, you might conclude that there is a particular stripe of Labour self-indulgence that has simply redefined what it means to be an absolute shower of shits. Against the backdrop of the election result, then, it is difficult for those leadership candidates who are closely associated with Corbyn to strike the right balance. Specifically, the right balance between wearing the mark of Cain and wearing an albatross round their neck. If you need any more detail on how leading Corbynites should be wearing dead seabirds this season, the creature should be putrefying to the point of driving all sensible voters away from their orbit, forcing the candidate to follow them apologetically while saying: \u201cPlease forgive me, but I am bound to tell you the story of how I shot the Labour party.\u201d Yes, the real shite starts now. However mirthlessly, you do have to laugh at the various Corbyn outriders who\u2019ve now been wrong for two elections \u2013 in most cases for three \u2013 but have not even broken stride since the biggest defeat since 1935 before turning up with some more advice for what Labour should do next. What can you say? Other than: why are you still here? Did someone order some more wrong, with a side order of obnoxiously erroneous? Because I definitely didn\u2019t. You\u2019ve just spent four years plugging a political Fyre festival. On the matter of where Labour should go next, I would honestly rather hear what Ja Rule has to say from here on. If he\u2019s not available, the Labour party should take their lead from the classic Seinfeld episode The Opposite. Struck by the conviction that every decision he has ever made has been wrong, George decides to simply do the opposite of what he\u2019d do normally. Seeing an attractive woman, he opts not to lie to her but to say: \u201cMy name is George. I\u2019m unemployed and I live with my parents.\u201d She immediately agrees to go on a date with him. This, but for Labour. So instead of saying to potential voters \u201cHi, we won the argument and the voters loved our policies\u201d, just say \u201cHello, we lost the argument and I\u2019d hate to see what it looked like if they didn\u2019t like our policies.\u201d And then let them do the talking, because you might learn something.

I\u2019ve chosen to donate to the @wireswildliferescue emergency fund. Thank you to all for your support thus far and as a nation we really do appreciate your gratitude and generosity. However there continues to be homes lost, lives of both people and animals lost or in danger, along with whole communities, businesses and more. I hope we can continue in the same manor and continue to encourage and influence people into raising money for those affected. Other places you\u2019re able to donate can be found in the links in their bios on Instagram or visiting their official webpages.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you with Barney Ronay on the state of things at Manchester United. Thanks for reading. Cheerio! We\u2019ll be wrapping this blog up shortly. Thanks for joining us, and for your many excellent tales of players that got away. Enjoy your weekends, and be sure to keep it Guardian sport for all the football. Time for one more preview: England youth international Keanan Bennetts has fallen off the radar since leaving Spurs for Gladbach two years ago - but he scored the winner in today\u2019s friendly against Freiburg: No, it\u2019s not a Bob Mortimer monologue - this really happened: Here\u2019s today\u2019s Fiver, featuring Tarlos Cevez, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Amazon meltdown and a draconian five-a-side team: Time for Peter Oh to get the weekend started: \u201cRe: the Aston Villa manager putting on a brave face despite his striker shortage. It\u2019s good to know that there is at least one Smith resisting panic on the streets of Birmingham.\u201d And while we\u2019re on the subject of Villa strikers: Injury news: It\u2019s more bad news for Bournemouth, whose injury crisis has deepened with the news that centre-back Chris Mepham faces 12 weeks on the sidelines. Mepham had impressed in recent weeks, but suffered a knee injury in the FA Cup win over Luton. A look ahead to Chelsea v Burnley now. Sean Dyche\u2019s side are flirting with relegation, but have been tricky opponents at Stamford Bridge before - and Chelsea have handed morale boosts to Bournemouth, West Ham and Southampton at home recently. \u201cAt the end of the 2002 season, Liverpool had the opportunity to turn Nicolas Anelka\u2019s successful loan period into something more permanent,\u201d writes Toby Podmore. \u201cInstead, Houllier opted to sign the undoubted star of the World Cup, a pacy striker with a fantastic skill set and an eye for goal. His name was El-Hadji Diouf.\u201d Transfer alert! Young Arsenal playmaker Emile Smith Rowe has joined Huddersfield on loan until the end of the season. An earlier moment of mirth from J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s presser, a harmless bit of fun that will in no way make Mourinho furious: December\u2019s Premier League goal of the month? Take a bow, Son. Crystal Palace host Arsenal in Saturday\u2019s early kick-off. Granit Xhaka looked set to leave the Gunners after remonstrating with home fans when the two teams met at the Emirates - but he\u2019s expected to start at Selhurst Park. Christian Benteke is expected to start up front despite Cenk Tosun\u2019s arrival, and rumours of a return to Aston Villa. Wolves might be riding high these days, but they were deep in the doldrums back in the 80s, sliding all the way into Division Four. How different things might have been: According to the article, Wolves have a bit of a track record, having missed out on Wayne Rooney, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Nicolas Anelka and more. At least these days, their transfer game is tight. More team news! Manchester United take on Norwich, who are set to give Adam Idah a chance up front with Teemu Pukki injured. The Irish teenager banged in a hat-trick against Preston in the FA Cup. Everton face Brighton tomorrow, with an air of farce still hanging over them after the FA Cup loss to Liverpool\u2019s second string. Fans turned up at the training ground to confront players, only to find it was their day off. Now Fabian Delph is in hot water for arguing with fans on social media, calling one \u201ca gobshite\u201d and another a \u201cdelusional little boy.\u201d Unprofessional? Perhaps. But in my humble one, perhaps fans shouldn\u2019t abuse players if they\u2019d rather not get any back. With Kane out until at least April, will Gareth Southgate try to tempt Jamie Vardy back out of retirement, or give Danny Ings another England chance? He was at the King Power on Wednesday night, so perhaps he\u2019ll be back to see both strikers in action tomorrow: Thanks, Dave. A couple of you asking if we might do a Joy of Six on transfers that got away. We might be due a part two, but Rob Smyth has it covered: It\u2019s time to hand the baton back to Niall McVeigh, who\u2019ll guide you through to stumps. Team news from Crystal Palace and Roy Hodgson has his options limited for the visit of Arsenal. Captain Luka Milivojevic is serving a ban while Joel Ward (knee), Scott Dann, Victor Camarasa (both calf), Mamadou Sakho, Patrick Van Aanholt (both hamstring), Jeffrey Schlupp (hip), Andros Townsend (groin) and Christian Benteke (muscle) remain out. Celtic\u2019s Dick Rowe moment here? To be fair to Dick, he may have shunned the Beatles but signing up the Rolling Stones was a fairly smart move. Even Aston Villa boss Dean Smith isn\u2019t panicking despite not having a fit senior forward. Villa need a frontman for Sunday\u2019s visit of Manchester City after Wesley suffered a season-ending knee injury on New Year\u2019s Day but Jonathan Kodjia is likely to miss out through illness and Keinan Davis has a hamstring problem. Here\u2019s Smith\u2019s TED Talk about the mechanics of the transfer window. \u201cWhen you are after players, four things need to align, the selling clubs want to sell, the buying club wants to buy and have the funds and then the player and his agents. There are four boxes and we\u2019re not any closer to doing that at the moment.\u201d Sean Dyche won\u2019t panic and neither will Spurs boss Jose Mourinho. There\u2019s a severe lack of panic amongst all the Premier League managers to be honest. What\u2019s the matter with them? Anyway, here\u2019s Jose ruling out panic buys despite the recent injuries to Harry Kane and Moussa Sissoko... \u201cIf the boss arrives with a solution that can help us to face these difficult months that we are going to have ahead of us then so be it, then welcome. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t find the right solution, the right opportunity, then we are going to wait for the next summer to try to make the right decisions for the evolution of the team. \u201cSo let\u2019s wait, calm, but in this moment my focus is total on the players that we have available. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201d Always a contender for the Dick Rowe award is this classic by RuefulCountenance... \u201cSheffield United were of course linked heavily with Diego Maradona in his Boca days, but the board baulked at the price. \u201cOur manager at the time, also set up a deal to get Ossie Ardilles, but I think what happened was his stock and fee rose after a good World Cup. Haslam instead acted as a middle man for Ardille\u2019s move to Spurs. Bah.\u201d A bit more from Frank Lampard on the possible departure of Olivier Giroud. \u201cWith Ollie the situation is, if it\u2019s right for everybody, and first and foremost that\u2019s us as the club, then we\u2019ll look at whether he can leave the club. He\u2019s been a great professional here, who has continued to train professionally without many opportunities. But I still have to make a decision for the football club, and nothing\u2019s done yet. Everyone\u2019s talking about it so I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush.\u201d As for team news ahead of the visit of Burnley, Christian Pulisic is out with an adductor injury that will keep him out for a number of weeks. There is no sign of an imminent return for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who continues rehabilitation from heel surgery. The PA report that the Football Association is in discussions with the BBC and BT Sport about how to broadcast any FA Cup match which falls outside of the Saturday 3pm blackout period. The FA has had to act after betting companies who had previously held exclusive UK streaming rights for ties not on television or kicking off at 3pm waived the right to exclusivity on Thursday. The original deal was criticised for encouraging gambling, and how it jarred with an FA campaign promoting mental health awareness, but on Thursday the betting companies announced they were happy for a free platform to be found for these ties. Here\u2019s Jose Mourinho sounding particularly enthused about the forthcoming Tottenham documentary series on Amazon. Moussa Dembele to Chelsea? Frank Lampard is playing it down. \u201cHe\u2019s a player I know and a player the club know, but I\u2019m surprised to see his name crop up so frequently in relation to us to be brutally honest. And I could say the same thing about a number of players this week. I don\u2019t want to go cut and dried on anyone. But it\u2019s not one we\u2019re openly talking about.\u201d Asked if Chelsea are close to finalising any signings, Lampard adds: \u201cNo, not at the moment. But what is close? It\u2019s January, and if it\u2019s right we\u2019ll look at it. Nothing\u2019s imminent, we\u2019re not going to have any big news today, or tomorrow.\u201d So expect him to be further harangued on Sunday then. Here\u2019s a good one... and with a picture too. Down the East Lancs road at Goodison (although most surely take the M62), we have another injury update. This time it\u2019s Carlo Ancelotti on midfielder Andre Gomes, who looked set to be out for the season after a dislocation fracture to his right ankle in the draw against Tottenham in November. No timeframe but Ancelotti says: \u201cIt is good news. He is doing well in his recovery. It is going fast so I hope as soon as possible he can be with us.\u201d Pep Guardiola has given injury updates on two of his key absentees. On Aymeric Laporte: \u201cHe\u2019s training every day and he feels good. That is good news but I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be ready to play games.\u201d Leroy Sane, absent since August\u2019s Community Shield, has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich and Guardiola addressed that speculation too: \u201cIt\u2019s a question for Leroy, his agents and the club. I\u2019m not involved but he knows what we believe. I want him to come back fit. His knee looks really good. After that it\u2019s not my business.\u201d A double tale of woe from below the line courtesy of TheGreatBaldo... \u201cDuring the Alex Miller horror show at Pittodrie, we were offered 2 Monaco unknown youngsters on loan - Thierry Henry and David Trezuguet... \u201cMiller declined and signed Mike Newell and Nigel Pepper instead. Newell\u2019s only highlight in Aberdeen was being so drunk he got thrown out of a Louise Nurding (Redknapp) gig and then got his arm trapped in a letter box. \u201cAs for Pepper, his highlight was being sent off less than 20 seconds after he came on as a sub vs Dundee United, he actually passed the player he replaced (Paul Bernard) on the way to the dressing room.\u201d Flashbleu puts forward this \u2018one that got away\u2019 tale. \u201cI recall Joe Royle parted company with Everton over his desire to bring a young Norwegian striker to the club. The club\u2019s then chairman, Peter Johnson, used all his experience of selling hampers to tell the former striker that he knew nothing of strikers and Royle was forced out. The Norwegian striker , Tore Andr\u00e9 Flo, did quite well with Chelsea afterwards.\u201d Talking of which, have you tried our Norwegian footballers in 1998 quiz? A bit niche, admittedly. A bit more from Sean Dyche, who says Burnley are thinking more about players coming in rather than going out. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not in a position where we need to sell anyone. The club is in very good financial health, so there\u2019s no demand on that.\u201d In terms of team news for the Stamford Bridge trip, Ashley Barnes and Johann Berg Gudmundsson are set to miss out with groin and hamstring injuries respectively. On the plus side, Chris Wood is likely to return after hamstring trouble. Burnley have lost nine of their last 13 games and sit just four points above the relegation zone ahead of Saturday\u2019s trip to Chelsea but boss Sean Dyche is not one to panic. \u201cIt\u2019s partly the understanding of the challenge, partly understanding who we are and partly the experience I\u2019ve gathered. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different things. I wouldn\u2019t say \u2018calm\u2019 about everything, but I like to work on logic and realities, so that keeps me a little bit more level about what the challenge is, I think,\u201d says Dyche, sounding more Spock than Lance Corporal Jones. Teddy Sheringham to Liverpool was one I recall but a personal favourite is Frank Worthington having his dream switch to Anfield scuppered due to a failed medical. The title of his book, \u2018One Hump Or Two\u2019, hints at why (Frank\u2019s blood pressure was off the scale due to recent activity). Bizarrely, that book helps me out on quiz nights. One hump or two, of course, also refers to camels and, as Frank explains, the best way to remember your Bactrian from your Dromedary is to take the first letter of each, make it a capital and turn it on its side. Sideways B = Bactrian. Thanks Niall. Keep those \u2018one that got away\u2019 entries coming in. Plenty more who could contend for the Dick Rowe award I would imagine. Time to hand over to my esteemed colleague, Dave Tindall, who will guide you through the next couple of hours. Dave ... Here\u2019s Roy Hodgson on new recruit Cenk Tosun: \u201cThere was a serious interest in signing him, but Everton got his signature. We\u2019re very pleased to have him with us, we know his qualities and what he can bring. But we also feel we could have had him much earlier.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re signing him to score goals for us, it\u2019s an area we\u2019ve been looking to improve for some time. He\u2019s full of enthusiasm, because he\u2019s not had game time at Everton.\u201d My favourite \u2018one that got away\u2019 so far sounds completely made up, but is apparently true. His loss. Another transfer line being rapidly reheated today is Bruno Fernandes to Manchester United. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played a straight bat early on, in response to reports that he and Mike Phelan took a trip to Lisbon to watch the attacking midfielder. Portuguese press say United have opened talks, with Sporting wanting \u00a360m large. As I mentioned earlier, that seems like a good move for all concerned. Palace have needed a centre-forward for about 10 years, and Tosun needs game time with Euro 2020 coming up. What\u2019s more, he\u2019ll go from Everton bench-warmer to first-choice at a team higher in the table. That\u2019s how we like it - a deal mooted earlier on today has quickly progressed, and is now confirmed before lunch. Cenk Tosun has joined Crystal Palace on loan until the end of the season. You\u2019re correct, Sam. Below the line, one for Everton to forget: Amid news that Harry Maguire could feature against Norwich, another potential defensive boost for Manchester United. Eric Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah are on their way back, and will feature for the Under-23s this evening. The first of our Premier League match previews has landed, with both Wolves and Newcastle bidding to end losing runs: Coming up: Pep Guardiola at 1pm, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at 1.30pm, and Frank Lampard also at half one. Will be interesting to see if Frank has any comment on Olivier Giroud. Sky are reporting that the striker has agreed personal terms with Inter as both clubs haggle over his transfer fee. More of your \u2018ones that got away\u2019: Bournemouth have slipped into the relegation zone after two wins in their last 16 games, and Eddie Howe is desperate to get the good times rolling at the Vitality Stadium again. \u201cThis is a massive game for us. It is a key run coming up and we can\u2019t wait any longer, we need points,\u201d Howe said. \u201cTeams used to fear coming here, it was a tight stadium with a really good atmosphere. I\u2019m desperate to get that back.\u201d The Cherries take on Watford on Sunday, with Adam Smith, Lloyd Kelly and Nathan Ak\u00e9 all potentially in the frame to return. ThisNameIsMine nominates Liverpool, who missed out on Michael Laudrup in 1983, and one Cristiano Ronaldo 20 years later. \u201cWe had a wage scale and we weren\u2019t paying the sort of salary he wanted,\u201d Gerard Houllier said of Ronaldo. \u201cI agreed with not breaking the wage structure. I thought it would cause problems in our dressing room.\u201d Houllier signed Harry Kewell instead. Props to Abhishek Mallik and VigoTheCarpathian, who point out that Blackburn also missed out on Roy Keane and Christophe Dugarry, along with Zidane and later Lewandowski. They also nearly got Sven-Goran Eriksson in as manager in the late 90s; it seems they could have gone the full Lazio. Sticking with Palace, and Cenk Tosun is reportedly in South London for a medical ahead of a loan move to Crystal Palace. That could be a smart move for both parties. Wolves, meanwhile, are chasing RB Leipzig forward Matheus Cunha, having agreed to let Patrick Cutrone return to Italy with Fiorentina. The Brazilian can play through the middle or out wide, and would slot nicely into Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s Portugal-heavy squad. Some hot transfer news from my colleague, Will Unwin: Olympiakos captain Omar Elabdellaoui has turned down the chance to join Turkish giants Galatasaray in order to focus on securing a move to the UK. The defender, who will be available for free in the summer, has attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs, including Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, in addition to Scottish champions Celtic. Italian side Atalanta are also keeping a close eye on the defender, watching him in his most recent match. Olympiakos want to keep Elabdellaoui, who came through the ranks at Manchester City and has previously enjoyed a loan spell at Hull, until the end of the season as they battle PAOK for the title and face Arsenal in the Europa League. It will be a busy few months for Norway captain Elabdellaoui who will lead the national team, including Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard, in the Euro 2020 playoffs. \u201cWest Ham almost signed Shevchenko; he played in a friendly away to Barnet,\u201d writes Jack Ryan. An intriguing one this; Harry Redknapp has claimed the Ukrainian had a trial with the Hammers in the early 90s. Shevchenko, however, has denied it ever happened. Before we get back into the Premier League grind, here\u2019s a remarkable story from Ed Aarons and Alex Cizmic, on the footballers in limbo as they try to escape one of the world\u2019s most oppressive regimes: \u201cLewandowski actually came somewhat close to signing for Norwegian third-tier club H\u00f8dd (former club of Aston Villa keeper \u00d8rjan Nyland) in 2007 after getting him recommended by the assistant coach\u2019s friend,\u201d writes Kristian Skaar. \u201cThe forward was interested in a trial, but the club wouldn\u2019t pay for his plane ticket. Might have regretted that.\u201d More on Mat Ryan\u2019s pledge to help wildlife hit by bushfires back in Australia: Championship preview In the lunchtime kick-off, third-placed Brentford face QPR in a West London derby, looking to muscle in on the automatic promotion party. It\u2019s a big weekend for derbies, with leaders Leeds hosting Sheffield Wednesday, a basement battle between Barnsley and Huddersfield, and Preston visiting Blackburn. West Brom go to Charlton for the second straight weekend after their FA Cup win there, while bottom club Luton might fancy their chances at home to free-falling Birmingham. Play-off chasers Millwall, Fulham and Forest visit Stoke, Hull and Reading respectively, but the biggest game of all comes on Sunday as Cardiff host Swansea. The outrageously talented Trent Alexander-Arnold has been named the Premier League player of the month for December. Here\u2019s Eni Aluko on why the flying full-back should win the PFA award this season: \u201cApparently Newcastle were offered the chance to sign Zinedine Zidane from Bordeaux in 1996 for \u00a31.2m,\u201d writes Ben Blatch-Hanlon. \u201cAfter watching him they turned him down, claiming he wasn\u2019t good enough for the Premier League.\u201d Have you read the one about the goalless 32-year-old centre-forward who is one of the Premier League\u2019s breakout stars? If not, do so now: As pointed out by GatehouseAmi below the line, Burnley interviewed Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas back in 2010, but gave the job to Brian Laws instead. \u201cHe sent a very detailed and lengthy application for the job,\u201d former Burnley chief executive Paul Fletcher wrote in his 2012 book. \u201cHis CV and PowerPoint presentation was amazing. Even by today\u2019s standards there was some complicated stuff in it, with some things that I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cWith hindsight, we might have appointed him, but at the time it would have been too big a risk. The language and jargon of football gets worse by the day. Villas-Boas uses a lot of it. Would Burnley players have ever understood him?\u201d \u201cI have written a regular column for Norwich City\u2019s matchday programme for 12 seasons featuring former players,\u201d writes Steve. \u201cThis season I have been writing on Nearly Canaries - those that didn\u2019t make the first team.\u201d \u201cMy list includes Oceania\u2019s \u201cplayer of the century\u201d, Wynton Rufer, who signed a contract with Norwich in 1981 only to be refused a work permit. He went on to win the Uefa Cup with Werder Bremen.\u201d Klopp adds that aside from Rhian Brewster, he doesn\u2019t expect too many of his young guns to head out on loan this month. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are other players who would benefit more from a loan than from being here,\u201d he says. Liverpool injury news: Xherdan Shaqiri is back in training, but both James Milner and Naby Keita are out of the trip to North London with ongoing muscle problems, while Fabinho will be back in the first-team picture next week. Klopp is reminded that if his side beat Spurs, it will be the best ever start to an English top-flight season ever. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it if we win,\u201d Klopp hits back, while grappling with a bottle of water. J\u00fcrgen Klopp tells us what he expects from Tottenham on Saturday. \u201cExpecting an organised Spurs side putting some emphasis on defending for sure. They have players who can create at speed - Eriksen, Alli, Lucas, Son - and Aurier at full-back. We have to think about what [Jos\u00e9 Mourinho] did against us at United, but this is a different team, different players.\u201d Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan has pledged his support to Australian wildlife charities working amid the ongoing bushfires. The Aussie keeper will donate A$500 for every save made by a Premier League keeper this weekend: Transfer news! Chelsea defender Marc Guehi is heading to Swansea on loan, linking up with his former England U17 manager, Steve Cooper, who has already picked up Rhian Brewster in this transfer window. \u201cThe gaffer is a big part of the reason for coming here,\u201d Guehi said. \u201cYou are coming to a place where you are unfamiliar with your surroundings, so to have that familiar face really helps in terms of getting down to work.\u201d Our first \u2018one that got away\u2019 is a manager, rather than a player - but a brutal one to take for Hamburg, currently in Germany\u2019s second division. Speaking of Klopp, his Liverpool presser is coming right up. Newcastle are five points above the relegation zone ahead of Saturday\u2019s trip to Molineux, and Steve Bruce isn\u2019t happy about the Premier League\u2019s packed Christmas schedule, describing it as \u201cludicrous\u201d. Bruce added that he would like to sign Lookman, but \u201cwe\u2019ve been linked with 38 players this month, and he\u2019s one of them. It\u2019s still pretty far off\u201d. Across Manchester, a significant boost for City, with Leroy San\u00e9 back in training. The German winger has been on the sidelines since suffering a knee injury in the Community Shield. San\u00e9 has been repeatedly linked with a move to Bayern Munich but has been missed by Pep Guardiola. Not as much as defensive linchpin Aymeric Laporte, perhaps - but the centre-back is also close to a first-team return. Some interesting news out of Old Trafford, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer confirming that Harry Maguire could feature against Norwich this weekend. The centre-back was expected to be out for some time, but OGS has denied there were ever fears of a long-term injury. \u201cMaybe you were thinking of Harry Kane?\u201d Ole chirps, to zero laughs. Solskjaer also refuses to confirm or deny that club captain Ashley Young could be off to Internazionale, and informs us Jesse Lingard is not available. More here: More gossip in today\u2019s Rumour Mill: Some early transfer news: Spurs have reportedly held talks with Milan over Polish striker Krzysztof Piatek, Newcastle are hoping to sign Ademola Lookman on loan, and Norwich are closing in on Hertha Berlin playmaker Ondrej Duda. In keeping with today\u2019s key themes, I\u2019d love to hear a) your team\u2019s lesser-known rivalries, and b) the transfer targets that got away. Robert Lewandowski nearly joining Blackburn, that sort of thing. You can comment below, email me or tweet here. There may be bad blood between Sheffield United and West Ham, but their two managers are going big on the mutual respect, like the school\u2019s two hardest dads exchanging a nod at the gates. David Moyes on Chris Wilder: \u201cI quite enjoy seeing managers who have to earn their stripes, prove themselves in the lower leagues, and then they move up.\u201d Wilder on Moyes: \u201cHis record, from Preston to Everton, was incredible. For the vast majority of his career he\u2019s been hugely successful and they\u2019re definitely a different proposition with David Moyes in charge.\u201d More on that, and nine other things, here: The Premier League is back, and we\u2019re all a little bloated from football\u2019s festive excesses, particularly that double Cup chaser. But what better way to ease your indigestion than some choice Friday night beef? Sheffield United welcome West Ham to Bramall Lane tonight for the first time since 2007, when Carlos Tevez helped the Hammers escape the drop at the Blades\u2019 expense, leading to a long legal battle and a simmering mutual emnity between the two clubs. There\u2019s more where that came from on Saturday, too, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho facing Liverpool, a club that a) overlooked him in favour of Rafa Ben\u00edtez, b) forced him out of Old Trafford, and c) are surpassing his mid-naughts Chelsea side as the Premier League\u2019s most efficient winning machine. As for Southampton, the cackles of Jamie Vardy still haunt their dreams as they look to restore pride against Leicester, without reminding NINE everyone NIL of the score NINE-NIL! last time the two sides met. Plus! Team news! Press conference soundbites! A Football League programme that can only be described as bumper! And more! So stick around, email me here, tweet @niallmcveigh or comment below the line.",

Eras rise and fall. Trophies will be won again. By the same token, travel to any United away game and the soul and heart of this club is still boisterously present. It will be there if and when the glory times return. It might even draw a little more strength, a little more sweetness from the current confusions.",

It may also be worse than Tickle suggests because for various reasons (including unsuitably qualified solicitors or a perceived lack of evidence) judges may not even take account of an established pattern of controlling behaviour.

By 1620 Jamestown was a regular transatlantic destination with a population of over 1,000 colonists occupying many separate holdings for 50 miles on both sides of the James River with a rapidly developing tobacco trade. The 400th anniversary of the first general assembly \u2013 the oldest continuous law-making body in the US that was originally held in the second wooden Jamestown church built in 1617 \u2013 was relatively quietly celebrated on 30 July last year, though President Trump did attend.

The guide, aimed at police officers, government organisations and teachers who by law have to report concerns about radicalisation, was dated last November. It says that issues to look out for include people who speak in \u201cstrong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution\u201d. In the guide, people are advised to listen and look out for young people who \u201cneglect to attend school\u201d or \u201cparticipate in planned school walkouts\u201d \u2013 an allusion to the school strikes for the climate, a global movement of which the activist Greta Thunberg is a lead proponent.

They started in Nottingham but now have choirs all over the country with at least two in London. After three years, I still can\u2019t sing in tune but singing with others similarly afflicted is pure joy. We tunelessly sing our hearts out from Abba to Wham, by way of Elvis, Frank Sinatra and Queen and it sounds awful but we don\u2019t care.

I tell my group of players that if they are unable to play the right chord they just sing louder, and if they are unable to sing, they just play louder. Apart from playing more for our own fun than anyone else\u2019s, ukes are about the easiest instrument to play, good to sing with, and great for leading community singing. <br><strong>Jenny Braithwaite</strong><br><em>Faringdon, </em><em>Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Singing in tune comes naturally to some people; others have to learn how to do it.

Everyone has a voice.<br><strong>Lucy Quinn</strong><br><em>Wallingford, </em><em>Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Don\u2019t give up hope, Jennifer!

We are invited to sing at old people\u2019s homes and we have a wonderful time. It\u2019s also a great way of getting out of your home and making new friends.

They started in Nottingham but now have choirs all over the country with at least two in London. After three years, I still can\u2019t sing in tune but singing with others similarly afflicted is pure joy. We tunelessly sing our hearts out from Abba to Wham, by way of Elvis, Frank Sinatra and Queen and it sounds awful but we don\u2019t care. I\u2019m looking forward to the Tuneless Choir big weekend in February when 200 of us will sing badly together. Bridget Cuthbertson Hexham, Northumberland \u2022 I would suggest that Jennifer Henley joins a ukulele group. I tell my group of players that if they are unable to play the right chord they just sing louder, and if they are unable to sing, they just play louder. Apart from playing more for our own fun than anyone else\u2019s, ukes are about the easiest instrument to play, good to sing with, and great for leading community singing. Jenny Braithwaite Faringdon, Oxfordshire \u2022 Singing in tune comes naturally to some people; others have to learn how to do it. It needs motivation, practice and friendly encouragement. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t sing. Everyone can sing. Everyone has a voice. Lucy Quinn Wallingford, Oxfordshire \u2022 Don\u2019t give up hope, Jennifer! Find a group like the Greenacres Friendship Choir in Oldham. I can\u2019t sing, but I enjoy making a noise with others at this friendly group. We are invited to sing at old people\u2019s homes and we have a wonderful time. It\u2019s also a great way of getting out of your home and making new friends. At present we meet on Tuesday mornings and we are also thinking of setting up an evening group.

Wolf Cukier, 17, from Scarsdale, New York, made the discovery while peering through the agency\u2019s orbiting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) last year. Assigned to study how two stars would cross paths creating an eclipse, he focused on the solar system TOI 1338, where he noticed something in the orbit of two stars that was blocking the light. His bosses spent several weeks verifying his observation, and ultimately concluded that Cukier had discovered a planet 6.9 times larger than Earth and only the 13th planet of its kind ever discovered. \u201cI was looking through the data for everything the volunteers had flagged as an eclipsing binary, a system where two stars circle around each other and from our view eclipse each other every orbit,\u201d Cukier said, according to a Nasa press release. \u201cAbout three days into my internship, I saw a signal from a system called TOI 1338.

He grew up in a tower block in a Paris banlieue before moving to the country \u201cfor the clean air\u201d, and works helping jobless people get back into employment. He liked working through different opinions to find consensus. \u201cWhen a Parisian who lives right next to a metro station says, \u2018Oh, we need to ban cars\u2019, I might say, \u2018Look, when you live in the countryside and have to drive your car 15km to buy bread, it\u2019s something else\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf we build an efficient public transport network for 90% of French people across the country, then we can reduce cars. But surely you have to do things in the right order? You can\u2019t put people in difficulty before finding solutions.\u201d</p> <p>He said his family used one car, not two, and he now would not take flights for a holiday. \u201cI see myself as the silent majority: someone who does a little bit for the environment, but could do more.\u201d He said it was about getting society on board. \u201cWe\u2019re not inventing miracle solutions, we\u2019re just reinventing the workings to make sure solutions will be accepted.\u201d</p> <p>Sylvain Burquier, 45, described himself as a typical \u201ccynical Parisian advertising executive\u201d despite spending his childhood in the Alps. \u201cI\u2019ve become really passionate about the human experience of putting so many different people together. We\u2019re being asked to come up with proposals to basically save humanity, so there\u2019s a lot resting on this! When you take 150 different people, with different complaints and incoherences and indiscipline, and then they get together to produce a work of collective intelligence, I find that remarkable and very touching.\u201d</p> <p>He said it was not just about creating policy for individuals to change their habits. \u201cEven if we do something drastic and demand a huge effort from individuals on travel and consumption, that would only get us 25% of the way there. Companies have a huge role to play \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t have to be a negative message of fear and collapse, there can be positive ways to encourage change.\u201d</p> <p>He said inserting new climate elements into the French constitution would be a revolutionary possibility, but there would also be concrete measures impacting people\u2019s everyday lives. The process had reignited his interest in politics and debate. \u201cI\u2019ve got back some of my teenage enthusiasm.\u201d</p>",

It was crucial for organisers to include people under 18. \u201cClimate change is the key issue for our generation and our future,\u201d said Romane, who wants to study management. \u201cAt my first sessions, the full sense of the climate emergency really hit me and I was a bit scared, but now I think if we give our all, we can make proposals for change.\u201d Personally, she does what she can. \u201cI try to use public transport, but the nearest bus stop is in the next village so I have to take a car to get there.\u201d Gr\u00e9goire Fraty, 31, who lives in Normandy, is from what geographers call the French periphery \u2013 the hinterland outside cities where gilets jaunes protesters mobilised and which is increasingly targeted by the far right. He grew up in a tower block in a Paris banlieue before moving to the country \u201cfor the clean air\u201d, and works helping jobless people get back into employment. He liked working through different opinions to find consensus. \u201cWhen a Parisian who lives right next to a metro station says, \u2018Oh, we need to ban cars\u2019, I might say, \u2018Look, when you live in the countryside and have to drive your car 15km to buy bread, it\u2019s something else\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cIf we build an efficient public transport network for 90% of French people across the country, then we can reduce cars. But surely you have to do things in the right order? You can\u2019t put people in difficulty before finding solutions.\u201d He said his family used one car, not two, and he now would not take flights for a holiday. \u201cI see myself as the silent majority: someone who does a little bit for the environment, but could do more.\u201d He said it was about getting society on board. \u201cWe\u2019re not inventing miracle solutions, we\u2019re just reinventing the workings to make sure solutions will be accepted.\u201d Sylvain Burquier, 45, described himself as a typical \u201ccynical Parisian advertising executive\u201d despite spending his childhood in the Alps. \u201cI\u2019ve become really passionate about the human experience of putting so many different people together. We\u2019re being asked to come up with proposals to basically save humanity, so there\u2019s a lot resting on this! When you take 150 different people, with different complaints and incoherences and indiscipline, and then they get together to produce a work of collective intelligence, I find that remarkable and very touching.\u201d He said it was not just about creating policy for individuals to change their habits. \u201cEven if we do something drastic and demand a huge effort from individuals on travel and consumption, that would only get us 25% of the way there. Companies have a huge role to play \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t have to be a negative message of fear and collapse, there can be positive ways to encourage change.\u201d He said inserting new climate elements into the French constitution would be a revolutionary possibility, but there would also be concrete measures impacting people\u2019s everyday lives. The process had reignited his interest in politics and debate. \u201cI\u2019ve got back some of my teenage enthusiasm.\u201d",

We don\u2019t learn much about Lance Cpl Schofield (George MacKay) and Lance Cpl Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), the British soldiers asked to embark on a life-saving quest across enemy lines to keep 1,600 comrades from falling into a German trap. But their individual sacrifice is a silver lining common to many first world war movies: in the absence of a larger and nobler purpose, the best soldiers can do is fight for each other, and hope to spare a life or steal a little bit of dignity and humanity.</p> <p>Though 1917 takes place against the haunted backdrop of abandoned trenches, bombed-out facades and corpse-strewn thickets of barbed wire, the limits of its time-frame (and faux-single-shot continuity) forbid a larger picture of the war.

The extra time allows Vidor the opportunity to humanize the characters through slapstick shenanigans and the wordless romance between Jim and Melisandre, who share only the language of love. By the time the action shifts toward a harrowing march through the woods to confront the Germans, the human stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, especially when Jim and his buddies are asked to leave a shellhole at night to quell the mortar fire of a German nest. They realize instantly that not all of them will survive until morning.</p> <p>The ordering of suicide missions is a running theme in first world war movies, which often contrast the bravery of the rank-and-file with leaders who are either tragically wrong-headed or openly reckless in leading these lambs to the slaughter. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1957 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/28/stanley-kubrick-paths-of-glory\">Paths of Glory</a> is about a French general who knowingly orders his division to a suicidal attack on a heavily fortified German \u201canthill\u201d, then arbitrarily court-martials three men for cowardice when the first wave gets cut down and the second refuses to leave the trench. Kubrick presents the show trial that follows as the height of absurdity, mounted entirely as a face-saving measure for a general who\u2019s seeking a promotion at the grunts\u2019 expense. (Nearly half a century later, Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s A Very Long Engagement would pick up on a similar story of soldiers condemned for \u201cself-mutilation\u201d, though Jeunet and his Am\u00e9lie star, Audrey Tautou, were more interested in romantic serendipity than anti-war sentiment.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98accea4bb725f45d4b8c7f640f716c3522ee118\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98accea4bb725f45d4b8c7f640f716c3522ee118/0_7_2976_1787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>By contrast, Jean Renoir\u2019s 1937 standard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-grande-illusion\">Grand Illusion</a> comes around to an anti-war message through a subtler assessment of leaders on both sides of the conflict, whose class connections to each other run deeper than nationalist animosity. There are shades of The Great Escape to the story of French officers who politely yet insistently attempt to break free of the aristocratic German (Erich von Stroheim) who\u2019s holding them captive. Yet the conditions for these prisoners of war aren\u2019t exactly dire \u2013 they stage a rousing vaudeville-style performance in drag \u2013 and the conversation turns to a lament over Europe\u2019s collapsing social order, which presages even more tragedy to come. What stands out in Grand Illusion is Renoir\u2019s humane treatment of all parties: War is an unnatural state, stoked by a nationalist fervor that dissolves when people are in a room together.</p> <p>Even a film as pitiless and lacerating as Paths of Glory comes to the same conclusion in its final moments, when French soldiers gather at an inn and start to heckle and catcall a frightened German woman as she sings The Faithful Hussar, only to respond deeply to her vulnerability. What\u2019s touching about the great first world war movies is their attempt to find meaning in small acts of courage and friendships under duress, when a salvageable moment or relationship transcends the cynicism, chaos and death that defined the war itself.</p> <p>As a documentary postscript to these films, Peter Jackson\u2019s miraculous digital reclamation project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/11/they-shall-not-grow-old-peter-jackson-review-first-world-war-footage\">They Shall Not Grow Old</a>, winds up reinforcing their observations with real testimony from the men who actually lived through it. Drawing images, footage, and audio from the Imperial War Museum and other sources \u2013 revivified further by advances in visual and sound effects \u2013 Jackson brings these old ghosts to life in a chorus of shared experience. The film is an emotional history rather than a record of important dates or key battles, full of specific memories and plainspoken laments. No one cared to hear from them when it mattered.</p>",

The extra time allows Vidor the opportunity to humanize the characters through slapstick shenanigans and the wordless romance between Jim and Melisandre, who share only the language of love. By the time the action shifts toward a harrowing march through the woods to confront the Germans, the human stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, especially when Jim and his buddies are asked to leave a shellhole at night to quell the mortar fire of a German nest. They realize instantly that not all of them will survive until morning. The ordering of suicide missions is a running theme in first world war movies, which often contrast the bravery of the rank-and-file with leaders who are either tragically wrong-headed or openly reckless in leading these lambs to the slaughter. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1957 film Paths of Glory is about a French general who knowingly orders his division to a suicidal attack on a heavily fortified German \u201canthill\u201d, then arbitrarily court-martials three men for cowardice when the first wave gets cut down and the second refuses to leave the trench. Kubrick presents the show trial that follows as the height of absurdity, mounted entirely as a face-saving measure for a general who\u2019s seeking a promotion at the grunts\u2019 expense. (Nearly half a century later, Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s A Very Long Engagement would pick up on a similar story of soldiers condemned for \u201cself-mutilation\u201d, though Jeunet and his Am\u00e9lie star, Audrey Tautou, were more interested in romantic serendipity than anti-war sentiment.) By contrast, Jean Renoir\u2019s 1937 standard Grand Illusion comes around to an anti-war message through a subtler assessment of leaders on both sides of the conflict, whose class connections to each other run deeper than nationalist animosity. There are shades of The Great Escape to the story of French officers who politely yet insistently attempt to break free of the aristocratic German (Erich von Stroheim) who\u2019s holding them captive. Yet the conditions for these prisoners of war aren\u2019t exactly dire \u2013 they stage a rousing vaudeville-style performance in drag \u2013 and the conversation turns to a lament over Europe\u2019s collapsing social order, which presages even more tragedy to come. What stands out in Grand Illusion is Renoir\u2019s humane treatment of all parties: War is an unnatural state, stoked by a nationalist fervor that dissolves when people are in a room together. Even a film as pitiless and lacerating as Paths of Glory comes to the same conclusion in its final moments, when French soldiers gather at an inn and start to heckle and catcall a frightened German woman as she sings The Faithful Hussar, only to respond deeply to her vulnerability. What\u2019s touching about the great first world war movies is their attempt to find meaning in small acts of courage and friendships under duress, when a salvageable moment or relationship transcends the cynicism, chaos and death that defined the war itself. As a documentary postscript to these films, Peter Jackson\u2019s miraculous digital reclamation project, They Shall Not Grow Old, winds up reinforcing their observations with real testimony from the men who actually lived through it. Drawing images, footage, and audio from the Imperial War Museum and other sources \u2013 revivified further by advances in visual and sound effects \u2013 Jackson brings these old ghosts to life in a chorus of shared experience. The film is an emotional history rather than a record of important dates or key battles, full of specific memories and plainspoken laments. No one cared to hear from them when it mattered.",

One of the dead was reportedly a female teacher, with some reports suggesting she had been the shooter\u2019s target. The other was the shooter, who police said had killed himself. A graphic photograph published by Mexican news outlets showed what appeared to be the body of a young boy splayed out in a pool of blood, with a handgun lying on the ground. Police chief Maurilio Ochoa told reporters six people had been wounded \u2013 five schoolchildren and a teacher \u2013 with two in a \u201cdelicate\u201d condition in hospital.

One of the worst such attacks to take place in Mexico came in 2017 when a 15-year-old student killed himself after shooting four people at a school in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.

Honestly, when was the last decent Friday night game? Admittedly, Wolves 3-2 Man City was pretty good, but through a haze of Christmas Tin, that didn\u2019t feel like a Friday. There was Leicester\u2019s 9-0 win at Southampton but ... let\u2019s not ruin the narrative. Down with this sort of thing!</p> <p>At first glance, Sheffield United v West Ham looks an odd choice, no more than an excuse for the cry-laughing-face emojis at Premier League Towers to force already un\u2019appy \u2018Ammers fans to spend their weekends in a travel tavern. Hang on, something\u2019s coming back to us \u2026 it\u2019s April 2007. The Proclaimers top the charts with I\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles), their bellowed ode to travelling supporters. The Fiver is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/20/thefiver.sport\"> moving headlong</a> into the artificial intelligence age. And Sheffield United are staying up!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/10/david-mcgoldrick-beloved-blades-lack-cutting-edge\">David McGoldrick is beloved by Blades despite his lack of cutting edge | Paul Doyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A comprehensive 3-0 win over West Ham leaves Neil Warnock\u2019s merry band five points above the Hammers with four to play. Once the expected points deduction for the murky third-party signings of Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez kicks in, it\u2019ll all be over. Eh, what\u2019s that? Oh. West Ham get a hefty fine instead, and Tevez goes on to lead them to safety with four straight wins, including a victory at Old Trafford back when that was actually hard. And Sheffield United are going down.</p> <p>Warnock took the outcome with trademark good grace, stripping to the waist and demanding \u201cfive minutes alone, no holds barred\u201d with Premier League big cheese Richard Scudamore [if the Prem really wanted to offer us Friday night entertainment \u2026 - Fiver Ed]. A protracted legal battle ensued, which The Fiver can\u2019t delve into fully because \u2013 yes, just put it on the tab, please \u2013 it\u2019s, uh, a complicated business. In the end, West Ham agreed to pay Sheffield United \u00a321m in compensation, but the beef was well and truly set.</p> <p>On balance, did the Blades have the right to feel aggrieved? Yes. Would the whole thing have been avoided if they\u2019d beaten Plucky Wigan at home? Also yes. Either way, Friday night marks the Hammers\u2019 first trip to Bramall Lane since that infamous season. Chris Wilder and David Moyes have snarled their mutual respect at each other, and with both teams in the top flight again, perhaps the hatchet can finally be buried. At least until Moyes\u2019 new loan signing, the mysterious forward Tarlos Cevez, scores a last-gasp winner.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Tumaini Carayol for live minute-by-minute coverage of Sheffield United 3-2 West Ham at 8pm GMT.</a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cThese guys [points to Amazon cameraman], these guys are 24 hours.

A comprehensive 3-0 win over West Ham leaves Neil Warnock\u2019s merry band five points above the Hammers with four to play. Once the expected points deduction for the murky third-party signings of Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez kicks in, it\u2019ll all be over. Eh, what\u2019s that? Oh. West Ham get a hefty fine instead, and Tevez goes on to lead them to safety with four straight wins, including a victory at Old Trafford back when that was actually hard. And Sheffield United are going down. Warnock took the outcome with trademark good grace, stripping to the waist and demanding \u201cfive minutes alone, no holds barred\u201d with Premier League big cheese Richard Scudamore [if the Prem really wanted to offer us Friday night entertainment \u2026 - Fiver Ed]. A protracted legal battle ensued, which The Fiver can\u2019t delve into fully because \u2013 yes, just put it on the tab, please \u2013 it\u2019s, uh, a complicated business. In the end, West Ham agreed to pay Sheffield United \u00a321m in compensation, but the beef was well and truly set. On balance, did the Blades have the right to feel aggrieved? Yes. Would the whole thing have been avoided if they\u2019d beaten Plucky Wigan at home? Also yes. Either way, Friday night marks the Hammers\u2019 first trip to Bramall Lane since that infamous season. Chris Wilder and David Moyes have snarled their mutual respect at each other, and with both teams in the top flight again, perhaps the hatchet can finally be buried. At least until Moyes\u2019 new loan signing, the mysterious forward Tarlos Cevez, scores a last-gasp winner.

Tottenham\u2019s interest in Gedson Fernandes has West Ham blowing bubbles of frustration after they thought they had secured the Benfica midfielder on an 18-month loan deal only to find out he has been offered to Spurs.

But not many imagined Nadal and Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta would struggle so much in the deciding doubles before beating Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen 6-7 (7), 7-5, 10-7.</p> <p>\u201cIt was tough, not much time to adapt,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cThe conditions were very heavy, big humidity. To play the singles then the doubles is always difficult, but we\u2019re super happy to be in the semi-finals. We had the toughest situation possible in the cup, coming from Perth with the three-hour time change, finishing 1.10am, maybe not sleep before 4am. David played a great match. Better than me. I was suffering a lot physically today.\u201d</p> <p>If this was a classic night of struggle, controversy rumbles on elsewhere.</p> <p>Fans and drop-in critics shocked by the tantrums of Daniil Medvedev this week may have forgotten that his Russian team coach, Marat Safin, roamed tennis like a wounded tiger two decades ago. It\u2019s in the blood, as Safin used to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"330ea45da434914959dde79ce03b43bee059dbae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/330ea45da434914959dde79ce03b43bee059dbae/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic of Serbia in action against Canada\u2019s Denis Shapovalov in their quarter-final match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic of Serbia in action against Canada\u2019s Denis Shapovalov in their quarter-final match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Evans/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Relishing their match against Serbia, he spoke with the bellicose intent that drove him then and lingers still. After watching Djokovic fight through three sets to beat Denis Shapovalov and put Canada out, Safin was adamant Medvedev \u2013 who bashed his racket against the umpire\u2019s chair in a childish row during his match against Diego Schwartzman on Thursday - will catch the world No 2 off guard.</p> <p>Safin was top of the rankings at the turn of the millennium and beat Lleyton Hewitt to win the Australian Open in 2005; he would go on to survive several years in the Duma, which was probably tougher than anything he did on a tennis court. Recalled from the jungle of Russian politics for this new event at 39, he has clicked with his skinny doppelganger.</p> <p>Safin expects Karen Khachanov to beat Dusan Lajovic in the first match, piling pressure on Djokovic to keep Serbia in the tournament. Safin does not want the tie to go to a deciding doubles because he suspects Djokovic, like Nadal, would come to his country\u2019s rescue there.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough one, for sure,\u201d Safin said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for Karen to win that first match so he gives some confidence to Daniil. Obviously he\u2019ll have a chance \u2013 especially as Novak had the long match today [two hours and 40 minutes]. They are playing in the morning, so hopefully Novak will not recover well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey know each other [Djokovic prevailed in their first three matches but has lost to him twice since winning a tough four-setter at the 2019 Australian Open], how they play and the patterns of the game. One match against Shapovalov will not show [Medvedev] something extra. Plus, Shapovalov is a lefty; Novak is not going to serve and volley all the time. I think we can do it in the first two matches. I honestly believe so, even though Novak is Novak. I still believe that we will win in the two first matches, so we don\u2019t have to go into the doubles.\u201d</p> <p>In the closing quarter-final, Goffin, outsmarted by Dan Evans in straight sets this week, resisted a fierce comeback by Nadal.</p> <p>The tournament could hardly have wished for a better finish, with Nick Kyrgios hitting peak form for the home side and Nadal and Djokovic still in the frame. While Medvedev has been the tournament time bomb, Kyrgios has astounded those waiting for an explosion, but he surely is benefiting from a spell of half-decent behaviour during his ban, which runs out in March.</p> <p>Meanwhile Evans, who left Sydney for Adelaide after beating two top 20 players \u2013 Goffin and Alex de Minaur \u2013 in the space of a week, will go to the Australian Open seeded for the first time \u2013 but without a shirt sponsor. He did not look overly concerned. If Medvedev is the volcano of tennis, Evans surely is the placid lake.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is only so far any hero can carry his tribe. Yet after a weary Novak Djokovic and Serbia limped through the quarter-finals of the ATP Cup into Saturday\u2019s match against Russia, Rafael Nadal lost and won in the space of a few hours as Spain beat Belgium 2-1 to book an evening showdown with Australia. Neither will be easy. It is asking a lot for either the world No 1 or No 2 to reach Sunday\u2019s final of the inaugural 24-nation tournament, especially so close to the start of the Australian Open in Melbournea week later, but they will let nobody down. It was a minor rather than major shock that David Goffin beat Nadal 6-4, 7-6 (3), in the singles on Friday; his one win in five against the Spaniard arrived indoor on a hard court at the 2017 ATP World Tour Finals. But not many imagined Nadal and Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta would struggle so much in the deciding doubles before beating Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen 6-7 (7), 7-5, 10-7. \u201cIt was tough, not much time to adapt,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cThe conditions were very heavy, big humidity. To play the singles then the doubles is always difficult, but we\u2019re super happy to be in the semi-finals. We had the toughest situation possible in the cup, coming from Perth with the three-hour time change, finishing 1.10am, maybe not sleep before 4am. David played a great match. Better than me. I was suffering a lot physically today.\u201d If this was a classic night of struggle, controversy rumbles on elsewhere. Fans and drop-in critics shocked by the tantrums of Daniil Medvedev this week may have forgotten that his Russian team coach, Marat Safin, roamed tennis like a wounded tiger two decades ago. It\u2019s in the blood, as Safin used to say. Relishing their match against Serbia, he spoke with the bellicose intent that drove him then and lingers still. After watching Djokovic fight through three sets to beat Denis Shapovalov and put Canada out, Safin was adamant Medvedev \u2013 who bashed his racket against the umpire\u2019s chair in a childish row during his match against Diego Schwartzman on Thursday - will catch the world No 2 off guard. Safin was top of the rankings at the turn of the millennium and beat Lleyton Hewitt to win the Australian Open in 2005; he would go on to survive several years in the Duma, which was probably tougher than anything he did on a tennis court. Recalled from the jungle of Russian politics for this new event at 39, he has clicked with his skinny doppelganger. Safin expects Karen Khachanov to beat Dusan Lajovic in the first match, piling pressure on Djokovic to keep Serbia in the tournament. Safin does not want the tie to go to a deciding doubles because he suspects Djokovic, like Nadal, would come to his country\u2019s rescue there. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough one, for sure,\u201d Safin said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for Karen to win that first match so he gives some confidence to Daniil. Obviously he\u2019ll have a chance \u2013 especially as Novak had the long match today [two hours and 40 minutes]. They are playing in the morning, so hopefully Novak will not recover well. \u201cThey know each other [Djokovic prevailed in their first three matches but has lost to him twice since winning a tough four-setter at the 2019 Australian Open], how they play and the patterns of the game. One match against Shapovalov will not show [Medvedev] something extra. Plus, Shapovalov is a lefty; Novak is not going to serve and volley all the time. I think we can do it in the first two matches. I honestly believe so, even though Novak is Novak. I still believe that we will win in the two first matches, so we don\u2019t have to go into the doubles.\u201d In the closing quarter-final, Goffin, outsmarted by Dan Evans in straight sets this week, resisted a fierce comeback by Nadal. The tournament could hardly have wished for a better finish, with Nick Kyrgios hitting peak form for the home side and Nadal and Djokovic still in the frame. While Medvedev has been the tournament time bomb, Kyrgios has astounded those waiting for an explosion, but he surely is benefiting from a spell of half-decent behaviour during his ban, which runs out in March. Meanwhile Evans, who left Sydney for Adelaide after beating two top 20 players \u2013 Goffin and Alex de Minaur \u2013 in the space of a week, will go to the Australian Open seeded for the first time \u2013 but without a shirt sponsor. He did not look overly concerned. If Medvedev is the volcano of tennis, Evans surely is the placid lake.",

He said such judgments merely caused pain for the families of the bereaved, including many Iranians.</p> \n  <p>In an hour-long briefing, he also insisted that the Iranian government was allowing US government officials, as well as Boeing experts, to join the investigation in Tehran. He said: \u201cWe are fully committed to have a conclusive report on the reasons for the incident with experts on the ground from concerned countries.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But he said he was \u201cdisappointed that some countries including the UK, which do not have hard evidence without access to the black box, the voice recordings, airplane wreckage and the technical engineers reports in Tehran airport, are rushing to judgment. That only adds to the anxiety of the families.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said it was not true that the crash site was being bulldozed, although the bodies, including Iranians, may be being collected from the site. </p> \n  <p>Baeidinejad promised a full transparent and technical report, pointing out that Iran wanted to know the cause of the crash as much as any other country. He added that the black box and voice recordings would now be available to the experts, saying some media reporting about refusing to give others access to the box was based on unsubstantiated claims.</p> \n  <p>He insisted no Iranian missile was triggered at the time the Ukrainian plane was taking off from the airport around 6am, adding that Tehran\u2019s safety and security authorities were capable of distinguishing between a military and civilian aircraft. \u201cThe speed and height of a passenger airline is quite different from a missile or a fighter jet,\u201d he claimed. He said the Iranian radar could distinguish any threat in the air.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe plane was only 5 minutes in the air at 8,000 feet, and had requested permission to go to more than 20,000 feet.

being followed closely in Germany. Three of the victims of the Ukraine airlines crash were German citizens, including Paniz Soltani, a 29-year-old scientist of Iranian-German citizenship, who worked at the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, and a 30-year-old woman of German-Afghan nationality and her children, eight and five, from the state of North Rhine Westphalia. </p> \n  <p>The national airline, Lufthansa, has cancelled all flights to and from Tehran until further notice. On Thursday night it ordered a plane from Frankfurt to Tehran to turn back as reports emerged that the crash had been caused by an Iranian missile. A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said: \u201cLufthansa flights from and to Teheran have been cancelled as a precaution.\u201d She did not say when the ban would be lifted.</p> \n  <p>The German government, keen to keep alive the fragile Iran nuclear deal framework, has been cautious not to be seen to support what is widely viewed in Germany as the Trump administration\u2019s belligerent and provocative approach towards Iran after the killing of Quassem Suleimani. But Heiko Mass, the German foreign minister, has said the death was hardly surprising given that Suleimani \u201chas drawn a trail of blood and violence throughout the Middle East\u201d. It was for that reason that he was on the EU\u2019s terrorist list, he said.</p> \n  <p>But critics in Germany who fear the government has taken a hitherto over-friendly stance towards Iran, have said the government should be looking closer to home, voicing concern over the influence of supporters loyal to the current Iranian regime living in Germany.<br></p> \n  <p>In particular, attention is being focused on a mosque in Hamburg where worshippers have been gathering in the past few days to publicly mourn the death of Suleimani. </p> \n  <p>The Imam Ali Mosque situated on the Alster river in the northern port city held a memorial service, as it stated: \u201cin honour of Suleimani and the nine additional victims\u201d of the US drone attack, last Sunday as well as holding subsequent events to mourn his passing. </p> \n  <p>Reporting on the services, Der Spiegel said that Hamburg\u2019s Social Democrat-Green coalition government has been urged by critics from the Christian Democrats, the pro-business FDP and the rightwing populist AfD, to cease its six-year state cooperation with the IZH, the Islamic Centre of Hamburg, which is responsible for the running of the mosque, amid concern over its growing political influence.</p> \n  <p>The public homage being paid to Suleimani, says Spiegel, \u201cis acting like dynamite in the debate about the correct way to deal with political Islam in Germany\u201d. But the Hamburg senate has said it has no plans to break the cooperation, which it claimed \u201coffers important chances for the development of the relationship between the city and the Islamic communities and as a whole for the better integration of Muslims\u201d. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T14:29:46.798Z\">at 2.29pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e185f8c8f085eda5c1157fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T11:30:15.504Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Elizabeth Palmer from CBS News has tweeted this picture of the crash site.

You can follow today\u2019s US reaction to the crash, including Trump\u2019s new sanctions against Iran in our US politics blog. Here\u2019s a summary of key events today. Thanks for following along. A UK expert raised serious concerns over the integrity of the crash site. Photographs taken the day of the crash showed heavy machinery being used to move larger pieces of debris. Graham Braithwaite said: \u201cWhere you have flight recorders that tell you what has happened you can move quickly to clearing the site. But if the recorders are damaged [as the Iranians have said] then all you have is the forensic evidence at the site to tell you the story.\u201d Hamid Baeidinejad, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, urged the west \u2013 including the UK \u2013 to stop politicising the inquiry into the Ukraine plane crash by rushing to premature judgment about its causes without hard evidence. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said he and the Ukrainian president had met US embassy officials and obtained important data about the plane crash. Earlier in the day, Volodomir Zelenskiy said he was not ruling out the possibility that the plane was shot down and again called for \u201call international partners\u201d the US, Britain and Canada in particular to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. French experts will play a role in the investigation into the Ukrainian International Airlines crash, officials said. Britain\u2019s ambassador to Iran said UK travel advice to Iran has changed and all British nationals are advised against all travel there. The advice adds: \u201cIf you\u2019re in Iran, you should review your departure options and consider leaving the country.\u201d Iranian officials have rejected western intelligence assessments that the Ukrainian airliner was shot down accidentally by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile. A spokesman for the Iranian government went on to blame what he described as a \u201cUS psychological operation\u201d. Graham Braithwaite, professor of safety and accident investigation at Cranfield University, has said the Iranian handling of the crash site, including the apparent quick removal of evidence, raised \u201cserious concerns over the integrity of the investigation\u201d. \u201cWhere you have flight recorders that tell you what has happened you can move quickly to clearing the site,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the recorders are damaged [as the Iranians have said] then all you have is the forensic evidence at the site to tell you the story.\u201d Photographs taken the day of the crash showed heavy machinery being used to move larger pieces of debris. Iranian media outlets also published several photos and videos of the wide field of wreckage and personal belongings left by the crash. It was unclear whether the removal of the debris was done in accordance with crash-investigations procedures to ensure important evidence is preserved. Braithwaite, who teaches a course in air accident investigations, said he was surprised that the Iranians had moved to clear the crash site before other interested parties, including Ukrainian, Canadian and other technical investigators had been able to make their own examination, which he said he would have been expected under annex 13 of the Chicago convention, the international agreement that sets out protocols for crash inquiries. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met to discuss the plane crash this afternoon. A US statement said Pompeo offered the Ukrainian leader \u201ccondolences and full assistance in the ongoing investigation\u201d into the crash of the jetliner. Zelenskiy\u2019s office said he briefed Pompeo about the progress in the probe, and they agreed the US politician would visit Ukraine later this month. \u201cGrateful for the condolences of the American people and valuable support of the US in investigating the causes of the plane crash,\u201d Zelenskiy tweeted after the call. \u201cData from the United States contains important information to help with the investigation.\u201d Sweden\u2019s transport agency has temporarily halted Iran Air flights between Sweden and Iran after the crash of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran. \u201cThe reason is the uncertainty around the accident and the security of civil aviation,\u201d the agency said in a statement reported by Reuters. Seven Swedish citizens and 17 people who lived in the country died in the crash. Iranian officials gave a press conference on Friday giving more details of their investigation and continuing to rebuff allegations the Ukrainian aircraft was shot down. \u201cIf [intelligence agencies] have findings with scientific support they should show this to the world,\u201d Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation, told reporters. He said he had watched a video clip purporting to show the plane being hit by a missile before crashing to the ground but said \u201cthis cannot be confirmed from a scientific perspective\u201d. He said the pilot had been in contact with the control tower two minutes before the accident, asking if he could ascend to 26,000 feet. After the fire broke out, the crew would have been consumed with \u201csaving the plane\u201d, he said, and so would not have been able to communicate further to explain what had gone wrong. \u201cWe have to look for the cause of the fire,\u201d Abedzadeh said. Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the committee that oversees aviation accidents in Iran, said that contrary to earlier claims that the black boxes appeared to have been damaged by the crash, both appeared to be intact. \u201cWe prefer to extract the data and download the data inside the country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we come to the conclusion that the data may be damaged then we will carry out the process [overseas].\u201d Investigators would attempt to extract and analyse the black box data on Friday, he added, but said the findings might take one or two months to be released. Hamid Baeidinejad, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, has urged the west \u2013 including the UK \u2013 to stop politicising the inquiry into the Ukraine plane crash by rushing to premature judgment about its causes without hard evidence. He said such judgments merely caused pain for the families of the bereaved, including many Iranians. In an hour-long briefing, he also insisted that the Iranian government was allowing US government officials, as well as Boeing experts, to join the investigation in Tehran. He said: \u201cWe are fully committed to have a conclusive report on the reasons for the incident with experts on the ground from concerned countries.\u201d But he said he was \u201cdisappointed that some countries including the UK, which do not have hard evidence without access to the black box, the voice recordings, airplane wreckage and the technical engineers reports in Tehran airport, are rushing to judgment. That only adds to the anxiety of the families.\u201d He said it was not true that the crash site was being bulldozed, although the bodies, including Iranians, may be being collected from the site. Baeidinejad promised a full transparent and technical report, pointing out that Iran wanted to know the cause of the crash as much as any other country. He added that the black box and voice recordings would now be available to the experts, saying some media reporting about refusing to give others access to the box was based on unsubstantiated claims. He insisted no Iranian missile was triggered at the time the Ukrainian plane was taking off from the airport around 6am, adding that Tehran\u2019s safety and security authorities were capable of distinguishing between a military and civilian aircraft. \u201cThe speed and height of a passenger airline is quite different from a missile or a fighter jet,\u201d he claimed. He said the Iranian radar could distinguish any threat in the air. \u201cThe plane was only 5 minutes in the air at 8,000 feet, and had requested permission to go to more than 20,000 feet. Our experts have announced that the plane was suffering a fire for more than a minute.\u201d The Tass news agency has reported that one of Russia\u2019s deputy foreign ministers, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow had no grounds to blame Iran for the crash of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran, contradicting statements by Canada\u2019s prime minister and others. Ryabkov called on senior world officials to refrain from public statements until more details were known about the causes of the crash. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa airline says it and subsidiaries are cancelling flights to and from Tehran for the next 10 days as a precautionary measure, the Associated Press is reporting. The airline said the decision was due to the \u201cunclear security situation\u201d for the airspace around Tehran airport after the crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752. Other airlines have been making changes to avoid Iranian airspace. Alitalia, which hasn\u2019t had flights to Iran since December 2018, says its flights to New Delhi and the Maldives were using alternate routes to those that usually fly over Iran and Iraq. The investigative journalism website Bellingcat is responding to reports that the site of the plane crash is being cleared by bulldozers by compiling an interactive map of the scene, using pictures and videos shared online. Here\u2019s a useful visual guide to what we know about the crashing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752: Boris Johnson has spoken to the Swedish prime minister Stefan L\u00f6fven and issued the following statement \u2013 The prime minister spoke to Prime Minister L\u00f6vfen of Sweden. The leaders expressed condolences to all those who lost loved ones on the Ukraine International Airlines flight \u2013 including from the UK and Sweden. They agreed that there must now be a full, transparent investigation and committed to work closely together and with other international partners to ensure the families of the victims get the answers they deserve. They also underlined the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh [Isis] and urgent de-escalation in the region. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, has said on Twitter that he and the Ukrainian president had met US embassy officials and obtained important data about the plane crash. Prystaiko gave no further details but said the data would be \u201cprocessed by our specialists\u201d. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, is due to discuss the investigation with Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, this afternoon. The Iran crisis is being followed closely in Germany. Three of the victims of the Ukraine airlines crash were German citizens, including Paniz Soltani, a 29-year-old scientist of Iranian-German citizenship, who worked at the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, and a 30-year-old woman of German-Afghan nationality and her children, eight and five, from the state of North Rhine Westphalia. The national airline, Lufthansa, has cancelled all flights to and from Tehran until further notice. On Thursday night it ordered a plane from Frankfurt to Tehran to turn back as reports emerged that the crash had been caused by an Iranian missile. A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said: \u201cLufthansa flights from and to Teheran have been cancelled as a precaution.\u201d She did not say when the ban would be lifted. The German government, keen to keep alive the fragile Iran nuclear deal framework, has been cautious not to be seen to support what is widely viewed in Germany as the Trump administration\u2019s belligerent and provocative approach towards Iran after the killing of Quassem Suleimani. But Heiko Mass, the German foreign minister, has said the death was hardly surprising given that Suleimani \u201chas drawn a trail of blood and violence throughout the Middle East\u201d. It was for that reason that he was on the EU\u2019s terrorist list, he said. But critics in Germany who fear the government has taken a hitherto over-friendly stance towards Iran, have said the government should be looking closer to home, voicing concern over the influence of supporters loyal to the current Iranian regime living in Germany. In particular, attention is being focused on a mosque in Hamburg where worshippers have been gathering in the past few days to publicly mourn the death of Suleimani. The Imam Ali Mosque situated on the Alster river in the northern port city held a memorial service, as it stated: \u201cin honour of Suleimani and the nine additional victims\u201d of the US drone attack, last Sunday as well as holding subsequent events to mourn his passing. Reporting on the services, Der Spiegel said that Hamburg\u2019s Social Democrat-Green coalition government has been urged by critics from the Christian Democrats, the pro-business FDP and the rightwing populist AfD, to cease its six-year state cooperation with the IZH, the Islamic Centre of Hamburg, which is responsible for the running of the mosque, amid concern over its growing political influence. The public homage being paid to Suleimani, says Spiegel, \u201cis acting like dynamite in the debate about the correct way to deal with political Islam in Germany\u201d. But the Hamburg senate has said it has no plans to break the cooperation, which it claimed \u201coffers important chances for the development of the relationship between the city and the Islamic communities and as a whole for the better integration of Muslims\u201d. Elizabeth Palmer from CBS News has tweeted this picture of the crash site. She says most of the wreckage has been cleared away and there is no security at the site. Hamed Esmaeilion, whose wife and daughter were killed in the Iran plane crash (see this earlier post), has shared this video of 9-year-old Reera Esmaeilion playing the piano. The head of Iran\u2019s civil aviation body has told reporters that authorities are examining the contents of flight 752\u2019s black box today at a laboratory at Tehran\u2019s Mehrabad airport. The will attempt to assess whether it is possible to reconstruct and analyse the information inside the country, according to Iran\u2019s Irna news agency. A British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran has had panic attacks since tensions between the country and the US escalated, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe said the fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was taking a toll on the mental health of his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained since 2016 after she was arrested on espionage charges and jailed for five years. She is among up to five people with dual British-Iranian nationality, or with UK connections, believed to be in prison in Iran. Their families have said they are being held as collateral and that the heightened tensions have made it harder to secure their release. Iraq\u2019s top Shia Muslim cleric has condemned mutual US and Iranian attacks on Iraqi soil and warned of deteriorating security in the country and wider region as a result of Washington\u2019s standoff with Tehran. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said the attacks were a violation of sovereignty and that no foreign powers should be allowed to decide Iraq\u2019s fate. Sistani delivered his message through a representative who spoke at Friday prayer in the holy city of Kerbala, Reuters reported. \u201cThe use of over-the-top methods by different sides which possess power and influence ... will only entrench the crisis and prevent a solution,\u201d the representative said. \u201cThe latest dangerous aggressive acts, which are repeated violations of Iraqi sovereignty, are a part of the deteriorating situation [in the region].\u201d Canada is \u201cpaying for past decisions\u201d \u2013 namely a decision by Canada\u2019s previous Conservative administration to sever ties with Tehran and upheld by Justin Trudeau\u2019s government \u2013 asserts a piece in the Toronto Star. Like other news outlets in Canada, which was the end destination of 138 people on the Ukraine International Airlines flight, the Star leads with developments including the news that Canada\u2019s federal transportation safety agency has accepted an invitation from Iran to send officials to the site. But the newspaper adds that without an official relationship, Canada must rely on Italy to secure applications and coordinate diplomacy with Tehran. The perception that the threat of war in the middle east has receded caused oil to slip towards $65 a barrel today as investors also focused on rising US inventories. Crude is now below where it was before a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani on 3 January. For more on that, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff is running a business liveblog here. France\u2019s BEA air accident agency has said it would be involved in the investigation into a Ukrainian airliner crash in Iran. \u201cWe have been notified of the event by Iran and we have designated an accredited representative to the safety investigation,\u201d a BEA spokesman said. \u201cNo further assistance has been requested at this point in time,\u201d he added. Airstrikes carried out by unidentified planes in the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor overnight killed at least eight members of an Iranian-backed militia, according to monitors. Several planes targeted positions belonging to the Iraqi Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary group in Bukamal, near the border with Iraq, in the early hours of Friday, both local media and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The attack, which occurs against the backdrop of soaring tensions across the region between the US and Iran, was most likely carried out by Israel, Iraqi officials said, without offering evidence. Israel regularly carries out airstrikes inside Syria targeting Iranian assets but does not normally comment on its military activity in the neighbouring nine-year-old civil war. The same area was also targeted by the US on 29 December in strikes which killed 25 members of a pro-Iran Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah in retaliation for a rocket attack on a military base in Iraq that killed a US military contractor as tensions escalated between Washington and Tehran over the last two weeks. Weapons depots and vehicles were targeted, causing several huge explosions, the UK-based Observatory said. Deir Ezzor 24 and Sound and Pictures, activist collectives in the area, also said the planes had struck trucks carrying weapons and depots for ballistic missiles near the town. The area struck Friday is a key land corridor for Tehran that links Iran across Iraq and Syria through Lebanon. Britain\u2019s ambassador to Iran has been on Twitter pointing out that UK travel advice to Iran has changed and all British nationals are advised against all travel there. The advice adds: \u201cIf you\u2019re in Iran, you should review your departure options and consider leaving the country.\u201d In Germany, Lufthansa has confirmed that one of its flight to Tehran was ordered yesterday to turn back to Germany, amid security concerns, after the emergence of the missile attack allegations. It followed the airline\u2019s lifting of a flight ban to Tehran-bound aircraft, after one day. Iran continues to deny the assessments of western intelligence agencies that its force shot down the Ukrainian passenger jet in the tense early hours on Wednesday morning. Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation, said overnight: \u201cAt the time this plane was in the air, there were several other internal and international flights flying at 8000 feet and the suggestion it was targeted by a missile cannot be correct.\u201d Flight records show there was some domestic traffic around the same time at the Mehrabad Airport, about 35km north-east of Imam Khomeini International airport. Flight records available online show there were no other flights landing or taking off from Imam Khomeini International airport around the same as the Ukrainian plane was in flight. Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the committee that oversees aviation accidents in Iran, said \u201cnowhere in the world\u201d would it be possible to determine the cause of a crash this soon. \u201cNot only haven\u2019t we found evidence to prove the claim [of a missile strike] but we\u2019ve found evidence to reject it,\u201d he said, likely referring to claims by Iranian investigators that the Ukrainian flight attempted to turn around and return to the airport before it went down. He said he was open to international involvement in the probe, including American, but added - likely in reference to sanctions that prevent US involvement with Iran - that they \u201cshould get the authority from their Senate\u201d. The terrible human tragedy at the centre of the incident is laid bare in reports which are detailing how the flight was carrying entire families, university students, and a young couple who had traveled back to Iran for their wedding. Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gourji, 25, who were graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta, had gone to Iran for their wedding, according to Reza Akbari, president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton. They were on the plane with four members of their wedding party and 24 other Iranian-Canadians from Edmonton, Akbari said. \u201cOh God, I can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Akbari told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to the whole community.\u201d Borna Ghotbi, a close friend of the newlyweds since they were all undergraduates at Tehran\u2019s Sharif University, said their wedding took place three days ago. Another couple, Siavash Ghafouri Azar and Sara Mamani, had also just married in Iran, according to a Montreal university professor who taught Azar. The couple, both engineers, had just bought a house in a Montreal suburb. Negar Mortazavi, Iranian-American journalist, has tweeted this interview with Hamed Esmaeilion, whose wife Parisa and their daughter Reera were killed in the crash. France has said this morning that it is ready to join the investigating into the crash of a Ukrainian airliner. \u201cIt is important that as much clarity as possible is made and as quickly as possible,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was quoted by Reuters as saying. Last year, the French agency BEA helped analyse data from the flight recorder of a crashed Boeing plane in Ethiopia. In a Facebook post this morning the Ukrainian president says he is not ruling out the possibility that the plane which crashed earlier this week in Iran had been hit a by a missile. \u201cThe missile theory is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet,\u201d Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in the post. Zelenskiy reiterated his call for \u201call international partners\u201d the U.S., Britain and Canada in particular to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. The head of Iran\u2019s investigation team into the plane crash has told state television that Tehran will use expert help from Russia, Ukraine, France and Canada if we cannot recover data from the plane\u2019s recorders. Hassan Rezaeifar said today that recovering the data could take more than one month and the entire investigation into the crash could take more than one year. He also said the flight had been delayed by about an hour because the pilot decided to unload part of the luggage as the flight was overweight. It\u2019s believed the US system that detected the missile launches that brought down the Ukrainian passenger jet is the Space Based Infrared System, a network of around ten satellites operated by the US Air Force\u2019s Space Command first launched in 2011. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Beaumont adds that the system was designed specifically to detect launches of missiles, including missile tests by countries like North Korea, and relies on detecting the infrared end of the spectrum. Specifically the system is designed to be able to detect strategic and short range ballistic missile launches, determine their flight trajectory, and provide a location for where the missile will hit, pretty much what the US and its allies are claiming. Oleksandr Danylyuk, the former head of Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the US side should have enough intelligence in the region to be back up assertions that the flight was shot down. He added: \u201cIt looked very suspicious early. It was a relatively new plane with very experienced crew. What I was very suspicious about was that quite quickly from the Iranian side there was a position that it was not a terrorist attack or shooting down but a technical failure.\u201d The investigative journalism website Bellingcat has geolocated the location of one of a number of videos that have emerged showing the moment of a possible missile strike on the plane. The video - which posted onto a public Telegram channel - has been geolocated to a residential area in Parand (coordinates 35.489414, 50.906917), a suburb to the west of Imam Khomeini International Airport, according to the website. Bellingcat notes that it is unclear why the person holding the camera was filming at the time, but it was possible that there were two missiles. A number of media outlets report that Iran had turned on its missile defence system to protect itself after it fired 22 missiles at American bases in Iraq in retaliation for the US killing last week in Iraq of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The system, however, mistook Flight 752 for a threat and shot it down, Newsweek reports, quoting a senior US intelligence official. US media outlets have also quoted officials saying their satellites had identified the signature of an Iranian anti-aircraft battery being activated shortly before the aircraft went down a few minutes after taking off at 6.13am on Wednesday morning. The US officials said they had identified infrared signals from two suspected missiles, followed shortly afterwards by an infrared blip from the burning aircraft. Public suspicions that the Boeing 737-800 may have accidentally been shot down had grown throughout Thursday based on images circulating on social media showing what appeared to be missile debris that was purportedly photographed near the crash site. Iranian officials have rejected the western intelligence assessments. \u201cScientifically, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane, and such rumours are illogical,\u201d said Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s of Civil Aviation Organisation. A spokesman for the Iranian government, Ali Rabiei, went on in a statement today to blame what he described as a \u201cUS psychological operation.\u201d Iran\u2019s Press TV quotes him as saying: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the psychological operation of the US government, and those supporting it knowingly and unknowingly, are adding insult to the injury of the bereaved families and victimising them for certain goals by propagating such fallacies,\u201d the senior Iranian official pointed out. Meanwhile, a new video has emerged which appears to show the moment a Ukrainian passenger jet was shot down in Iran. Originally obtained by the New York Times, the phone footage shows a tiny spec suddenly exploding. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has vowed to find answers over crash that killed 176 people, including 63 Canadians, and has also cited intelligence reports casting the incident in a new light. \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cCanadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice.\u201d Western agencies are understood to have picked up signals of the missile launches followed by the traces of an explosion. A British source told the Guardian: \u201cThe assessment is that it looks like it is a tragic accident.\u201d In a statement on Thursday night, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \u201cThere is now a body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. This may well have been unintentional. We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog coverage of the terrible loss of life after a Ukrainian passenger aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran - and the new development in the form of claims by western security officials that it was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile. Intelligence have sources told the Guardian their assessments suggest two surface-to-air missiles had targeted the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 that went down in Iran on Wednesday morning, killing all 176 people onboard. Iran was inviting experts from Boeing, the jetliner\u2019s manufacturer, to join the investigation into the crash, the Iranian official news agency IRNA said on Friday, while the US National Transportation Safety Board said it had received \u201cformal notification\u201d of the crash from Iran and had designated a representative to the crash inquiry. On Friday morning the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on \u201cinternational partners\u201d to share any information they had on the crash. Zelenskiy also said he would discuss the investigation with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo later on Friday. \u201cThe version about a missile hitting a plane is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet,\u201d Zelenskiy said on Facebook. \u201cGiven the recent statements by the leaders of the states in the media, we call on all international partners - notably the governments of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom - to submit data and evidence concerning the disaster to the commission which investigates the causes.\u201d You can reach here here on Twitter if you want to flag up news developments on this.",

      "bodyText": "Detectives are investigating new allegations against the most persistent rapist in legal history amid an unprecedented increase in male victims contacting helplines to report sexual abuse. Greater Manchester police said on Friday they had received a \u201csignificant number\u201d of calls to a dedicated major incident hotline launched after the sentencing of Reynhard Sinaga on Monday. The force declined to reveal how many potential new victims had come forward but said it would \u201cfully investigate all reports\u201d as part of its ongoing inquiry into the 36-year-old. Sinaga, a PhD student originally from Indonesia, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison after being convicted of 159 counts of rape or sexual assault against 48 men between January 2015 and June 2017. A small team of five police officers and four specially trained support officers have been manning a dedicated hotline set up in the expectation that dozens more possible victims of Sinaga will come forward. Police believe the former university student attacked at least 195 victims, including the 48 whose cases were brought to court, over a period that could stretch back to 2007, when he first arrived in the UK. Detectives will seek to interview Sinaga at Strangeways prison in Manchester if the investigation into any potential new offences progresses to that stage. He has never spoken to professionals during his two years in custody on the advice of his legal team, meaning the true scale of his offending remains unclear. While the police investigation continues, the worldwide coverage of the case has prompted a flood of male victims to contact helplines about sexual abuse they have suffered \u2013 many breaking their silence after decades. The charity Safeline said it had seen a 500% increase in calls to its national hotline for male survivors of sexual abuse since Sinaga\u2019s sentencing on Monday \u2013 the biggest rise in its history. Neil Henderson, its chief executive, said the huge increase in contacts this week compared with a 300-400% rise following the football abuse scandal in 2016. Survivors Manchester, the charity supporting several of Sinaga\u2019s victims, said it had also experienced a rise in the number of people seeking help, from an average of two a day usually to 57 new referrals between Monday and Friday morning. Duncan Craig, its founder, described the case as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the perception of male rape. He said it had bust \u201cthe myth\u201d that rape only happened to gay men and started a national conversation about men opening up about sexual abuse. \u201cWhat it\u2019s done inadvertently is open a window of opportunity to male survivors which they\u2019re now jumping through,\u201d he said. Craig, a trained therapist, said there now needed to be a wider discussion about how night-time safety campaigns were always aimed at women, when they applied equally to men. \u201cThe whole world effectively is talking about how it\u2019s possible for men to be raped, how we need to talk about safety and rethink messaging,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen pubs and clubs and alcohol campaigns are often talking about be careful of your drink it\u2019s always aimed at women, but maybe we need to start having a wider conversation.\u201d Sinaga posed as a \u201cgood samaritan\u201d to lure his intoxicated victims back to his flat in Manchester city centre, where he would spike their drink and sexually abuse them when they passed out, filming the whole encounter on two mobile phones. All but four of the men he assaulted were raped.",

To this end, it is consulting on proposals that include closing up to 14 libraries, including the withdrawal of support from four community-managed sites, or reducing opening hours across the board.

The latest figures from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy show that almost 800 libraries have closed since 2010, with 3,583 library branches still open in the UK \u2013 773 fewer than a decade ago.

Hampshire county council\u2019s consultation, which closes on 18 March, says that its future vision for libraries is focused on promoting reading, \u201csupporting healthy, creative communities\u201d, and investing in digital services.

Last month Edward Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing\u2019s 737 factory in Renton, Washington, told Congress he had witnessed \u201cchaos\u201d at the factory where the Max was built and had warned management that \u201cBoeing was prioritizing production speed over quality and safety\u201d. His warnings were ignored. Lawmakers also heard the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Boeing\u2019s regulator, allowed the Max to keep flying even after its own analysis found the plane could have averaged one fatal crash about every two or three years without intervention. That decision came a month after the Lion Air crash in October 2018 that claimed 189 lives, and four months before an Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed another 157 people.

Prince Harry and Meghan said the announcement came after \u201cmany months of reflection and internal discussions\u201d.</p> <p>They had already formally departed from the charity set up by Prince William and Harry a decade ago and the couple\u2019s new foundation was due to be launched this year. More discreet steps were also taken last summer in the form of applications to trademark their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/advisers-applied-for-sussex-royal-trademark-in-summer\">brand \u201cSussex Royal\u201d</a> for a range of goods and activities.</p> <p>However, the scale and form of the Sussexes\u2019 initiative appears to have left Buckingham Palace reeling, particularly as the couple <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/duke-and-duchess-of-sussex-defied-queen-over-statement-release\">did not consult the Queen</a> or Prince Charles before releasing their statement.</p> <h2><strong>What does it mean for the future of the monarchy and the Sussexes\u2019 titles?</strong></h2> <p>Nothing, for now. Harry will remain sixth in line to the throne while there is no indication that his status and that of his wife will change.</p> <p>However, scenarios have been floated in which that could change, either as a result of actions by the palace or by the couple themselves. There have been calls in some quarters for the couple to be stripped of their titles, although memories of the public reaction to the way in which Harry\u2019s mother lost her title after her divorce from Prince Charles would surely weigh heavily on the palace.</p> <h2><strong>Will the taxpayer continue to contribute towards the Sussexes\u2019 upkeep?</strong></h2> <p>On their website, Harry and Meghan say they will no longer receive funding through the sovereign grant, \u201cthereby making them members of the royal family with financial independence\u201d.</p> <p>But while the couple say that grant only provides 5% of their income \u2013 a claim which royal aides have contested in off-the-record briefings this week \u2013 it also remains unclear whether they will give up their other sources of funding.</p> <p>The Prince of Wales would turn off the taps on his funding of Harry and Meghan if they step away from their royal duties, according to a report in the Times.

However, only senior royals tend to get police protection, so the role of the taxpayer in this regard is likely to become a matter of debate.

Harry inherited an estimated \u00a320m from his mother, and about \u00a37m from his great-grandmother. Meghan\u2019s net worth has been put at about \u00a34m, having earned \u00a337,000 per episode as an actor in the legal drama Suits.</p> <p>The North American market appears to be at the fore of the couple\u2019s plans. Their new online presence appears to have been masterminded by a digital creative agency in Toronto, where Meghan lived when filming Suits.</p> <p>Obvious sources of future income include the sale of Sussex Royal trade marked items ranging from clothing to stationery, book deals and public speaking appearances at events for which the couple could command six-figure sums.</p> <h2><strong>Who is advising the</strong><strong>m?</strong></h2> <p>Key figures include Sara Latham, the couple\u2019s communications secretary who worked for the Clintons in the US, and Natalie Campbell, who last year became their director of insight and innovation after moving from her role as an aide to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.</p> <p>Other figures now associated with Harry and Meghan include recently appointed directors of their foundation.

Meghan\u2019s net worth has been put at about \u00a34m, having earned \u00a337,000 per episode as an actor in the legal drama Suits. The North American market appears to be at the fore of the couple\u2019s plans. Their new online presence appears to have been masterminded by a digital creative agency in Toronto, where Meghan lived when filming Suits. Obvious sources of future income include the sale of Sussex Royal trade marked items ranging from clothing to stationery, book deals and public speaking appearances at events for which the couple could command six-figure sums. Who is advising them? Key figures include Sara Latham, the couple\u2019s communications secretary who worked for the Clintons in the US, and Natalie Campbell, who last year became their director of insight and innovation after moving from her role as an aide to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Other figures now associated with Harry and Meghan include recently appointed directors of their foundation. These include Stefan Paul Allesch-Taylor, a financier behind a number of coffee brands, as well as the entrepreneur Steven Cooper, the former Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young and the media executive Karen Blackett. In the legal realm \u2013 where the couple are taking action against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday after the newspaper published a handwritten letter Meghan had sent to her estranged father \u2013 they have recruited the services of the London-based libel specialists Schillings. What has been the role and reaction of the Queen? While Meghan has gone to Canada with the couple\u2019s son, Archie, the head of state is reported to have asked staff to find a \u201cworkable solution\u201d and has been in contact with Charles and William. However, in what was interpreted last month as a hint of a rift, Royal watchers keenly noted that the Queen failed to include a photo of Harry, Meghan or Archie at her desk during her pre-recorded Christmas Day speech. A potentially interesting future flashpoint could come, say experts, if the Queen refuses to give consent to the use of \u201cRoyal\u201d in future trademark applications by the couple. What impact have the events of this week had on public opinion? A poll of 1,327 Britons found that 45% supported the Sussexes\u2019 decision to step away from royal life but almost two-thirds (63%) believed their Duchy of Cornwall funding should end. In what is likely to be a disappointment to republicans, the survey of 1,320 adults by YouGov found that almost half of people do not think it will have an impact on the wider reputation of the royal family. A total of 49% of people questioned thought the decision would not have an effect, compared with 32% who think it will. Prince Harry is ranked by YouGov as the UK\u2019s second most popular royal, after the Queen and just ahead of his brother, while Meghan is ranked as number eight. Are there any precedents for what the Sussexes are doing? The Earl and Countess of Wessex ran into difficulties as they attempted to combine royal duties with their business interests in television and public relations after the Queen\u2019s youngest child and his wife were accused of cashing in on their status. Sophie Wessex was hit in a tabloid newspaper sting in 2001, when she was recorded making comments about the royals and senior politicians in a pitch for business, while the following year she and her husband quit their business interests to focus on royal duties. Some have likened this week\u2019s events to the abdication crisis of 1936, with Meghan being compared to another US divorcee and supposed disrupter of the royal order, Wallis Simpson. At a time when it was considered that the British public would never accept Simpson as Queen, Edward VIII had to choose between her and the throne, eventually opting to relinquish all royal duties. By contrast, Harry and Meghan plan to continue with duties and are not backed into the same type of corner as Edward was. What happens next? Talks and more talks.

      "bodyText": "The way we treat the most vulnerable people is a test of who we are, what kind of country we hope to live in and what humanity we have. The most vulnerable people imaginable are lone refugee children. I\u2019ve visited the camps in Greece and Calais, where I have met many children without families. Some are in refugee camps, but others live rough, in woods, on the streets or even on rubbish tips, with some support from NGOs. I can think of little more frightening than to be a child in a foreign country with no family, unable to speak the language, sleeping rough. We know that thousands of these children have simply disappeared. Others are threatened and abused, or worse. They are often fleeing war, and may have witnessed horrors, torture and the destruction of their communities. If they are not traumatised when they leave their homes, then they certainly are in the aftermath. When I have met them in the camps or in the streets, I have seen that for these children, trauma is almost a universal experience. A small proportion of these refugee children hope to come to the UK because this is the only safe country where they have family. They have a connection here \u2013 perhaps the only relations they have. As members of the EU, we are part of the Dublin regulation, which allows lone children within the EU to apply for legal family reunion with relatives elsewhere within the EU. So, for example, a Syrian orphan who arrives in Greece hoping to find an uncle in Birmingham has the right to apply to be reunited with him. But when we leave the EU, we will no longer be covered by the Dublin regulation. When Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal bill was going through parliament, I brought an amendment in the Lords that received cross-party support in both houses. This obliged the government to negotiate that the terms of the Dublin regulation would continue after we left the EU. So when the latest withdrawal bill was published just before Christmas, it was a shock to see that the rights of refugee children to be reunited with their families here had been removed. There had been no mention of this in the Conservative manifesto. Boris Johnson\u2019s withdrawal bill, which passed the Commons unamended on Thursday, leaves the children whose rights have been removed with no means of finding their family in the UK \u2013 other than using illegal traffickers or other dangerous routes. The Lords will be debating the withdrawal bill in the coming week and a half, and I will be bringing an amendment to return the original rights to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable children. Among my Conservative colleagues, I sense there is sympathy for the view that there is no moral justification for preventing family reunion. It seems the government is concerned that my amendment may pass the Lords. If this happens, then the bill will return to the Commons. Public support will be crucial if the Commons is to support the Lords amendment.

When I arrived in Britain as an unaccompanied refugee child fleeing the Nazis, I never thought I would end up in the Lords. But this country not only allowed me a life and gave me sanctuary, it also gave me opportunity. I certainly never imagined that 81 years later, in the same country that gave homes to 10,000 lone refugee children like me, I\u2019d be fighting for just a few hundred to be allowed to find their families here. \u2022 Alf Dubs is a Labour peer and former MP \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

I am the bold choice to put up against Boris Johnson and it\u2019s going to take bold to beat Boris Johnson.\u201d We\u2019ve been at the forefront of fighting for women\u2019s rights and we always seem to just fall at this hurdle. With Keir Starmer now the favourite in the competition, having got the biggest chunk of MP nominations and the backing of Unison, Phillips also made the case that it was time for the next Labour leader to be a woman. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at the forefront of fighting for women\u2019s rights and we always seem to just fall at this hurdle,\u201d she said. Phillips conceded it was a big step up from being a backbencher but said she was \u201cas ready as much as anyone\u2019s ever ready\u201d for the task. \u201cAnyone who says they\u2019re not daunted by it is arrogant, doesn\u2019t deserve the job and doesn\u2019t understand the weight of responsibility\u201d. As for putting together a shadow cabinet, Phillips said she would have a broad range of people from across the party who had backed different candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t give a toss actually which faction people have been in, because I\u2019ve been put in one that I\u2019m not in,\u201d she said, referring again to the idea that she is on the right of the party. \u2018\u201cI\u2019ve never been part of any of these Labour groups, that everybody\u2019s part of. I\u2019m from the Labour party.\u201d",

It was the fourth profit warning for Superdry in less than a year and followed tough Christmas trading Disappointing data came out of the US, with US non-farm payrolls coming in at 145K compared to forecasts for 164K. The employment rate remained steady at 3.5% But the biggest worry surrounded wage growth, which fell below 3% for the first time since 2018 However, that did not stop US markets from hitting fresh record highs at the open That\u2019s all from us this week. Have a lovely weekend and see you Monday - KM And in lighter news, the co-founder of digital bank Monzo has quit to pursue an alternative career: farming alpacas in Northumberland. In an announcement on his LinkedIn page, Paul Rippon announced that after 27 years in financial services he and his wife will be farming full-time. With no farming background or experience we now have over 300 alpacas and welcome many visitors to our farm and holiday cottages. For the next few weeks and months I\u2019m going to enjoy some time with Debbie at our wonderful farm in Northumberland. You\u2019ll find me doing the feed rounds, hosting alpaca walk \u2019n\u2019 talks and driving my tractor (a Massey Ferguson 390T if you like that sort of thing - otherwise it\u2019s big and red!). Sometime after April 2020 I plan to spend a day a week doing non-executive, consulting or coaching; the rest of the time will be reserved for Debbie, our alpaca farm and enjoying life. Even poor job and wage growth figures couldn\u2019t hold back US stocks, resulting in all three major indices hitting fresh record highs at the open. The Dow has hit 28,988.01 and we\u2019re still waiting for it to rise above 29,000 for the first time. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.2% to 3,281.18 The NASDAQ is up 0.3% at 9,233.90 The proof is in the chart: here you can see how US annual wage growth has held up above 3% between summer 2018 and November 2019. The FT (\u00a3) caught on to a notable statistic: this first time that US wage growth has dropped below 3% since July 2018. For those of you who saw the earlier tweet, it\u2019s now been revised. (I\u2019ve deleted the previous version in the blog to avoid confusion...) Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank, says the biggest question arising from the US December jobs figures is why wage growth is slowing: The disappointing jobs figures appear to have dimmed excitement about a potential new record for the Dow, which some have said could push above 29,000 for the first time today. US stock futures have pared their gains: Dow futures are now flat S&amp;P 500 futures are now up about 0.1% Sam Cooper, a vice president at Silicon Valley Bank, comments on the US non-farm payrolls report: Today\u2019s underwhelming report will inject some life into relatively quiet markets as the headline jobs number narrowly missed expectations and wage growth also disappointed. While participants appear to be focused on trade and geopolitical tensions, the disappointing data will be a concern for participants sitting on large dollar balances and could put the brakes on the momentum behind a strengthening dollar. The surprise will likely spur some additional volatility to an already nervous GBP-USD however is unlikely to effect the long term view of the Federal Reserve who appear content with the current state of the labour market. More details on US jobs figures: The unemployment rate has remained steady at 3.5%, which is in line with forecasts. But average earnings have risen year-on-year by 2.9% though that is lower than estimates for a 3.1% rise. US non-farm payrolls have come in at 145k for the month of December. That compares to a Reuters poll forecasting 164k and November\u2019s tally, which has been revised down from 266k to 256k. Less than 30 minutes until US non-farm payrolls, which are forecast to come in around 164K, according to consensus figures from Refinitiv. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, warns that a weak reading for US jobs could result in a quick response from the Federal Reserve and could spark a drop in the value of the dollar: Remember last month a blowout jobs number sent equities higher along with the US dollar and Treasury yields, as it suggested the US economy was doing better than many corners of the market feared. The headline print was miles ahead of expectations, coming in at 266k vs 180k expected. Unemployment at 3.5% was exceptionally strong, too. September was revised up 13k to 193k, while October was also revised higher by 28k to 156k. Private payrolls also very strong at 254k. Should we worry about the Fed pivoting again? I don\u2019t think so and the market clearly thinks the same. The Fed can stand this sort of hot reading for a while yet \u2013 jobs growth is averaging only 180k this year vs 223k last year. And whatever privately you might think about whether the Fed should be maintaining an easing bias in this environment, it\u2019s made it very clear that it will take a sustained and pronounced rise in inflation to warrant a hike. The Fed has made it clear it will let inflation and the economy run hot, so today\u2019s numbers can\u2019t really miss as far as equities are concerned. A weak reading only raises prospect of quicker policy response and may lead to the USD handing back some of the recent gains. The FTSE 100 appears to be losing some of its shine and is just holding its head above water, up just 0.1%. Some of the stocks dragging on the index include: Kingfisher down -2.6% Mondi down -2.5% Lloyds Banking Group down -2.3% J Sainsbury down -2% Sainsbury\u2019s decline comes after discount supermarket Lidl emerged as one of the winners of the Christmas shopping season, logging an 11% rise in total sales over the 4 weeks to 29 December. Earlier this week, Sainsbury\u2019s said like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) slipped 0.7% in the 15 weeks to 4 January. Mondi, the paper and packaging firm announced this morning that its chief excutive Peter Oswald is stepping down after just three years in the role, but did not disclose the reason for his departure. The industry has suffered a drop in demand for paper including newsprint, but is also producing more packaging for parcels for online shopping deliveries. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says US unemployment is expected to hold at a 50-year low of 3.5% for December: The mood is muted this morning as traders await the US non-farm payrolls report at 1.30pm (UK time). The consensus estimate is that 164,000 jobs were added last month, which would be a decent number, but keep in mind that 266,000 jobs were added in November. The unemployment rate is at a joint 50-year low of 3.5%, and it is tipped to hold steady. Average earnings are expected to remain at 3.1%. It is clear the US labour market is in rude health, so the wages component will be of extra importance as realistically, the jobless rate is unlikely to fall much more without a rise in the earnings reading. If companies are struggling to fill vacancies they might have to offer higher wages to attract potential workers. A solid earnings reading should bode well for the economy as people who earn more tend to spend more \u2013 which drives the economy along. Boeing shares are up 0.19% in premarket trading despite fury over internal messages released by the company that have raised questions about its development of the 737 Max. That model was grounded in March following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. Instant messages dating back to April 2017 showed two employees complaining that \u201cThis airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.\u201d The FT (\u00a3) has pulled out a few more damning quotes suggested staff may have been trying to cover up problems from the regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration. \u201cI still haven\u2019t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year,\u201d an employee said in a 2018 message. Another from the same year said they were not sure \u201cif I will be returning in April given this \u2014 am not lying to the FAA. Will leave that to people who have no integrity.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that is not acceptable,\u201d another employee responded. \u201cYour integrity is priority 4.\u201d Members of the US Congress have called the messages \u201cincredibly damning\u201d: Bank of England ratesetter Silvana Tenreyro has signalled that she would be prepared to cut interest rates soon if recent weakness in the British economy amid Brexit uncertainty persists. Speaking at an event held by the Resolution Foundation in London, the member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee says there are some reasons for optimism since the general election, but that she sees plenty of reasons for caution too, and that the risks are \u201clargely to the downside.\u2019\u2019 \u201cIf uncertainty over the future trading arrangement or subdued global growth continued to weigh on UK demand then my inclination is towards voting for a cut in bank rate in the near term,\u201d she says. Her comments come after Mark Carney indicated on Thursday that the Bank could cut rates if necessary. Tenreyro says unless there are any signs of a pick-up in the jobs market soon, weaker wage growth will mean inflation in Britain should remain below the Bank\u2019s 2% target rate set by the government - another big hint that interest rates are more likely to be cut than raised. Though the jobs market starts the year in relatively reasonable health, she adds: \u201cThe labour market will probably not tighten further and is now showing some signs of softening.\u201d Oil prices have retreated to levels last seen before Christmas. Following US strikes which killed Qassem Suleimani last week, Brent crude prices climbed above $70 for the first time in four months. But with fears over a potential disruption to supplies due to rising fears of conflict between Washington and Beijing now subsiding, we\u2019re now back to around $65 per barrel. The Dow Jones Industrial Average could break above 29,000 for the first time today. That\u2019s the forecast by Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group. He says markets are \u201cthrowing caution to the wind\u201d when it come to the US and Iran, though the tragic downing of the Ukrainian plane over Iran could end up being another \u201cflashpoint.\u201d But with attention now turning to the US-China trade pact, we could be in for another day of record highs for US equities: US President Donald Trump has said the US- China trade deal is to be signed January 15. The direct benefits of more amicable relations between the US and China are plain to see in reports of rising iPhone sales in China and new record highs for the Apple share price. Apple is leading the charge taking the Dow Jones above 29,000 for the first time. Of course other factors like seasonality and new model releases play into it, but the easing of widely-reported anti-US sentiment in China against Apple because of the trade war is important. An update has been issued on the winding up of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. Its administrator Link Fund Solutions says BlackRock has raised around \u00a31.9bn through the sale of assets, which represents around 63% of the value of the total fund. (Woodford\u2019s flagship fund, once worth more than \u00a310bn, fell below \u00a33bn as investors rushed to withdraw their money after a series of poorly performing stock picks, last year) Park Hill is in charge of a separate portfolio of less liquid assets. No update has been issued on that part of the fund, except to say that Link continues to work with the firm to \u201cexplore opportunities for the sale of assets within Portfolio B.\u201d Link has also notified investors that there will be a 10 day delay in paying returns to investors, with the date moving from 20 January to 30 January: This change to the timetable is required to ensure that investors retain exposure to the equity market for the entire period prior to the Fund being wound up as required by the regulations. This delay also allows a significant portion of the Fund\u2019s holdings in money market instruments to be liquidated in a way that minimises costs to the Fund. You can read the full investor update here. That is unlikely to spur excitement among investors who heard that former star stockpicker Neil Woodford and his business partner pocketed \u00a313.8m in dividends from their investment management company last year. Last month 300,000 investors were told they had lost nearly a fifth of their money and that selling the remaining assets was proving more difficult than expected. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK says the de-escalation in the Middle East has allowed traders to re-focus on positive news around next week\u2019s signing of the US-China trade pact (at least the first phase of it...) They say a week is a long time in politics, and this week it\u2019s also been true for financial markets, given some of the hyperbolic talk of World War Three that was doing the rounds early on Monday morning. In the space of a few days we appear to have swung full circle; with investors seemingly convinced that the problems in the Middle East appear to have settled down, at least for the time being. While that seems a big assumption to make it would need a significant escalation now for the current rebound to come full circle, and while it would be unwise to rule that out, investors have been rotating into gold as a precaution, in addition to buying back into stocks, just in case. Hewson added: With this week\u2019s geopolitical risk subsiding as we head towards the weekend, investors now have the opportunity to focus on the signing of the signing of the new US, China phase one trade deal next week, as well as the health of the US economy today, and in particular the labour market which has continued to look resilient. Grim news for fashion brands Superdry and Joules, which have plunged 22% and 33% respectively. Both retailers issued profit warnings today, saying earnings would be below expectations after tough Christmas trading. Superdry now expects to make between between nil and \u00a310m for the year, against City forecasts of around \u00a320m. It is the fourth profit warning for Superdry is less than a year. Joules, meanwhile, warned that annual pretax profits would be \u201csignificantly below expectations. Analysts had pegged at \u00a317.3m, up from \u00a315.5m a year earlier. Airlines are leading the UK markets after Ryanair upped its forecast, following a busier-than-expected Christmas and New Year travel period. Ryanair shares are up 8.5% on the news which also lifted competitors to the top of the FTSE 100: EasyJet is up 5.6% while British Airways owner IAG is up 4.4%. Ryanair said it expects to carry a million more passengers across the year than the 153m it had forecast, thanks to strong forward bookings for the January to April period, which are up 1% year-on-year. \u201cOn the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the mid-point of this new range,\u201d the company said. European stocks are on the up, having taken their cues from the geopolitical relief rally that sent US and Asian shares higher overnight: FTSE 100: up 0.3% German DAX: up 0.3% French CAC 40: up 0.2% Spain\u2019s IBEX: up 0.3% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A lot has changed in a week, especially across global markets. Stocks have continued to rebound as fears around a fresh military conflict in the Middle East started to subside. Markets have welcomes signs that US president Donald Trump is unlikely to take further action after Iran retaliated against the US for the assassination of top Iranian military official Qassem Suleimani last week. Iran went on to launch more than a dozen missiles at Iraqi bases hosting US and coalition troops on Wednesday, but neither side is believed to be planning additional attacks. It caused a relief rally across equity markets and sent US stocks to new record highs in yesterday\u2019s session, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 0.67% overnight. Asian stocks also climbed higher overnight, with the Nikkei 225 up 0.47% and the Australian ASX jumping 1.38%. European shares are set to follow suit. Global authorities are now trying to discern the cause of a plane crash over Iranian airspace on Wednesday. While western security officials believe the Ukrainian passenger was shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile, killing all 176 people on board, markets do not seem to be forecasting any military response from western powers. Markets are also looking ahead to the signing of the first phase of a US-China trade pact next week that should also ease fears around the tit-for-tat tariff war between Washington and Beijing. This afternoon, all eyes will be US jobs numbers, with forecasts for US non-farm payrolls for December at 160k down from 266k in November. Stay tuned! The agenda 1.30pm: US non-farm payrolls, US unemployment, and US average earnings for December",

      "body": "<p>When I woke up on Friday last week in Isfahan, the third largest city in Iran, I found my older sister standing beside my bed looking at me in silence. I saw fear in her eyes. Earlier, Qassem Suleimani had been assassinated by US forces in Baghdad. I could easily imagine what my sister was thinking: she has two sons in their 20s. I had seen the same fear in her before. During the 1980s her husband spent several years at the front during the Iran-Iraq war. She did not know for months whether he was alive or dead. Now she is worried that her sons will experience what their father did before them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>As my sister showed, the initial reaction of many in Iran to the assassination was silence.

My relatives and friends mockingly said that I was leaving them behind to deal with a war for the second time in my life. The first was in 1987, when I escaped the country while the war with Iraq raged. This week I heard references to that time everywhere \u2013 in taxis, on buses, in coffee shops, bookstores, and small villages. In the eyes of many, a new war with the US would be a continuation of that conflict. People have not forgotten how the US armed and supported Saddam Hussein.</p> \n<p>But, as my sister showed, the initial reaction of many to the assassination was silence. They could not believe it. At newspaper stands men and women, young and old, stared quietly at pictures of Suleimani on the front pages of newspapers, from the hardline Kayhan to reform-oriented Sharq. For the first time in a long time I was unable to detect any difference between them. The limited political pluralism in the media had faded away.</p> \n<p>A few days before the assassination, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had declared that there would not be a war with the US, and President Rouhani announced a willingness for negotiations with the west. There were glimmers of hope. The Iranian stock market improved. By last Saturday morning, though, the first day of the week in Iran, that hope had been replaced with fear. The stock market plunged, and Iran\u2019s currency lost value. The shock had barely subsided when President Trump threatened to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/donald-trump-vows-to-hit-52-sites-very-hard-if-iran-retaliates-for-suleimani-killing\" title=\"\">attack cultural sites</a> in Iran.

Suleimani in particular had become an icon of patriotism. Even those who oppose the Iranian regime respect him. While corruption scandals involving high-level officials are a daily occurrence, Suleimani was regarded as one of the few who still \u201cstruggled for the people\u201d. He embodied the revolutionary ideals of 1979. Huge crowds attended several days of processions in Ahvaz, where he fought against Saddam\u2019s army, and in Mashhad and Kerman (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/general-qassam-suleimani-obituary\" title=\"\">his birthplace</a>), where he fought against drug traffickers along the eastern borders. </p> \n<p>In the small village in south-western Iran where I grew up, middle-aged men praised him as the general who kept Islamic State away from Iranian territory. However, their fear of war was intense as well. Some of them did their military service during the Iran-Iraq war. One was gravely injured by a chemical weapon, another lost a foot, and another one suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. They have seen how wars break bodies and souls.

      "bodyText": "Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer has narrowly qualified for next week\u2019s key debate in Iowa after polls in the early voting states of Nevada and South Carolina showed a surprise surge in support. Steyer, a San Francisco-based billionaire investor whose candidacy has languished in polls near the bottom of a narrowing Democratic field, came in second place with 15% in South Carolina and tied with the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren in third place at 12% in Nevada. In both polls, conducted by Fox News, Steyer trailed the former vice-president Joe Biden, who stood at 23% in South Carolina and 36% in Nevada. Steyer qualified for the Iowa debate next week under what is called the early-state polling method where candidates must get 5% support in at least four national or early-state polls, or 7% support in at least two early-state polls. He will now join Biden, the former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, and the US senators Amy Klobuchar, Sanders and Warren at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday for the first debate of the 2020 election year and the the last before voting begins in Iowa. Self-financing former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg will not make the stage. Under Democratic party rules, candidates must show, in addition to polling support, at least 225,000 unique donors across a minimum of 20 states. The New Jersey senator Cory Booker is also ruled out after failing to meet the polling threshold. Steyer, who is running on platform that places emphasis on the climate crisis, has barely risen above the low single digits in previous polls. But his Fox poll does not appear to be an aberration; a poll by Morning Consult showed Steyer at 10% combined across four early voting states. Political pundits pointed to Steyer\u2019s heavy spending in the two states for the surge. According to the Los Angeles Times, Steyer spent $47m during the first three months of his presidential bid, making his campaign one of the largest self-funding political candidates in American history. \u201cI don\u2019t think these Steyer numbers are a mistake,\u201d the NBC political correspondent Steve Kornacki said on Twitter. \u201cRemember, we\u2019ve had basically no polling out of NV and SC and for months now he\u2019s been spending a fortune in both while the other candidates focus on IA and NH. He\u2019s had the run of the place.\u201d",

around him in disarray, this Renaissance man signals defeat and sweet despair. He is poised though broken, stylish despite his unconcealed weakness. Behind him is a classical building whose decay mirrors his own. The colours make this a painted answer to a Shakespeare sonnet, in their subtle, pensive feeling: black hose, a mustard jacket, silvery chain mail and stained grey marble weave a delicate atmosphere of muted regret. Yet he is proud. His ruddy face is disdainful, his sword long and phallically straight. Even with his armour off and his bad leg, this warrior is not finished yet. He has been identified as Conte Faustino Avogadro of Brescia, and that\u2019s a maybe. Above all, he is one of the most enigmatic characters in the history of portraiture.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/giovanni-battista-moroni-a-knight-with-his-jousting-helmet\">National Gallery, London</a>.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t forget</h2> <p>To follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gdnartanddesign?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@GdnArtandDesign</a>.</p> <h2>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</h2> <p>If you don\u2019t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email\">please sign up here</a>.</p>",

Image of the week Imamzadeh Helal Ali holy shrine, Aran, Iran In a grotesque echo of past desecrations by the Taliban and Isis, President Trump threatened to bomb 52 of Iran\u2019s incomparable cultural and historical treasures if the country retaliated to America\u2019s assassination of Revolutionary Guard general Qassem Suleimani last week. Iran\u2019s position in one of the cradles of civilisation has left it with unprecedented riches: glittering mosques, holy shrines, capitals of past civilisations including Persepolis, wondrous bridges, a Christian cathedral and the tomb of Biblical hero Daniel. But other US leaders \u2013 including Trump\u2019s secretary of state and defence secretary \u2013 sought quickly to defuse the president\u2019s comments, while commentators denounced the threat as an overture to war crimes.

      "bodyText": "The obsessive focus of Boris Johnson\u2019s advisers on shaking up Whitehall reinforces the failed belief that all the answers lie in better central government. If they really want the UK to be the most dynamic state in the world and to \u201clevel up\u201d the most deprived areas, they need to devolve power away from London. There is good evidence that decentralised countries have stronger growth and better public services \u2013 and even the Treasury recognises that the UK is one of the most centralised states in the world. Instead of poking at the problem with a few grudging concessions negotiated through city deals, ministers need to give local government the decision-making and tax-raising powers it needs to make a difference. That would be the fastest route to \u201clevelling up\u201d and beginning to tackle endemic problems such as skills shortages, low productivity and poor public transport. The signals about how Whitehall will be reformed have been mixed. The growing expectation that the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, will be staying for the foreseeable future rather than becoming ambassador to Washington provides experience and continuity at the top. Plans to merge the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office \u2013 despite Boris Johnson claiming as foreign secretary that separating them in the 1990s was a \u201ccolossal mistake\u201d \u2013 look to have been abandoned, avoiding a serious distraction irrelevant to voters and with doubtful benefits. A separate borders and immigration department may still happen. But the pincer movement on the civil service by Rachel Wolf \u2013 who played a key role in drafting the Conservative manifesto \u2013 and Dominic Cummings reveals a determination to force through radical change.

Of course government needs more of these sorts of skills, but many, if not most, policy failures are rooted in bad politics, not bad administration or advice. Coachloads of data analysts and project managers will not solve the social care or housing crises unless there is the political will to do so. Cultural change across a workforce of more than 400,000 \u2013 such as Sedwill\u2019s aim of better cross-government working \u2013 will always be a long, hard slog.

Now the absence of previously prominent security sentries afford this once state-of-the-art complex a slightly neglected, semi-deserted air. With no one staffing main reception, the building\u2019s plate glass front doors are locked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/07/sunderland-fans-ire-owner-stewart-donald-sell-club\">Sunderland address fans\u2019 ire by saying Stewart Donald is trying to sell club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almost three years after dropping out of English football\u2019s top tier, and deep into the second season of an unwanted League One sojourn, the effects of some brutal cost-cutting are clearly apparent. It would, though, be very wrong to assume Sunderland is an uncared-for club.</p> <p>Instead it provokes such powerful emotions that recent weeks have witnessed the eruption of an ugly civil war between supporters and the board, with the manager, Phil Parkinson, briefly threatening to become collateral damage before results improved and fans began arguing among themselves.</p> <p>The learner\u2019s clutch control appears infinitely less jerky than the recently chaotic, and highly charged, manoeuvres at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light.</p> <p>To understand the events that prefaced the hostile fallout from a disappointing home draw with Bolton on Boxing Day, it is necessary to rewind to May 2018 when Stewart Donald, previously the owner of non-league Eastleigh, bought Sunderland from the American billionaire Ellis Short following two successive relegations. Donald\u2019s initial plan involved an immediate return to the Championship before attracting the sort of large-scale investment he, personally, could not provide. Instead Jack Ross narrowly missed out on promotion and was sacked last October. Parkinson has since steered Sunderland, six-times English champions, to a historic nadir: mid-table in the third tier.</p> <p>Matters boiled over on Boxing Day when calls for the former Bradford and Bolton manager\u2019s head were augmented by a sometimes uneasy, social media-fuelled amalgam of various fans groups demanding Donald go too.

      "bodyText": "It is a wet, windy Thursday lunchtime at Sunderland\u2019s training ground and nervous eyes rest on a learner driver honing their reversing skills in the players\u2019 car park. Back in the not-so-distant days when the Academy of Light was a Premier League practice base, littered with Porsches and Bentleys, such a cameo would have been unthinkable. Now the absence of previously prominent security sentries afford this once state-of-the-art complex a slightly neglected, semi-deserted air. With no one staffing main reception, the building\u2019s plate glass front doors are locked. Almost three years after dropping out of English football\u2019s top tier, and deep into the second season of an unwanted League One sojourn, the effects of some brutal cost-cutting are clearly apparent. It would, though, be very wrong to assume Sunderland is an uncared-for club. Instead it provokes such powerful emotions that recent weeks have witnessed the eruption of an ugly civil war between supporters and the board, with the manager, Phil Parkinson, briefly threatening to become collateral damage before results improved and fans began arguing among themselves. The learner\u2019s clutch control appears infinitely less jerky than the recently chaotic, and highly charged, manoeuvres at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light. To understand the events that prefaced the hostile fallout from a disappointing home draw with Bolton on Boxing Day, it is necessary to rewind to May 2018 when Stewart Donald, previously the owner of non-league Eastleigh, bought Sunderland from the American billionaire Ellis Short following two successive relegations. Donald\u2019s initial plan involved an immediate return to the Championship before attracting the sort of large-scale investment he, personally, could not provide. Instead Jack Ross narrowly missed out on promotion and was sacked last October. Parkinson has since steered Sunderland, six-times English champions, to a historic nadir: mid-table in the third tier. Matters boiled over on Boxing Day when calls for the former Bradford and Bolton manager\u2019s head were augmented by a sometimes uneasy, social media-fuelled amalgam of various fans groups demanding Donald go too. This coalition swiftly issued a formal statement demanding he sell up. Considering Donald has spent much of the past nine months actively, openly and forlornly attempting to find a buyer it seemed academic but he took the hint and, on Monday, issued an emotional club bulletin reiterating his intentions to depart. As reaffirmations go it all appeared a bit bizarre. If appeasement was the aim it arguably merely deflected yet more pressure on to Parkinson\u2019s team at a time when they are unbeaten in five games and within touching distance of a play-off place before Saturday\u2019s home game against high-flying Wycombe. Accordingly social media was soon ablaze with supporters arguing the case for \u201cDonald In\u201d, at least in the short-term. A restorative win against Lincoln had apparently softened hearts and minds towards Parkinson, while possibly reprising memories of Donald\u2019s Wearside honeymoon when he drank with fans after joining them in replacing sun-bleached plastic seats at the Stadium of Light. As their Newcastle counterparts discovered with Mike Ashley, owners who share beers with supporters can have clay feet but, by Thursday, the mood had mellowed to the point where the coalition issued a second, reconciliatory \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019 statement. It seems an owner who has tended to communicate directly with supporters\u2019 leaders rather than through local reporters had made some reconnections and a tense, fragile rapprochement was reached. Significantly any sale would be complicated by Sunderland\u2019s \u00a39m loan from a group of American investors, FPP, linked closely to Michael Dell of Dell computers. Donald acknowledges that, should he default on repayment, FPP will assume control of Sunderland. More immediately the loan \u2013 which Donald says he can repay \u2013 should help Parkinson reinforce the squad this month, with Sheffield United\u2019s Billy Sharp among his attacking targets. \u201cWe wondered what might happen when the owner made his statement but football clubs aren\u2019t easy to sell and nothing will be done overnight,\u201d says Parkinson, addressing a sparsely filled media room. \u201cThe chairman\u2019s said that although he\u2019s willing to sell, he\u2019s still 100% committed to helping us.

It is too much of an unknown quantity for an unreserved recommendation here.</p> <p>Sadly, 2019 was the year of failing energy companies. The regulator, Ofgem, has measures in place to protect customers if their supplier fails, however, plenty of Money readers reported big problems last year trying to resolve billing disputes, and getting balances owed after their supplier collapsed.</p> <p>It all means switchers may want to stick to suppliers that have been in business for some time and have an established track record.</p> <p>Joe Malinowski, the founder of<a href=\"https://www.theenergyshop.com/\"> TheEnergyShop.com</a>, says the fact that the big five energy suppliers have been fighting back with cut-price fixed energy deals is \u201ca great opportunity for consumers\u201d.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cSeasonally, energy prices rise over the winter months, so now is a great time to lock in a low price in case they do.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to check the new supplier and avoid getting sucked into cut-price deals from small suppliers that ask for several payments in advance.\u201d</p> <p><em>* As ever, households should do an <a href=\"https://www.energyhelpline.com/guardianmoneydeals?utm_source=gdnwb&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=energy-editorial&amp;CMP_TU=bmmcr&amp;CMP_BUNIT=moneydeals\">energy comparison</a> to check the best deal in their area, for their consumption.

This comes with 100% renewable electricity and a fixed price for 12 months,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing to smaller suppliers, savings of \u00a3350 a year can be found for a typical home, though the suppliers offering them can be rather unknown quantities; these deals are more for those who are happy to take a bigger saving for a larger service-quality risk.\u201d Utility Point is the first point of call for those buying on price alone. However, its cheapest deals do not offer 100% green electricity, and while it has a reasonable service rating, its website arguably is not as good as rivals. Crucially, they have been around for a while and do answer the phone \u2013 a rare thing among smaller suppliers. Readers who want the very cheapest green deal should look at People\u2019s Energy Company\u2019s winter 19 tariff v2, although be aware it requires customers to pay two months upfront. It is too much of an unknown quantity for an unreserved recommendation here. Sadly, 2019 was the year of failing energy companies. The regulator, Ofgem, has measures in place to protect customers if their supplier fails, however, plenty of Money readers reported big problems last year trying to resolve billing disputes, and getting balances owed after their supplier collapsed. It all means switchers may want to stick to suppliers that have been in business for some time and have an established track record. Joe Malinowski, the founder of TheEnergyShop.com, says the fact that the big five energy suppliers have been fighting back with cut-price fixed energy deals is \u201ca great opportunity for consumers\u201d. He adds: \u201cSeasonally, energy prices rise over the winter months, so now is a great time to lock in a low price in case they do. \u201cIt is important to check the new supplier and avoid getting sucked into cut-price deals from small suppliers that ask for several payments in advance.\u201d * As ever, households should do an energy comparison to check the best deal in their area, for their consumption. Just remember to click on all available products \u2013 not just the deals that the site earns a commission for switching you to. You may want to stick to firms you have heard of or, at least, researched.",

But impeachable relative to what? Many presidents have committed impeachable offences in office \u2013 whether Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/463613/irs-political-weapon\" title=\"\">IRS auditing</a> of political opponents, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/iran-contra-affair\" title=\"\">Iran-Contra scandal</a>, or George W Bush\u2019s lying to ignite the Iraq war (a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-pelosi-impressive-impeach-bush-wolf-blitzer-interview-cnn-a9252716.html\" title=\"\">2008 CNN interview</a> has been making the rounds, in which the civilian Trump expresses disappointment that Pelosi did not try harder to impeach Bush for the Iraq war).</p> \n<p>These comparisons make Democratic claims that to not impeach Trump would effectively mean shredding the constitution seem more than a little over-heated. However much constitutional obligation may appear to necessitate impeachment, in the end it is always a political choice.</p> \n<p>The irony is that Trump is now impatient for his own Senate trial to start, which he reasonably expects will bring the public more to his side. During the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings, Trump\u2019s approval ratings <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/271691/trump-approval-inches-support-impeachment-dips.aspx\" title=\"\">rose six points</a>. McConnell has not so much as bothered with the usual lip service about conducting an impartial trial. On 12 December, <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/republican-senator-disturbed-by-mcconnell-pledge-to-coordinate-with-white-house-over-impeachment-trial-2019-12-26\" title=\"\">he told Fox News</a>, \u201cWe\u2019ll be working through this process, hopefully in a fairly short period of time, in total coordination with the White House counsel\u2019s office.\u201d On 3 January, he made the case on the Senate floor that the authors of the US constitution had always intended impeachment to be a deeply political affair, which is why they designated the Senate to try presidents instead of the judiciary. Pelosi, sensing the depth of the opposition, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/07/trump-articles-of-impeachment-senate-trial-pelosi-strategy\" title=\"\">delayed sending the articles of impeachment</a> to the Senate, which has raised the legal question of whether Trump has in fact been impeached at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a63165223fa7fa086ff62197710405b97ab8689e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a63165223fa7fa086ff62197710405b97ab8689e/0_16_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mitch McConnell, the Republican senate majority leader\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mitch McConnell, the Republican senate majority leader, has not so much as bothered with the usual lip service about conducting an impartial trial.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Either way, the circling tactic appears doomed to fail. Even if they are armed with court orders to make crucial witnesses appear, the Democrats cannot deny Trump his favourite resource \u2013 sensational television \u2013 for much longer without wearying the public\u2019s patience and taking the sting out of their original intent to remove him.</p> \n<p>In 2001, the historian Perry Anderson <a href=\"https://newleftreview.org/issues/II8/articles/perry-anderson-us-elections-testing-formula-two\" title=\"\">argued</a> that critics of US empire should have embraced the impeachment of Bill Clinton: any body blow against the imperial presidency was surely something good for the rest of the world. Today, liberals and legal scholars argue that impeachment will at least weaken the forward march of Trumpism, much as Clinton\u2019s impeachment supposedly hobbled his chosen successor, Al Gore. The trouble is that the impeachment of Clinton resulted in the opposite of presidential impairment: his approval reached an all-time postwar high of 73% during his Senate trial.</p> \n<p>Like Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/02/afghanistan.terrorism3\" title=\"\">bombing of a pharmaceutical factory</a> in Sudan in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Trump may have diverted some attention away from his impeachment with the assassination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/03/donald-trump-qassem-suleimani-haunt-quds-iran\" title=\"\">Qassem Suleimani</a>. Yet this impeachable offence \u2013 engaging in an act of war without Congress\u2019s approval \u2013 is unlikely to be added to Trump\u2019s bill of offences. The presidency has accrued war powers at a rate since 9/11 that only accelerated under Obama. It would now take sweeping congressional legislation to reverse the tide. In the absence of this political will, Pelosi and the Democrats have proposed an emergency bill to make any Trump-led war on Iran only slightly more difficult.</p> \n<p>Trump may not enjoy a popularity bump like Clinton\u2019s during his own Senate carnival, even with McConnell as ringmaster. But however much less mystique Americans attach to their presidents since Nixon and Clinton, the office still retains an aura. For the Democrats to set themselves against it, instead of concentrating their fire on an electoral victory in November, could further inflate the executive. Their best chance for cutting the imperial presidency down to size is for them to back a presidential challenger who is dedicated to the cause of restoring Congress\u2019s war powers.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Thomas Meaney is a fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, Washington DC</p>",

Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, seemed to provide all the ingredients that the soup of the Mueller report lacked: a Mafioso-style quid-pro-quo; a tampering with the US electoral process during, as opposed to before, Trump\u2019s presidency; and, on top of it all, the irresistible charge of cold war vintage that Trump \u2013 with his consideration of delaying the delivery of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kiev \u2013 was endangering national security by not sufficiently escalating tensions with Russia. There is little question that Trump committed an impeachable offence by encouraging the Ukrainians to publicise an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine. But impeachable relative to what? Many presidents have committed impeachable offences in office \u2013 whether Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s IRS auditing of political opponents, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush\u2019s Iran-Contra scandal, or George W Bush\u2019s lying to ignite the Iraq war (a 2008 CNN interview has been making the rounds, in which the civilian Trump expresses disappointment that Pelosi did not try harder to impeach Bush for the Iraq war). These comparisons make Democratic claims that to not impeach Trump would effectively mean shredding the constitution seem more than a little over-heated. However much constitutional obligation may appear to necessitate impeachment, in the end it is always a political choice. The irony is that Trump is now impatient for his own Senate trial to start, which he reasonably expects will bring the public more to his side. During the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings, Trump\u2019s approval ratings rose six points. McConnell has not so much as bothered with the usual lip service about conducting an impartial trial. On 12 December, he told Fox News, \u201cWe\u2019ll be working through this process, hopefully in a fairly short period of time, in total coordination with the White House counsel\u2019s office.\u201d On 3 January, he made the case on the Senate floor that the authors of the US constitution had always intended impeachment to be a deeply political affair, which is why they designated the Senate to try presidents instead of the judiciary. Pelosi, sensing the depth of the opposition, has delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, which has raised the legal question of whether Trump has in fact been impeached at all. Either way, the circling tactic appears doomed to fail. Even if they are armed with court orders to make crucial witnesses appear, the Democrats cannot deny Trump his favourite resource \u2013 sensational television \u2013 for much longer without wearying the public\u2019s patience and taking the sting out of their original intent to remove him. In 2001, the historian Perry Anderson argued that critics of US empire should have embraced the impeachment of Bill Clinton: any body blow against the imperial presidency was surely something good for the rest of the world. Today, liberals and legal scholars argue that impeachment will at least weaken the forward march of Trumpism, much as Clinton\u2019s impeachment supposedly hobbled his chosen successor, Al Gore. The trouble is that the impeachment of Clinton resulted in the opposite of presidential impairment: his approval reached an all-time postwar high of 73% during his Senate trial. Like Clinton\u2019s bombing of a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Trump may have diverted some attention away from his impeachment with the assassination of Qassem Suleimani. Yet this impeachable offence \u2013 engaging in an act of war without Congress\u2019s approval \u2013 is unlikely to be added to Trump\u2019s bill of offences. The presidency has accrued war powers at a rate since 9/11 that only accelerated under Obama. It would now take sweeping congressional legislation to reverse the tide. In the absence of this political will, Pelosi and the Democrats have proposed an emergency bill to make any Trump-led war on Iran only slightly more difficult. Trump may not enjoy a popularity bump like Clinton\u2019s during his own Senate carnival, even with McConnell as ringmaster. But however much less mystique Americans attach to their presidents since Nixon and Clinton, the office still retains an aura. For the Democrats to set themselves against it, instead of concentrating their fire on an electoral victory in November, could further inflate the executive. Their best chance for cutting the imperial presidency down to size is for them to back a presidential challenger who is dedicated to the cause of restoring Congress\u2019s war powers. \u2022 Thomas Meaney is a fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, Washington DC",

Ballooning debt payments and cuts in public spending are a recipe for disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Meeting the UN <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\">sustainable development goals</a> to cut poverty and inequality requires \u201clarge increases in public spending\u201d, Clifton said.</p> <p>In many countries, however, researchers found that the opposite is happening. In states with the highest debt repayments, public expenditure per person \u2013 which had been rising in countries with the lowest debt commitments \u2013 is dropping.</p> <p>Between 2015 and 2018, 14 of the 15 countries spending more than 18% of their revenue on servicing debt cut public expenditure per person by an average of 13%. Conversely, the 30 countries with the lowest repayments increased their public spending by 14% over the same period.</p> <p>By 2022, governments\u2019 foreign debt payments could be three times as costly as they were in 2011, and higher even than at the turn of the millennium, when debt relief was high on the international agenda.</p> <p>Researchers predict that, by 2022, average foreign debt payments for the 63 poorest governments in the world will increase by between 133% and 216% on 2011 levels.</p> <p>Even in the best-case scenario \u2013 where there is strong economic growth and no economic shocks \u2013 debt payments are expected to continue to increase over the next three years. But if there are significant economic shocks \u2013 such as drops in commodity prices, rises in interest rates or widespread disasters due to global heating \u2013 researchers predict that average debt payments could reach the highest level in more than 20 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe need the IMF and World Bank to stop bailing out the reckless lenders who are contributing to runaway debts and play their part in bringing about fair and rapid debt restructurings for countries in crisis,\u201d said Clifton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/19/debt-in-developing-economies-rises-to-record-55tn\">Debt in developing economies rises to record $55tn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At more than 50%, Congo-Brazzaville was found to have made the most severe spending cuts between 2015 and 2018.

      "bodyText": "Poorer countries are cutting public spending in response to a \u201cgrowing debt crisis\u201d, campaigners have warned. Debt in some countries has trebled according to new figures that calculate debt reimbursements, and their impact on government expenditure, in 60 countries. The research, based on 60 countries for which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have data, consolidates figures on past debt payments from 2015 to 2018 and weighs up scenarios for the near future. Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, the charity that published the numbers, said: \u201cThe world must wake up to the growing debt crisis in poor countries. Ballooning debt payments and cuts in public spending are a recipe for disaster.\u201d Meeting the UN sustainable development goals to cut poverty and inequality requires \u201clarge increases in public spending\u201d, Clifton said. In many countries, however, researchers found that the opposite is happening. In states with the highest debt repayments, public expenditure per person \u2013 which had been rising in countries with the lowest debt commitments \u2013 is dropping. Between 2015 and 2018, 14 of the 15 countries spending more than 18% of their revenue on servicing debt cut public expenditure per person by an average of 13%. Conversely, the 30 countries with the lowest repayments increased their public spending by 14% over the same period. By 2022, governments\u2019 foreign debt payments could be three times as costly as they were in 2011, and higher even than at the turn of the millennium, when debt relief was high on the international agenda. Researchers predict that, by 2022, average foreign debt payments for the 63 poorest governments in the world will increase by between 133% and 216% on 2011 levels. Even in the best-case scenario \u2013 where there is strong economic growth and no economic shocks \u2013 debt payments are expected to continue to increase over the next three years. But if there are significant economic shocks \u2013 such as drops in commodity prices, rises in interest rates or widespread disasters due to global heating \u2013 researchers predict that average debt payments could reach the highest level in more than 20 years. \u201cWe need the IMF and World Bank to stop bailing out the reckless lenders who are contributing to runaway debts and play their part in bringing about fair and rapid debt restructurings for countries in crisis,\u201d said Clifton. At more than 50%, Congo-Brazzaville was found to have made the most severe spending cuts between 2015 and 2018. Chad cut its spending by 35%. The debt crisis in both countries follows loans from oil traders. In Mozambique, public spending cuts of 21% follow secret loans from banks based in London. While Zambia\u2019s revenue has been hit by drops in copper prices, its rising debt payments were found to be primarily due to high-interest bonds and other loans from commercial banks. In 2019 the country\u2019s public spending is expected to be 18% lower than in 2015, with more cuts predicted by the IMF in the next few years. Following the Ebola crisis, Sierra Leone\u2019s debt payments have risen. Public expenditure in 2018 was 10% less per person than in 2015, with even greater cuts in 2016 (17%). Nearly half of the government\u2019s external debt burden is owed to the IMF. Mark Perera, policy and advocacy manager at the European Network on Debt and Development, said: \u201cThese figures show that citizens are bearing the greatest burden as debt crises unfold.

The former prisons minister and London mayoral candidate Rory Stewart has backed it. Frost said he did not dispute the right of the United States to consider Suleimani a bad actor, but the decision to kill him outside a state of war was wrong and would cause a backlash. His warning came as the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said this week that her force was \u201cextremely alert\u201d to potential repercussions within the UK from the Iran crisis, while an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said Iran could consider the UK \u201ca partner in this crime\u201d.</p> <p>Khan was jailed in 2012 for al-Qaida-inspired terrorism offences and released in 2018.

At about 2pm he launched his attack, killing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/london-bridge-attack-victim-jack-merritt-tributes\">Jack Merritt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/11/london-bridge-attack-victim-saskia-jones-family\">Saskia Jones</a>, both Cambridge graduates.</p> <p>\u201cTheir deaths have created a drive within me to challenge hatred and intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat feeds terror is actions like this where people in power act as judge, jury and executioner across borders and jurisdictions.

Its producer, the Spanish company Novameat, says the steak will be available in some restaurants in Spain and Italy this year before scaling up in 2021.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">enormous impact of cattle</a> and other livestock on the environment has led a swathe of companies to create plant-based alternatives to meat, with the Beyond Meat burger and Greggs sausage roll among the vegan successes. But recreating the texture of whole cuts of meat is far more challenging than ground meat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">Avoiding meat and dairy is \u2018single biggest way\u2019 to reduce your impact on Earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI started with steak I think because it is the holy grail of plant-based meat,\u201d said Giuseppe Scionti, founder of <a href=\"https://www.novameat.com/\">Novameat</a>. \u201cIt is the most difficult.\u201d The company unveiled a 3D-printed steak in 2018, but the new steak has both the firm, fibrous texture and meaty appearance of a real steak, he said, making it the \u201cmost realistic\u201d to date.</p> <p>The company is still experimenting with the taste, but Scionti said the company\u2019 can use the ingredients already used to create convincing beefy burgers from plants. He expects a final formulation in the next few months.</p> <p>The key to the new steak is patented micro-extrusion technology that produces fibres between 100 and 500 microns in diameter. This allows the complex structure of real meat to be replicated, with muscle fibres and fat entwined. Existing extrusion technology produces much larger fibres.</p> <p>The 50g steak produced cost $1.50 (\u00a31.15) to make, similar in price to current supermarket steak in the UK. But Scionti said the cost will drop when the process is scaled up. The company plans to commission a pilot plant in 2021 which can produce 50kg of steak per hour. But to reach a mass market, the company plans to licence its technology to existing food manufacturers who can develop their own recipes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ad667445e6700905fab9931d6b214b14e2ae2ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad667445e6700905fab9931d6b214b14e2ae2ff/484_655_2821_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A well done Novameat steak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A well done Novameat steak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Novameat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some plant-based alternatives to meat have been criticised for being as high in fat and salt as the food they are intended to replace. Scionti said plant-based alternatives do not contain cholesterol or the hormones and antibiotics often found in real meat.

      "bodyText": "The \u201cmost realistic\u201d plant-based steak to date has been revealed, mimicking the texture and appearance of a real cut of meat. The fake steak\u2019s ingredients include pea, seaweed and beetroot juice, which are extruded into fine fibres to recreate muscle tissue. Its producer, the Spanish company Novameat, says the steak will be available in some restaurants in Spain and Italy this year before scaling up in 2021. The enormous impact of cattle and other livestock on the environment has led a swathe of companies to create plant-based alternatives to meat, with the Beyond Meat burger and Greggs sausage roll among the vegan successes. But recreating the texture of whole cuts of meat is far more challenging than ground meat. \u201cI started with steak I think because it is the holy grail of plant-based meat,\u201d said Giuseppe Scionti, founder of Novameat. \u201cIt is the most difficult.\u201d The company unveiled a 3D-printed steak in 2018, but the new steak has both the firm, fibrous texture and meaty appearance of a real steak, he said, making it the \u201cmost realistic\u201d to date. The company is still experimenting with the taste, but Scionti said the company\u2019 can use the ingredients already used to create convincing beefy burgers from plants. He expects a final formulation in the next few months. The key to the new steak is patented micro-extrusion technology that produces fibres between 100 and 500 microns in diameter. This allows the complex structure of real meat to be replicated, with muscle fibres and fat entwined. Existing extrusion technology produces much larger fibres. The 50g steak produced cost $1.50 (\u00a31.15) to make, similar in price to current supermarket steak in the UK. But Scionti said the cost will drop when the process is scaled up. The company plans to commission a pilot plant in 2021 which can produce 50kg of steak per hour. But to reach a mass market, the company plans to licence its technology to existing food manufacturers who can develop their own recipes. Some plant-based alternatives to meat have been criticised for being as high in fat and salt as the food they are intended to replace. Scionti said plant-based alternatives do not contain cholesterol or the hormones and antibiotics often found in real meat. In future, he said, beneficial ingredients such as omega-3 fatty acids could be added. Novameat is not alone in developing plant-based steaks, with Israel-based Redefine Meat being a leading competitor. Unlike Novameat\u2019s product, the Israeli company\u2019s meat has been publicly tasted, receiving positive feedback, but the firm has not yet revealed a textured steak. Others include Atlast Food, which is using a fungus fibres to create textures similar to meat, and Emergy Foods. Another Israeli company, Aleph Farms, has produced a steak from real beef cells cultured in a laboratory, which, the firm says, will have a much lower environmental footprint than real meat. There is definitely a role for technology that can structure both plant-based and lab-grown meat into more complex products, said Rosie Wardle, at the Jeremy Coller foundation and advisor for CPT Capital, which has invested in Redfine Meat. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten early versions of the Redefine products and they were truly delicious,\u201d she said. Novameat has attracted investment from New Crop Capital, a firm that also invests in some of the best known plant-based and lab-grown meat companies, including Beyond Meat, Memphis Meat and Mosa Meat. David Welch, at the Good Food Institute, which works with scientists and entrepreneurs to create alternatives to animal products, said: \u201cTo meet the growing global demand for meat with more sustainable plant-based products, we need to deliver the taste, texture, and appearance that meat eaters want.\u201d He said new technologies such as Novameat\u2019s bioprinting are useful: \u201cThey give plant-based meat manufacturers a wider array of tools to mimic all types of meat and seafood.\u201d Scionti said the company aims to produce pork and salmon in the future. Recent scientific studies have found that huge reduction in meat-eating in rich nations is essential to cut greenhouse gas emissions and fight the climate crisis. \u201cWe believe it is important to provide an alternative,\u201d said Scionti, who spent a decade researching tissue engineering at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona and other institutions. \u201cThis will help in the long term to decrease the need for land, water, energy and, of course, reduce the emissions coming from animal agriculture. \u201cWe want to be better than the other companies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are all in the same boat.

In contrast to the smiles and hugs of acid house, the music, the dancing, the drugs were all becoming truly hardcore. This, in turn, birthed all kinds of mainly regional variations that have lasted from the 90s to today, most notably gabber \u2013 a relentless mix of superfast BPMS, distorted kickdrums and roared vocals that evoked the distilled nihilism of Rotterdam skinheads. While other equally aggressive techno and trance variants were given a platform in French \u201cteknivals\u201d and micro-enclaves in Moscow, Newcastle and Valencia, gabber was confined to its own diehard subculture. But now, following a gradual rise in underground interest, gabber and its hardcore cousins have become oddly popular again. Of course, club culture is always porous: people like Hudson Mohawke have long repped their hardcore pasts. But 2019 saw gabber and hardcore boiling over into the mainstream. Siberian star Nina Kraviz put ever-higher BPMs into her Trip label and DJ sets. \u201cIt\u2019s got that joyous energy that makes you want to jump around,\u201d she says. \u201cSome techno snobs say gabber is tasteless and overly simplistic.

      "body": "<p>A record-breaking satirical comedy about migrants attempting to reach Europe has provoked a row in Italy, infuriating far-right politicians and their supporters.</p> <p>Tolo Tolo, starring and directed by the comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/italys-comic-blockbuster-quo-vado-draws-laughs-from-bitter-economic-reality\">Luca Medici</a>, AKA Checco Zalone, 42, took in \u20ac8.7m (\u00a37.4m) on 1 January, the best opening day of all time in Italian cinema.</p> <p>The movie features a debt-ridden Italian businessman, played by Zalone, who leaves Italy to take refuge in Kenya. The outbreak of civil war forces him to pack his bags and return to Italy with some of his new African friends aboard a migrant vessel.</p> <p>In early December, Zalone, known for his politically incorrect humour, publicised the film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmH2ZZy0dUI\">by posting a video on YouTube of a song titled \u201cImmigrato\u201d</a>, meaning Immigrant. In the clip, which featured a series of stereotypes of asylum seekers, Zalone is stalked by an African migrant who begs him for money, enters his flat and flirts with his wife. The footage prompted criticism, with the actor accused of racism and of inciting stereotypes of migrants.</p> <p>The clip was well received by far-right politicians, who took it as a signal that the film would promote an anti-migrant agenda. A few days after the video\u2019s release, the former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini <a href=\"https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2019/12/23/checco-zalone-salvini-accusato-di-essere-razzista-lo-voglio-senatore-a-vita-non-qualche-reperto/5634685/\">said at rally</a>: \u201cI understand that they\u2019ve accused Zalone of being racist and politically incorrect. I say long live Checco Zalone. I want him as a senator for life!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bb4fb9a9a6ade908c54ca6af1378cedd17abbb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb4fb9a9a6ade908c54ca6af1378cedd17abbb0/0_0_1787_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Tolo Tolo with, from left to right, Idjaba (Manda Toure\u0300), Oumar (Souleymane Sylla), Checco (Checco Zalone) and Doudou (Nassor Said Birya).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Tolo Tolo with, from left to right, Idjaba (Manda Toure\u0300), Oumar (Souleymane Sylla), Checco (Checco Zalone) and Doudou (Nassor Said Birya).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Taodue and Medusa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Salvini and his extremist supporters may have been disappointed when the full film was released and it became clear that it derides Italian populism and the language of extreme rightwing politicians. Far from promoting an anti-migrant agenda, the film tackles stereotypes and the racism migrants face on a daily basis. It highlights the suffering of the thousands of people who attempt to cross the sea in order to reach Europe. In one scene, Zalone ends up in a Libyan detention centre during his quest to return home.</p> <p>Following the film\u2019s release, the praise rightwing politicians had showered on Zalone swiftly turned to criticism. One of the first comments came from Ignazio La Russa, a senator in the extreme rightwing party Brothers of Italy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ignazio_LaRussa/status/1212505873878257665\">who tweeted</a>: \u201cI\u2019ve just seen Tolo Tolo: zero applause at the end of the film. Besides, it\u2019s boring and of little value.\u201d</p> <p>Maurizio Gasparri, a senator and member of Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party, said in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gasparri.it/videos/su-checco-zalone/792274117958185/\">a video</a> posted on Facebook: \u201cIt is too politically correct. The moral is too far left. Checco, come back as you were, don\u2019t sell out to political correctness in the name of immigrants.\u201d In reference to the video of the song that preceded the film, Gasparri said: \u201cThat song was perhaps better than the film.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3497c81f0fd912d49e4bc510e0423c4df460b7f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3497c81f0fd912d49e4bc510e0423c4df460b7f5/0_87_1705_1023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Tolo Tolo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Tolo Tolo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Taodue and Medusa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a press conference, Zalone addressed the controversy with irony. \u201cIt is not a film against Salvini, because Salvini\u2019s not even in the film. If it\u2019s against him, only he can tell.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is, however, a character who is reminiscent of [the foreign minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement] Luigi Di Maio, who dresses like Prime Minister Conte and speaks like Matteo Salvini. I guess I\u2019ve created a modern monster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have invested \u20ac20m to make a film against Salvini,\u201d said Pietro Valsecchi, the film\u2019s producer.</p> <p>In the first week of January, Tolo Tolo was viewed by 5 million people and made \u20ac36m. The film could ultimately take in as much as \u20ac80m and become the highest grossing Italian film based on domestic box office receipts, <a href=\"https://www.milanofinanza.it/news/boom-zalone-una-manna-per-la-mediaset-dei-berlusconi-202001021625026763\">according to</a> the financial newspaper Milano Finanza.</p>",

The movie features a debt-ridden Italian businessman, played by Zalone, who leaves Italy to take refuge in Kenya. The outbreak of civil war forces him to pack his bags and return to Italy with some of his new African friends aboard a migrant vessel. In early December, Zalone, known for his politically incorrect humour, publicised the film by posting a video on YouTube of a song titled \u201cImmigrato\u201d, meaning Immigrant. In the clip, which featured a series of stereotypes of asylum seekers, Zalone is stalked by an African migrant who begs him for money, enters his flat and flirts with his wife. The footage prompted criticism, with the actor accused of racism and of inciting stereotypes of migrants. The clip was well received by far-right politicians, who took it as a signal that the film would promote an anti-migrant agenda. A few days after the video\u2019s release, the former deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini said at rally: \u201cI understand that they\u2019ve accused Zalone of being racist and politically incorrect. I say long live Checco Zalone. I want him as a senator for life!\u201d However, Salvini and his extremist supporters may have been disappointed when the full film was released and it became clear that it derides Italian populism and the language of extreme rightwing politicians. Far from promoting an anti-migrant agenda, the film tackles stereotypes and the racism migrants face on a daily basis. It highlights the suffering of the thousands of people who attempt to cross the sea in order to reach Europe. In one scene, Zalone ends up in a Libyan detention centre during his quest to return home. Following the film\u2019s release, the praise rightwing politicians had showered on Zalone swiftly turned to criticism. One of the first comments came from Ignazio La Russa, a senator in the extreme rightwing party Brothers of Italy, who tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve just seen Tolo Tolo: zero applause at the end of the film. Besides, it\u2019s boring and of little value.\u201d Maurizio Gasparri, a senator and member of Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia party, said in a video posted on Facebook: \u201cIt is too politically correct. The moral is too far left. Checco, come back as you were, don\u2019t sell out to political correctness in the name of immigrants.\u201d In reference to the video of the song that preceded the film, Gasparri said: \u201cThat song was perhaps better than the film.\u201d In a press conference, Zalone addressed the controversy with irony. \u201cIt is not a film against Salvini, because Salvini\u2019s not even in the film. If it\u2019s against him, only he can tell.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is, however, a character who is reminiscent of [the foreign minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement] Luigi Di Maio, who dresses like Prime Minister Conte and speaks like Matteo Salvini. I guess I\u2019ve created a modern monster.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have invested \u20ac20m to make a film against Salvini,\u201d said Pietro Valsecchi, the film\u2019s producer. In the first week of January, Tolo Tolo was viewed by 5 million people and made \u20ac36m. The film could ultimately take in as much as \u20ac80m and become the highest grossing Italian film based on domestic box office receipts, according to the financial newspaper Milano Finanza.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Why </strong><strong>did Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government collapse in January 2017?</strong></h2> <p>The executive fell apart when Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Martin McGuinness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/09/martin-mcguinness-to-resign-as-northern-ireland-deputy-first-minister\">resigned as deputy first ministe</a>r in response to a scandal surrounding the Democratic Unionist party first minister Arlene Foster\u2019s role in the \u201ccash for ash\u201d scandal centring on the mismanagement of a renewable heat incentive scheme that ultimately cost the government \u00a3480m. Foster had refused to stand aside to allow an independent inquiry into her conduct. Because the terms of the Good Friday agreement require representatives of both communities for the executive to sit, McGuinness\u2019s departure and the refusal to replace him led to the assembly\u2019s collapse.</p> <h2><strong>Why has it been impossible to restore devolved government since then?</strong></h2> <p>Despite fresh elections and round after round of talks, previously proposed solutions have failed because of disagreements over the status of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/27/irish-language-act-hampering-northern-ireland-power-sharing-talks\">the Irish language</a> in the region. There have also been differences on how to handle the legacy of the Troubles. With negotiations failing to yield a positive outcome, it has even been suggested that an external mediator may be needed.</p> <h2><strong>What are the core elements of the new deal that would </strong><strong>restore power sharing?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/bid-launched-to-revive-power-sharing-in-northern-ireland\">Any agreement</a> will hinge on the issues of language and culture. Sinn F\u00e9in insists on an Irish language act that would put Irish on an equal par to English in Northern Ireland, not unlike the situation with Welsh in Wales. Unionists oppose this, but the two sides appear to have hit upon a compromise whereby the rights of Irish speakers are balanced with rights for the Ulster Scots/loyalist tradition. Language and cultural commissioners have been proposed to oversee policies such as dual-language street signs and the right to use Irish in public arenas such the courts.</p> <h2><strong>Can the two main parties live with this compromise?</strong></h2> <p>One potential sticking point that emerged on Friday is what power any new first and deputy first minister would exercise over the remit of the commissioners. If the likes of Foster, the DUP leader, were able to limit a commissioner\u2019s power to implement certain policies, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leadership might be reluctant to sign up, having until now demanded a standalone Irish language act.</p> <h2><strong>Will the smaller parties join </strong><strong>any </strong><strong>cross-community \u2018grand coalition\u2019?</strong></h2> <p>The cross-community Alliance party and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party are likely to take up ministerial portfolios in any new power-sharing coalition. However, the Ulster Unionist party is divided. One UUP faction headed by the party leader, Steve Aiken, wants to participate in regional government and run its own department. Another led by Doug Beattie, a former Afghan war veteran and Military Cross holder, believes any devolved executive needs opposition in the Stormont assembly to hold it to account, especially DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in ministers.</p> <h2><strong>Under a</strong><strong> new regional parliament in Belfast will there be a referendum or </strong><strong>border </strong><strong>poll on Irish unity?</strong></h2> <p>In the short to medium term this is highly unlikely. Boris Johnson and his government will hardly agree to a referendum on whether Northern Ireland leaves the UK or not whilst he resists demands from the SNP for a second Scottish independence referendum. There is also is little appetite for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/31/sinn-fein-border-poll-ireland-unity-must-follow-no-deal-brexit\">a border poll</a> in the Irish government, which believes such a referendum would destabilise Northern Irish society and exacerbate sectarian tensions. Dublin would prefer a functioning Northern Ireland executive and a more stable situation north of the border than a poll that would probably result in the status quo anyway.</p> <h2><strong>Why has there been a </strong><strong>fresh push </strong><strong>to return to devolution?</strong></h2> <p>First, the lack of power for the DUP at Westminster. Now the Tories have a Commons majority, the Northern Irish party is no longer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/26/tories-and-the-dup-reach-deal-to-prop-up-minority-government\">the kingmaker</a> and has lost the influence it had during Theresa May\u2019s premiership. In those circumstances the only way to exercise any real political influence is to run devolved ministries in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in last month\u2019s general election both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in lost thousands of votes. If one thing unites the electorate, regardless of it being unionist, nationalist or neither, it is universal disgust that even during three years without government, politicians elected to Stormont were paid their salaries. There has been genuine grassroots\u2019 anger over this and local politicians know it. Hence the post-Christmas rush towards a settlement to get them back to work.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why did Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government collapse in January 2017? The executive fell apart when Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in response to a scandal surrounding the Democratic Unionist party first minister Arlene Foster\u2019s role in the \u201ccash for ash\u201d scandal centring on the mismanagement of a renewable heat incentive scheme that ultimately cost the government \u00a3480m. Foster had refused to stand aside to allow an independent inquiry into her conduct. Because the terms of the Good Friday agreement require representatives of both communities for the executive to sit, McGuinness\u2019s departure and the refusal to replace him led to the assembly\u2019s collapse. Why has it been impossible to restore devolved government since then? Despite fresh elections and round after round of talks, previously proposed solutions have failed because of disagreements over the status of the Irish language in the region. There have also been differences on how to handle the legacy of the Troubles. With negotiations failing to yield a positive outcome, it has even been suggested that an external mediator may be needed. What are the core elements of the new deal that would restore power sharing? Any agreement will hinge on the issues of language and culture. Sinn F\u00e9in insists on an Irish language act that would put Irish on an equal par to English in Northern Ireland, not unlike the situation with Welsh in Wales. Unionists oppose this, but the two sides appear to have hit upon a compromise whereby the rights of Irish speakers are balanced with rights for the Ulster Scots/loyalist tradition. Language and cultural commissioners have been proposed to oversee policies such as dual-language street signs and the right to use Irish in public arenas such the courts. Can the two main parties live with this compromise? One potential sticking point that emerged on Friday is what power any new first and deputy first minister would exercise over the remit of the commissioners. If the likes of Foster, the DUP leader, were able to limit a commissioner\u2019s power to implement certain policies, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leadership might be reluctant to sign up, having until now demanded a standalone Irish language act. Will the smaller parties join any cross-community \u2018grand coalition\u2019? The cross-community Alliance party and the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party are likely to take up ministerial portfolios in any new power-sharing coalition. However, the Ulster Unionist party is divided. One UUP faction headed by the party leader, Steve Aiken, wants to participate in regional government and run its own department. Another led by Doug Beattie, a former Afghan war veteran and Military Cross holder, believes any devolved executive needs opposition in the Stormont assembly to hold it to account, especially DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in ministers. Under a new regional parliament in Belfast will there be a referendum or border poll on Irish unity? In the short to medium term this is highly unlikely. Boris Johnson and his government will hardly agree to a referendum on whether Northern Ireland leaves the UK or not whilst he resists demands from the SNP for a second Scottish independence referendum. There is also is little appetite for a border poll in the Irish government, which believes such a referendum would destabilise Northern Irish society and exacerbate sectarian tensions. Dublin would prefer a functioning Northern Ireland executive and a more stable situation north of the border than a poll that would probably result in the status quo anyway. Why has there been a fresh push to return to devolution? First, the lack of power for the DUP at Westminster. Now the Tories have a Commons majority, the Northern Irish party is no longer the kingmaker and has lost the influence it had during Theresa May\u2019s premiership. In those circumstances the only way to exercise any real political influence is to run devolved ministries in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, in last month\u2019s general election both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in lost thousands of votes. If one thing unites the electorate, regardless of it being unionist, nationalist or neither, it is universal disgust that even during three years without government, politicians elected to Stormont were paid their salaries. There has been genuine grassroots\u2019 anger over this and local politicians know it. Hence the post-Christmas rush towards a settlement to get them back to work.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>I would feel rather more rested after a two-week break if I didn\u2019t have to take myself on holiday with me. It would be rather a relief to have some time off from near constant feelings of anxiety and dread. It feels like rather an invasion of privacy to have my thoughts and dreams still dominated by the messiness of UK and global politics. Not to mention football. But then I am often my own worst enemy. We went away to an Airbnb on the Welsh border with a couple of friends for five days. The house was advertised as having internet access but it turned out there was scarcely even a phone signal, so keeping up with the possible outbreak of the third world war was probably nearly as stressful for me as it was for Boris Johnson on his sun lounger in Mustique. The lowest point was sitting on my own in the car outside a pub \u2013 the only place I could get a signal \u2013 on New Year\u2019s Day to watch the Spurs game against Southampton. It was the perfect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/southampton-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">exercise in masochism</a>. I\u2019m not quite sure why I care so much about a team that clearly no longer gives a toss about itself. For 90 minutes I got steadily colder and more depressed as darkness fell while Spurs went from the merely bad to the totally clueless. However once the game was over, I felt weirdly almost content. There was no longer any danger of being drawn to the footballing antichrist of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. There was, if not a safety, then at least a comforting familiarity in being once more without hope. My therapist has a lot of work to do.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>The first day back in parliament and the difference between the two tribes could not be clearer. Labour MPs are still wandering around in a state of trauma and can barely raise their heads to look one another in the eye, let alone be bothered to seriously challenge the government. There\u2019s just no point. Everything feels a bit futile. The Tories meanwhile are all smiles and are wandering around as if they own the place. Which, of course, they now do. What the Conservatives really mean by uniting the country and moving on is that anyone who wanted to remain in the EU should just suck up the fact that they had lost. There are to be no olive branches on offer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/parliament-returns-and-tory-majority-gives-idiots-licence-to-be-idiots\">Johnson couldn\u2019t even be bothered to come to the Commons</a> to give a statement on the US assassination of Qassem Suleimani. He was sunburnt, had jetlag and it was too much hassle to get involved when there was a trade deal with the US to be negotiated later in the year. Even Chris Grayling was looking more chipper than I have seen him in ages. Clearly being demoted from cabinet has been a liberation for him. No more sense of daily despair at his complete uselessness. A smart publisher would be bidding for his memoirs. You\u2019d get the rights for next to nothing and it could become the comedy bestseller of the year. The one Tory to look miserable was Jeremy Hunt, who is now bitterly regretting his brief outbreak of principle in refusing to serve in Johnson\u2019s cabinet and made a pitiful brown-nosing plea for a return to office during the Iran debate. Just a shame Boris wasn\u2019t there to ignore him.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s not immediately clear to me how Meghan and Harry plan to square away some of their privileges \u2013 sell their Windsor home and give back the public money spent on its renovation to the Treasury? \u2013 with their decision to break away from the royal family, but my gut reaction is good on them for choosing to give it a go. Not least because Piers Morgan and Sarah Vine have been in the vanguard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/09/prince-harry-meghan-two-most-spoiled-brats-in-history-pundits-provoked-by-royal-rupture\">those queuing to put the boot in</a>. If in doubt, it\u2019s generally safe to do the opposite of these two. The announcement could have been handled a little better, but we should be applauding a relatively minor royal \u2013 Harry is sixth in line to the throne and likely to descend further down the succession pecking order at some point \u2013 who wants to become financially independent and doesn\u2019t want to sit around at home while the tabloid press continues to do to his wife what it did to his mother. After all, it\u2019s not as if Prince Andrew or Prince Edward have done the monarchy any favours by staying put. Fair play also to the Queen for getting stuck in. After various senior members of the royal household had given snarky anonymous briefings to the media, it rather looks as if Her Maj took charge and told everyone to sod off. Even if the situation wasn\u2019t ideal she wanted to try and find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/harry-meghan-returns-canada-queen-demands-workable-solution\">a way of making it work</a>. When push came to shove, she cared more about her relationship with, and the mental health of, her grandson and Meghan than royal protocol. Families are complicated. There have been several times in my life when my own family could easily have disowned me for some of the choices I made.

The decision to shut down the department has been taken partly to signal that Brexit has been done \u2013 even if it hasn\u2019t \u2013 but mainly to limit scrutiny of the future trade negotiations. Most of the hour in the Commons, however, was taken up with Tory MPs enquiring what national celebrations should take place on 31 January. Amid much talk of special ales, flag-flying and Big Ben ringing, no one thought to mention the \u201cfestival of Brexit\u201d that Boris has previously indicated should be a centre-piece of the celebrations. This could be because most artists are remainers and wouldn\u2019t be seen dead appearing at the event. If the festival does go ahead, the one person the government should not appoint as its creative director is Robert Jenrick, the housing, communities and local government minister. Having realised he needed to do something for various towns in the Midlands and the north that it had always previously ignored as they were considered safe Labour seats, Jenrick chose to launch his new Towns Fund and Town of the Year competition from Wolverhampton. Which just happens to have been upgraded to a city in 2000 after a long local campaign. Jenrick spent most of the launch desperately trying to cover his back by suggesting that all cities were basically towns and all towns were cities in disguise. To compound the error, Jenrick grew up just outside Wolverhampton. Nice to see he\u2019s always taken such interest in his roots.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>There is something charmingly Tiggerish about the way Matt Hancock champions the NHS, but sooner or later he is actually going to have to deliver on his promises. Only this week the December data revealed that all A&amp;E departments had had their worst ever month in terms of missing performance targets. Luckily for the government, Labour was far too busy following the \u201cwill he, won\u2019t he\u201d saga of Barry Gardiner\u2019s leadership bid to make too much fuss. Hancock is also going to have his work cut out to improve mental health services. A new report from the Education Policy Institute has found that one in four children who have been referred for help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/10/one-in-four-children-with-mental-health-referral-rejected-nhs\">are being refused treatment</a> on the grounds their condition is not considered serious enough. So presumably these kids either have to pull themselves together or wait for their condition to get bad enough for them to qualify. I care passionately about this, not least because my own mental health has been so fragile for much of my life. But I am one of the lucky ones because I have had the money to get help. Some of my treatment has come courtesy of the NHS, but some of it has been paid for privately. There have been times in my life when waiting months and months, hoping for a referral that might never come, was not a realistic option. I needed help urgently and I have no doubt that if I had not been able to get it I would not be alive today. There must be many thousands of people with similar problems who weren\u2019t so financially well-off and didn\u2019t live to get help. My mental health issues span more than four decades and in that time \u2013 despite repeated promises from successive governments \u2013 nothing has changed. If anything provision has got worse. Over to you, Matt.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: Megxit</strong></p>",

In hot food, raisins are an abomination.</p> <h2><strong>Portion control</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"111ece3ad58d11ee76ab5e6b346603a69a8dc097\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/111ece3ad58d11ee76ab5e6b346603a69a8dc097/0_1725_4160_2935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crumble takes shape\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crumble takes shape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandra Grablewski/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The unnecessary prettification (prissy-fication?) of food, over-elaborate presentation and/or a neurotic desire to erase any hint of mess or evidence of human fallibility from the plate, is a subject that deserves a PhD\u2019s worth of analysis. Suffice to say, in apple crumble, as in so many things in life, form should follow function \u2026 and flavour. Attempts to \u201cstyle\u201d a crumble are a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>Individual apple crumbles served in ovenproof pots or tiny ramekin dishes are mistaken on several levels. First, the unpierced crumble will maintain a dangerous temperature far longer than you would ideally want and, second, where do you put the sauce? In a jug? In another bowl? Why do I have to eat some crumble first before I can pour it in?</p> <p>Even worse, as <a href=\"https://www.countrylife.co.uk/food-drink/love-crumble-make-best-family-191122\">any chef </a>worth<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/stephen-harris-just-dont-call-deconstructed-apple-crumble-plus/\"> their salt</a> will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/31/how-to-make-fruit-crumble-cooking-with-kids\">tell you</a>, are those for-elegant-read-idiotic experiments in deconstructing the apple crumble into its individual components. The crumble\u2019s very appeal lies in its elements melding together as they bake.</p> <p>It should then be served in such a way that, and preferably in one smooth action, you can scoop up a little sauce, crumble and fruit at the same time. To that end, the only way crumble should ever be presented \u2013 aesthetically, think: 1950s farmhouse kitchen \u2013 is in great steaming clods in wide, shallow bowls that allow easy access from all angles. Such a rough-and-ready approach embodies the homely vibe you should be looking to convey. Serving your crumble topping-up is preferable, but crumble that in the portioning-out has collapsed on its side is acceptable. Note: clumsily serving it upside down, with the topping at the bottom of the bowl, is taking this aversion to cheffy presentation too far. It smacks of inverted snobbery. Having to dig the crumble out is no fun. It is the best bit.</p> <h2><strong>Sauce</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"379dbdd304c519279a59a9bb7be02d175b9a06ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/379dbdd304c519279a59a9bb7be02d175b9a06ba/0_0_4800_3860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Choose cream, not custard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"804\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choose cream, not custard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: foodfolio / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A large dollop of whipped double cream is by far the best accompaniment. You don\u2019t want a sauce that will overwhelm the crumble. You want the crumble topping to stay crispy, not soggy, and in terms of flavour, you want an emollient edge, a lubricating lick of <em>something</em> rich and cooling \u2026 yet, ultimately, innocuous. The power dynamic here is not Ant and Dec, Starsky and Hutch, Fabio and Grooverider. The crumble and sauce are not equals. The sauce should never attempt to assert itself as the dominant partner.</p> <p>Some will agitate for clotted cream over whipped, here. Ignore them. Be honest, clotted cream tastes nauseatingly \u201coff\u201d and has all the dense textural allure of toothpaste. It is hideous stuff.</p> <p>As for ice-cream, there is something unappetisingly jarring in that contrast between piping hot crumble and freezing ice-cream. The overt grittiness of the last crumble as it sits in melted ice-cream is, moreover, a poor way to end your crumble experience.</p> <p>Pouring cream suffers from the same issue in the last few mouthfuls. But will you get that far? Single or even double cream can feel oddly \u201cthin\u201d lapping against a robustly muscular apple crumble, while at the same time (unlike whipped cream, which has a lighter, airier profile), use too much of it and its intensely creamy flavour can smother the crumble; its nuances lost in that creamy quagmire. Paradoxically, pouring cream is too thin texturally and <em>too much </em>in its flavour.</p> <p>Custard strikes HTE as a bizarre go-to in this context (and in many others). A gently cooling sauce is preferable to one that will seal heat into your pudding. No one wants to wait even longer for their crumble to cool to a safe temperature and, in custard\u2019s case, the sauce will begin to form an unedifying skin as you do. That is even before we get to custard\u2019s cloying and often thickly oily texture, not to mention its unpredictable quality.</p> <p>Like Fray Bentos pies and Heinz tomato soup, any nostalgia you might have for Bird\u2019s custard peters out after a few mouthfuls. It is all a bit vapid. At the other end of the spectrum, when was the last time you ate a posh pouring custard that was smooth as silk and redolent with flavours of fresh yolks and real vanilla? Moons ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/25/vanilla-shortage-ice-cream-price-rise-uk-madagascar\">HTE would wager</a>. Is that even desirable? The custard is supposed to be a supporting actor in this heartwarming Sunday-night drama. A brilliant custard will, like cream, shout down the cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, dark sugar and fruit flavours that give a crumble its heady charisma.</p> <h2><strong>A short note on the microwave</strong></h2> <p>Except in an emergency (financial, failed gas supply, abduction by kidnappers demanding crumble in 10 minutes etc.), avoid using the microwave to reheat or, worse, \u201cbake\u201d a crumble. If not exposed to the oven\u2019s radiant heat, your crumble topping will not crisp properly and microwaves are notorious for heating high-water content foods, such as fruit, to extraordinary temperatures that deaden flavour. They do so patchily, too. Microwaved food can range from lethally hot to lukewarm, mouthful-by-mouthful.</p> <h2><strong>When\u2026</strong></h2> <p>\u2026 whenever life becomes intolerable.</p> <h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> <p>Nothing. You don\u2019t need it. Any crumble will be wolfed in minutes. Dehydration is not an issue. Plus, there a several problematic things going on here \u2013 tartness, cream, high sugar content \u2013 which make it incredibly difficult to pair crumble with drinks, from tea to best bitter, water to cola. A sommelier would point you to dessert wines, but, let\u2019s be real, most stickies suck. You might drink a sweet wine out of curiosity, you might even find it \u201cinteresting\u201d (code for: \u201cI\u2019m supposed to like this, actually it\u2019s awful\u201d), but will it become a regular tipple? No. Dessert wine is a lot of expense for little pleasure.</p> <p>So, apple crumble, how do you eat yours?</p>",

Even worse, as any chef worth their salt will tell you, are those for-elegant-read-idiotic experiments in deconstructing the apple crumble into its individual components. The crumble\u2019s very appeal lies in its elements melding together as they bake. It should then be served in such a way that, and preferably in one smooth action, you can scoop up a little sauce, crumble and fruit at the same time. To that end, the only way crumble should ever be presented \u2013 aesthetically, think: 1950s farmhouse kitchen \u2013 is in great steaming clods in wide, shallow bowls that allow easy access from all angles. Such a rough-and-ready approach embodies the homely vibe you should be looking to convey. Serving your crumble topping-up is preferable, but crumble that in the portioning-out has collapsed on its side is acceptable. Note: clumsily serving it upside down, with the topping at the bottom of the bowl, is taking this aversion to cheffy presentation too far. It smacks of inverted snobbery. Having to dig the crumble out is no fun. It is the best bit. Sauce A large dollop of whipped double cream is by far the best accompaniment. You don\u2019t want a sauce that will overwhelm the crumble. You want the crumble topping to stay crispy, not soggy, and in terms of flavour, you want an emollient edge, a lubricating lick of something rich and cooling \u2026 yet, ultimately, innocuous. The power dynamic here is not Ant and Dec, Starsky and Hutch, Fabio and Grooverider. The crumble and sauce are not equals. The sauce should never attempt to assert itself as the dominant partner. Some will agitate for clotted cream over whipped, here. Ignore them. Be honest, clotted cream tastes nauseatingly \u201coff\u201d and has all the dense textural allure of toothpaste. It is hideous stuff. As for ice-cream, there is something unappetisingly jarring in that contrast between piping hot crumble and freezing ice-cream. The overt grittiness of the last crumble as it sits in melted ice-cream is, moreover, a poor way to end your crumble experience. Pouring cream suffers from the same issue in the last few mouthfuls. But will you get that far? Single or even double cream can feel oddly \u201cthin\u201d lapping against a robustly muscular apple crumble, while at the same time (unlike whipped cream, which has a lighter, airier profile), use too much of it and its intensely creamy flavour can smother the crumble; its nuances lost in that creamy quagmire. Paradoxically, pouring cream is too thin texturally and too much in its flavour. Custard strikes HTE as a bizarre go-to in this context (and in many others). A gently cooling sauce is preferable to one that will seal heat into your pudding. No one wants to wait even longer for their crumble to cool to a safe temperature and, in custard\u2019s case, the sauce will begin to form an unedifying skin as you do. That is even before we get to custard\u2019s cloying and often thickly oily texture, not to mention its unpredictable quality. Like Fray Bentos pies and Heinz tomato soup, any nostalgia you might have for Bird\u2019s custard peters out after a few mouthfuls. It is all a bit vapid. At the other end of the spectrum, when was the last time you ate a posh pouring custard that was smooth as silk and redolent with flavours of fresh yolks and real vanilla? Moons ago, HTE would wager. Is that even desirable? The custard is supposed to be a supporting actor in this heartwarming Sunday-night drama. A brilliant custard will, like cream, shout down the cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, dark sugar and fruit flavours that give a crumble its heady charisma. A short note on the microwave Except in an emergency (financial, failed gas supply, abduction by kidnappers demanding crumble in 10 minutes etc.), avoid using the microwave to reheat or, worse, \u201cbake\u201d a crumble. If not exposed to the oven\u2019s radiant heat, your crumble topping will not crisp properly and microwaves are notorious for heating high-water content foods, such as fruit, to extraordinary temperatures that deaden flavour. They do so patchily, too. Microwaved food can range from lethally hot to lukewarm, mouthful-by-mouthful. When\u2026 \u2026 whenever life becomes intolerable. Drink Nothing. You don\u2019t need it. Any crumble will be wolfed in minutes. Dehydration is not an issue. Plus, there a several problematic things going on here \u2013 tartness, cream, high sugar content \u2013 which make it incredibly difficult to pair crumble with drinks, from tea to best bitter, water to cola. A sommelier would point you to dessert wines, but, let\u2019s be real, most stickies suck. You might drink a sweet wine out of curiosity, you might even find it \u201cinteresting\u201d (code for: \u201cI\u2019m supposed to like this, actually it\u2019s awful\u201d), but will it become a regular tipple? No. Dessert wine is a lot of expense for little pleasure. So, apple crumble, how do you eat yours?",

Crisp, fluffy Yorkshire pudding encases the second carb \u2013 golden, olive oil-kissed bread \u2013 with some roast onions and squash for good measure. All with a killer gravy to coat it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this excited about a recipe. Squash and poppyseed toad in the hole (pictured above) Two carbs, no apologies. If I ever write an album, this will be the title. You can swap up the veg here: most root veg will work well instead of the squash, and leeks will work instead of the onions. Just make sure they are well roasted and not wet, as this will affect the rise of the Yorkshire. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 15 min Serves 4 1 butternut squash (approx 1kg), peeled and chopped in to 2cm chunks 4 red onions, peeled and cut into sixths 1 tbsp fennel seeds Olive oil Salt and pepper 3 eggs 115g plain flour 285ml milk 1 tbsp poppy seeds 2 sage leaves, finely chopped 1 sprig rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped, plus extra sprigs for topping 100g sourdough bread, crusts cut off and torn into 2cm chunks Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/gas 5. Put the squash, onion and fennel seeds in a large roasting tray with three tablespoons of oil, and season. Roast for 30-40 minutes, until everything is really soft and golden. Meanwhile, in a bowl or large jug, whisk the eggs, flour, milk, poppy seeds, herbs and a good pinch of salt and pepper, until you have a smooth batter. Set aside to rest until the veg are ready. Once cooked, remove the onions and squash from the oven and add a quarter to a frying pan to make the mustard and ale gravy (see below). Turn up the oven to 230C (210C fan)/gas 8. Put five tablespoons of oil and the remaining squash and onions in a high-sided, 20cm x 25cm dish, and pop in the oven for five to 10 minutes, so the oil gets really hot and the oven comes up to temperature. Carefully remove the dish from the oven and, working quickly so the oil stays hot, pour the batter evenly over the hot veg and oil. Top with chunks of bread and a few extra sprigs of rosemary, and bake for 20-25 minutes, until risen, golden and crisp \u2013 do not open the oven door in the first 20 minutes or the yorkshire crust will not rise well. Meanwhile, make the gravy and steam some greens. When the toad in the hole is ready, remove from the oven and serve immediately. Mustard and ale gravy An all-pleasing gravy that makes use of some of the veg for the toad in the hole. If you are just making the gravy, roast the veg at 200C (180C fan)/gas 6 for 35-40 minutes before you start. Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 \u00bc roasted squash (from today\u2019s toad in the hole recipe above) 1 roasted red onion (from today\u2019s toad in the hole recipe above) 25g butter 1 tbsp plain flour 400ml good ale Salt and black pepper 1 tsp dijon mustard Small bunch parsley, finely chopped Put the cooked squash and red onion in a pan on a medium-high heat with half the butter, and mash the squash with the back of a fork. Add a tablespoon of plain flour and mix in. Add the ale, little by little, stirring with each splash, until you have a thick, creamy gravy. Simmer for a few minutes, season well, then add the remaining butter, the mustard and parsley.",

Grieving the death of his mother and negotiating a fraught relationship with his father, 17-year-old Charlie finds himself drawn into a dangerously compelling online game with a controller that calls itself God. Charlie and his nerdish friends become the playthings of an artificial intelligence that sends them out on missions in the real world.

Grieving the death of his mother and negotiating a fraught relationship with his father, 17-year-old Charlie finds himself drawn into a dangerously compelling online game with a controller that calls itself God. Charlie and his nerdish friends become the playthings of an artificial intelligence that sends them out on missions in the real world. Tempting them with cash and other rewards, the AI gradually inveigles the group into committing morally dubious acts, leading to betrayal and even the threat of death. Tobey brilliantly captures the immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere of the malign game and its addictive allure for a collection of flawed and needy characters.

The forecast opening would be two and a half years beyond the original deadline, and another three to six months past the revised window set last year by the chief executive, Mark Wild. However, they are more optimistic than the \u201cplanning assumptions\u201d divulged by London\u2019s transport commissioner, Mike Brown, this week, of an autumn 2021 opening. Wild said Bond Street station, whose construction was lagging behind, could be operational when the Elizabeth line opens after all. Crossrail said the forecast was based on progress with the software for its signalling and train systems. Intensive test-running of train services along the route will begin later this year. Transport for London (TfL) operates services on existing railways in west London from Paddington and east from Liverpool Street, which will eventually join up as the full Elizabeth line. Should the central section, tunnelled between Paddington and Abbey Wood, open in summer 2021, Crossrail anticipates full opening a year later. Direct services from Heathrow and Reading in the west to Shenfield in the east will follow in mid-2022. Wild said there were \u201cno shortcuts\u201d to building the railway. He said: \u201cWe continue to make good progress with the central section now reaching substantial completion and we are increasingly confident that Bond Street station will be ready to open with the rest of the railway. \u201cOur latest assessment is that Elizabeth line services through central London will commence in summer 2021 \u2013 but we are aiming to open the railway as soon as we can. \u201cThe key focus for everyone on the Crossrail project is commencing intensive testing of the Elizabeth line as soon as we can in 2020, to enable passenger service as early as possible in 2021.\u201d All stations, bar Bond Street and Whitechapel, would be substantially complete by the end of March, Crossrail said, with the final two ready by the end of 2020. Intensive trials, with multiple trains simulating the actual planned service, should start this autumn. Crossrail said the new timescale would not cause it to break the revised budget announced in November 2019, of just over \u00a318bn. Construction delays, design changes and problems with signalling systems and software have heaped costs on Europe\u2019s largest infrastructure project, whose former bosses had repeatedly claimed it was meeting its \u00a314.8bn budget and timetable until just months before its 2018 due date. The problems have also been hugely costly to TfL in lost fare revenue. Its business plan, published last month, shows it expects income from passengers to be reduced by \u00a31.3bn as a result of Crossrail\u2019s delayed opening. A spokesman for the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cAs the mayor has made clear, it is vital that Crossrail\u2019s new leadership team continues to be open and transparent with Londoners about the complex challenges that need to be addressed to enable the line to open. \u201cTfL and the Department for Transport, as joint sponsors, will continue to hold the Crossrail leadership to account to ensure it is doing everything it can to open Crossrail safely and as soon as possible, and to mitigate further cost pressures.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The high-profile bloodstock operation Phoenix Thoroughbreds suffered another setback on Friday morning when it was reported by the Racing Post that the trainer Martyn Meade had cut ties with them. News broke in November that Amer Abdulaziz Salman, the man behind Phoenix, had been accused of money-laundering by a convicted fraudster during a court case in New York, an allegation that Abdulaziz has strenuously denied. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible shock,\u201d Meade told The Guardian at the time though he added that nothing had been proved. On Friday, the Post reported him as saying: \u201cI no longer train for Phoenix\u201d. Phoenix\u2019s most high profile successes in Europe have been achieved by the Meade-trained Advertise, a top-class sprinter who is now at stud. But their white and orange colours have been carried by runners from various stables and it appears that other trainers are prepared to keep Phoenix horses on the premises for the time being. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a couple of horses for them,\u201d Peter Chapple-Hyam told me on Friday. \u201cI take the view that it\u2019s innocent until proven guilty. They\u2019ve been very good to me. Amer\u2019s fighting the allegations, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d John Quinn and Karl Burke have both sent out Phoenix-owned runners in the past eight days and indicated that they do not intend to take the same action as Meade.

In her (excellently titled) book on non-duality, Radically Condensed Instructions For Being Just As You Are, Jennifer Mathews gets straight to the point: \u201cWe cannot get anything out of life. There is no outside where we could take this thing to. There is no little pocket situated outside of life, [to which we could] steal life\u2019s provisions and squirrel them away. The life of this moment has no outside.\u201d Partly, I confess, I like this because it reminds me of the comic Steven Wright\u2019s line: \u201cYou can\u2019t have everything \u2013 where would you put it?\u201d But it\u2019s also a helpful pointer in its own right \u2013 to the truth that, ultimately, the only purpose of any of this is, well, this. Read this Robert Wright probes the idea that the individual self might be an illusion in his 2017 book, Why Buddhism Is True",

The book, which is divided into fragments each cleaving to a different literary genre, is an attempt, at some 10 years\u2019 distance, to make sense of the experience of her early 20s, when she was not only trapped in a house with a woman who gave every appearance of wanting to destroy her, but trapped in a relationship trope \u2013 an abusive lesbian partnership \u2013 not widely recognised as even existing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/07/carmen-maria-machado-meet-the-author-fiction-interview\" title=\"\">Machado</a> is sitting across from me in the bar of her hotel in New York, on a brief visit from her home in Philadelphia. At 33, she is as far from the version of herself depicted in the book as it is possible to get: happily married to a woman called Val; employed at the University of Pennsylvania, and with a thriving literary career \u2013 Machado\u2019s short story collection, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/her-body-other-parties-carmen-maria-machado-review\" title=\"\">Her Body and Other Parties</a></em>, was a finalist for the US National Book Award in 2017. And yet, she says, one of the bleaker side effects of writing the book was the realisation that \u201cOh, damage can be permanent.\u201d</p> <p>When Machado meets her abuser \u2013 the woman is never named \u2013 she is completely smitten. The woman is \u201cshort and pale and rail-thin and androgynous\u201d. She has a \u201cdazzling smile\u201d and \u201ca raspy voice that sounds like a wheelbarrow being dragged over stones\u201d. She is confident, assertive and socially at ease \u2013 all the things that, at that age, Machado is not. The sex is amazing. Addressing herself in the second person, as she does throughout the book, Machado looks back and observes that, \u201cpart of the problem was, as a weird fat girl, you felt lucky\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The basic dynamic of any abusive relationship is the tendency of the victim to blame herself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book is skilful at elucidating the doublethink necessary to stay in a bad relationship \u2013 the constant shuttle between wanting to leave and wanting to stay; the internal litigation one does to disprove the evidence of one\u2019s own eyes; the sympathy one has for one\u2019s abuser. \u201cThe world is full of hurt people who hurt people,\u201d writes Machado, who frequently found herself (after being screamed at, chased and bombarded with objects thrown at her head by her girlfriend) in the position of comforting her. And yet she stayed on. As she writes, \u201cpeople settle near volcanoes because the resulting soil is extraordinary\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cdream house\u201d of the title refers in the literal sense to the house the women occupy in the midwest, and more generally, to the psychic space in which the abusive relationship unfolds, a terrain complicated by the fact that both partners are women. For Machado, the basic dynamic of any abusive relationship \u2013 the tendency of the victim to blame herself and assume she has the power to change things \u2013 is compounded by the silence that surrounds abusive lesbian relationships. Not only does she lack a language to describe what is happening to her, but there are times when to confront what\u2019s going on feels disloyal to the very idea of lesbianism \u2013 the myth that \u201cto find desire, love, everyday joy without men\u2019s accompanying bullshit is a pretty decent working definition of paradise.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s take on genre \u2013 each short section appears under a subhead framing it through a different literary device, for example \u201cDream House as Soap Opera\u201d, or \u201cDream House as Comedy of Errors\u201d \u2013 speaks to Machado\u2019s desperate efforts to fit her experiences into a pre-existing narrative. At one point, in a section entitled \u201cDream House as Sanctuary\u201d, she locks herself in the bathroom to escape her girlfriend\u2019s rampage. \u201cI remember sitting with my back against the wall,\u201d she writes, \u201cpleading with the universe that she wouldn\u2019t have the tools or know-how to take the doorknob out of the door.\u201d Meanwhile, the girlfriend batters the door, which rocks on its hinges \u201cwith every blow\u201d. It\u2019s a contention of Machado\u2019s that abuse within same sex relationships is homophobic in the same way that heterosexual abuse is fuelled by sexism.</p> <p>\u201cInherent to domestic abuse in queer relationships is the fact that no one is going to believe you,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause there is no narrative for this. You\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019re not going to be understood because of the sexual orientation element, and I think that is a kind of homophobia; it\u2019s relying on a certain understanding, a certain prejudice.\u201d It is, she believes, embedded in the structure of the relationship, \u201cin the same way that when men beat their girlfriends, they\u2019re relying on the fact that sexism permits a certain amount of autonomy and control [within straight relationships]. I thought that was interesting.\u201d</p> <p>It is one of the aims of <em>In the Dream House</em> to fill what Machado calls the \u201carchival silence\u201d around these thoughts by assembling a \u201crough, working attempt at a canon\u201d of \u201cqueer domestic abuse and sexual assault\u201d. This includes anecdotal and academic references to poems, essays, memoirs, such as Jane Eaton Hamilton\u2019s powerful essay \u201cNever Say I Didn\u2019t Bring You Flowers\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/06/dominatrix-to-professor-students-imagine-melissa-febos\" title=\"\">Melissa Febos\u2019</a>s essay \u201cAbandon Me\u201d, and the poems of Leah Horlick, as well as legal precedents that exemplify the reluctance of the courts to recognise and prosecute domestic violence within same sex partnerships.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94ba9dde9a4f6aeca92bdafa33e1e22f0416a2cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94ba9dde9a4f6aeca92bdafa33e1e22f0416a2cf/279_358_2667_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Machado with a fan at a PEN Presents event in Los Angeles in November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Machado with a fan at a PEN Presents event in Los Angeles in November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One result of this silence, she says, is that it may be that perpetrators such as her ex-girlfriend fail even to recognise what they\u2019re doing as abusive. \u201cI think about that a lot, and I go back to this question of did my ex-girlfriend realise what she was doing? Was she aware of it? I have no answer to that, and I have to be comfortable with having no answer. It doesn\u2019t matter in the sense that the outcome is the same.\u201d Neither does she wish to focus on why her ex-girlfriend behaved the way she did. A person who does that \u201cis in pain; of course they\u2019re in pain. Again: does it matter? It\u2019s an interesting question but not one I can begin to psychoanalyse. I\u2019m not her doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Machado focuses, instead, on the task of identifying and articulating emotional damage, which isn\u2019t for the most part even illegal. To her shame, she says, she went through a phase of the relationship when she hoped that she had external bruises to prove that what was happening was real. \u201cI wished that I had a police report, or a black eye. And I recognise that that\u2019s really fucked up but also there\u2019s something about having clarity that feels intoxicating and that I think I wanted and continue to want. And I don\u2019t know what to do with that.\u201d</p> <p>The platonic ideal of victimhood, I suggest, is used across the spectrum to undermine women\u2019s credibility and turn the blame back on them, so it\u2019s not as if bruises would necessarily have clarified things. \u201cSo maybe it\u2019s really about the fact that we don\u2019t have the tools to deal with anybody\u2019s trauma; the fact that we all think, well, if one thing was different, people would take me seriously or believe me. And the fact is that nobody would believe you.\u201d</p> <p>For a long time, Machado didn\u2019t even believe herself. When, in the book, she is told by a doctor that she needs to lose weight, she misses \u201cthe punchline entirely\u201d, she writes, which is that \u201cthe weight you need to lose is 105 pounds and sitting in the waiting room with an annoyed expression on her face.\u201d She is increasingly miserable. Her writing breaks down into smaller and smaller fragments, an unconscious reflection of her shattered equilibrium. Machado had good friends who grew concerned for her welfare and a loving family \u2013 her father, the son of a Cuban immigrant, is a chemical engineer and her mother a homemaker. But still she couldn\u2019t walk away. (Hers isn\u2019t an entirely tolerant family \u2013 a relative once said to her: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in gay people,\u201d to which she retorted: \u201cWell, we believe in you,\u201d something she now finds funny. \u201cI mean she\u2019s just the worst, but also, like, you know, it\u2019s funny. You don\u2019t believe in us? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. You\u2019re not even saying I don\u2019t think it\u2019s OK or all right. You don\u2019t believe in us \u2013 that act of denial in existence. It\u2019s interesting.\u201d)</p> <p>In the end, Machado was emboldened to leave thanks to the support of friends and the creeping feeling that her girlfriend was seriously unstable. The sobering thing, she says, is that while writing the book she would occasionally catch sight of herself through the lens of her ex\u2019s perspective. \u201cVestigial trauma,\u201d she calls it. \u201cPlaces where I could catch myself thinking in a way that I could tell she was shaping, from the past. Which was really disturbing.\u201d</p> <p>The internalisation of the abuser\u2019s voice can be the worst aspect of an abusive relationship and one that Machado still finds \u201cpretty uncomfortable. It was weird and it remains weird. Healing doesn\u2019t mean undoing things that happened. That\u2019s very painful, and very sad, and the more I think about it, the sadder I feel. But also I\u2019m like, well, you go through life, things happen to you. That\u2019s the human experience.\u201d</p> <p>Can you see yourself as she saw you?</p> <p>\u201cTotally, totally. And also the sense of the book as an act of returning to this old version of myself. I can go up to the old Carmen, but I can\u2019t interact with her to say it\u2019s going to be OK. So there\u2019s this act of trying to access the past and an old way of thinking that doesn\u2019t exist any more.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/05/in-the-dream-house-carmen-maria-machado-review\">In the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Machado\u2019s book of short stories, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/her-body-other-parties-carmen-maria-machado-review\">Her Body and Other Parties</a></em>, was almost impossible to categorise \u2013 part gothic horror, part fantasy, part science fiction.

Justin Timberlake\u2019s was Strawberry Bubblegum, and Justin Bieber\u2019s is Yummy. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the teens make of the chorus, which has been precision-engineered for TikTok.

Delicious.</p> <p>On Tuesday I advise turning the oven on when you walk through the door, doing a little therapeutic chopping, then bunging Anna Jones\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/15/anna-jones-winter-salad-recipes\">winter panzanella</a> in the oven.

We\u2019re officially flying over the mid-Veganuary hump together: chest bumps all around. One thing I often find, midway through, is that you cook the same things over and over. I can plough through a surprising amount of carbs by sleepwalking into the pasta cupboard. Of course, I love carbs and you might too \u2013 but I want you to keep mixing it up and trying new things, so this week I\u2019ve overindexed on vegetable-heavy recipes such as soups, stews, curries and salads to stop you reaching for the spaghetti tin. Feel free to mix and match with suggestions from week 1 or week 2, or sift through my back catalogue of recipes on The new vegan and make your own way through. Breakfast This quick herby fruit salad by Angela Hartnett packed with seasonally appropriate blood oranges and pomegranates is what I\u2019ll be making this week. But if you\u2019re in need of something hot, try these baked apples or some roasted neon-pink rhubarb served with a good non-dairy yoghurt. Snacks I\u2019ve been exclusively snacking on Twiglets and Perello olives, which are so good I\u2019m taking out a Costco membership so I can buy them in bulk. Want to make something yourself? Try Nigel Slater\u2019s baba ganoush. Lunch Lunch is all about steaming hot bowls of soup this week. Here are three delights: the Green Kitchen\u2019s green pea, broccoli and mint; my own mother\u2019s beetroot and ginger in which you can vary the ginger according to the weather; and, finally, a Rachel Roddy classic \u2013 pasta e ceci. Dinner I\u2019ve been a big fan of Claire Thomson\u2019s no-nonsense, family-friendly recipes for years now and these roasted cauliflower and gram flour pancakes are just fantastic. I\u2019ll be piling some caramelised red onions, spinach and peas on to mine and eating them with Patak\u2019s lime pickle and non-dairy yoghurt. Delicious. On Tuesday I advise turning the oven on when you walk through the door, doing a little therapeutic chopping, then bunging Anna Jones\u2019 winter panzanella in the oven. Wait until the gorgeous smells creep under the doors and up the stairs, making the house feel like home, then tuck in. On to Wednesday, and it\u2019s time to spice things up with some chilli tofu \u2013 one of my most popular recipes on the Guardian. It\u2019s spicy, nasal-clearing and we Indians eat platefuls of the stuff just like that, but you might want to scoop yours up with some chapatis. Keep the flavours rolling on Thursday with Tom Hunt\u2019s roast pumpkin with chickpeas, kale, pomegranate and tahini, then finish the week on Friday with my potato, chard and coconut curry. On the weekend, it\u2019s time to release the big pots. Pop one of these hearty root vegetable stews on the stove or pop Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s latest ratatouille in the oven. For afters, I\u2019m thinking chocolate or ice-cream, or both. Kick back with Magnum\u2019s new vegan ice-cream, or these perfectly sized Little Moons chocolate ice-cream bites \u2013 or else, make your own squidgy chocolate cake. Just one more week to go until you\u2019ve completed the set and the world is your oyster mushroom.",

      "bodyText": "Welcome back and happy new year. The turn of a decade is always a great time for taking stock, for predictions and forecasts about the new era to come. In case you missed it, the Upside published its review of the super-trends of 2010s over the Christmas period \u2013 and asked readers what they thought the dominating tendencies of the 2020s would be. There were some thought-provoking responses. John Simke predicted that the 2020s would mark the end of seven decades of overenthusiastic consumerism: By 2030, buying consumer goods will not only be looked down on, increasingly it will not be done, particularly in the \u201crich\u201d world. This will go far beyond \u201cconscious consumption\u201d to complete cessation of consumption. This will be led by the younger generation but will be picked up by everyone. Our economy will shift from being consumption led to being savings and investment led, as we spend trillions of dollars on a new energy system and climate change adaptation. Obviously this will be driven by the need to mitigate climate change. Kevin Fisher in Los Angeles forecast a series of \u2018ends\u2019. The end of work as we know it, the end of human contact, the end of disease: I think even in the next decade we will see more and more diseases eradicated completely and as we start to treat illness with in-body genetic engineering we will see hereditary conditions also disappear. Robbie Morrison in Berlin is buoyant about prospects for a more open society: I predict \u201copen\u201d will become a super\u2011trend: more specifically, open civil society organizations \u2026 and open analysis in pursuit of solutions to our existential crisis of sustainability. It was the open\u2011source world that bequeathed the ethos, the community norms, the decision processes, the copyleft and permissive open licensing models, the versioning and issues tracking tools, the concept of predominantly online collaboration, and the web platforms in support. So I see this fledgling super\u2011trend in the raft of new self\u2011organizing civil society communities confronting climate change, including Extinction Rebellion, GermanZero, Fridays for Future, and Scientists for Future. To this end, I\u2019ve embarked on trying to build a community to analyze future zero\u2011carbon energy systems thus, with some background here. And finally, Tom Forster ran through an exotic list of predictions including skyrocketing pet ownership, drug liberalisation, the return of the city state, anti-fashion, nationalist art \u2013 and my own favourite, ocean travel: I think ocean/rail liners will start targeting #generationeasyjet, diversifying their onboard services to subcontract for millennial appetites such as rage rooms, food/beer markets, vegan cuisine, axe throwing, escape games, gin tastings, etc. As for me, I predict a giddy torrent of optimistic journalism. Already in the last week or so, we have published: How Bangladesh is leading the way in adapting to the climate emergency. Three-minute read How lab-grown food can save the planet. Three-minute amuse bouche The house that Verdi built \u2013 and the 60 retired opera singers who live there. Two-minute aria The wave pool for disabled surfers. Two-minute read Fukushima\u2019s plan to replace nuclear with renewable energy hub. One-minute read Lucky numbers US greenhouse gas emissions fell 2% in 2019, according to preliminary estimates, as cheaper natural gas supplanted coal at a prodigious rate. Also falling in the US is the cancer death rate, by 2.2% in the latest year on record \u2013 the biggest ever reported decline. And it was a good week for auto workers in the US and bakers in the UK. Automakers GM and Ford made more than 1,500 temporary workers permanent members of staff under a new union deal. British baker Greggs gave its 25,000 staff a bonus of up to \u00a3300 each, as the company continued to thrive. What we liked? Vogue Italia\u2019s startling decision to publish its January edition without any photos. Also, various media reports detailing Australian generosity to raise money to battle the bushfires. But most of all, we loved this NPR piece about the \u2018scary moms\u2019 and crowdfunded activists pressuring the Pakistani government to do something about apocalyptic air pollution. What we heard We had plenty of further suggestions for \u2018Upside Legends\u2019, following our article just before new year highlighting the unsung heroes who really deserve public acclamation.

Crates, bottles, straws and nets, she said, also wash into the fishpond during the \u201cextreme high tides\u201d.

On a bright day last summer, Larson and fellow members of the Hawaii Wildlife Fund (HWF), a team of conservation volunteers, collected 1,400lb of it. Hawaii has long evoked images of a remote Pacific paradise, a land of pristine beaches and extraordinary biodiversity. But its unique location has forced the islands to reckon with an unwelcome guest: plastic debris washing up in vast quantities, sullying its waters and threatening its marine life. A 2019 study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that Hawaiian fish begin eating plastic particles just days after being born. For Larson and other activists, Kamilo Beach has become ground zero of the crisis. Hawaii sits at the center of swirling ocean currents, just east of the Great Pacific garbage patch.

In many ways, Larson\u2019s shifting relationship with plastic mirrors that of wider society \u2013 once hailed as a wonder-material, plastic is now a reviled pollutant found on every corner of the planet and deep inside our bodies. \u201cLiterally, plastic was so cool when I was growing up in the 90s,\u201d Larson says. \u201cYou had to have slap bracelets and banana clips in order not to be teased at school.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to look back on that perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember having one of these moments in a college geology class where everything flashes in front of your face and I realized, oh my God, that\u2019s not right, that\u2019s my plastic, and fish are eating that.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Hawaii\u2019s remarkable wildlife has been particularly hard hit. Across the islands, marine wildlife agents continue to find humpback whales ensnared in abandoned fishing nets and turtles hooked on plastic bags, while fishermen routinely haul in catches of fish with plastic-filled bodies. Longtime residents describe a transformation of their homeland from pure to plastic-riddled. Roger Bialas, who has been spearfishing around Oahu for over 30 years, says the waters \u201cused to be crystal clear\u201d. \u201cIt was like swimming in an aquarium. Every color of fish you could think of.\u201d Now he sees a lot of \u201cfood wrappers, shopping bags\u201d, as well as fishing lines. \u201cSometimes after being in the ocean, back on land, my skin feels dirty,\u201d he adds. Reef fish, commonly eaten by local fishermen, are often the most likely to consume plastic particles, but the contamination doesn\u2019t stop there. Many of those reef fish are eaten by larger fish, such as tuna, which absorb the plastics into their fatty tissues. In a culture that celebrates fresh fish and raw dishes such as poke, many fear for the health repercussions. Ted Clark is a spearfisher and glass sculptor who shares his catch with family, neighbors, and others in need of food. He lives on the east side of Oahu, and has seen the plastic trash increase over the last decade. \u201cI hate cutting out plastic from fish,\u201d he says, explaining that fish do not know the difference between plastic and food, especially when they\u2019re in a feeding frenzy. At a 400-year-old fishpond in K\u0101ne\u2018ohe Bay on Oahu \u2013 one of many built by ancient Hawaiians that allowed saltwater in through the porous rocks, while keeping fish from escaping \u2013 plastic trash collects on the high watermark along its rock walls, according to Rosalyn \u201cRoz\u201d Ku\u2018uleimomi Rubio Dias Concepcion. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen an increase in plastic washing up on shore since I\u2019ve started, and I would have to say in the last three to four years it\u2019s become more of an issue,\u201d she says. Concepcion described the plastic debris that floats around and into the Waikalua Loko fishpond as \u201ca constant thing\u201d. Crates, bottles, straws and nets, she said, also wash into the fishpond during the \u201cextreme high tides\u201d. She says they\u2019ve found fish in the pond and surrounding bay eating algae that grows off the floating plastic. \u201cThey are digesting the very fine, fine microparticles. Then you find it\u2019s in their stomach.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Hawaii\u2019s efforts to push back on rampant plastics consumption have been among the boldest in the country. In 2015, it became the first state in the US to ban plastic bags at grocery stores. Earlier this year, Maui and the Big Island banned polystyrene containers. And Honolulu, the state\u2019s capital, in December passed one of the most restrictive plastic bans in the US, prohibiting all single-use plastic food containers, including straws and utensils, as well as Styrofoam. Steven Colbert, the department chair of the marine science program at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at Hilo, describes the bans as positive steps, saying the state needs to reduce its dependence on these materials as well as figure out ways to prevent them from getting into the environment. \u201cA lot of those Styrofoam containers were being used to take your plate lunch down to go to the beach to eat it,\u201d says Colbert. \u201cAnd then they weren\u2019t being disposed of properly and that Styrofoam was getting into our oceans.\u201d Data collected by the HWF has been used in support of legislation to reduce plastic use. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about the chemistry of plastic, it will never go away,\u201d says Megan Lamson, a scientist and cleanup volunteer with HWF. \u201cWhen your bathtub is overflowing, you have to turn off the water before you start baling.\u201d Her words ring truer here than on the mainland US \u2013 when you\u2019re surrounded by thousands of miles of blue Pacific, making plastic \u201cgo away\u201d is a challenge. The state\u2019s landfills are reaching capacity, forcing the local counties to look for alternatives. As a result of market volatility in the wake of China\u2019s new limits on plastic imports, Hawaii county officials announced in October that they would no longer accept plastic recycling, diverting thousands of tons of additional waste to landfill. Kauai county, meanwhile, has also begun landfilling once-recyclable plastics, while on Oahu, most trash is now being incinerated. \u201cWe are in a literal state of emergency when it comes to our municipal waste,\u201d says Lamson. Most experts agree that without big changes in the way corporations produce and consumers use plastics, places like Hawaii will continue to bear the brunt of the planet\u2019s dependency. In the meantime, volunteers continue to fight the rising tide, piece by piece. Back at Kamilo, a group of Canadian engineers prepared to test the Hoola One, a vacuum-like machine that collects sand and separates the microplastics. These tiny fragments, formed when plastic breaks down, are the greatest challenge during beach cleanups. The group glanced nervously at each other, admitting they were not expecting such rough roads. The machine sits on the back of a trailer with small tires not equipped for off-roading on jagged lava rock. But the group remained hopeful. A few days later, they report back. The machine removed 230lb of microplastics in just a few days. It\u2019s only a start, and there\u2019s a long way to go. But the crew doesn\u2019t plan on giving up. \u201cIf we can clean up Kamilo,\u201d says Samuel Duval, a Hoola One engineer, \u201cwe can clean up anywhere in the world.\u201d",

The only 21st-century releases on the list are Amy Winehouse\u2019s 2006 album Back to Black (5) and Lana Del Rey\u2019s 2011 debut Born to Die (10), the only original album from the 2010s to chart. The soundtrack to Marvel\u2019s first Guardians of the Galaxy film, released in 2014, placed third with 367,000 sales, but features solely music released between 1968 and 1979. Expanded allegations of child sex abuse by Michael Jackson do not appear to have affected his sales: Thriller placed sixth, selling with more than 334,000 copies. Abbey Road also topped vinyl sales for 2019 in the US, thanks to an elaborate box set reissue to mark its 50th anniversary. It was a similar story when the Official Charts Company revealed the UK\u2019s biggest-selling vinyl LPs of the decade in late December: the only album from the 2010s to place in the Top 10 was Arctic Monkeys\u2019 2013 release, AM. Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Rumours topped the list, which saw similar high rankings to the US for Back to Black (2), Dark Side of the Moon (3), the Guardians of the Galaxy OST (4) and Legend (10). The British public preferred Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band to Abbey Road, with the Beatles\u2019 1967 album placing eighth. The Top 10 also offered some national variation, with the Stone Roses\u2019 debut placing fifth and Oasis\u2019s (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory, seventh. The British Phonographic Industry recently reported that 2019 marked the 12th consecutive year of vinyl sales growth, with 4.3m LPs sold. Vinyl albums account for one in every eight albums bought in the UK across digital and physical formats. In 2019, Liam Gallagher\u2019s Why Me? Why Not was the most popular album on the format. Billie Eilish\u2019s debut, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? placed second, with Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Rumours at No 3.

      "body": "<p>It went from a scurrilous rumour to full-blown scandal within 24 hours: the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-say-they-are-stepping-back-from-royal-family\" title=\"\">stepping back</a> from their royal duties and mulling a move to North America. And according to a \u201cpal\u201d initially quoted in a recent Sun exclusive, they\u2019re likely to set up shop in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2020/jan/08/canada-the-perfect-place-for-brits-to-live-post-brexit\" title=\"\">Canada</a>, following what seemed like a lovely Christmas holiday on drizzly Vancouver Island.</p> <p>As a lifelong Canadian, and avowed anti-monarchist who winces every time he passes a Canadian $20 note bearing the Queen\u2019s visage, I say through gritted teeth: welcome, royal overlords, to our glorious Commonwealth manor! Stay a while: sample the motley fruits assembled before you at our multicultural buffet; laugh madly as your royal motorcade blasts down the expanses of the <a href=\"https://www.transcanadahighway.com/\" title=\"\">Trans-Canada </a><a href=\"https://www.transcanadahighway.com/\" title=\"\">highway</a>, and be loudly and robustly booed as your faces grace the enormous Jumbotron at a Canadian football game!</p> <p>If, as the gossip suggests, Prince Harry, Meghan and the wee baby Archie do plan on spending a considerable portion of the year in the chilliest of Britain\u2019s former dependencies, I can offer a few good-faith tips to assist them in integrating into the customs and culture of Canada.</p> <p>The historic home of Canada Goose-branded parkas and the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, Canada is a hub of high fashion. Lest Harry and Meghan be outed as our social and political betters, they\u2019d do well to ditch the crowns, sceptres and garlands of invaluable gems and jewels, and dress the part of your average Canuck. I\u2019m talking red-and-black flannel shirts, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/06/30/old-canadian-retailers_n_10758688.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMm9-RyG-084ovoTw_t8hl7cfbrOv108j1GbUztdv8T6orEbpsgL_OOFYegOQV_BSVUtgvlS-1nnMr1NlTHHKt9kg_tJVh29hkItANRaTxnsz8bafnCDhyuCZ7a_XNeD_l7wxdoTT9Ue7o20As_9sqwqpn21raz0afaCepU7m3nZ\" title=\"\">Randy River</a> denim jeans, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukluk\" title=\"\">mukluk boots</a> (the bigger the better), and the cherry on top \u2013 a vintage <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_Canada\" title=\"\">Roots</a> cap of the kind famously sported by the disgraced Canadian Olympic snowboarder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/26/ross-rebagliati-weed-wada-ban-cannabis\" title=\"\">Ross Rebagliati</a>. So attired, the royals will pass seamlessly as a couple of workaday \u201chosers\u201d. And, by the way, while you might think \u201choser\u201d is an insult \u2013 referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/16/hockey-weed-and-taxes-canadian-stereotypes-debunked\" title=\"\">stereotype</a> of a beer-swilling, proudly uncultivated Canadian \u2013 it\u2019s actually a term of endearment. So, Harry and Meghan, use it freely. In fact: refer to anyone and everyone you meet as a hoser.</p> <p>As far as lodging goes, Canada offers plenty of luxe options. Obviously, Vancouver \u2013 where a penthouse condo was recently listed for $26m \u2013 offers pricey lodging befitting a duke and duchess. Ottawa, the nation\u2019s capital and so-called \u201ccity that fun forgot\u201d may be suitable. If you squint, the parliament buildings faintly resemble palaces. Maybe? But really, there\u2019s no choice more suitable than Toronto, aka \u201cCanada\u2019s only city\u201d.</p> <p>While Toronto may be more known for its glass-and-concrete architecture, we can\u2019t expect the Sussexes to feather their nest in such unfeeling, brutalist trappings. Meghan may have lived under the radar in Toronto for years, relative to her life now, while filming the TV <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2018/apr/26/meghan-markle-exits-tv-show-suits-with-a-wedding-video-report\" title=\"\">legal drama Suits</a>, but a royal (even a reluctant one) can hardly afford to remain inconspicuous. The duchess and her duke are far more likely to install themselves along the Bridle Path, a celebrity-rich strip of real estate in North York, which the likes of Drake and C\u00e9line Dion have called it home. Granted, the Bridle Path is known as \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Row\u201d, which may be more than a little vulgar for members of a royal line of succession. But all the same, it offers a rare opportunity for the Sussexes to slum it, and connect with the baseborn rabble from the comfort of a modest, 40,000 sq ft pied-\u00e0-terre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ea30cd8d9233a8c0b5ce77fc12cfe46d4075565\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ea30cd8d9233a8c0b5ce77fc12cfe46d4075565/0_0_5368_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toronto Maple Leafs players celebrate a goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If the duke and duchess and their bounding royal baby are keen on understanding the lot of the common Canadian, there is one shortcut: ice hockey.\u2019 Toronto Maple Leafs players celebrate a goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Turchiaro/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And speaking of French words: do Harry and Meghan know that Canada has about 7.2 million people for whom French is their first language? And, sorry to say, but they have even less tolerance for the royals than many of us anglophones. Still, ancient enmities dating back at least as far as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War\" title=\"\">Seven Years\u2019 War</a> can\u2019t last forever, right? I heartily encourage Harry to waltz into a bar in a Montreal neighbourhood such as Pointe-Saint-Charles and proudly announce himself as the prince of England.

Yes, it\u2019s our national pastime. But more than that, pro hockey proves the one place where anyone, no matter their rank or station in life, can join together in one of the nation\u2019s genuinely unifying, communal rituals: watching our homegrown teams get trounced in the playoffs. If Harry and Meghan do fully disentangle themselves from their historic obligations and ditch the royals, they\u2019re bound to find a new family among the ranks packing out the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosebleed_section\" title=\"\">nosebleeds</a> of the nation\u2019s hockey arenas, comforting themselves with quixotic talk about things working out better next year.

And according to a \u201cpal\u201d initially quoted in a recent Sun exclusive, they\u2019re likely to set up shop in Canada, following what seemed like a lovely Christmas holiday on drizzly Vancouver Island. As a lifelong Canadian, and avowed anti-monarchist who winces every time he passes a Canadian $20 note bearing the Queen\u2019s visage, I say through gritted teeth: welcome, royal overlords, to our glorious Commonwealth manor! Stay a while: sample the motley fruits assembled before you at our multicultural buffet; laugh madly as your royal motorcade blasts down the expanses of the Trans-Canada highway, and be loudly and robustly booed as your faces grace the enormous Jumbotron at a Canadian football game! If, as the gossip suggests, Prince Harry, Meghan and the wee baby Archie do plan on spending a considerable portion of the year in the chilliest of Britain\u2019s former dependencies, I can offer a few good-faith tips to assist them in integrating into the customs and culture of Canada. The historic home of Canada Goose-branded parkas and the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, Canada is a hub of high fashion. Lest Harry and Meghan be outed as our social and political betters, they\u2019d do well to ditch the crowns, sceptres and garlands of invaluable gems and jewels, and dress the part of your average Canuck. I\u2019m talking red-and-black flannel shirts, Randy River denim jeans, mukluk boots (the bigger the better), and the cherry on top \u2013 a vintage Roots cap of the kind famously sported by the disgraced Canadian Olympic snowboarder Ross Rebagliati. So attired, the royals will pass seamlessly as a couple of workaday \u201chosers\u201d. And, by the way, while you might think \u201choser\u201d is an insult \u2013 referring to the stereotype of a beer-swilling, proudly uncultivated Canadian \u2013 it\u2019s actually a term of endearment. So, Harry and Meghan, use it freely. In fact: refer to anyone and everyone you meet as a hoser. As far as lodging goes, Canada offers plenty of luxe options. Obviously, Vancouver \u2013 where a penthouse condo was recently listed for $26m \u2013 offers pricey lodging befitting a duke and duchess. Ottawa, the nation\u2019s capital and so-called \u201ccity that fun forgot\u201d may be suitable. If you squint, the parliament buildings faintly resemble palaces. Maybe? But really, there\u2019s no choice more suitable than Toronto, aka \u201cCanada\u2019s only city\u201d. While Toronto may be more known for its glass-and-concrete architecture, we can\u2019t expect the Sussexes to feather their nest in such unfeeling, brutalist trappings. Meghan may have lived under the radar in Toronto for years, relative to her life now, while filming the TV legal drama Suits, but a royal (even a reluctant one) can hardly afford to remain inconspicuous. The duchess and her duke are far more likely to install themselves along the Bridle Path, a celebrity-rich strip of real estate in North York, which the likes of Drake and C\u00e9line Dion have called it home. Granted, the Bridle Path is known as \u201cMillionaire\u2019s Row\u201d, which may be more than a little vulgar for members of a royal line of succession. But all the same, it offers a rare opportunity for the Sussexes to slum it, and connect with the baseborn rabble from the comfort of a modest, 40,000 sq ft pied-\u00e0-terre. And speaking of French words: do Harry and Meghan know that Canada has about 7.2 million people for whom French is their first language? And, sorry to say, but they have even less tolerance for the royals than many of us anglophones. Still, ancient enmities dating back at least as far as the Seven Years\u2019 War can\u2019t last forever, right? I heartily encourage Harry to waltz into a bar in a Montreal neighbourhood such as Pointe-Saint-Charles and proudly announce himself as the prince of England. Who better to offer up an olive branch that can ease the hitherto irreconcilable tensions between Canada\u2019s two solitudes? Finally, it may sound awfully cliched, but if the duke and duchess and their bouncing royal baby are keen on understanding the lot of the common Canadian, there is one shortcut: ice hockey. Yes, it\u2019s our national pastime. But more than that, pro hockey proves the one place where anyone, no matter their rank or station in life, can join together in one of the nation\u2019s genuinely unifying, communal rituals: watching our homegrown teams get trounced in the playoffs. If Harry and Meghan do fully disentangle themselves from their historic obligations and ditch the royals, they\u2019re bound to find a new family among the ranks packing out the nosebleeds of the nation\u2019s hockey arenas, comforting themselves with quixotic talk about things working out better next year. Welcome, Sussexes, to the land of the beautiful losers. \u2022 John Semley is the author of Hater: On the Virtues of Utter Disagreeability",

The RFS has warned a new fire in Faulconbridge in the Blue Mountains could take a turn around midnight when the change sweeps through.</p> <p>In Victoria there are eight fires at emergency warning level:</p> <ul> <li>Noorinbee and surrounding areas</li> <li>Walwa fire and surrounding areas</li> <li>Abbeyard fire 8km east-south-east of Abbeyard, travelling north-west towards the King Valley Area</li> <li>Mount Buffalo fire travelling in a north-easterly direction towards Bright</li> <li>Harrietville fire, currently travelling towards Myrtleford</li> <li>Two additional warnings for the Abbeyard fire for Davenport Village, Dinner Plain, Happy Valley and a number of towns close by</li> <li>Wodonga for a grass fire that is out of control</li> </ul> <p>An additional four fires are at watch and act level.

Let me tell you about another fire in <strong>Harrietville</strong>, seven years ago. </p> <p>It explains a lot about the risk assessment process that is currently used by firefighters in Victoria.</p> <p>On 13 February 2013, firefighters <strong>Steven Kadar</strong>, 34, and <strong>Katie Peters</strong>, 19, were travelling in a convoy heading out of the Buckland Valley.</p> <p>They had been working on a backburning operation at the Pheasant Creek Track, a 4WD track in a heavily forested mountainous region north of Omeo. </p> <p>It was an alpine ash forest. Tree clearing crews were in there at the same time \u2014 unusual, as that\u2019s usually done first. Thunderstorm activity was picking up. When the call came to get out, Kadar and Peters were the first ute in line when a \u201cgiant\u201d alpine ash did what alpine ash is wont to do in hot weather and strong winds, and fell to the ground, crushing their vehicle.</p> <p>They were the third and fourth firefighters to die that season. </p> <p>Peters was on her gap year and had picked up a summer firefighting gig. A lot of Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) firefighters \u2014 they are the ones in green overalls \u2014 are in the same position. Kadar was a career firefighter with nine years experience. He had earlier expressed concern about the risk of falling trees.</p> <p>An inquest in 2015 made ten recommendations around the need to improve communication between the fireground and incident control, two-way relaying of weather information, and improved safety provisions. </p> <p>If you are wondering why the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and FFMV has appeared extremely cautious in pulling firefighters out of certain situations, this is partly why. </p> <p>This inquest is built on findings from the Black Saturday royal commission. It\u2019s also why, if you have ever done a fire briefing in Victoria, you would have heard a lot about \u201c<strong>red flag warnings</strong>\u201d. </p> <p>A red flag warning is issued when there is \u201ca significant change to any critical information that may adversely affect the safety of personnel located at an emergency\u201d. It is given priority over any radio traffic except a mayday call.</p> <p>This is from DELWP\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/20116/FINAL-DELWP-Harrivetille-response-16032016.pdf\">response to the coroner\u2019s report:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Communications and awareness, policies and procedures, and staff capability, are all required as no single measure alone will fully mitigate the risk to staff safety. The Department is also actively working on creating a safety culture across the workforce that embeds a sense of collective responsibility with everyone being encouraged to be aware of safety risks and speaking up about possible safety compromises.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T08:01:21.485Z\">at 8.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e182b6c8f08c39722648058\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T07:45:03.242Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A sea of umbrellas in Melbourne. <br><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joshuabadge/status/1215539434575122437\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THOUSANDS have braved torrential rain in Naarm (Melbourne) for tonight\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/climateprotest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#climateprotest</a> at the State Library.

They have about 15 bulldozers in the field building fire breaks today but Hamilton is not coordinating that.</p> <p>He\u2019s at their home and business headquarters at Whorouly, which is also under an evacuation alert, preparing it for the possible arrival of fire.</p> <p>Asked how this compared to other fire seasons he had experienced in the Ovens region, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t recall anything so big as this, so early in the season. And this is not about to go out either, I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p> <p>The Victorian alpine region, including the area around Mt Buffalo, burned in 2002-2003, 2006-2007 and 2009. The total area burned in Victoria so far this summer has already exceeded those fires, topping 1.2m hectares.</p> <p>Hamilton again: \u201cIt\u2019s not good. It\u2019s not a lot of fun. I feel for everyone involved. There would be nothing like four inches of good rain right about now.\u201d </p> <p>The main Abbeyard fire is currently 60,000ha in size and spot fires have been reported at its western edge, at <strong>Whorouly South</strong> and <strong>Carboor</strong>. There\u2019s an emergency warning current for the <strong>King Valley</strong> and <strong>Whitfield </strong>on the western edge, and <strong>Mt Hotham</strong> which is sandwiched between that and another fire. </p> <p>Evacuate now warnings have been issued for three sides of the Abbeyard fire, taking in <strong>almost all of the King and Ovens River valleys.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T05:25:57.991Z\">at 5.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1806318f087e8308e6bc58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T05:12:22.721Z\">5.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019ve spent the past day or so seeking some clarification around the NSW and Queensland compensation schemes for volunteer firefighters.</p> <p>This week the Queensland government released details about its scheme. NSW\u2019s is expected to be the same but they haven\u2019t released as much detail.</p> <ul> <li>The federally-funded but state-administered scheme provides for \u201cincome lost\u201d by firefighters, capped at $300 per day, depending on what the individual earns after tax, up to a total of $6,000 per firefighter, with proof of lost income.</li> <li>They must have volunteered as part of an operational response to bushfires or provided direct operational support between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020, and it doesn\u2019t include non-emergency operations such as hazard reduction burns, or catering and brigade support.</li> <li>Eligible volunteers must have experienced loss of income from being self-employed, or from being an employee of a business with annual turnover of less than $50m, and who has exhausted all paid leave entitlements (not including long service leave, annual recreational leave, or sick leave).</li> <li>Casual employees can claim for lost income if they were volunteering on a day they were rostered to work.</li> </ul> <p>However, the eligibility requirements released this week have caused concern. Below are clarifications or responses to those concerns.</p> <p><strong>The payments only kick in after a volunteer has spent 10 days in total on the fireground, and only pays for the loss of income in the days which follow.</strong></p> <p>A spokesman for natural disaster response minister, David Littleproud, defended the threshold.</p> <p>\u201cThe 10 days volunteering is a qualifying period for the government\u2019s reimbursement for volunteer firefighters. This is a sensible period of volunteering before being eligible for the reimbursement.\u201d</p> <p>The RFSA also defended it, saying the vast majority of volunteers are happy putting their time in and they haven\u2019t heard many complaints about people really suffering, although a few people have said they\u2019ll be applying to the scheme.</p> <p><strong>The compensation payments cover only the hours of work lost \u2013 for instance, someone who misses a 9am-5pm work day to fight a fire until 11pm will only be paid for eight hours\u2019 work.</strong><br></p> <p>This is true, however Guardian Australia understands a volunteer would be covered for lost income if they were unable to go to work because they had been fighting fires all through the previous night and needed to sleep. There is some confusion around this, though. The Queensland scheme helpline wasn\u2019t across the details so much, and the NSW government directed queries to Littleproud.</p> <p><strong>Self-employed farmers have also balked at the scheme, querying how they can prove lost income.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe real problem is that, even in a good season, and we\u2019re in the worst season this area has ever experienced, we don\u2019t have a regular workday income,\u201d Burnett Creek grazier Glenn Fearby <a href=\"https://www.fassifernguardian.com/bloody-biased-farmers-fume-over-firie-compensation\">told the Fassifern Guardian</a>, which first reported the restrictions.</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands this part of the scheme is still being worked on but that it is expected to use current provisions for quantifying the value of a particular farmer\u2019s income value in a day, and it would take into account the season but not the drought.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1804198f08c39722647fb5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T05:00:39.346Z\">5.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">First NSW emergency alert today</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The RFS have just issued the first emergency alert for a fire in NSW today.

In New South Wales, there are three emergency warning fires: Dunns Road, East Ournie Creek, Green Valley. All three blazes have merged and are located in the Snowy Valley region near the Victoria border. A 90km/h southerly is worsening conditions in NSW, and one male firefighter in his mid-20s suffered burns to his face fighting fires in the Snowy Valley region. The Green Valley fire is now 233,000 hectares in size, and is moving to Mundaroo, Tumbarumba and Mannus. Another three fires are at watch-and-act level. The southerly will continue up New South Wales and reach Sydney at around 2am. The RFS has warned a new fire in Faulconbridge in the Blue Mountains could take a turn around midnight when the change sweeps through. In Victoria there are eight fires at emergency warning level: Noorinbee and surrounding areas Walwa fire and surrounding areas Abbeyard fire 8km east-south-east of Abbeyard, travelling north-west towards the King Valley Area Mount Buffalo fire travelling in a north-easterly direction towards Bright Harrietville fire, currently travelling towards Myrtleford Two additional warnings for the Abbeyard fire for Davenport Village, Dinner Plain, Happy Valley and a number of towns close by Wodonga for a grass fire that is out of control An additional four fires are at watch and act level. A southerly has been passing through Victoria on its way to New South Wales. Severe thunderstorm predictions did not come to pass, but the CFA has warned conditions could worsen tonight. For up-to-date information on the fires in NSW, click here. For up-to-date information on the fires in Victoria, click here. Until tomorrow, stay safe. There\u2019s now what media (but not RFS) refer to as a megablaze in the Kosciuszko national park with three fires at emergency level in that area of southern NSW, just near the Victorian border. There\u2019s also concern that a fire at watch-and-act level in Faulconbridge in the Blue Mountains could worsen around midnight once the southerly reaches there. People in the Wentworth Falls and Leura areas are being advised to stay alert. There are also reports the Green Valley fire, which the East Ournie Creek fire has merged with, has also merged with the fire on the other side of the border with Victoria. We are expecting an update from the RFS shortly. Here\u2019s some video of the grass fire in Wodonga. CFA now warns the grass fire in Wodonga is travelling towards Killara in addition to Baranduda. People are being advised to seek shelter indoors immediately because it is too late to leave. NSW RFS has issued an emergency warning for Green Valley, Talmalmo. The fire is burning east and north of Jingellic. It is too late to leave, and residents are advised to seek shelter. An emergency warning has been issued for a grass fire out of control at Beechworth-Wodonga Rd, Wodonga. The fire is travelling in an easterly direction towards Baranduda. The Bureau of Meteorology in Victoria has cancelled its severe thunderstorm warning for the East Gippsland and north-east districts. The immediate threat of thunderstorms has passed but warnings could still be issued if the situation changes, Bom says. Rain has fallen across Kangaroo Island today, and the warning levels have been reduced, but properties have still been lost and firefighters injured, AAP reports. Assessments are underway, but some homes are believed lost at Vivonne Bay while the town of Parndana was spared for a second time, despite fire bearing down on it from several directions. Both towns had been evacuated amid emergency warnings and the escalating danger. Two Country Fire Service trucks were involved in burn-overs and two more CFS personnel were injured, taking the total hurt on Kangaroo Island to 22. Nine News is reporting people in Mogo were being denied disaster payments from Centrelink because the maps the government has show the fires didn\u2019t burn near their properties. As usually happens with these things, the people featured in the story were given their payments after media intervened. Another aerial shot of the Sydney protest. Daniel Andrews talked about the evacuation of Harrietville in that press conference. Let me tell you about another fire in Harrietville, seven years ago. It explains a lot about the risk assessment process that is currently used by firefighters in Victoria. On 13 February 2013, firefighters Steven Kadar, 34, and Katie Peters, 19, were travelling in a convoy heading out of the Buckland Valley. They had been working on a backburning operation at the Pheasant Creek Track, a 4WD track in a heavily forested mountainous region north of Omeo. It was an alpine ash forest. Tree clearing crews were in there at the same time \u2014 unusual, as that\u2019s usually done first. Thunderstorm activity was picking up. When the call came to get out, Kadar and Peters were the first ute in line when a \u201cgiant\u201d alpine ash did what alpine ash is wont to do in hot weather and strong winds, and fell to the ground, crushing their vehicle. They were the third and fourth firefighters to die that season. Peters was on her gap year and had picked up a summer firefighting gig. A lot of Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) firefighters \u2014 they are the ones in green overalls \u2014 are in the same position. Kadar was a career firefighter with nine years experience. He had earlier expressed concern about the risk of falling trees. An inquest in 2015 made ten recommendations around the need to improve communication between the fireground and incident control, two-way relaying of weather information, and improved safety provisions. If you are wondering why the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and FFMV has appeared extremely cautious in pulling firefighters out of certain situations, this is partly why. This inquest is built on findings from the Black Saturday royal commission. It\u2019s also why, if you have ever done a fire briefing in Victoria, you would have heard a lot about \u201cred flag warnings\u201d. A red flag warning is issued when there is \u201ca significant change to any critical information that may adversely affect the safety of personnel located at an emergency\u201d. It is given priority over any radio traffic except a mayday call. This is from DELWP\u2019s response to the coroner\u2019s report: Communications and awareness, policies and procedures, and staff capability, are all required as no single measure alone will fully mitigate the risk to staff safety. The Department is also actively working on creating a safety culture across the workforce that embeds a sense of collective responsibility with everyone being encouraged to be aware of safety risks and speaking up about possible safety compromises. A sea of umbrellas in Melbourne. We have an update now from the NSW RFS commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons. He says there is a new fire in the Blue Mountains near Faulconbridge. Firefighters are also concerned about a fire north of Coonabarabran. Firefronts around the Eden district and Bega are not as bad as the RFS thought they would be and are quite contained at this stage, he says. Huuuuge. A shot of the size of the crowd in Sydney. The latest from NSW. We are getting some photos come through on Twitter from the various climate protests around Australia. The Australian Academy of Science has issued a strongly worded statement calling on the government to do more on climate change in the wake of the bushfire crisis. The president of the academy, John Shine, suggests the response to the fires should be sweeping and transformative, including Australia taking stronger action on climate to reflect its part in the worldwide commitment made in Paris to limit global warming to as close to 1.5C as possible. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has downplayed the role Australia can play in addressing the climate crisis, saying nothing it did to reduce emissions would have changed this bushfire season. Shine says the scale of the bushfires is unprecedented anywhere in the world, and offers the academy\u2019s sympathy to those who have lost loved ones and been directly and indirectly affected: \u201cThe scientific evidence base shows that as the world warms due to human induced climate change, we experience an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. As a nation, we must deal with extreme weather events more effectively than we currently do. As such events become more frequent and severe, we must adapt Australia and Australians accordingly, as well as strengthen mitigation efforts. Australia must take stronger action as it\u2019s part of the worldwide commitment to limit global warming to 1.5C above the long-term average to reduce the worst impacts of climate change. To have the best chance of succeeding, we must draw on all the available evidence and knowledge, including working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and undertaking further research where it will have the most benefit.\u201d On the climate protests about to kick off in capital cities across the country, Andrews says people have the right to protest, but claims (despite Victoria Police saying otherwise) that the protest will \u201cdivert resources away from critical needs\u201d. He also took a kick at the former Liberal government on climate change policy. \u201cOur government is very proud to have not just talked about climate change, but to have got on and taken real action to deal with it. That is very different to, perhaps, other governments, that have been in power in our state. We are very proud of that.\u201d He said the states need to be part of any federal review of the bushfire season, whether or not that takes the form of a royal commission. Crisp reiterates: \u201cToday is not over.\u201d The next four hours will be crucial. Crisp says while people have the right to stay in their home, it does make it difficult for firefighters. Andrews says it can be the difference between saving a home and saving a life. If your plan, as good as your plan might be, if it relies on a CFA truck or a forest fire management truck or anybody else from the emergency services being at your front gate and you receive a warning on the text, then you need to go. Because what that warning is telling you is that we will not be able to be there for you, and even if we were, the ferocity of these fires, we couldn\u2019t guarantee your safety. Police minister Lisa Neville says in Bright and Harrietville, large containers containing satellite phones, baby formula, food, nappies and torches have been put in preparation for the possibility that those two areas could be cut off. This is the first time a deployment of supplies has been made before fires hit those communities. Emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp is now providing more info. It\u2019s a couple of hours before the change in weather, he said, and there are two or three hours after the change where there will be strong, squally winds. It is expected that there will be up to 15mm rain in an area north of Bairnsdale and there could be the potential for flash flooding. He reiterates that the fire in the Snowy region of NSW will join with the one in the alpine region of Victoria today. \u201cThese next few hours will be very, very challenging\u201d, Andrews says. The areas of most concern are around the fire around Mount Buffalo, the fire above Cann River, and the communities like Bruthen and Buchan. At the moment there is no one unaccounted for, no more people have died, and no more communities are cut off, but he says that can change quickly. Here\u2019s the latest update on Victoria from premier Daniel Andrews: There are 21 going fires, more than 1.3 million hectares burnt out. We have three evacuate now notices issued, seven emergency warnings and around a dozen watch and act advice in a dozen communities. Even with rain and forecast better conditions next week, Andrews says that there is a long way to go and it is very early on in the fire season. A total of 286 residential properties have been damaged or destroyed in Victoria, and 400 outbuildings damaged or destroyed. Here is how the rain is travelling in Victoria. An emergency warning has now been issued with Bright, Eurobin, Happy Valley, Kancoona South, Ovens, Porepunkah, Rosewhite and Kancoona. People are still advised to leave now before conditions become too dangerous. Lots of smoke around Mount Buffalo now. People in Victoria\u2019s north east and East Gippland regions are being told they need to evacuate soon. From AAP: A cool change passing through the state will bring strong southwesterly winds of 70km/h to 100km/h to the regions about 7pm on Friday. People in alpine towns have been warned they can evacuate until 7.50pm, but then it will be too late to leave. \u201cEvacuation after this time is considered life threatening\u201d, the VicEmergency warning reads. \u201cShelter indoors when the fire arrives \u2013 protect yourself from the radiant heat.\u201d Six emergency alerts are in place while three evacuation alerts have been issued. Relief centres are set up in Bonegilla, Myrtleford and Wangaratta for evacuees. Luke Heagerty from the State Control Centre says there is a \u201creal possibility\u201d the fires in the region will merge with those near the NSW border. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping is that with the rainfall that\u2019s coming with this change there will be at least some moisture in the air, which we know does slow the spread of fires\u201d, he told 3AW. \u201cSo we\u2019re hoping that bit of rainfall could at least avoid the merging of some of those fires or the spread of other fires in Victoria.\u201d Despite the expected up to 10mm of rainfall, it is \u201chighly likely\u201d dozens of blazes will merge, and the fires are expected to go for some weeks. The rainfall could also create slippery conditions for firefighting vehicles. Josh Taylor here taking over from my colleague Naaman Zhou, taking you into this evening with condition worsening. Thanks to Naaman for running the blog this afternoon. Our data team have also updated our animated graphic of how the fires have spread \u2013 looking at specific fires all across the country. The East Ournie Creek fire (which stretches to the Victorian border) is now only 300m away from merging with the Dunns Road fire. It is almost inevitable that many fires in the south will join, Fitzsimmons says. There has been increased fire activity around the Tumut and Tumbarumba area, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s resulting in a couple of the fires continuing to join up in a number of locations. We will end up with, at the end of today and whatever happens tonight, with another complex of fires that have all joined together to create another large challenge.\u201d In good news, Fitzsimmons says the fires near Kosciuszko national park are not posing any threat to the ski resorts of Thredbo and Perisher. Fires today are staying within the RFS\u2019s predicted spread map, Fitzsimmons says, but \u201cwe still have many hours to go of these north westerlies strengthening ahead of the frontal activity\u201d. That new fire in the Blue Mountains is not a threat to homes, he says, and is \u201cstill a few kilometres north of the townships\u201d. Water bombing aircraft are up and blanketing that fire. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons and premier Gladys Berejiklian are speaking now. They say that two new fires have sprung up \u2013 the emergency fire near Coonabarabran, and one in the Blue Mountains. Indications are both were started by lightning strikes, Fitzsimmons says. An update on the new emergency fire near Coonabarabran. The Newell Highway is now closed between Coonabarabran and Narrabri. The fire is moving southwest. But the Oxley highway is still open north to south. The message to properties nearby is to shelter in place. These fires are about 1.3km apart. I\u2019ve just had a chat to a semi-retired bulldozer operator at Whorouly in northeast Victoria, where the Abbeyard fire is burning at an emergency warning level. Doug Hamilton\u2019s family company handles local earthmoving and fire-break contracts for Hancocks Victorian Plantation Holdings (which owns the pine plantations which flank the hills on the way to Bright) as well as the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, and the CFA. They have about 15 bulldozers in the field building fire breaks today but Hamilton is not coordinating that. He\u2019s at their home and business headquarters at Whorouly, which is also under an evacuation alert, preparing it for the possible arrival of fire. Asked how this compared to other fire seasons he had experienced in the Ovens region, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t recall anything so big as this, so early in the season. And this is not about to go out either, I don\u2019t think.\u201d The Victorian alpine region, including the area around Mt Buffalo, burned in 2002-2003, 2006-2007 and 2009. The total area burned in Victoria so far this summer has already exceeded those fires, topping 1.2m hectares. Hamilton again: \u201cIt\u2019s not good. It\u2019s not a lot of fun. I feel for everyone involved. There would be nothing like four inches of good rain right about now.\u201d The main Abbeyard fire is currently 60,000ha in size and spot fires have been reported at its western edge, at Whorouly South and Carboor. There\u2019s an emergency warning current for the King Valley and Whitfield on the western edge, and Mt Hotham which is sandwiched between that and another fire. Evacuate now warnings have been issued for three sides of the Abbeyard fire, taking in almost all of the King and Ovens River valleys. I\u2019ve spent the past day or so seeking some clarification around the NSW and Queensland compensation schemes for volunteer firefighters. This week the Queensland government released details about its scheme. NSW\u2019s is expected to be the same but they haven\u2019t released as much detail. The federally-funded but state-administered scheme provides for \u201cincome lost\u201d by firefighters, capped at $300 per day, depending on what the individual earns after tax, up to a total of $6,000 per firefighter, with proof of lost income. They must have volunteered as part of an operational response to bushfires or provided direct operational support between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020, and it doesn\u2019t include non-emergency operations such as hazard reduction burns, or catering and brigade support. Eligible volunteers must have experienced loss of income from being self-employed, or from being an employee of a business with annual turnover of less than $50m, and who has exhausted all paid leave entitlements (not including long service leave, annual recreational leave, or sick leave). Casual employees can claim for lost income if they were volunteering on a day they were rostered to work. However, the eligibility requirements released this week have caused concern. Below are clarifications or responses to those concerns. The payments only kick in after a volunteer has spent 10 days in total on the fireground, and only pays for the loss of income in the days which follow. A spokesman for natural disaster response minister, David Littleproud, defended the threshold. \u201cThe 10 days volunteering is a qualifying period for the government\u2019s reimbursement for volunteer firefighters. This is a sensible period of volunteering before being eligible for the reimbursement.\u201d The RFSA also defended it, saying the vast majority of volunteers are happy putting their time in and they haven\u2019t heard many complaints about people really suffering, although a few people have said they\u2019ll be applying to the scheme. The compensation payments cover only the hours of work lost \u2013 for instance, someone who misses a 9am-5pm work day to fight a fire until 11pm will only be paid for eight hours\u2019 work. This is true, however Guardian Australia understands a volunteer would be covered for lost income if they were unable to go to work because they had been fighting fires all through the previous night and needed to sleep. There is some confusion around this, though. The Queensland scheme helpline wasn\u2019t across the details so much, and the NSW government directed queries to Littleproud. Self-employed farmers have also balked at the scheme, querying how they can prove lost income. \u201cThe real problem is that, even in a good season, and we\u2019re in the worst season this area has ever experienced, we don\u2019t have a regular workday income,\u201d Burnett Creek grazier Glenn Fearby told the Fassifern Guardian, which first reported the restrictions. Guardian Australia understands this part of the scheme is still being worked on but that it is expected to use current provisions for quantifying the value of a particular farmer\u2019s income value in a day, and it would take into account the season but not the drought. The RFS have just issued the first emergency alert for a fire in NSW today. Multiple fires have reached emergency in Victoria already. The fire is \u201cspreading quickly northeast of Coonabarabran\u201d. \u201cIf you are in Dandry Rd, Tandarra &amp; Galaxy Estate, you are at risk. It is too late to leave.\u201d Conditions will worsen across NSW as the southerly comes through. The bureau have just also issued an updated wind prediction \u2013 it will come through later than previously thought. Temperatures in Wagga Wagga have hit 41.7C, and are at 40C in Albury, as of a few minutes ago. Fire authorities have fears today that fires in the Snowy Valley will merge soon. In Victoria, Rutherglen near the NSW border is also at 40C. The bureau of meteorology\u2019s observation station in nearby Corryong is unavailable due to signal losses, and the station in Combienbar, which is being evacuated, is out due to power loss. And a reminder that if you are a university student or employee, you could also be eligible for disaster payments if affected by the fires. And in yet more sport \u2013 Commonwealth Bank have revealed themselves to be the buyer of Shane Warne\u2019s baggy green, which sold for over a million dollars in a charity auction. The bank will donate the cap to the Bradman Museum in Bowral. Speaking of football, The Matildas have just begun their charity auction too. First up: Hayley Raso\u2019s game boots from the World Cup. One for the football fans out there. A range of A-League clubs have raised money this month \u2013 offering signed shirts, charity matches and more. In other sports, Nick Kyrgios, Ash Barty, Shane Warne and dozens of sportspeople have raised millions. Today, the Central Coast Mariners have perhaps topped them all, with a unique experience that would make any hardened A-League fan\u2019s heart flutter. You could be inside the legendary Masterfoods sauce bottle mascot costume. For those who need reminding, the sauce bottle achieved infamy when it was caught on camera giving the finger to visiting fans. It has since gone down in A-League folklore. Data editor Nick Evershed went the extra mile to confirm that this is happening with the full blessing of the NSW club. Anyone who donates will be in the running to enter the costume \u2013 with terms to be finalised. The CFA have issued a new emergency warning for Ensay, Swifts Creek, Brookville and surrounding areas in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland. \u201cFire activity has increased significantly this afternoon. The south-west wind change is due between 4-6pm and may cause spot fires in private property around Swifts Creek, Brookville and Ensay. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave.\u201d In America, Trevor Noah and The Daily Show has done a segment on the fires, and their climate change links \u2013 plus a global call to donate. Emergency ADF National Support Coordinator, Maj Gen Justin \u201cJake\u201d Ellwood, just finished his daily briefing. Ellwood confirmed there are now just under 2,000 reservists on duty to assist with the bushfire effort, as well as three ships providing support and numerous aircraft. The situation on Kangaroo Island worsened at 5am today, so the ADF dispatched a C130 and a C17 aircraft to a nearby RAAF base on standby ready to assist. \u201cWe thought it prudent to have additional assets in location just in case,\u201d he said. Two air mobile teams are at the ready to launch if required in the Snowy and Alpine regions today. The Choules will land at 15.30 AEST in Mallacoota to provide more resources. The ADF have also established an emergency route to Mallacoota that is only accessible via defence\u2019s armoured vehicles. One hundred personnel have also been set up in Tasmania on 48 hours notice to move in case conditions there worsen. The exaggerated claims about arson are not restricted to English-language media. We shared this earlier but suspect we will be posting it a lot over the next few weeks: police in Victoria say the arson claim is not true. Hi all, this is Naaman Zhou taking over the blog for a while. Thanks to Calla and Helen for their work today. Lt Col John Pearce, from the Australian army, told reporters in Bairnsdale that ADF personnel had helped Victoria Police conduct aerial evacuations at Combienbar. He confirmed that some locals in the region, which is on the northern edge of the largest Gippsland fire, had refused to leave but said he could not give numbers on how many people had been evacuated, and how many remained. The helicopters are currently on their way back to the airbase in Sale. As the wind picks up over the next 24 hours, Pearce said, the helicopters will be grounded: The winds are picking up so it is getting dangerous for helicopter operations... The helicopters will be on the ground until the winds come down. The turbulence is severe. The incident controller Brett Mitchell for the Gippsland fires is addressing the media in Bairnsdale right now. He says fire activity is increasing, and will continue to do so until the wind change arrives between 4pm and 7pm tonight. That wind change will push the fire into private property around Omeo and Swifts Creek. Mitchell says they currently have water-bombing aircraft putting out spot fires at Buchan South, which has just been made subject to an emergency warning, as well as Omeo and Swifts Creek. An emergency warning for the Omeo and Swifts Creek region will be issued soon, he said. That wind change will bring winds of up to 70-100km/h as well as a chance of severe thunderstorms with both dry lightning in some parts and rainfall of between 15-20mm per hour in others. That rain is welcome, but it could impact on roads. The key message for me, not only about the rainfall but the fire situation now, particularly in those affected communities, is leave early and leave now if it is safe to do so. Monitor that wind change closely because it will be erratic and increased fire activity significantly. The fire at Combienbar, which was subject to an evacuation now warning today, is being managed out of Orbost. Mitchell said he believes an ADF helicopter had been sent to pull people out. Mitchell: I am led to believe the Australian Defence Force sent a helicopter in there to evacuate people out of Combienbar but I am not across that detail. Mitchell said an evacuation now warning, like that at Combienbar, is different to a mass community evacuation, which must be coordinated ahead of time. An evacuation of the community needs to occur early, like 24 hours ahead. Mitchell said the increased fire activity from the wind change could last until midnight. Let\u2019s check in with South Australia and the fire burning on Kangaroo Island. Two people died and 22 people have been injured in that fire, AAP has reported, including CFS volunteers who were injured in a burn-over of two fire trucks. More from that report by AAP: On Friday morning the town of Emu Bay also came under threat, with residents moved to the nearby beach but the CFS said the situation had also eased. So far more than 170,000 hectares of scrub has been burnt, including most of the famed Flinders Chase National Park, along with dozens of homes and hundreds of other buildings. In response to the situation, the ferry service from the SA mainland was asked to restrict travel to freight, local residents and emergency service personnel but that decision was expected to be reviewed later on Friday. The overnight escalation in fire activity cut power to more properties with about 850 now without electricity. SA Power Networks said its crews had been relocated to Penneshaw for safety reasons and would wait for CFS clearance before re-entering the fire zone. The fire was sparked by lightning on 20 December and escalated rapidly last Friday and Saturday, when Dick Lang and his son Clayton were killed as they returned to their family property. The operators of the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park have been defending their animals against the out-of-control bushfire which has burned through more than a third of the island. They posted this update on their social media channels: Thank you to everyone for your messages and thoughts. The park is currently safe although we are still under threat. Sam, our dad\u2019s, brother and manager Billy are all at the park defending our an animals. We are not out of the woods yet but have an amazing team protecting us . They said they are not currently taking donations of supplies like towels and pouches until they figure out what they need. Veterinarians from the Australian army provided urgent care to wildlife \u2014 mainly koalas, kangaroos, eagles and possums \u2014 in the immediate aftermath of the fire. Tony Abbott volunteering with the RFS in the Snowy Mountains Former prime minister Tony Abbott has been spotted among volunteer firefighters stationed near the Snowy Mountains, 115 kilometres south of Canberra, AAP has reported. The former prime minister received a briefing at Adaminaby, near the Snowy Mountains, where a fire is burning out of control. Firefighters are bracing for extreme conditions across Victoria, NSW and the ACT. \u201cI\u2019m one of 70,000 RFS volunteers \u2014 let\u2019s hope all of us stay safe and do good work,\u201d Mr Abbott told reporters on Friday. \u201cThe fire season has been the same for me as for everyone else, it\u2019s been long, it\u2019s been arduous.\u201d Hot weather and strong winds threaten to fan existing blazes burning through the Snowy Mountains region. Meanwhile, a senior News Corp employee has sent an explosive reply-all email to executive chairman Michael Miller, accusing the company of \u201cmisinformation\u201d and diverting attention from climate change during the bushfire crisis. Chris Knaus as all the details. If you look at the active fire map on the NSW Rural Fire Service website, you will see two fires burning in the alpine region along the NSW/Victorian border that appear to be burning closer and closer together. According to a spokesman from the RFS, if those fires have not yet merged today, they are likely to do so \u201cimminently\u201d. The spokesman told Guardian Australia that the East Ournie Creek fire (that\u2019s the Corryong fire on the NSW side of the border) was only, according to the latest mapping, \u201ca few hundred meters\u201d from the Dunns Road fire (the large fire burning in the Snowys and into Kosciuszko National Park). The fires appear to be meeting in the vicinity of Clarkes Hill Nature Reserve. The Perich clan, a wealthy rural family who are behind Australia\u2019s biggest dairy farming group, are donating $1m to the NSW Farmers Natural Disaster Relief Fund. Money from the donation will be used to support dairy farmers and other primary producers who have had their farms burned, been unable to feed or water their stock or distribute milk, the NSW Farmers Association said. The Perich family owns Australian Fresh Milk Holdings, the country\u2019s biggest dairy farmer, which milks more than 10,000 cows. Brothers Tony and Ron Perich run the family empire. \u201cWe want this money to reach the farmers and NSW Farmers will make sure that happens,\u201d Tony Perich said. \u201cWe want others to join us in supporting this bushfire appeal, our donation is a start and we will encourage everyone we know to help too.\u201d NSW Farmers president James Jackson said the organisation would be talking to charities to see what direct aid could be immediately provided to dairy farmers. \u201cOnce the immediate emergency has passed we will work with impacted farmers to provide ongoing support and implement measures to enhance sustainability of these farm businesses,\u201d he said. A message from the CFA board The board of the CFA just issued this message in support of thousands of CFA volunteers, who have been fighting fires across the state, and interstate, for weeks. The board was briefed at the state control centre in Melbourne this week. Chairman Greg Smith said the board \u201chas been impressed with the commitment of CFA members, both staff and volunteers, who are giving up their time and leaving family and work commitments to support the intensive bushfire effort\u201d. Smith said some volunteers had lost their own homes while protecting their communities. He said the focus would be on the welfare of volunteers and other CFA staff. The Board is also ensuring there is a general focus on mental health for those who have participated in this long campaign, with reporting by the CEO/CO on measures to regularly reinforce the emphasis on the welfare and safety of CFA members. Back in Victoria now. There is also an evacuation alert and emergency warning current for an out-of-control grassfire at Combienbar in East Gippsland. It\u2019s on the edge of the border fire. Firefighters were pulled out of the area late yesterday, and they are attempting to get aerial support in to place today. Back to Western Australia, WA Police have charged a 25-year-old man with arson, for allegedly lighting a bushfire in Australind, which is a beachside suburb near Bunbury, on 20 December. The man is alleged to have deliberately set a grass fire near the Collie River and caused a fire that he was not able to control. The fire was reported by a member of the public and extinguished. The charge of wilfully light or cause to be lit a fire likely to injure or damage carries a maximum sentence of 20 years jail. The man will face court in Bunbury today. Importantly: this does not mean that reports arson is to blame for this catastrophic bushfire season are suddenly correct. They are still not. You can read Chris Knaus\u2019s earlier reports about the \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d exaggerating the role of arson this bushfire season and there being no evidence that arson is responsible for any of the devastating fires in Victoria. To New South Wales now. The biggest fire threat today is in the Snowy Mountains but there are still active fires and a lot of smoke around the south coast. Surf Life Saving NSW has released a list of beach closures. This is the map of forecast fire spread in NSW today. We reported yesterday that there is a risk, according to Victorian emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp, that fires burning on either side of the border near Corryong in Victoria and Dunns Road fire in NSW could join. You can see that shown in that fire spread map. There is also a risk, Crisp said, that the Abbeyard fire could join with the East Gippsland fire, and those fires could also join a merged Corryong-Dunns Road fire. Authorities in Victoria have issued a third evacuation alert for communities on the edges of the Abbeyard fire, which is threatening the King and Ovens Valleys in northeast Victoria. Emergency alerts for the western side of the fire \u2014 the King Valley, and Carboor and surrounds, remain in place. The new evacuation alert is for the northern flank of the fire down to Harrietville, in preparation for the forecast south-westerly wind change. The communities listed in the new alert are: Brookside, Buckland, Buffalo Creek, Buffalo River, Dunphys Hill, Eurobin, Freeburgh, Harrietville, Merriang, Merriang South, Mount Buffalo, Salt Log, Selwyn, Smoko, Wandiligong, Buckland Junction, and Germantown. It means that everyone within a set distance west or north of the fire has been told to leave. The warning is current until 3.30pm today. After that point it may be too late to leave, and authorities have warned that if people choose to stay firefighters may not be able to help them. There are evacuation centres set up in Wangaratta, at the performing arts centre and the showgrounds if you have animals. Let\u2019s go to Western Australia now where a bushfire at Baldivis on the eastern fringe of Perth is burning at a watch and act level. The fire has been contained, but authorities warn that \u201cunfavourable wind conditions\u201d may cause it to breach those containment lines. About 180 firefighters are currently on the ground working to strengthen those containment lines. The fire was reported yesterday and has burned through 1,205ha in less than 24 hours. The cause has been listed as accidental, and reporters on the ground have identified a possible cause: a boat, found abandoned on its trailer on Karnup Road. This is from ABC24 reporter, James Carmody: The boat was being towed on the road on a trailer when it appears as if the tyres on the boat had burst, and that trailer was dragged along the road. We have seen the gouges in that road, that appears to have sparked a grass fire on the edge of Karnup Road. It wasn\u2019t particularly hot yesterday but with the extreme winds coming through, that picked up the fire and saw it race north-east through dozens of private properties, paddocks and bushland here. This message just came through from the UK High Commission: A team of UK experts is travelling to Australia to scope how the UK can best contribute to the Australian response to the unprecedented bushfires causing devastation across the country. As a first step in the UK\u2019s support for Australia, this team will include a senior member of the UK Fire and Rescue Service, a medical specialist in trauma and mental health, and a military liaison officer, specialising in crisis response. They will work with Australian colleagues to establish what type, extent and duration of support will be of most use to the emergency responders, and ensure that such contributions are fully integrated with Australian efforts. These specialists will liaise with regional coordinators across a number of states as well as with the central Australian government. This engagement will inform options for a future UK contribution, which would focus on areas of most pressing Australian need, including where the UK has world leading capabilities and expertise. The deployment comes following exchanges between the prime minister, foreign secretary and their Australian counterparts. On the deployment, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: Australia is one of our strongest and oldest friends and we are utterly distraught about the devastation caused by these catastrophic bushfires \u2013 including the tragic loss of life and of precious biodiversity. Despite being on opposite sides of the world, our bond is a close one, and we will do all that is possible to help them respond to and recover from this tragic situation. Emergency Victoria just issued an updated evacuation warning for communities northwest of the Abbeyard fire. The communities of Dandongadale, Merriang South, Mount Buffalo, Buffalo River and Nug Nug have been advised to evacuate ahead of fire and ember attacks. There is also an evacuation warning current for Bennies, Cheshunt South, Markous, Rose River, Top Crossing, Wabonga and Upper Rose River, which are under threat from the same fire. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for damaging winds in Victoria (the northeast, East Gippsland, and south Gippsland coast) and New South Wales (in a broad line from Broken Hill/Tibooburra and down to Albury and the southern highlands, and also the Illawarra coast). The damaging winds will reach between 65km-90km/h and are timed with that south-westerly change, which means they will impact fire weather and also possibly cause falling trees in areas previously impacted by fire. The Victorian Farmers Federation has put together a register of people offering free agistment, or \u201ccow parking\u201d, for people affected by the bushfires. The fires on the south coast of NSW, particularly the Bega Valley, as well as those in the Upper Murray and East Gippsland regions have impacted key dairy farming areas. Senior business reporter Ben Butler wrote more on that here. People and smaller pets looking for accomodation after the fires can check out Find-a-bed, a volunteer-led service that popped up in response to the bushfire crisis. (More on its origin here.) Michael Pengilly is the mayor of Kangaroo Island and a former state Liberal member for the seat of Finniss, which is on the mainland around Victor Harbour. As of yesterday, more than one third of Kangaroo Island had burned and remaining sections were under threat. This is a map of Kangaroo Island from the SA Country Fire Service website this morning. The blue section has already burned, the yellow section is under a watch and act alert. People who do not need to be on the island were advised to leave, and some residents have been cut off due to road closures, the ABC has reported. Anyway. If you want to adopt our politics live blogger Amy Remeikis, please ensure you first believe in the man-made climate emergency. It\u2019s Calla Wahlquist here, taking over from Helen Davidson. I want to look to the Abbeyard fire in Northeast Victoria first, which has triggered emergency warning and evacuate now alerts for the King Valley and Carboor on the western front of that fire today. Water authorities have told residents they will be turning off sprinklers in unattended houses to conserve water for firefighting efforts. That is likely to stress out some residents, who often put the sprinkler on the roof before evacuating. This is from the Emergency Victoria alert: People are urged to conserve tap water as much as possible, so that the town\u2019s don\u2019t run out of water before a fire front arrives. North East Water staff and other authorised officers have been directed to enter unattended properties to turn-off garden sprinkler. A \u201cleave now\u201d warning was issued for most of eastern Victoria late yesterday, advising that everyone east of a line from Bairnsdale to Corryong, and dog-legging west around Mount Buffalo, should leave the area if they do not need to remain. The Abbeyard fire is now about 80km long, and has been creeping west toward Carboor, just south of Mount Buffalo. It is being pushed west this morning but the biggest danger will come later this evening, when a south-westerly wind change will convert the northern flank into an 80km-wide fire front. Bright is about 20km north of the fire. Residents in the King Valley, Carboor and surrounds, Edi, Myrrhee, and surrounding localities have been advised to evacuate now, via the Carboor-Everton Road, if they\u2019re at the Carboor side, and via the King Valley-Wangaratta Road, from the King Valley. Evacuation centres have been set up in Wangaratta, with a information and registration centre at the Myrtleford library. Morrison is again asked about the government\u2019s position on climate change, questioned on whether he needs to do more, and whether he might revisit the national energy guarantee - a policy that Morrison previously supported before a conservative uprising within government ranks caused it to be dumped by former PM Malcolm Turnbull. When asked if he accepted that these type of bushfire events would become more common, Morrison said the government had \u201ccovered that a number of times now.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019ll be the reviews that take place as you would expect and I\u2019ve already indicated in response to questions that we\u2019ll be working closely with state and territory authorities on how they are undertaken,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cBut the links and implications here have been acknowledged.\u201d When asked if he accepted that community sentiment had shifted on climate change as a result of the bushfire season, and this might warrant a review of policy, including the national energy guarantee, Morrison does not bite. \u201cI accept community sentiment today when we have got extreme fire conditions in New South Wales and Victoria, would have me absolutely 100% focused on ensuring the response effort that may have to roll in the next 24 hours is ready to go, and that I\u2019ve given the order of the Defence Forces to be ready to go and get in there.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I believe the community wants me focused on right now.\u201d It\u2019s worth mentioning that this press conference was not 100% focused on the response effort. It began with obviously important briefings on the Iran situation. So he should have been able to answer questions on this. The Eyre Highway has reopened after being closed for 12 days due to a bushfire, allowing travellers and road freight to get through to Perth. The WA department of fire and emergency services opened the road at 7am local time in response to a calming of fire activity in the Dundas fire, which has been \u201cmoderated due to cooler temperatures, reduced wind speeds and higher relative humidity.\u201d The alert read: \u201cthe Eyre Highway and the Coolgardie-Esperance Highway have now reopened. Some speed restrictions are in place and it is anticipated a large number of vehicles could be on the roads, so motorists are urged to drive with care and ensure they have adequate fuel, food and water. The highway has been closed since 30 December. It is the main road into WA from the Eastern States \u2014 the only other sealed road is the Victoria Highway, which goes from Darwin to Kununurra at the northern end of the continent \u2014 and it\u2019s also the main freight route. Supermarkets Coles and Woolworths both said in statements yesterday that they were experiencing some stock shortages due to the road closure. Dozens of truck drivers and tourists have been stuck at the Caiguna roadhouse, on the eastern edge of the road closure, for a fortnight. Toilet paper had to be helicoptered in, and the roadhouse was running low on water, which it generates through desalination. The Eyre Highway runs from Norseman to Port Augusta. The Coolgardie-Esperance Highway also runs through Norseman, and forms part of the route from Perth to Adelaide. Morrison is speaking in Canberra on the bushfires, after addressing what he says was a \u201cterrible accident\u201d, that saw a Ukrainian aircraft shot down in Iran. On the fires, Morrison says conditions remain \u201csevere and extreme\u201d, and he has advised the Australian Defence Force to stand ready to assist. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve said in my briefings this morning with the ADF is I\u2019ve given them very clear instructions that they are to stand ready to move and support immediately,\u201d Morrison said. He reports on the work the ADF has been undertaking, including help with the burying of dead livestock. \u201cThat will be of great relief I think to those farmers and graziers for whom the disposal of their stock and the stock losses is a very difficult issue for them,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThe other part of the work and effort that is being undertaken by the ADF is in the engineering side of works, clearing roads, working with local authorities to establish contact with isolated communities but that will come under threat again today. \u201cSo, having put the Defence Forces in a position to move quickly in the event of a fire activity today, they will move and ensure that they can provide that support as swiftly as they can, but again working in concert with local state and territory authorities.\u201d More from that 2GB interview with Morrison, via AAP: Scott Morrison says any national inquiry into the bushfires needs to be wide-ranging and examine what impact climate change has had on the crisis. The prime minister is weighing up calling a royal commission into the disaster, which would also look at hazard reduction burns and national coordination. \u201cI think Australians, because of the scale of this particular disaster, will be looking for something more holistic,\u201d he told 2GB radio on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s not the focus right now \u2013 today there are severe and extreme fire forecasts in Victoria and NSW \u2013 but down the track, that\u2019s what premiers and I am sure will discuss.\u201d But while the prime minister acknowledges there is an appetite to examine the impacts of climate change on the bushfires, he will not consider a stronger commitment to carbon emission reductions. The federal government has committed at least $2bn towards the recovery effort. The latest element of its response package was immediate cash payments of $1m for dozens of councils hardest hit by the fires. A comprehensive mental health plan is expected to be announced in coming days, along with assistance for bushfire-ravaged small businesses. From AAP: The escalating bushfire emergency across Kangaroo Island has cut power to more properties. SA Power Networks says about 850 are now without electricity following a fire-related outage on the main supply line to the west of the Island overnight on Thursday. The main supply powerline runs through the firegrounds near Parndana from Kingscote and goes on to supply western parts of the island. SA Power Networks said its crews were not able to work on Thursday due to fire escalation and would await advice from the Country Fire Service before going onto the fireground on Friday. \u201cOur focus has been community and crew safety in fast-changing and dangerous bushfire circumstances and today, given the threat to Kingscote, we have moved crews and equipment to Penneshaw to ensure their safety and our ability to mobilise all our resources once the bushfire situation eases,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe additional damage and continuing fire situation will further delay our efforts to restore power to those who can be reconnected.\u201d Water supplies are also a concern for the island with major damage earlier to a water treatment plant near Penneshaw. Army personnel and SA Water crews tried to get to the plant on Thursday but were unable to make it. The army has set up a portable treatment plant but islanders continue to be urged to keep water use to essential needs only. Luke Henriques-Gomes has checked in with the people in the Victorian town of Mallacoota. Christy Brya Bryar is now staying at a friend\u2019s place in Mallacoota. She is keen to stress that although there had been some terrifying moments, \u201cit wasn\u2019t all chaos and panic and armageddon\u201d. \u201cI could tell when something had come out in the media because I would get this flood of messages from people panicked, from Portugal, or Canada, or the UK,\u201d she says. She is not downplaying the experience of those who were there. Bryar was on the wharf crouching, face down, sheltering from the embers with a friend, Vanessa, as well as Vanessa\u2019s children and dogs, when the fire front hit. \u201cThe kids were so still,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever we asked them to do, they just did it straight away. \u201cWe were each under a blanket. I had the two dogs under mine as well. We couldn\u2019t hold them so they were just so brave and just calm. \u201cThere were moments where you think, \u2018This might be it\u2019. But we had the kids there, and the dogs, and you knew you just have to keep it together.\u201d Read Luke\u2019s full feature here. NSW Police have released some details about the helicopter crash yesterday. The pilot was conducting aerial waterbombing of fires around Bega and Eden when it crashed into a dam in Boydtown. He\u2019d been refilling a water bucket in the Ben Boyd Reservoir about 4.20pm when the helicopter lost power and \u201ccame to rest\u201d in the dam. The 47-year-old pilot was able to free himself from the aircraft and make his way to shore,\u201d police said. \u201cHe was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics for shoulder, back and ankle injuries, before being taken to South East Regional Hospital in a stable condition.\u201d The dam is closed as a drinking supply and a recovery operation to retrieve the helicopter will be coordinated. Inquiries are continuing. Over on 2GB, Scott Morrison has just been taken to task for doing \u201ctoo much on climate change\u201d. Yes, you heard that right. Host John Stanley also lambasted Morrison for not building a new coal-fired power plant. \u201cYou\u2019re aware that a lot of the people who are listening to this program, if Alan was doing the program, their view is you\u2019re doing too much on climate change, you\u2019re doing too much in the renewable space. And then you go around the community and you\u2019re told you\u2019re not doing enough, more needs to be done, you need to ramp up the reduction of emissions. Is that a fair characterisation of the debate and the debate within your own party?\u201d Morrison reckons that\u2019s about right. \u201cOh John I think in terms of how you\u2019ve characterised the debate nationally, I think it\u2019s a pretty good summary. But what that means is that the policy we have is a balanced one. It\u2019s one that understands the need to take action here ... Stanley interjects: \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to satisfy ... the people listening here would say you\u2019re doing too much and they would be demanding that you, for instance, move ahead with a coal-fired power station because that\u2019s going to provide energy security for us.\u201d Sigh. Morrison goes on to say that the \u201cconflation\u201d of the bushfires and climate policy in the public debate has been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, because no single climate policy caused the fire. \u201cWe continue to consider our policies carefully here, and we understand we don\u2019t want job destroying, economy destroying, economy wrecking targets and goals which won\u2019t change the fact that there are bushfires or anything like that in Australia. The suggestion that there\u2019s any one emissions reduction policy or climate policy that has contributed to any of these fire events is just ridiculous, the conflation of those two things I think has been very disappointing. Over the last few weeks, John, in particular, there has been a lot of misinformation running around, that\u2019s been very disappointing. People have been looking to make political points in many cases, that\u2019s disappointing.\u201d Yep. Morrison\u2019s right. There has been a lot of misinformation around. Like, you know, the bots and trolls exaggerating the role of arson to deflect from climate change\u2019s impact. Or the misinformation about greenies stopping hazard reduction work. Prime minister Scott Morrison was interviewed on 7.30 last night. It\u2019s worth watching the full exchange, but this particular clip goes to the backlash he\u2019s received, in fire-affected areas and elsewhere, and specifically asks about his apparent misspeak on Kangaroo Island in saying there had been no deaths (there have been two - Dick Lang and his son, Clayton). Morrison says he was talking about firefighters when he said that (Dick and Clayton were volunteer firefighters). Here is a clip of the Kangaroo Island exchange. We\u2019re getting an update from Kangaroo Island where the general message is: firefighters are exhausted and it\u2019s not over yet, although conditions have improved and they\u2019ll be working on reopening roads and restoring power. Night shift were busy fighting fires and the day shift would have had trouble sleeping. An aircraft crew at Emu Bay also had to be evacuated last night. \u201cEssentially everybody working on this fire not only had a big day yesterday but they had disrupted rest, and we\u2019ve got to keep going,\u201d says CFS incident controller Ian Tanner. We can\u2019t afford to stop now, but the weather has eased off. I\u2019m very confident that the rate of spread will have slowed if not stopped and that any fire activity or smoke that you can see will be just burning in some of those creek lines and things. There is a bit of drizzle out there at the moment. Temperatures are down. Humidities are up. ... It will still move slightly through the bush, through those forested areas, but our fire crews should be able to get in and deal with that. Unlike yesterday. But it is not going to make a run through the paddocks and across the country to Emu Bay under the current conditions. Last night at fire-threatened Kingscote, residents fled homes and stayed in their cars near the water. We have a line that\u2019s parallel to the original line, but it is from about Seal Bay up to about Emu Bay, but this time it hasn\u2019t because the conditions were milder, it hasn\u2019t reached the coast on the north like it did on the previous Friday and it stopped back there around the Kingscote airport. Fitzsimmons says the big difference today is there has been a sensible and considered response from the community in getting out so there aren\u2019t tens of thousands of people in these towns and there\u2019s been a lot of stocking from communities. Fitzsimmons: \u201cOur focus today isn\u2019t just about people and community assets, but we know we have a lot of critical assets which go to the viability and livelihoods of communities.\u201d NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says she is proud of the preparedness of authorities in the state but there is no doubt that extreme conditions and extreme events have given them a lot for consideration. Asked about the various inquiries being announced or flagged, Berejiklian says the crisis goes beyond state borders but responses are run by the states and run quite differently, so it\u2019s appropriate for each state to consider what they do. \u201cBut we also have to accept that what the nation is facing goes beyond the borders of one state\u201d and so she appreciates why there would be something at the national level as well. NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons is giving a briefing. Communities everywhere across the south of NSW are under threat, and he\u2019s urged people to check information related to their locality. The conditions are difficult today. It\u2019s the hot, dry winds that will prove once again to be the real challenge. We are going to see winds coming through around about 35-50km/h, gusting up to 70-90 an hour, in some areas out of the north-west and we are going to see that through most of the day. Later in the afternoon, anywhere from mid-afternoon, late afternoon, somewhere round about 4pm, we\u2019ll see the change moving in. The southerly change will be vigorous and gusty, he said. Inland it will be largely from the south-west, and near the coast it will be more from the souther or south-easter. \u201cThose winds will penetrate through and be dominating those firegrounds for many hours,\u201d he says. Here are the predicted fire movements for NSW today. It obviously stops at the Victorian border despite the fire clearly spreading across both states. I\u2019ll see if Victorian authorities produce similar maps. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the continuing bushfire crisis in Australia. Firefighters and residents have had a few days reprieve this week, with cooler conditions and even a bit of rain \u2013 although that can also hamper containment work. Unfortunately those conditions end today. Temperatures in the south of New South Wales and in Victoria are predicted to reach the low to mid 40s, with a late cool change bringing winds with peak gusts of up to 90km/h and possible dry lightning. \u201cThese conditions will make fire behaviour erratic and dangerous,\u201d the RFS said. Authorities have warned people in areas under particular threat that they should leave. \u201cIf it is safe to get out, then you must get out. That is the only way to guarantee your safety,\u201d Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews said on Thursday. \u201cI know that\u2019s a very binary message. It\u2019s blunt. It\u2019s not meant to impress anyone. It\u2019s meant to be the cold facts.\u201d An emergency warning is in place in Western Australia, for a bushfire threatening lives and homes across a string of suburbs in Perth\u2019s south. It has burned more than 300ha since it started about midday on Thursday. The emergency warning applies across an area spanning 20km north to Casuarina. The ABC is reporting the Kangaroo Island town of Kingscote has been cut off, with residents stranded as South Australian firefighters battle a bushfire. It\u2019s currently designated a watch and act, with roads closed and some residents reportedly sleeping at the water\u2019s edge and on the town oval. Two other emergency warnings remained in place early on Friday, one for the area around the Kangaroo Island south coast town of Vivonne Bay and one for the central districts around Parndana.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of climate protesters flooded the streets of Australian state capitals on Friday night as fire authorities warned of another dangerous night ahead in four states. Firefighters in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia continued to battle fires, with gusty winds expected to create hazardous firefighting conditions late into the night. A male firefighter in his 20s suffered burns to his face, ears and hands in the Snowy Valley region where fierce winds were pushing the fires in different direction. Temperatures reached above 40C in some parts of NSW during the day, and strong south-westerly winds with gusts of up to 90km/h were expected to move up the coast later in the night, the Bureau of Meteorology said. \u201cThe change is critical,\u201d the BoM\u2019s Graham Reader said. \u201cThe winds really peak around the change and the directions shift is very sharp and particularly gusty.\u201d The change was not expected to reach Sydney until early on Saturday morning. By 8pm on Friday, fire authorities in NSW and Victoria had started to issue emergency warnings as southerly winds fanned the fires. In Victoria, 21 fires were burning out of control by late afternoon, with more than 1.3m hectares burned so far this bushfire season. On Friday afternoon the state\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, said 286 residential properties had been damaged or destroyed in the state. Andrews praised the response of Victorians to evacuation orders and other warnings. \u201cPeople have, by and large, followed the advice given, and that is one of the reasons why I\u2019m able to say to you tonight, despite this unprecedented fire activity, we have nobody who is unaccounted for, we have no further people that have died, and we have no further communities that have been cut off.\u201d But he warned that \u201call of those things can change\u201d and urged the public to remain vigilant. People living in the state\u2019s alpine region were told they had until 7.50pm on Friday to safely evacuate. \u201cEvacuation after this time is considered life threatening,\u201d an emergency warning said. Relief centres were set up in Bonegilla, Myrtleford and Wangaratta for evacuees. In the alpine towns of Bright and Harrietville, authorities had placed satellite phones, baby formula, food, nappies and torches in containers in case the two areas were cut off. State authorities were concerned fires in the north of Victoria could merge with others burning near the NSW border. In NSW, where 66 of the 137 fires burning were not contained, the Rural Fire Service warned the forecast wind change \u201ccould cause erratic fire behaviour over many firegrounds\u201d. Conditions in several areas of the Snowy Mountains, and in the southern highlands around Bundanoon, were particularly challenging. Conditions in the state were expected to ease on Saturday. In Western Australia, a fire jumped one of the the main freeways south of Perth, threatening lives and homes just 30km south of the city centre. Residents were told to immediately head south if they could. Fires in South Australia had burned through more than a third of Kangaroo Island, killing two people and injuring 22 fire personnel. The town of Parndana in the centre of the island was again spared on Friday after being threatened twice by flames. In the evening more than 10,000 climate change protesters filled the streets in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra, with anger directed towards the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. Sydney protester Ambrose Hayes, 14, said people were \u201cfed up\u201d with Morrison, who she said was not acting on the climate crisis. Morrison rejected criticism of his government\u2019s climate record in a series of interviews on Thursday and Friday. Conceding climate change had played a role in the fires, he told one radio station his government did not want \u201cjob-destroying, economy-destroying, economy-wrecking targets and goals\u201d on climate change. He said any such efforts to cut emissions \u201cwon\u2019t change the fact that there have been bushfires or anything like that in Australia\u201d. In a conference call with MPs, Morrison banned backbench MPs from doing international media, after Liberal MP Craig Kelly caused an outcry by denying the link between climate change and bushfires on the UK\u2019s Good Morning Britain show. On Friday it emerged a senior News Corp employee had accused the company of \u201cmisinformation\u201d and diverting attention from climate change during the bushfire crisis in an all-staff email addressed to the company\u2019s executive chairman. The email accused News Corp papers, including the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun, of misrepresenting facts and spreading misinformation to focus on arson as the cause of the bushfires, rather than climate change. The company defended its coverage and said the employee, Emily Townsend, had submitted her resignation in December. The Bureau of Meteorology confirmed on Thursday that 2019 was the country\u2019s hottest since records began in 1910. The year was also been the country\u2019s driest since rainfall records began in 1900. The bureau said 2019 had also been the worst year for the Forest Fire Danger Index \u2013 a metric used to assess the risk of dangerous bushfire weather. That record goes back to 1950.",

Ramon Estevez became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/25/martin-sheen-emilio-estevez-charlie-sheen\" title=\"\">Martin Sheen</a> and Carlos Estevez is better known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/20/charlie-sheen-regrets-hiv-positive\" title=\"\">Charlie Sheen</a>, but Emilio never cashed in his Latino heritage for mass market (read: white) appeal, even when he was a young ambitious teenager and being known as his father\u2019s son would have only helped his career.</p> <p>\u201cMy decision was met with a lot of resistance at the time,\u201d Estevez tells me. \u201cBut it was abundantly clear to me that my father had earned his name and I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>We are sitting in a private members\u2019 club in central London, and although he is unfailingly polite, he doesn\u2019t look entirely comfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t generally hang out in places like this,\u201d he says. Despite being a member of one of Hollywood\u2019s most famous dynasties, the Estevez men have never been known for glitziness; when Martin Sheen appeared on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zzn2c\" title=\"\">Desert Island Discs in 2011</a>, he said that he only plays golf on public courses, rather than the many private courses in LA where actors of his stature are generally found.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable belonging to a private members\u2019 club,\u201d Sheen said. \u201cIt has a sense of privilege and entitlement that I resent deeply.\u201d</p> <p>There is a similar seriousness to Estevez, a kind of moral rectitude, as he sits soldier-straight in his seat. In her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/books/demi-moore-memoir-inside-out.html\" title=\"\">recently published memoir</a>, Demi Moore, who was briefly engaged to Estevez in the 1980s, says that, when they were both still in their 20s, he made her quit smoking, and I can believe it: he has the mien of a man who is baffled by anyone who wastes their time on anything frivolous.</p> <p>Unfortunately for him, I have a question that I know he will find just that, and it is one that he has had to answer pretty much every day of his life for the past three decades. Because it turned out that keeping his name did not hinder Estevez\u2019s career \u2013 if anything, he was too successful for his own good. Can I ask just one thing about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/15/culture.features1\" title=\"\">Brat Pack</a>?</p> <p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he sighs, defeated, as he has been for the past four decades.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHqodIVOqpA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yHqodIVOqpA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Doesn\u2019t he think in St Elmo\u2019s Fire that his character \u2013 who is portrayed as a big romantic for tracking Andie MacDowell down and forcibly kissing her \u2013 was a terrible stalker?</p> <p>\u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cIf they were to remake that movie now they would never include that character. That film \u2026 I know people hold it as a fond memory, but it\u2019s not a great film.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, Emilio!</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>Well, I love it.</p> <p>\u201cReally? But it\u2019s so overdramatic!\u201d</p> <p>But that\u2019s what young people are like. Same with The Breakfast Club \u2013 the intensity of the characters\u2019 feelings reflects what it feels like to be young, I say.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/13/80s-films-molly-ringwald-john-hughes-metoo\">Times move pretty fast! Rewatching 80s favourites in the age of #MeToo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI would agree with you about The Breakfast Club. I think the [school] setting allowed for us to give those kinds of performances, and John [Hughes, The Breakfast Club\u2019s director] allowed the time for us to get under the skin of those characters, and as a result it\u2019s a superior film,\u201d he says, ranking the two movies for which he will always be best known.</p> <p>Thinking I have found an acceptably serious way to discuss the Brat Pack, I ask if he read Molly Ringwald\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/what-about-the-breakfast-club-molly-ringwald-metoo-john-hughes-pretty-in-pink\" title=\"\">essay in the New Yorker</a> about her mixed feelings about The Breakfast Club.</p> <p>\u201cI did not, no.

Yet people won\u2019t stop relitigating his past. Depending on the age of the journalist, he gets asked about his late-80s and 90s hits (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31uopmuQcJ8\" title=\"\">Young Guns</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK0SizOkbF4\" title=\"\">The Mighty Ducks</a>), his famous family, or \u2013 the worst, from his perspective \u2013 the Brat Pack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0783480cfb0db8d28525a7a629d83fff3b332032\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0783480cfb0db8d28525a7a629d83fff3b332032/0_38_3056_1834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Brat Pack in St Elmo\u2019s Fire (l to r): Andrew Mccarthy, Estevez, Judd Nelson and Rob Lowe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Brat Pack in St Elmo\u2019s Fire (l to r): Andrew Mccarthy, Estevez, Judd Nelson and Rob Lowe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection / Rex Feat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat [term] will be on my tombstone,\u201d he says, gloomily and accurately. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying because Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon have worked together more than any of us have. We just made two movies and somehow it morphed into something else.\u201d</p> <p>Both The Breakfast Club and St Elmo\u2019s Fire came out in 1985, and anyone who was in them was deemed to be in the Brat Pack. Unfortunately for Estevez, he starred in both and the New York magazine article that coined the term Brat Pack dubbed him \u201cthe unofficial president\u201d.</p> <p>It also made him sound like the best of the bunch, always paying for other people\u2019s drinks and generally being everyone\u2019s best friend. But Estevez still recoils at references to the article, three decades on, and refuses to name the journalist who wrote it (David Blum). \u201cIf that\u2019s the one thing he has offered the world, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d he grumbles, still smarting at the reductive term that preserved him \u2013 along with Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Andrew McCarthy and Ally Sheedy \u2013 in teen-dream amber for ever.</p> <p>Anyway, on to The Public, which Estevez directed, wrote and stars in. The film, which wears its well-intended heart on its sleeve to a fault, is almost entirely set in a public library, and it imagines what would happen if the homeless people who sit there all day for warmth refused to leave in the evening when the library shut. Estevez plays the librarian fighting for the homeless people and it stars two other 80s heartthrobs: Estevez\u2019s close friend, Christian Slater, and Alec Baldwin.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen Alec in 30 years, and I was pretty scared of him at first. Back in the day, when he first came on the scene we thought we were done. I was part of this group of scrappers \u2013 me, Tom Cruise, Sean Penn \u2013 and when Alec Baldwin came in the room the whole industry was like, OK, this guy\u2019s a great actor, and he\u2019s gorgeous! So we had this absolute jealousy of Alec Baldwin. But now here we are today working together, texting all the time and having a bromance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e522a7e778774658d805ae8ca2a10171a915ba0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e522a7e778774658d805ae8ca2a10171a915ba0/0_0_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Estevez with Christian Slater in The Public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Estevez with Christian Slater in The Public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tell him that for a certain kind of person \u2013 one who insists on asking about the Brat Pack, say \u2013 the thought of Estevez and Baldwin having any kind of romance is basically erotica. He makes a hoot of a laugh and, to his great credit, concedes the inevitable: in the hearts of an entire generation, he will forever be in 1985.</p> <p>The Public is the first movie Estevez has directed that doesn\u2019t include any members of his family: the little-loved 1990 garbagemen comedy, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LjEubnHhlc\" title=\"\">Men at Work</a>, starred him and Charlie; 1996\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSVfEcm76hU\" title=\"\">The War at Home</a>, 2006\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dakDA3bY_6E\" title=\"\">Bobby</a> \u2013 Estevez\u2019s best film \u2013 and 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzFV1Ixof0Q\" title=\"\">The Way</a> all featured or starred his father. Did he miss not having them around this time?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers immediately, then laughs. \u201cWhen you work with family, you know what buttons to push because you helped to build the machine. There were times on The Way when my dad looked at me, not as his director, but as the 12-year-old boy he remembers running around in the backyard with a movie camera. I could see it in his eyes. We had <em>massive</em> fights on that film.\u201d</p> <p>As anyone with a family knows, massive fights are the flip side of being so close with someone that you feel you can say anything to them, and the Estevezes are famously close knit. Martin Sheen and his wife, Janet, have been happily married for almost 60 years. When Estevez and his three siblings were growing up \u2013 as well as Charlie, there\u2019s another brother, Ramon, and a sister Renee \u2013 the whole family would travel wherever Martin was shooting, loading up the station wagon and all six of them shipping on out.</p> <p>\u201cMy parents knew that if the family was to stay together, we had to stay together,\u201d he says. They have maintained that setup as adults: Estevez, who is not married and has two adult children, mainly lives in LA \u201cbecause it\u2019s where my parents and siblings are\u201d. In her book, Moore says part of the reason she fell in love with Estevez was because of his relationship with his family. Every weekend, the whole group, to her amazement, would gather at the family home and debate politics, led by Martin, a liberal activist. (She is somewhat less glowing about Estevez, whom she broke up with after suspicions of infidelity. But let\u2019s not relitigate that past.)</p> <p>In other interviews, Estevez has tended to go a bit terse when asked about his family. But the subject is unavoidable as soon as he walks into the room: these days he looks so much like his dad, it is startling. This is no surprise \u2013 after all, he played his father\u2019s character on The West Wing, President Bartlett, in flashbacks. But it is very disorienting in person to look at the face of Martin Sheen and hear the voice of Emilio Estevez, and it makes his youthful insistence on keeping his real name when he went into acting, instead of adopting his father\u2019s stage name, seem even more endearing. He may well have wanted to get by on his own merits, but his paternity is stamped all over his face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a46f02389160946a63a17cdb2964fc66dd2a19fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a46f02389160946a63a17cdb2964fc66dd2a19fe/0_31_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Sheen with children Emilio, Ramon, Charlie and Renee, 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Sheen with children Emilio, Ramon, Charlie and Renee, 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Miller/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His father urged him to keep Estevez, having always regretted changing his name.

      "bodyText": "Unlike his father and his brother, Emilio Estevez never changed his name. Ramon Estevez became Martin Sheen and Carlos Estevez is better known as Charlie Sheen, but Emilio never cashed in his Latino heritage for mass market (read: white) appeal, even when he was a young ambitious teenager and being known as his father\u2019s son would have only helped his career. \u201cMy decision was met with a lot of resistance at the time,\u201d Estevez tells me. \u201cBut it was abundantly clear to me that my father had earned his name and I hadn\u2019t.\u201d We are sitting in a private members\u2019 club in central London, and although he is unfailingly polite, he doesn\u2019t look entirely comfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t generally hang out in places like this,\u201d he says. Despite being a member of one of Hollywood\u2019s most famous dynasties, the Estevez men have never been known for glitziness; when Martin Sheen appeared on Desert Island Discs in 2011, he said that he only plays golf on public courses, rather than the many private courses in LA where actors of his stature are generally found. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable belonging to a private members\u2019 club,\u201d Sheen said. \u201cIt has a sense of privilege and entitlement that I resent deeply.\u201d There is a similar seriousness to Estevez, a kind of moral rectitude, as he sits soldier-straight in his seat. In her recently published memoir, Demi Moore, who was briefly engaged to Estevez in the 1980s, says that, when they were both still in their 20s, he made her quit smoking, and I can believe it: he has the mien of a man who is baffled by anyone who wastes their time on anything frivolous. Unfortunately for him, I have a question that I know he will find just that, and it is one that he has had to answer pretty much every day of his life for the past three decades. Because it turned out that keeping his name did not hinder Estevez\u2019s career \u2013 if anything, he was too successful for his own good. Can I ask just one thing about the Brat Pack? \u201cMmm,\u201d he sighs, defeated, as he has been for the past four decades. Doesn\u2019t he think in St Elmo\u2019s Fire that his character \u2013 who is portrayed as a big romantic for tracking Andie MacDowell down and forcibly kissing her \u2013 was a terrible stalker? \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cIf they were to remake that movie now they would never include that character. That film \u2026 I know people hold it as a fond memory, but it\u2019s not a great film.\u201d Oh, Emilio! \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Well, I love it. \u201cReally? But it\u2019s so overdramatic!\u201d But that\u2019s what young people are like. Same with The Breakfast Club \u2013 the intensity of the characters\u2019 feelings reflects what it feels like to be young, I say. \u201cI would agree with you about The Breakfast Club. I think the [school] setting allowed for us to give those kinds of performances, and John [Hughes, The Breakfast Club\u2019s director] allowed the time for us to get under the skin of those characters, and as a result it\u2019s a superior film,\u201d he says, ranking the two movies for which he will always be best known. Thinking I have found an acceptably serious way to discuss the Brat Pack, I ask if he read Molly Ringwald\u2019s essay in the New Yorker about her mixed feelings about The Breakfast Club. \u201cI did not, no. I wish everyone well and anyone who writes anything, whether it\u2019s this or a New Yorker piece or Demi\u2019s new book. But as for retrospectives, I tend not to go there. I don\u2019t relitigate my past,\u201d he says politely but pointedly. Poor Emilio. He is 57 \u2013 and a grandfather! \u2013 and he has flown all the way from LA to discuss his latest very serious directing effort, The Public. Yet people won\u2019t stop relitigating his past. Depending on the age of the journalist, he gets asked about his late-80s and 90s hits (Young Guns, The Mighty Ducks), his famous family, or \u2013 the worst, from his perspective \u2013 the Brat Pack. \u201cThat [term] will be on my tombstone,\u201d he says, gloomily and accurately. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying because Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Matt Damon have worked together more than any of us have. We just made two movies and somehow it morphed into something else.\u201d Both The Breakfast Club and St Elmo\u2019s Fire came out in 1985, and anyone who was in them was deemed to be in the Brat Pack. Unfortunately for Estevez, he starred in both and the New York magazine article that coined the term Brat Pack dubbed him \u201cthe unofficial president\u201d. It also made him sound like the best of the bunch, always paying for other people\u2019s drinks and generally being everyone\u2019s best friend. But Estevez still recoils at references to the article, three decades on, and refuses to name the journalist who wrote it (David Blum). \u201cIf that\u2019s the one thing he has offered the world, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d he grumbles, still smarting at the reductive term that preserved him \u2013 along with Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall, Andrew McCarthy and Ally Sheedy \u2013 in teen-dream amber for ever. Anyway, on to The Public, which Estevez directed, wrote and stars in. The film, which wears its well-intended heart on its sleeve to a fault, is almost entirely set in a public library, and it imagines what would happen if the homeless people who sit there all day for warmth refused to leave in the evening when the library shut. Estevez plays the librarian fighting for the homeless people and it stars two other 80s heartthrobs: Estevez\u2019s close friend, Christian Slater, and Alec Baldwin. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen Alec in 30 years, and I was pretty scared of him at first. Back in the day, when he first came on the scene we thought we were done. I was part of this group of scrappers \u2013 me, Tom Cruise, Sean Penn \u2013 and when Alec Baldwin came in the room the whole industry was like, OK, this guy\u2019s a great actor, and he\u2019s gorgeous! So we had this absolute jealousy of Alec Baldwin. But now here we are today working together, texting all the time and having a bromance.\u201d I tell him that for a certain kind of person \u2013 one who insists on asking about the Brat Pack, say \u2013 the thought of Estevez and Baldwin having any kind of romance is basically erotica. He makes a hoot of a laugh and, to his great credit, concedes the inevitable: in the hearts of an entire generation, he will forever be in 1985. The Public is the first movie Estevez has directed that doesn\u2019t include any members of his family: the little-loved 1990 garbagemen comedy, Men at Work, starred him and Charlie; 1996\u2019s The War at Home, 2006\u2019s Bobby \u2013 Estevez\u2019s best film \u2013 and 2011\u2019s The Way all featured or starred his father. Did he miss not having them around this time? \u201cNo,\u201d he answers immediately, then laughs. \u201cWhen you work with family, you know what buttons to push because you helped to build the machine. There were times on The Way when my dad looked at me, not as his director, but as the 12-year-old boy he remembers running around in the backyard with a movie camera. I could see it in his eyes. We had massive fights on that film.\u201d As anyone with a family knows, massive fights are the flip side of being so close with someone that you feel you can say anything to them, and the Estevezes are famously close knit. Martin Sheen and his wife, Janet, have been happily married for almost 60 years. When Estevez and his three siblings were growing up \u2013 as well as Charlie, there\u2019s another brother, Ramon, and a sister Renee \u2013 the whole family would travel wherever Martin was shooting, loading up the station wagon and all six of them shipping on out. \u201cMy parents knew that if the family was to stay together, we had to stay together,\u201d he says. They have maintained that setup as adults: Estevez, who is not married and has two adult children, mainly lives in LA \u201cbecause it\u2019s where my parents and siblings are\u201d. In her book, Moore says part of the reason she fell in love with Estevez was because of his relationship with his family. Every weekend, the whole group, to her amazement, would gather at the family home and debate politics, led by Martin, a liberal activist. (She is somewhat less glowing about Estevez, whom she broke up with after suspicions of infidelity. But let\u2019s not relitigate that past.) In other interviews, Estevez has tended to go a bit terse when asked about his family. But the subject is unavoidable as soon as he walks into the room: these days he looks so much like his dad, it is startling. This is no surprise \u2013 after all, he played his father\u2019s character on The West Wing, President Bartlett, in flashbacks. But it is very disorienting in person to look at the face of Martin Sheen and hear the voice of Emilio Estevez, and it makes his youthful insistence on keeping his real name when he went into acting, instead of adopting his father\u2019s stage name, seem even more endearing. He may well have wanted to get by on his own merits, but his paternity is stamped all over his face. His father urged him to keep Estevez, having always regretted changing his name. So it must have been pretty strange for both of them when Charlie didn\u2019t just take on Sheen as a stage name but as his legal surname, too.

      "body": "<p>Of all the special relationships in the Premier League, the one between Sheffield United and David McGoldrick may just be the most beautiful. The club has, of course, been a delight in many regards this season, sweeping into the top flight with no airs and plenty of grace, defying the expectations of all those hollering experts who thought the Blades were still managed by Neil Warnock.</p> <p>Chris Wilder has expanded the minds not only of people too highbrow to know what goes on in the nether leagues, but also of busy coaches who appreciate creative thinking. Overlapping centre-backs is an innovation that will catch on. But it is McGoldrick\u2019s extraordinary role for Sheffield United that has really raised a smile this season. For who cannot love a striker who is a strong contender to be his club\u2019s player of the season despite not scoring a single goal?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/06/jack-rodwell-sheffield-united-point-to-prove\">Jack Rodwell has \u2018point to prove at highest level\u2019 with Sheffield United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McGoldrick inspires something close to love at Bramall Lane: you only have to see the way he is cheered off the pitch after another goalless performance to know that. Or listen to Wilder, who said in advance of Friday\u2019s match with West Ham that he would continue to pick McGoldrick this season regardless of his 0% conversion rate from 35 shots.</p> <p>Which is not to say that a blank\u2011shooting striker is another crafty tactical invention by Wilder. Merely that McGoldrick is so exceptional that all the other nifty things he does make not hitting the net forgivable. His movement is canny, his technique exquisite, his moxie inspirational. His ball control is magnetic and he is as likely to dupe a defender with a clever pass as he is to blindside a midfielder with a precision challenge. Only three Sheffield United players have won more tackles than him this season. Many of their moves start with him and practically all go through him at some point. He is to the Blades what Roberto Firmino is to Liverpool. Minus the goals.</p> <p>He used to score, of course. He struck 15 for United to help them to promotion last season but it was mainly his other contributions that earned him the player of the year award. He has not scored for the club since a brace against Hull in April but, even though Wilder spent around \u00a337m on three forwards last summer, the manager\u2019s first choice is still the player he signed for free in 2018 after Ipswich let McGoldrick go. It is testament to the character and quality of McGoldrick and Wilder that a player whom Ipswich believed to be washed up went on to make his Premier League debut this season at the age of 31. He has made 17 more top-flight appearances and counting. Now if only he could top off the story with a goal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>McGoldrick has come painfully close. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/tottenham-hotspur-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Against Tottenham in November</a> he even put the ball in the net, only for VAR to perpetrate what could well be its biggest crime against sport this season, disallowing McGoldrick\u2019s goal on the grounds of a hairline offside against John Lundstram. Three weeks later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/01/wolves-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">against Wolves</a> he had several chances but finished tamely, allowing Rui Patr\u00edcio to save each time. When he was substituted in the closing minutes, Blades fans gave him an ovation. But it was clear that the goal drought was beginning to gnaw. Wilder needed to lend his own voice to those of the fans.</p> <p>\u201cI had five minutes with David in the dressing room, away from everyone else, and told him how key he is for us,\u201d Wilder said afterwards. \u201cHe wants to get one [a goal], of course he does. But we play better with David in the team, make no mistake about that.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/brighton-hove-albion-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Four days before Christmas</a> it looked as if a red-and-white-hued dream would come true. After pouncing on a loose header by Adam Webster, McGoldrick skipped past Brighton\u2019s goalkeeper, Mat Ryan, to leave himself with an open goal. The travelling fans had the perfect view and leapt to their feet in anticipation of sweet deliverance. McGoldrick rolled his shot into the side netting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/sheffield-united-afc-fylde-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">Sheffield United hold on for nervy FA Cup win over non-league AFC Fylde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was silence, as if people needed VAR, Twitter or some other illustrious gimcrack to confirm what they had just witnessed. And then the realisation that yes, he had missed. In an instant hundreds of onlookers turned into characters from a painting by Edvard Munch. But then came the singing from United fans in praise of McGoldrick. Seldom, if ever, has a misfiring forward inspired such devotion.</p> <p>On the same day as it happened, Miguel Almir\u00f3n <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/21/newcastle-united-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">scored his first goal</a> for Newcastle United almost a year after joining the club. And four days later Alireza Jahanbakhsh <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/28/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-report\" title=\"\">scored his first</a> for Brighton almost one and a half years after signing from AZ Alkmaar. Both those phenomena triggered eruptions of joy. But those goals came from players whose quality many fans had begun to doubt. No one who has watched McGoldrick questions his worth. The goodwill he has generated is waiting to explode into roars. A bit like the ones released by Republic of Ireland fans in September when McGoldrick struck his first international goal on his 11th appearance. That was loud. But you get the feeling there will be a sonic boom when McGoldrick finally opens his Premier League account for Sheffield United.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Of all the special relationships in the Premier League, the one between Sheffield United and David McGoldrick may just be the most beautiful. The club has, of course, been a delight in many regards this season, sweeping into the top flight with no airs and plenty of grace, defying the expectations of all those hollering experts who thought the Blades were still managed by Neil Warnock. Chris Wilder has expanded the minds not only of people too highbrow to know what goes on in the nether leagues, but also of busy coaches who appreciate creative thinking. Overlapping centre-backs is an innovation that will catch on. But it is McGoldrick\u2019s extraordinary role for Sheffield United that has really raised a smile this season. For who cannot love a striker who is a strong contender to be his club\u2019s player of the season despite not scoring a single goal? McGoldrick inspires something close to love at Bramall Lane: you only have to see the way he is cheered off the pitch after another goalless performance to know that. Or listen to Wilder, who said in advance of Friday\u2019s match with West Ham that he would continue to pick McGoldrick this season regardless of his 0% conversion rate from 35 shots. Which is not to say that a blank\u2011shooting striker is another crafty tactical invention by Wilder. Merely that McGoldrick is so exceptional that all the other nifty things he does make not hitting the net forgivable. His movement is canny, his technique exquisite, his moxie inspirational. His ball control is magnetic and he is as likely to dupe a defender with a clever pass as he is to blindside a midfielder with a precision challenge. Only three Sheffield United players have won more tackles than him this season. Many of their moves start with him and practically all go through him at some point. He is to the Blades what Roberto Firmino is to Liverpool. Minus the goals. He used to score, of course. He struck 15 for United to help them to promotion last season but it was mainly his other contributions that earned him the player of the year award. He has not scored for the club since a brace against Hull in April but, even though Wilder spent around \u00a337m on three forwards last summer, the manager\u2019s first choice is still the player he signed for free in 2018 after Ipswich let McGoldrick go. It is testament to the character and quality of McGoldrick and Wilder that a player whom Ipswich believed to be washed up went on to make his Premier League debut this season at the age of 31. He has made 17 more top-flight appearances and counting. Now if only he could top off the story with a goal. McGoldrick has come painfully close. Against Tottenham in November he even put the ball in the net, only for VAR to perpetrate what could well be its biggest crime against sport this season, disallowing McGoldrick\u2019s goal on the grounds of a hairline offside against John Lundstram. Three weeks later against Wolves he had several chances but finished tamely, allowing Rui Patr\u00edcio to save each time. When he was substituted in the closing minutes, Blades fans gave him an ovation. But it was clear that the goal drought was beginning to gnaw. Wilder needed to lend his own voice to those of the fans. \u201cI had five minutes with David in the dressing room, away from everyone else, and told him how key he is for us,\u201d Wilder said afterwards. \u201cHe wants to get one [a goal], of course he does. But we play better with David in the team, make no mistake about that.\u201d Four days before Christmas it looked as if a red-and-white-hued dream would come true. After pouncing on a loose header by Adam Webster, McGoldrick skipped past Brighton\u2019s goalkeeper, Mat Ryan, to leave himself with an open goal. The travelling fans had the perfect view and leapt to their feet in anticipation of sweet deliverance. McGoldrick rolled his shot into the side netting. There was silence, as if people needed VAR, Twitter or some other illustrious gimcrack to confirm what they had just witnessed. And then the realisation that yes, he had missed. In an instant hundreds of onlookers turned into characters from a painting by Edvard Munch. But then came the singing from United fans in praise of McGoldrick. Seldom, if ever, has a misfiring forward inspired such devotion. On the same day as it happened, Miguel Almir\u00f3n scored his first goal for Newcastle United almost a year after joining the club. And four days later Alireza Jahanbakhsh scored his first for Brighton almost one and a half years after signing from AZ Alkmaar. Both those phenomena triggered eruptions of joy. But those goals came from players whose quality many fans had begun to doubt. No one who has watched McGoldrick questions his worth. The goodwill he has generated is waiting to explode into roars. A bit like the ones released by Republic of Ireland fans in September when McGoldrick struck his first international goal on his 11th appearance. That was loud. But you get the feeling there will be a sonic boom when McGoldrick finally opens his Premier League account for Sheffield United.",

For the second consecutive year the difficulties lay in its department stores where the boss, Paula Nickolds, carried the can for the poor performance. She is to leave the partnership after 25 years service. Sales at John Lewis\u2019s established stores fell 2% while sister chain Waitrose managed growth of 0.4% in the seven weeks to 4 January.</p> \n<h2>Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 Loser</h2> \n<p>Shares in M&amp;S <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/09/marks-spencer-sales-dented-by-too-many-mince-pies-and-skinny-jeans\">took a hit</a> after the retailer admitted to yet another wardrobe malfunction, along with too many Christmas food leftovers. Like-for-like clothing sales dropped 1.7% after the drive to make its menswear more fashionable backfired. It had doubled the number of slim and skinny fit trousers on offer at the expense of classic styles but the boss, Steve Rowe, confessed it \u201cgot the balance wrong\u201d. Its food halls fared better, with sales up 1.4%, boosted by new ranges and lower prices, but it bought too much festive fare which it then had to discount, hitting profit margins.</p> \n<h2><strong>Superdry \u2013 Loser</strong></h2> \n<p>Superdry, the fashion brand known for hoodies and T-shirts emblazoned with Japanese script, was missed off Christmas lists with the company warning it could now make no profit at all this year. Co-founder Julian Dunkerton returned last year to lead the revival but there is no light at the end of the tunnel yet. The company has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/10/superdry-and-joules-issue-profit-warnings-after-tough-christmas\">issued four profit warnings in under 12 months</a>, with sales falling 15.8% in the 10 weeks to 4 January.</p> \n<h2><strong>Joules \u2013 Loser</strong></h2> \n<p>It was also a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/10/superdry-and-joules-issue-profit-warnings-after-tough-christmas\">horror (fashion) show at Joules</a> after technical problems resulted in stock shortages on its website, hitting profits. Famous for its colourful wellies and waterproofs, sales declined 4.5% over the seven weeks to 5 January.</p> \n<h2>Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos \u2013 Loser</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/argos-toy-sales-christmas-sainsburys\">Poor sales of toys and video games at its Argos chain</a> snatched defeat from the jaws of victory for owner Sainsbury\u2019s. The catalogue chain scrapped its traditional festive 3-for-2 promotion, denting toy sales, but it suffered from the absence of a must-have game or gadget. Sainsbury\u2019s had a decent run in its grocery aisles, thanks to sharper prices and the appeal of its luxurious Taste the Difference range, but Argos was a drag on the group with sales at established stores finishing down 0.7% in the 15 weeks to 4 January.</p> \n<h2>Card Factory \u2013 Loser</h2> \n<p>There were no glad tidings from Card Factory either. The company blamed election torpor and quiet high streets for weaker than expected sales of Christmas cards and wrapping paper. The no-frills chain did not proffer a snapshot of trading but it was clearly bad with the retailer warning underlying profits would not be closer to \u00a382m than the \u00a389m pencilled in by analysts.</p> \n<h2>Morrisons \u2013 Loser</h2> \n<p>A decision to dial down Black Friday promotions backfired for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons\">Morrisons</a>, which booked a 1.7% slide in sales in the 22 weeks to 5 January. The Bradford-based supermarket complained of an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/07/supermarkets-christmas-sales-boris-morrisons-brexit\">unusually challenging period</a> for sales\u201d as rivals slashed prices to win over shoppers.</p> \n<h2>Greggs \u2013 Winner</h2> \n<p>The news was better from Newcastle baker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/greggs-to-pay-workers-7m-bonus-after-vegan-sausage-roll-success\">Greggs, which is handing 25,000 employees a special \u00a37m bonus</a> \u2013 up to \u00a3300 each \u2013 in their pay packets after the bakery chain\u2019s vegan sausage roll led to bumper sales and profits. The company was able to go back to City investors for the third time since November to say it was making more money than it had expected.

Typically represented as percentage growth rates, like-for-like sales measure sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, stripping out the impact of sales at newer stores.

This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher. Critics of the measure say that like-for-like sales do not always give an accurate picture of a retailer\u2019s health. They argue that of greater relevance is profitability and how well a company is adapting to challenges such as the living wage and online shopping revolution.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Aldi and Lidl \u2013 Winners</h2> \n<p>The German discounters Aldi and Lidl again trounced the mainstream supermarket chains with bumper sales growth over Christmas, fuelled by new store openings.

      "bodyText": "The traditionally lucrative Christmas trading period was a washout for many of Britain\u2019s retailers in 2019 with more losers than winners emerging from a fraught sales period overshadowed by Black Friday discounts. Poor performances from major high street chains including John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, and Morrisons, coupled with profit warnings from Joules, Superdry and Card Factory, capped a year described as the worst on record for British retail by the British Retail Consortium. John Lewis \u2013 Loser John Lewis\u2019s 81,000 staff face a nervous wait to find out if they will receive a bonus this year after the firm warned that a collapse in profits could lead to no annual bonus payment for the first time in 67 years. For the second consecutive year the difficulties lay in its department stores where the boss, Paula Nickolds, carried the can for the poor performance. She is to leave the partnership after 25 years service. Sales at John Lewis\u2019s established stores fell 2% while sister chain Waitrose managed growth of 0.4% in the seven weeks to 4 January. Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 Loser Shares in M&amp;S took a hit after the retailer admitted to yet another wardrobe malfunction, along with too many Christmas food leftovers. Like-for-like clothing sales dropped 1.7% after the drive to make its menswear more fashionable backfired. It had doubled the number of slim and skinny fit trousers on offer at the expense of classic styles but the boss, Steve Rowe, confessed it \u201cgot the balance wrong\u201d. Its food halls fared better, with sales up 1.4%, boosted by new ranges and lower prices, but it bought too much festive fare which it then had to discount, hitting profit margins. Superdry \u2013 Loser Superdry, the fashion brand known for hoodies and T-shirts emblazoned with Japanese script, was missed off Christmas lists with the company warning it could now make no profit at all this year. Co-founder Julian Dunkerton returned last year to lead the revival but there is no light at the end of the tunnel yet. The company has now issued four profit warnings in under 12 months, with sales falling 15.8% in the 10 weeks to 4 January. Joules \u2013 Loser It was also a horror (fashion) show at Joules after technical problems resulted in stock shortages on its website, hitting profits. Famous for its colourful wellies and waterproofs, sales declined 4.5% over the seven weeks to 5 January. Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos \u2013 Loser Poor sales of toys and video games at its Argos chain snatched defeat from the jaws of victory for owner Sainsbury\u2019s. The catalogue chain scrapped its traditional festive 3-for-2 promotion, denting toy sales, but it suffered from the absence of a must-have game or gadget. Sainsbury\u2019s had a decent run in its grocery aisles, thanks to sharper prices and the appeal of its luxurious Taste the Difference range, but Argos was a drag on the group with sales at established stores finishing down 0.7% in the 15 weeks to 4 January. Card Factory \u2013 Loser There were no glad tidings from Card Factory either. The company blamed election torpor and quiet high streets for weaker than expected sales of Christmas cards and wrapping paper. The no-frills chain did not proffer a snapshot of trading but it was clearly bad with the retailer warning underlying profits would not be closer to \u00a382m than the \u00a389m pencilled in by analysts. Morrisons \u2013 Loser A decision to dial down Black Friday promotions backfired for Morrisons, which booked a 1.7% slide in sales in the 22 weeks to 5 January. The Bradford-based supermarket complained of an \u201cunusually challenging period for sales\u201d as rivals slashed prices to win over shoppers. Greggs \u2013 Winner The news was better from Newcastle baker Greggs, which is handing 25,000 employees a special \u00a37m bonus \u2013 up to \u00a3300 each \u2013 in their pay packets after the bakery chain\u2019s vegan sausage roll led to bumper sales and profits. The company was able to go back to City investors for the third time since November to say it was making more money than it had expected. Sales at established stores were up 8.7% in the three months to 28 December. Next \u2013 Winner Next also bucked the gloom as its slick website enabled it to cash in on strong demand for winter coats and knitwear stoked by a cold November. The retailer reported full-price sales growth of 5.2% for the last two months of 2019, with a 3.9% slide in store sales outweighed by a 15.3% jump in online sales. The performance enabled Next to nudge up its profit guidance for the year by \u00a32m to \u00a3727m. Aldi and Lidl \u2013 Winners The German discounters Aldi and Lidl again trounced the mainstream supermarket chains with bumper sales growth over Christmas, fuelled by new store openings. Lidl even claimed to be stealing shoppers from Aldi as sales jumped 11% over the four weeks to 29 December 2019. Aldi\u2019s sales were up 7.9% in the four weeks to Christmas Eve as shoppers filled their trolleys with booze and stollen. Tesco \u2013 Winner The UK\u2019s biggest retailer emerged as one of the success stories from a subdued Christmas for the so-called Big Four supermarket chains. Its chief executive, Dave Lewis, said it had won business with low prices and discounts linked to its Clubcard loyalty scheme. Like-for-like sales at Tesco\u2019s UK stores fell 0.2% in the 19 weeks to 4 January. Dunelm \u2013 Winner The success of this budget home furnishings chain may help explain John Lewis\u2019s woes. The retailer clocked up like-for-like sales growth of 5% in the 13 weeks to 28 December thanks to improvements to its website and a bigger product range. Analysts said its \u00a35 scatter cushions and \u00a330 curtains were helping the retailer, which started as a market stall, pinch customers from upmarket rivals. Majestic Wine/Naked Wines \u2013 Winners Corks were also popping at Majestic Wine which delivered upbeat sales with English wine, cr\u00e9mant and spiced rum among the drinks in vogue. Sales at established stores rose 4.3% in the final three months of 2019, as it shifted nearly 25% more bottles of rum. French fizz also made a comeback with sales of champagne and cr\u00e9mant up 11% and 32%, respectively. Sales at online rival Naked Wines (the companies are no longer co-owned) jumped 11% over the same period with party-ready boxed wines, such as the Portuguese red Montaria Reserva, in demand.",

The sprawling site, once home to the SSI steelworks that went into liquidation in 2015, has been granted the money to turn it into a business park with an aim to create up to 20,000 skilled jobs by 2040. Redcar, a coastal town in north-east England, was one of more than two dozen \u201cred wall\u201d seats where Labour voters ditched lifelong political allegiances to back the Conservatives last month. The prime minister pledged to repay the trust of former Labour voters on a visit to the neighbouring constituency of Sedgefield the day after the election result, with the \u00a371m for SSI one of the first significant cash investments in the region since the poll. Ben Houchen, the Conservative mayor for Tees Valley, told the Guardian last month that Treasury ministers had planned to announce the funding in the November budget until it was jettisoned by the snap election. More than 2,200 people lost their jobs when the Thailand-based Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) went into liquidation with its UK subsidiary running up \u00a3500m worth of debts.

      "bodyText": "An unlikely venue has emerged as a possible site for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library: a Florida trailer park where retirees spend their time on shuffleboard courts and playing cards in a clubhouse overlooking the sea. The \u201cold Florida\u201d town of Briny Breezes occupies 43 acres of prime waterfront land sandwiched between the Atlantic and the intracoastal waterway just 12 miles south of the president\u2019s palatial Mar-a-Lago resort. Incorporated as a town with its own mayor and post office in 1963, the caravan park with a seasonal population of fewer than 650 would set Trump back more than $1bn, according to residents who discussed selling up at a public meeting last month. Trump has previously declared an interest in acquiring the site for development, and James Arena, a real-estate broker and Briny Breezes resident behind the idea, says it would be a perfect addition to Trump\u2019s already diverse Florida property portfolio that includes hotels, golf resorts and a mysterious quarter-acre patch of mosquito-infested scrubland. \u201cThe idea of a presidential township in this area makes a lot of sense,\u201d said Arena, who has lived in Briny Breezes with his wife and two children for almost a decade, and insists he would not be a broker in any deal. \u201cThis is one of the most prestigious pieces of property anyone could own in the world. It\u2019s on a barrier island so is a very safe and secure location. If you were to have a library and museum that you could only access by water taxi it would revitalize the entire waterway in a manner I don\u2019t think anybody could imagine. It would open new restaurants and real estate would boom. \u201cPresident Trump is certainly someone who has the wherewithal to take on a project like this, he\u2019s familiar with the place. I\u2019d love to shake the president\u2019s hand and discuss it with him directly.\u201d With a general election to fight later this year, choosing a venue for his own library \u2013 a museum-cum-memorial traditionally set up by presidents after they leave office \u2013 might not be an immediate priority for Trump. Neither the White House nor the Trump Organization returned the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. It might just be wishful thinking from the residents. But it is no secret Trump was sniffing around the site more than a decade ago, when shareholding residents first sought to sell up for development and make themselves instant millionaires. He told the Palm Beach Post in 2007 that Briny, as it is known fondly to residents, was \u201ca wonderful location\u201d and that he was looking to team up with the developer who wanted to buy the land for $510m. Ultimately that deal fell through. Palm Beach county commissioners, meanwhile, are also believed to be keen to secure Trump\u2019s presidential library, although the spiraling security costs of his frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago have caused friction in the past. At Briny Breezes, Arena said that crumbling infrastructure made it imperative that a deal was struck sooner than later. \u201cOur sea walls were built in 1958, they\u2019re the original,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a licensed engineer tell us in 2017 that the sea walls needed to be replaced, the land needed grading and raising 8ft. We have 9,000 linear feet of sea wall and it would be an extremely expensive project.

      "body": "<p>Bruce Goff was the ultimate outsider architect. Despite being one of the most innovative, imaginative and downright interesting architects in history, with admirers including Frank Gehry, Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Frank Lloyd Wright, Goff, who died in 1982, remains a marginal figure. His exile was partly self-imposed, but there are signs that Goff was also pushed out \u2013 as a result of his sexuality as much as his unorthodox design philosophy.</p> <p>We\u2019ve come to associate US midcentury modernism with minimalism \u2013 everything clean and straight and simple. Goff\u2019s buildings were the exact opposite: curvaceous or unconventionally geometric, busy, flamboyant, mysterious. Critics of the era could not get a handle on him. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/15/charles-jencks-obituary\" title=\"\">Charles Jencks</a> described him as \u201cthe Michelangelo of kitsch\u201d. Others described his work as organic, futuristic, or sci-fi. He was pop and postmodern before the terms existed. What\u2019s more, not one of Goff\u2019s works resembles another, making him even harder to classify.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A recurring motif is of diamond-shaped glass studs set into doors and columns. They are dime-store glass ashtrays</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Consider one of his most famous works: the Bavinger House of 1955. Designed for an artist couple in Norman, Oklahoma, its roofline is a rising spiral hung by cables from a central mast, like a twist of lemon. Its spiralling wall resembles a rockery, embedded with boulders, living plants and chunks of reused waste glass. There are no rooms inside; instead, sitting and sleeping areas are saucer-shaped pods radiating from the core. Even with the advent of computer-aided design, few architects could conceive of such a structure. It resembles nothing else built before or since.</p> <p>Goff would experiment with form, material, structure and ornament to almost absurd degrees. Materials he used in his buildings included aviation parts, goose feathers, oil rig equipment, orange artificial turf (on the roof), lumps of coal, and any kind of glass he could get his hands on. His 1948 Ledbetter House, also in Oklahoma, features a recurring motif of vertical lines of diamond-shaped glass studs set into doors and columns. In fact they are dime-store glass ashtrays.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2b95b39e01533a53d0199523007e9e2d8f32589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2b95b39e01533a53d0199523007e9e2d8f32589/0_0_1280_961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bavinger House in Norman, Oklahoma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bavinger House in Norman, Oklahoma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PUBLIC DOMAIN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Goff was the Michelangelo of kitsch, then his Sistine chapel was a house known as Shin\u2019En Kan in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Designed over a period of 20 years for a wealthy patron named Joe Price, Shin\u2019En Kan had golden roofs and a sunken \u201cconversation pit\u201d lined in deep-pile carpeting. For the windows, he created starburst patterns of sequins and glass tubes, originally intended for the artificial insemination of turkeys. A gallery to house Price\u2019s collection of Japanese screens had a hexagonal, glass-bottomed pool in the middle. On the floor below was a hexagonal Japanese bathtub, so the pool acted as a skylight, and Price could lie in the bath and look up at his art.</p> <p>\u201cHe was slightly humorous, but at heart he\u2019s a serious architect,\u201d says British architect John Sergeant, whom Goff stayed with when he came to Britain in 1978. \u201cAll the houses were very strictly geometrically controlled. I don\u2019t think Goff was able to describe these things in intellectual terms; he just instinctively got them. He picked up the vibes, in music, in film. He was very aware of culture. I took him to a record shop in Cambridge and he came away with a suitcase full of far-out modern classical music \u2013 really noisy stuff.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35c4df2335bb8430a6d420e247788d21659fa19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c4df2335bb8430a6d420e247788d21659fa19a/0_0_3276_3302/992.jpg\" alt=\"A decorative pool in the gallery of Shin\u2019En Kan, Bartlesville, Oklahoma.\" width=\"992\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A decorative pool in the gallery of Shin\u2019En Kan, Bartlesville, Oklahoma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Horst P Horst/Conde Nast via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goff was an outsider from the start. Born in 1904, he grew up in Oklahoma \u2013 way off the cultural radar. Having demonstrated a flair for art as a child, the 12-year-old Goff was taken by his father to a Tulsa architects\u2019 office, where he pleaded with them to give his boy a job. After quickly learning the basics of drafting, he began to produce his own designs. A colleague remarked that his ideas resembled the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Goff had never heard of. So he wrote to Wright, who replied with words of encouragement, and advised him not to study at architecture school and to find his own path.</p> <p>Goff\u2019s first major work was completed when he was just 22: the <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/boston-avenue-methodist-church\" title=\"\">Boston Avenue Methodist Church</a> in Tulsa.

      "bodyText": "Bruce Goff was the ultimate outsider architect. Despite being one of the most innovative, imaginative and downright interesting architects in history, with admirers including Frank Gehry, Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Frank Lloyd Wright, Goff, who died in 1982, remains a marginal figure. His exile was partly self-imposed, but there are signs that Goff was also pushed out \u2013 as a result of his sexuality as much as his unorthodox design philosophy. We\u2019ve come to associate US midcentury modernism with minimalism \u2013 everything clean and straight and simple. Goff\u2019s buildings were the exact opposite: curvaceous or unconventionally geometric, busy, flamboyant, mysterious. Critics of the era could not get a handle on him. Charles Jencks described him as \u201cthe Michelangelo of kitsch\u201d. Others described his work as organic, futuristic, or sci-fi. He was pop and postmodern before the terms existed. What\u2019s more, not one of Goff\u2019s works resembles another, making him even harder to classify. Consider one of his most famous works: the Bavinger House of 1955. Designed for an artist couple in Norman, Oklahoma, its roofline is a rising spiral hung by cables from a central mast, like a twist of lemon. Its spiralling wall resembles a rockery, embedded with boulders, living plants and chunks of reused waste glass. There are no rooms inside; instead, sitting and sleeping areas are saucer-shaped pods radiating from the core. Even with the advent of computer-aided design, few architects could conceive of such a structure. It resembles nothing else built before or since. Goff would experiment with form, material, structure and ornament to almost absurd degrees. Materials he used in his buildings included aviation parts, goose feathers, oil rig equipment, orange artificial turf (on the roof), lumps of coal, and any kind of glass he could get his hands on. His 1948 Ledbetter House, also in Oklahoma, features a recurring motif of vertical lines of diamond-shaped glass studs set into doors and columns. In fact they are dime-store glass ashtrays. If Goff was the Michelangelo of kitsch, then his Sistine chapel was a house known as Shin\u2019En Kan in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Designed over a period of 20 years for a wealthy patron named Joe Price, Shin\u2019En Kan had golden roofs and a sunken \u201cconversation pit\u201d lined in deep-pile carpeting. For the windows, he created starburst patterns of sequins and glass tubes, originally intended for the artificial insemination of turkeys. A gallery to house Price\u2019s collection of Japanese screens had a hexagonal, glass-bottomed pool in the middle. On the floor below was a hexagonal Japanese bathtub, so the pool acted as a skylight, and Price could lie in the bath and look up at his art. \u201cHe was slightly humorous, but at heart he\u2019s a serious architect,\u201d says British architect John Sergeant, whom Goff stayed with when he came to Britain in 1978. \u201cAll the houses were very strictly geometrically controlled. I don\u2019t think Goff was able to describe these things in intellectual terms; he just instinctively got them. He picked up the vibes, in music, in film. He was very aware of culture. I took him to a record shop in Cambridge and he came away with a suitcase full of far-out modern classical music \u2013 really noisy stuff.\u201d Goff was an outsider from the start. Born in 1904, he grew up in Oklahoma \u2013 way off the cultural radar. Having demonstrated a flair for art as a child, the 12-year-old Goff was taken by his father to a Tulsa architects\u2019 office, where he pleaded with them to give his boy a job. After quickly learning the basics of drafting, he began to produce his own designs. A colleague remarked that his ideas resembled the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Goff had never heard of. So he wrote to Wright, who replied with words of encouragement, and advised him not to study at architecture school and to find his own path. Goff\u2019s first major work was completed when he was just 22: the Boston Avenue Methodist Church in Tulsa. It looks like the work of a far older designer, with a soaring art deco spire, ornate detailing and a dramatic circular nave. Scholars are certain Goff was the main designer, though the church was a collaboration with his art teacher, Adah Robinson, who took sole credit. Goff\u2019s \u201cflamboyant personality\u201d did him no favours with the church, according to reports. As one newspaper put it: \u201cMr Goff\u2019s eccentricities were not well received.\u201d It got worse when he began teaching at Oklahoma University in 1946. He was an inspirational teacher and, under his leadership, Oklahoma\u2019s architecture school developed an international reputation; but in 1955 he resigned under a cloud. He was accused of abusing a 14-year-old boy. Many maintain the incident was a setup, engineered by rivals uncomfortable with Goff\u2019s sexuality and jealous of his reputation. Goff was open about being gay and friends describe him as a kind and gentle soul who would never prey on underage boys. He retreated to the wilderness, although he was kept busy by a steady stream of patrons. Shin\u2019En Kan was destroyed in a fire in 1996, which many suspect was arson. Perhaps those walls of coal weren\u2019t such a good idea, after all. The Bavinger House, too, was destroyed. After the death of its owners, it stood empty and fell into disrepair. It was demolished, supposedly after being damaged by a storm in 2011. Many more Goff properties have been lost through straightforward neglect or disregard for his reputation \u2013 although some, including the Ledbetter House, are now on the National Register of Historic Places. Goff\u2019s reputation is being rehabilitated. The Oklahoma film-maker Britni Harris recently completed a new documentary, titled Goff, which premiered at the Architecture &amp; Design Film Festival in New York last October.

Shares in both companies crashed after the warnings, the latest in a series of grim trading statements from the retail sector \u2013 Superdry by 22%, to 368p, and Joules by 33%, to a new low of 152p. In its fourth profit warning in less than 12 months, Superdry told investors on Friday that it may make no profit at all this year after poor trading over the festive period. The company, best known for its hoodies and T-shirts emblazoned with Japanese script, said it expected to make between nil and \u00a310m for the year, against City forecasts of about \u00a320m. In 2019, Superdry made underlying profits of almost \u00a342m, although it made a pre-tax loss of more than \u00a385m after one-off costs.

Superdry said retail sales fell \u00a323m short of expectations after a strong Black Friday discount period, predominantly online. The difficulties come after a change in strategy under the company\u2019s co-founder Julian Dunkerton, who returned in a boardroom coup in April when the business foundered in his absence. The entrepreneur, who started out selling clothes on a Cheltenham market stall, has stopped using price cuts to tempt shoppers and is aiming to have smaller more upmarket collections that play on the brand\u2019s design roots. However, Dunkerton has been hit by a series of difficulties since returning, including a near-\u00a34m accounting error revealed before Christmas. Dunkerton said his plan for long-term growth remained on track despite the profit warning: \u201cWhile we have always said it will take time, we continue to make progress in implementing our strategy.

Because his alcoholic father is dead, responsibility for all these women falls on Thomas. Fortunately, Thomas is well able to provide for both households, thanks to his job at a New York advertising firm where he pulls \u201chigh five figures\u201d turning human fears into consumer desire for products such as mobile phones and medication.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I did for a living,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI spun stories, made things like death seem clean and manageable \u2013 attractive, even.\u201d It\u2019s a warning, and not a very subtle one, that we should be wary of what he\u2019s selling us as the narrator of this novel. There are other warnings in the opening pages. For instance, the truncheon he purchases. \u201cThe billy club was for protection,\u201d says Thomas. Protection from physical threats, but also from something more intangible: \u201cIt was easy to believe that my life as I knew it was just a paper fa\u00e7ade, waiting to be punctured by horrors that could take me from my family \u2013 or worse, take my family from me.\u201d</p> <p>And if that isn\u2019t enough of a red flag, wait till you hear what Thomas has to say about opera. He has a particular love for Wagner\u2019s <em>Tannh\u00e4user</em>, which he calls a \u201csublime story of redemption\u201d. Specifically, he explains, it is about the redemption of a flawed man through the death of the pure woman who loves him. Readers will likely get twitchy here, noticing that Thomas seems very comfortable with feminine sacrifice in the service of masculine salvation, very conscious of his own need to be saved, and very opaque about what has happened to his wife.</p> <p>We learn that Thomas has somehow been deprived of his \u201cgirls\u201d (this is the fussy, infantilising word he uses to refer to his wife and daughter). We also learn that the circumstances of that deprivation were sufficiently lurid to have been the subject of widespread press coverage (\u201cThey write of revenge, of altruism \u2013 of the plight of women and the plight of men\u201d). And we learn that, as well as losing his father, Thomas has also lost an older sister, Evie, with whom he seems to have been uncommonly close (\u201cWe would play in Evie\u2019s bedroom, pretending to be Mimi and Rodolfo, Tristan and Isolde\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7252bb6e58311652644ea84aa1622178f384b622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7252bb6e58311652644ea84aa1622178f384b622/0_824_2393_1435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commitment to character \u2026 Ani Katz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commitment to character \u2026 Ani Katz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara J Winston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In other words, by the end of the first 20 pages, debut author Ani Katz has racked up a whole armoury over the mantelpiece.

And she\u2019s very much cracked it with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/little-women-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-emma-watson\">Little Women</a>, scoring a decent commercial return as well as rave reviews across the board (notwithstanding a small-scale rumpus over a male/female divide in its audience). Even if the Golden Globes failed to notice her, she\u2019s got every chance of an Oscar nomination this week.</p> <h2>El Topo (18)</h2> <p><em>(Alejandro Jodorowsky, 1970, Mex) 124 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=widMYyUbvfE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/widMYyUbvfE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of the more berserk products of the counter-culture era, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/09/el-topo-review-alejandro-jodorowsky\">El Topo</a> is directed by and stars Chilean film-maker Alejandro Jodorowsky (who would complete one more film, The Holy Mountain, before effectively disappearing for a decade and a half). Jodorowsky plays a black-clad gunslinger seeking mystical insights: after shooting down a series of symbolic opponents he ends up in a cave with a tribe of outcasts.

No, instead, the Iowa shouters return in full gimp-masked splendour to offer the terrifying sounds of new album We Are Not Your Kind \u2013 an \u201cart record\u201d, according to percussionist Shawn \u201cClown\u201d Crahan. Good times! <br><em><a href=\"https://www.slipknot1.com/events\">Dublin, Tuesday 14;</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.slipknot1.com/events\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.slipknot1.com/events\">Manchester, Thursday 16; Newcastle upon Tyne, Friday 17; touring to 25 January</a></em></p> <h2>Five Day Forecast</h2> <p>Dismayed at being back in the grips of the working week again? Relieve corporate gloom at this annual festival from music website The Line of Best Fit, which runs on weekday evenings. Tip-top talent includes sweet-voiced US singer-songwriter Frances Quinlan, dreamy Irish combo Just Mustard and winsome Philly outfit the Districts. <br><em><a href=\"http://thelexington.co.uk/events.php\">The Lexington, N1, Monday 13 to Friday 17 January</a></em></p> <h2>Day6</h2> <p>The a-ha of K-pop, hit-making Korean combo Day6 are that rarest of beasts: a boyband whose pouty members write their own songs and perform them, on actual instruments. The result is the kind of sunny power-pop that might occur if Green Day started covering ELO songs (in Korean, obviously). Extra points for song titles including Lovely Girl, Hi Hello and I Like You. <br><em><a href=\"https://academymusicgroup.com/o2academybrixton/events/1294383/day6-tickets\">02 Academy Brixton, SW9, Sunday 12 January</a></em></p> <h2>Noah Gundersen</h2> <p>Seattle pop troubadour Noah Gundersen got an early break in 2013 with a track featured on The Vampire Diaries, the perfect showcase for his growly, polished sound. But he\u2019s at his best stripped right back, as on 2018\u2019s collab with Phoebe Bridgers, Killer + the Sound. This tour offers fittingly intimate settings for songs from Gundersen\u2019s last LP, the super-sincere Lover. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.noahgundersen.com/\">Union Chapel, N1, Thursday 16; Gorilla, Manchester, Friday 17; touring to 20 January</a></em></p> <p><em>SH</em></p> <h2>Liran Donin\u2019s 1000 Boats</h2> <p>Tel Aviv-born bassist and composer Liran Donin is a cornerstone of former Mercury-nominated sax-blasters Led Bib, but his own folk-jazzy 1000 Boats band reveals imaginatively different dimensions to his work. The soundworlds of Hermeto Pascoal, fellow bassist Avishai Cohen, Carla Bley and uninhibited free-jazz meet in this kaleidoscopically lyrical group. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.lirandonin.com/new-cover-page-1\">The Lescar, Sheffield, Wednesday 15; 1000 Trades, Birmingham, Friday 17 January</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f64c545eff504a1ad2b1916d473dcc75c7770787\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f64c545eff504a1ad2b1916d473dcc75c7770787/412_187_1366_1706/801.jpg\" alt=\"Composer David Lang\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prisoner release\u2026 composer David Lang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Serling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Prisoner of the State</h2> <p>Musically, 2020 is going to be dominated by events marking the 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth. The BBC Symphony Orchestra, along with the BBC Singers, get their tribute under way with the European premiere of a concert opera by David Lang that updates the story of Beethoven\u2019s only opera, Fidelio, to the present day. It stars Claron McFadden and the staging is directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer; Ilan Volkov conducts. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/bbc-symphony-orchestra-david-langs-prisoner-of-the-state\">Barbican Hall, EC2,</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/bbc-symphony-orchestra-david-langs-prisoner-of-the-state\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/bbc-symphony-orchestra-david-langs-prisoner-of-the-state\">Saturday 12 January</a></em></p> <h2>Scottish Inspirations</h2> <p>Two premieres and a rarely heard 19th-century symphony linked by their Scottish associations make up the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra\u2019s first concert of the year, conducted by Thomas Dausgaard. Bent S\u00f8rensen\u2019s Enchantress: 5 Intermezzi for Orchestra takes its title from a poem by Walter Scott, while The Sail of a Flame, Emma-Ruth Richards\u2019s song cycle for mezzo-soprano and orchestra, sets texts by modern Scottish poets. The revival is the Gaelic Symphony by Amy Beach, based on Scottish, Irish and English folk tunes. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/emz3v2\">City Halls, Glasgow, Saturday 12 January</a></em></p> <h2>Sukanya</h2> <p>This year sees the centenary of the birth of Ravi Shankar, and the London Philharmonic are marking the anniversary with a revival of their 2017 semi-staging of the composer-sitarist\u2019s only opera. Based upon a story from the Mahabharata, Sukanya is scored for Indian and western instruments, and involves dancers as well as singers; David Murphy conducts the performance, which is directed by Suba Das and choreographed by Gauri Diwakar, with Susanna Hurrell in the title role. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/130360-sukanya-2020\">Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Wednesday</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed12a88ce7635918febca35512914f7b40bc9673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed12a88ce7635918febca35512914f7b40bc9673/0_32_6615_4737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feast &amp; Fast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"716\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For all tastes\u2026 Feast &amp; Fast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Essex Road 6</h2> <p>The great Adam Chodzko is among the participants in this group show. Chodzko\u2019s disconcerting interventions on the border of art and life (Fluid Dynamics; The Raising of the Quail, pictured) are always worth investigating. Other good artists here include Ayo Akingbade, Rebecca Lennon, Patrick Goddard, Melanie Smith and Webb-Ellis.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.tintypegallery.com/exhibitions/essex-road-6/\">Tintype Gallery, N1,</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.tintypegallery.com/exhibitions/essex-road-6/\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.tintypegallery.com/exhibitions/essex-road-6/\">to 9 February</a></em></p> <h2>Digital Strata</h2> <p>The London Arts Board sounds authoritative but it\u2019s just an old billboard on a Camberwell street corner where upcoming artists create public projects. Seungwon Jung\u2019s is about the nature of time. She uses the imagery of geological strata, layers of rock that reveal millions of years of time, to explore the \u201cdeep time\u201d of memory. <br><em><a href=\"https://londonartsboard.blogspot.com/\">London Arts Board, SE5, to 2 February</a></em></p> <h2>Damien Hirst</h2> <p>So much that passes for contemporary art is smooth, smart and completely forgettable. Damien Hirst is a monster in this mainstream, as hated by cool arty people as he is by any traditionalists who may survive. And that\u2019s why he matters. His giant bronze sculptures stick out like sore thumbs on this sculpture park\u2019s rolling hills \u2013 luridly painted lifelike statues that are both ugly and compelling. <br><em><a href=\"https://ysp.org.uk/exhibitions/damien-hirst\">Yorkshire Sculpture Park, near Wakefield, to 1 April 2022</a></em></p> <h2>Hello, Robot</h2> <p>Fantasies of intelligent and mobile machines have stalked the modern imagination from Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis to The Terminator and beyond. But are our robot dreams \u2013 and nightmares \u2013 becoming real? This exhibition mixes the latest strides in robotics with the rich legacy of science fiction to explore the boundaries of technology. The Star Wars droids make a timely guest appearance. But are their real-world cousins as characterful? <br><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/dundee/exhibitions/hello-robot\">V&amp;A Dundee, to 9 February</a></em></p> <h2>Feast &amp; Fast</h2> <p>Food has obsessed painters ever since ancient Greek artists competed to fool birds into pecking their pictures of fruit. But the painting of food reached its apogee in the 17th century when Caravaggio\u2019s black grapes pointed the way to richly real displays of Dutch cheeses, beer and lobsters and Spanish celery and meat. This show surveys a truly delicious theme from 1500 to 1800. <br><em><a href=\"https://feast-and-fast.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/\">Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, to 26 April</a></em></p> <p><em>JJ</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d0be14582139ccf533980d463fbf8ed07af113b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d0be14582139ccf533980d463fbf8ed07af113b/0_0_4938_3292/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guys and Dolls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Casey (centre) in Guys and Dolls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Uncle Vanya</h2> <p>One of the first big-hitters of the theatrical year arrives and it\u2019s set to be a cracker. This adaptation is penned by Conor McPherson, whom you can always depend on to create something special. A stunning cast includes Toby Jones (always an enigma) in the title role, plus Richard Armitage (always powerful) and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds (always devastating). Directed by Ian Rickson. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.haroldpintertheatre.co.uk/uncle-vanya\">The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1,</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.haroldpintertheatre.co.uk/uncle-vanya\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.haroldpintertheatre.co.uk/uncle-vanya\">Tuesday 14 January to 2 May</a></em></p> <h2>Guys and Dolls</h2> <p>Director Robert Hastie has created a sparkling new take on Frank Loesser\u2019s musical about seductive sinner Sky Masterston and the woman who might just save his soul. The whole cast is clearly having a ball but Natalie Casey (pictured) and Martin Marquez steal the show as long-time lovers (and squabblers) Miss Adelaide and Nathan Detroit. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/events/guys-and-dolls\">Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, to 18 January</a></em></p> <h2>Scenes With Girls</h2> <p>Miriam Battye has been steadily making a name for herself with intriguing plays for the National Youth Theatre and Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange. Her latest drama is about close friends Tosh and Lou who\u2019ve grown up together \u2013 just the two of them (and their own special language) against the world. What future do they imagine for themselves? Lucy Morrison directs Rebekah Murrell, Tanya Reynolds and Letty Thomas. <br><em><a href=\"https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/sceneswithgirls/\">Royal Court, SW1, Wednesday 15 January to 22 February</a></em></p> <h2>West Side Story</h2> <p>It\u2019s your last chance to see Nikolai Foster\u2019s bold take on Leonard Bernstein\u2019s masterful musical. Even the most innovative shows can end up being predictable but this West Side Story feels timely and new. There\u2019s original choreography from Ellen Kane, and a real sense of danger and spontaneity underpins all those clicks and high kicks. Romantic leads Adriana Ivelisse and Jamie Muscato make sure this Romeo and Juliet-inspired musical is still shot through with tenderness. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.curveonline.co.uk/whats-on/shows/west-side-story-2/\">Curve Theatre, Leicester, to 18 January</a></em></p> <h2>Beckett Triple Bill</h2> <p>This is quite a coup for fringe theatre Jermyn Street. Trevor Nunn is directing a triple bill of Beckett plays: Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, Eh Joe and The Old Tune. The big-hitting cast features Niall Buggy, James Hayes, David Threlfall and Beckett actor extraordinaire Lisa Dwan. It\u2019s a rare chance to see these special and haunting plays all in one go, and they should feel particularly intense in this intimate venue. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/show/beckett-triple-bill/\">Jermyn Street Theatre, SW1, Wednesday 15 January to 8 February</a></em></p> <p><em>MG</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best \u2026 dance shows</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6797154b3cd5d1371e544ce87db245d8501e4d8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6797154b3cd5d1371e544ce87db245d8501e4d8a/0_55_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"William Forsythe\u2019s Playlist by English National Ballet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Forsythe\u2019s Playlist by English National Ballet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Liotardo/English National Ballet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>English National Ballet: 70th Anniversary Gala</h2> <p>Originally called the London Festival Ballet, ENB celebrates its 70th birthday \u2013 looking pretty spry for 70, you have to say \u2013 with a feast of dance nuggets from down the years.

Spun out (with writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns) from a story Mendes heard from his grandfather, 1917 follows two soldiers as they head across no man\u2019s land to deliver a vital message. An immersive tour de force of apparently unbroken takes. Uncut Gems (15) (Josh and Benny Safdie, 2019, US) 135 mins Adam Sandler turns in a dynamic, brilliant performance in Uncut Gems as gem-dealing hustler Howard Ratner, selling jewels as he tries to pay off the loan sharks. The Safdie brothers (of Good Time renown) direct at a hundred miles an hour; their frenetic style bringing out the best in Sandler, who is leagues ahead of his more customary gormless comedy persona. Seberg (15) (Benedict Andrews, 2019, UK/US) 102 mins Here is a real Hollywood tragedy: Jean Seberg, the elfin, pixie-cropped star of Saint Joan and Breathless, who rattled the FBI\u2019s cage by getting involved with the Black Panthers, ending up on the receiving end of a Cointelpro anti-subversion operation. Kristen Stewart, who knows a thing or two about being the subject of unwelcome intrusion, plays Seberg, the immaculately tailored exponent of radical chic. Little Women (U) (Greta Gerwig, 2019, US) 135 mins Greta Gerwig has made a major step up from Lady Bird: taking on a beloved, all-time classic is never easy. And she\u2019s very much cracked it with Little Women, scoring a decent commercial return as well as rave reviews across the board (notwithstanding a small-scale rumpus over a male/female divide in its audience). Even if the Golden Globes failed to notice her, she\u2019s got every chance of an Oscar nomination this week. El Topo (18) (Alejandro Jodorowsky, 1970, Mex) 124 mins One of the more berserk products of the counter-culture era, El Topo is directed by and stars Chilean film-maker Alejandro Jodorowsky (who would complete one more film, The Holy Mountain, before effectively disappearing for a decade and a half). Jodorowsky plays a black-clad gunslinger seeking mystical insights: after shooting down a series of symbolic opponents he ends up in a cave with a tribe of outcasts. It may not make sense, but who cares? AP Five of the best \u2026 rock, pop &amp; jazz Slipknot Time has not mellowed Slipknot, thankfully, and the nu-metal troupe will not be making a comeback with nice new haircuts for an all-acoustic tour. No, instead, the Iowa shouters return in full gimp-masked splendour to offer the terrifying sounds of new album We Are Not Your Kind \u2013 an \u201cart record\u201d, according to percussionist Shawn \u201cClown\u201d Crahan. Good times! Dublin, Tuesday 14; Manchester, Thursday 16; Newcastle upon Tyne, Friday 17; touring to 25 January Five Day Forecast Dismayed at being back in the grips of the working week again? Relieve corporate gloom at this annual festival from music website The Line of Best Fit, which runs on weekday evenings. Tip-top talent includes sweet-voiced US singer-songwriter Frances Quinlan, dreamy Irish combo Just Mustard and winsome Philly outfit the Districts. The Lexington, N1, Monday 13 to Friday 17 January Day6 The a-ha of K-pop, hit-making Korean combo Day6 are that rarest of beasts: a boyband whose pouty members write their own songs and perform them, on actual instruments. The result is the kind of sunny power-pop that might occur if Green Day started covering ELO songs (in Korean, obviously). Extra points for song titles including Lovely Girl, Hi Hello and I Like You. 02 Academy Brixton, SW9, Sunday 12 January Noah Gundersen Seattle pop troubadour Noah Gundersen got an early break in 2013 with a track featured on The Vampire Diaries, the perfect showcase for his growly, polished sound. But he\u2019s at his best stripped right back, as on 2018\u2019s collab with Phoebe Bridgers, Killer + the Sound. This tour offers fittingly intimate settings for songs from Gundersen\u2019s last LP, the super-sincere Lover. Union Chapel, N1, Thursday 16; Gorilla, Manchester, Friday 17; touring to 20 January SH Liran Donin\u2019s 1000 Boats Tel Aviv-born bassist and composer Liran Donin is a cornerstone of former Mercury-nominated sax-blasters Led Bib, but his own folk-jazzy 1000 Boats band reveals imaginatively different dimensions to his work. The soundworlds of Hermeto Pascoal, fellow bassist Avishai Cohen, Carla Bley and uninhibited free-jazz meet in this kaleidoscopically lyrical group. The Lescar, Sheffield, Wednesday 15; 1000 Trades, Birmingham, Friday 17 January JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Prisoner of the State Musically, 2020 is going to be dominated by events marking the 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth. The BBC Symphony Orchestra, along with the BBC Singers, get their tribute under way with the European premiere of a concert opera by David Lang that updates the story of Beethoven\u2019s only opera, Fidelio, to the present day. It stars Claron McFadden and the staging is directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer; Ilan Volkov conducts. Barbican Hall, EC2, Saturday 12 January Scottish Inspirations Two premieres and a rarely heard 19th-century symphony linked by their Scottish associations make up the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra\u2019s first concert of the year, conducted by Thomas Dausgaard. Bent S\u00f8rensen\u2019s Enchantress: 5 Intermezzi for Orchestra takes its title from a poem by Walter Scott, while The Sail of a Flame, Emma-Ruth Richards\u2019s song cycle for mezzo-soprano and orchestra, sets texts by modern Scottish poets. The revival is the Gaelic Symphony by Amy Beach, based on Scottish, Irish and English folk tunes. City Halls, Glasgow, Saturday 12 January Sukanya This year sees the centenary of the birth of Ravi Shankar, and the London Philharmonic are marking the anniversary with a revival of their 2017 semi-staging of the composer-sitarist\u2019s only opera. Based upon a story from the Mahabharata, Sukanya is scored for Indian and western instruments, and involves dancers as well as singers; David Murphy conducts the performance, which is directed by Suba Das and choreographed by Gauri Diwakar, with Susanna Hurrell in the title role. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Wednesday AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Essex Road 6 The great Adam Chodzko is among the participants in this group show. Chodzko\u2019s disconcerting interventions on the border of art and life (Fluid Dynamics; The Raising of the Quail, pictured) are always worth investigating. Other good artists here include Ayo Akingbade, Rebecca Lennon, Patrick Goddard, Melanie Smith and Webb-Ellis. Tintype Gallery, N1, to 9 February Digital Strata The London Arts Board sounds authoritative but it\u2019s just an old billboard on a Camberwell street corner where upcoming artists create public projects. Seungwon Jung\u2019s is about the nature of time. She uses the imagery of geological strata, layers of rock that reveal millions of years of time, to explore the \u201cdeep time\u201d of memory. London Arts Board, SE5, to 2 February Damien Hirst So much that passes for contemporary art is smooth, smart and completely forgettable. Damien Hirst is a monster in this mainstream, as hated by cool arty people as he is by any traditionalists who may survive. And that\u2019s why he matters. His giant bronze sculptures stick out like sore thumbs on this sculpture park\u2019s rolling hills \u2013 luridly painted lifelike statues that are both ugly and compelling. Yorkshire Sculpture Park, near Wakefield, to 1 April 2022 Hello, Robot Fantasies of intelligent and mobile machines have stalked the modern imagination from Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis to The Terminator and beyond. But are our robot dreams \u2013 and nightmares \u2013 becoming real? This exhibition mixes the latest strides in robotics with the rich legacy of science fiction to explore the boundaries of technology. The Star Wars droids make a timely guest appearance. But are their real-world cousins as characterful? V&amp;A Dundee, to 9 February Feast &amp; Fast Food has obsessed painters ever since ancient Greek artists competed to fool birds into pecking their pictures of fruit. But the painting of food reached its apogee in the 17th century when Caravaggio\u2019s black grapes pointed the way to richly real displays of Dutch cheeses, beer and lobsters and Spanish celery and meat. This show surveys a truly delicious theme from 1500 to 1800. Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, to 26 April JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Uncle Vanya One of the first big-hitters of the theatrical year arrives and it\u2019s set to be a cracker. This adaptation is penned by Conor McPherson, whom you can always depend on to create something special. A stunning cast includes Toby Jones (always an enigma) in the title role, plus Richard Armitage (always powerful) and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds (always devastating). Directed by Ian Rickson. The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1, Tuesday 14 January to 2 May Guys and Dolls Director Robert Hastie has created a sparkling new take on Frank Loesser\u2019s musical about seductive sinner Sky Masterston and the woman who might just save his soul. The whole cast is clearly having a ball but Natalie Casey (pictured) and Martin Marquez steal the show as long-time lovers (and squabblers) Miss Adelaide and Nathan Detroit. Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, to 18 January Scenes With Girls Miriam Battye has been steadily making a name for herself with intriguing plays for the National Youth Theatre and Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange. Her latest drama is about close friends Tosh and Lou who\u2019ve grown up together \u2013 just the two of them (and their own special language) against the world. What future do they imagine for themselves? Lucy Morrison directs Rebekah Murrell, Tanya Reynolds and Letty Thomas. Royal Court, SW1, Wednesday 15 January to 22 February West Side Story It\u2019s your last chance to see Nikolai Foster\u2019s bold take on Leonard Bernstein\u2019s masterful musical. Even the most innovative shows can end up being predictable but this West Side Story feels timely and new. There\u2019s original choreography from Ellen Kane, and a real sense of danger and spontaneity underpins all those clicks and high kicks. Romantic leads Adriana Ivelisse and Jamie Muscato make sure this Romeo and Juliet-inspired musical is still shot through with tenderness. Curve Theatre, Leicester, to 18 January Beckett Triple Bill This is quite a coup for fringe theatre Jermyn Street. Trevor Nunn is directing a triple bill of Beckett plays: Krapp\u2019s Last Tape, Eh Joe and The Old Tune. The big-hitting cast features Niall Buggy, James Hayes, David Threlfall and Beckett actor extraordinaire Lisa Dwan. It\u2019s a rare chance to see these special and haunting plays all in one go, and they should feel particularly intense in this intimate venue. Jermyn Street Theatre, SW1, Wednesday 15 January to 8 February MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows English National Ballet: 70th Anniversary Gala Originally called the London Festival Ballet, ENB celebrates its 70th birthday \u2013 looking pretty spry for 70, you have to say \u2013 with a feast of dance nuggets from down the years. There\u2019ll be extracts from ballets by George Balanchine, Rudolf Nureyev, Roland Petit, William Forsythe, Akram Khan and more. London Coliseum, WC2, Friday 17 &amp; 18 January Compagnie HMG: 3D London international mime festival always throws up unexpected oddball delights and Jonathan Guichard\u2019s 3D could be one of them. An acrobat and wire-walker, Guichard\u2019s intimate show is based on a specially constructed piece of circus equipment that looks like a giant longbow. Jacksons Lane, N6, Saturday 11 &amp; Sunday 12 January Strictly Come Dancing: The Live Tour For when you\u2019re having withdrawal symptoms from the dazzling smiles, unerring positivity and ballroom dance-based bonding that is Strictly, the live tour comes to the rescue. The 2018 winner Stacey Dooley hosts all your faves. Arena Birmingham, Thursday 16 to 19 January; touring to 9 February LW",

Prediction: Texans 13-24 Chiefs Seattle Seahawks at Green Bay Packers Sunday, 6.40pm ET/11.40pm GMT What the Seahawks need to do to win: No team has won more games away from home this year than Seattle, who went 7-1 on the road during the regular season before Sunday\u2019s wildcard triumph in Philadelphia. A divisional playoff in a building where they have lost eight straight dating back to the Clinton administration will be their most difficult task yet, even if Lambeau isn\u2019t the postseason fortress it once was. Getting pressure on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers will be critical. Seattle recorded only 28 sacks during the regular season, fewer than any team besides the lowly Dolphins \u2013 but they piled up seven on Sunday against the Eagles. They will also need production out of emergency signing Marshawn Lynch against a defense that\u2019s been considerably better against the pass than the run. What the Packers need to do to win: The injuries to Seattle\u2019s top three running backs suggest the Seahawks will rely heavily on wideouts Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf, whose 160 receiving yards against the Eagles was a rookie playoff record. Green Bay will need lockdown efforts from their young cornerback tandem of Kevin King and Jaire Alexander to keep the visitors\u2019 offense in check. On the other side of the ball, the Packers have been at their best when they have gotten running back Aaron Jones involved both as a runner and a pass-catcher early and often. Key player: QB Russell Wilson, Seahawks. Seattle\u2019s star quarterback is winless in three career starts at Lambeau with a passer rating of 60.4 and twice as many interceptions (six) as touchdowns (three), but his mobility and uncanny ability to extend plays could be just what the Seahawks need to keep their improbable run alive. Prediction: Seahawks 17-16 Packers",

She and her husband, Joe Stelt, had been drinking dangerous levels of PFAS for years, and Stelt had died from liver cancer in March 2016. The level of PFAS in Wynn-Stelt\u2019s blood soared to 750 times that of the national average. She now suffers from recurrent thyroid problems and developed gout, and more serious issues are likely.

Biosolids contaminated with it were discovered two years ago in Lapeer, where a chrome plating facility <a href=\"https://pfasproject.com/lapeer-mi/\">discharged the chemicals</a> into the Flint River. A few hours north in Oscoda, the air force is refusing to clean up <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/map-shows-michigan-schools-daycares-with-pfas-in-the-well-water.html\">contamination from a shuttered base</a>, while officials have found <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/map-shows-michigan-schools-daycares-with-pfas-in-the-well-water.html\">contaminated wells</a> at schools and daycare centers across the state.</p> <p>Still, PFAS production and use is unabated in the state as Republicans <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/11/polluter-panel-hits-pause-on-michigan-pfas-drinking-water-rules.html\">in Michigan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/10/pfas-trump-defense-authorization-bill/4383945002/\">Congress </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/14/epa-toxic-chemicals-pfos-pfoa-delay\">White House </a>have successfully blocked stricter regulations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, those living with the contamination call life an \u201cabsolute nightmare\u201d. Wynn-Stelt said neighbors have faced cancer, miscarriages, autoimmune disorders and other health issues. That includes Jen Carney, whose children, ages 15 and 11, are among 22 kids living near the House Street dump.</p> <p>The family\u2019s well tested as high as 600 ppt while a neighbors\u2019 hit 11,000 ppt. The Carneys all have elevated PFAS levels in their blood, and in the years before the revelation, Carney and neighbors suffered from unexplained twitching, eye pain, migraines, distorted vision and numb arms and legs.</p> <p>\u201cI was, at the time, 38, and I was thinking, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to be in a wheelchair soon,\u2019\u201d Carney said.</p> <p>Once the family switched from PFAS-contaminated water to clean water, the issues vanished. Carney\u2019s son, however, hasn\u2019t been so fortunate. He endures severe gastrointestinal problems that forced him to miss so much school that Carney now homeschools him. She said she hopes time will alleviate his symptoms.</p> <p>Though it\u2019s evident to families in the area that PFAS are behind their ailments, the chemicals haven\u2019t been medically proven to cause them, so their illnesses can\u2019t be used in the lawsuit that local families have <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/09/wolverine-3m-class-action-lawsuit-plaintiffs-join-forces.html\">filed</a> against Wolverine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dc92455b493e64540a017689badc2e00f4f1076\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dc92455b493e64540a017689badc2e00f4f1076/0_0_2001_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PFAS-laden animal hides camouflaged with moss near Meaghan Schweizer\u2019s home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PFAS-laden animal hides camouflaged with moss near Meaghan Schweinzger\u2019s home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Meaghan Schweinzger</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI know in my heart that it\u2019s connected, and my primary care doctor believes it\u2019s connected, but we have to have it scientifically connected,\u201d Carney said. \u201cUnfortunately, until we do that, we can\u2019t hold the polluters accountable.\u201d</p> <p>The 76-acre House Street landfill most recently served as a Christmas tree farm, and neighborhood residents didn\u2019t know Wolverine had previously used it to dump toxic animal hides treated with 3M\u2019s Scotchgard at its tannery in nearby Rockford. </p> <p>The chemicals not only flowed a few hundred feet to House Street\u2019s wells, but far beyond.

The EPA, state and Wolverine are undertaking a massive cleanup effort. So far, the company has installed about 700 whole-home filters and excavated tons of soil in the area. As part of a settlement in a lawsuit stemming from the pollution, Wolverine will pay $69.5m to extend municipal water service to those around House Street who have private wells.</p> <p>\u201cWolverine will also continue the cleanup and remediation efforts it began [last] fall around its former tannery and House Street sites in cooperation with the EPA,\u201d the company said in a statement.

They\u2019ve appeared in front of the Michigan legislature, Congress, and spoken at a number of conferences and events to help put a face on the crisis and share the distressing uncertainty.

Wynn-Stelt and her neighbors in this small west Michigan community are among the PFAS crisis\u2019s human toll \u2013 those suffering the horrors that await humans with too much of the toxic chemical in their bodies. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 5,000 fluorinated compounds dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they don\u2019t naturally break down and there\u2019s no known way to destroy them. They\u2019re found in everything from food packaging to clothing to eyeliner to firefighting foam. The chemicals are also strongly linked to cancer, low birth weight, autoimmune disorders, thyroid issues, and a range of other serious diseases. By the time Wynn-Stelt learned of the contamination, it was too late. She and her husband, Joe Stelt, had been drinking dangerous levels of PFAS for years, and Stelt had died from liver cancer in March 2016. The level of PFAS in Wynn-Stelt\u2019s blood soared to 750 times that of the national average. She now suffers from recurrent thyroid problems and developed gout, and more serious issues are likely. She has been left \u201cscared to death\u201d and overwhelmed. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here full of this stuff and not knowing what it\u2019s going to do to me five years, 10 years from now,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost my husband, my home is worth nothing. I couldn\u2019t give it away this close to a toxic dump \u2026 or after they dumped toxic waste on my land.\u201d As the chemicals gather around the planet, public health officials have found more than 700 contaminated sites and waterways around the country, and the PFAS crisis\u2019s breadth is coming into focus. Researchers recently identified dangerous levels in rain, and areas around military bases are regularly contaminated. By some estimates, 21 million Americans are drinking PFAS-contaminated water \u2013 in the fall, an environmental group found the chemicals in California and Kentucky\u2019s water supplies. However, no state has more contaminated sites than Michigan, although officials say that\u2019s because the state is conducting more tests to look for PFAS. Biosolids contaminated with it were discovered two years ago in Lapeer, where a chrome plating facility discharged the chemicals into the Flint River. A few hours north in Oscoda, the air force is refusing to clean up contamination from a shuttered base, while officials have found contaminated wells at schools and daycare centers across the state. Still, PFAS production and use is unabated in the state as Republicans in Michigan, Congress and the White House have successfully blocked stricter regulations. Meanwhile, those living with the contamination call life an \u201cabsolute nightmare\u201d. Wynn-Stelt said neighbors have faced cancer, miscarriages, autoimmune disorders and other health issues. That includes Jen Carney, whose children, ages 15 and 11, are among 22 kids living near the House Street dump. The family\u2019s well tested as high as 600 ppt while a neighbors\u2019 hit 11,000 ppt. The Carneys all have elevated PFAS levels in their blood, and in the years before the revelation, Carney and neighbors suffered from unexplained twitching, eye pain, migraines, distorted vision and numb arms and legs. \u201cI was, at the time, 38, and I was thinking, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to be in a wheelchair soon,\u2019\u201d Carney said. Once the family switched from PFAS-contaminated water to clean water, the issues vanished. Carney\u2019s son, however, hasn\u2019t been so fortunate. He endures severe gastrointestinal problems that forced him to miss so much school that Carney now homeschools him. She said she hopes time will alleviate his symptoms. Though it\u2019s evident to families in the area that PFAS are behind their ailments, the chemicals haven\u2019t been medically proven to cause them, so their illnesses can\u2019t be used in the lawsuit that local families have filed against Wolverine. \u201cI know in my heart that it\u2019s connected, and my primary care doctor believes it\u2019s connected, but we have to have it scientifically connected,\u201d Carney said. \u201cUnfortunately, until we do that, we can\u2019t hold the polluters accountable.\u201d The 76-acre House Street landfill most recently served as a Christmas tree farm, and neighborhood residents didn\u2019t know Wolverine had previously used it to dump toxic animal hides treated with 3M\u2019s Scotchgard at its tannery in nearby Rockford. The chemicals not only flowed a few hundred feet to House Street\u2019s wells, but far beyond. That plume and six others from nearby Wolverine landfills now stretch 25 miles and have carried PFAS to the state\u2019s waterways. The EPA, state and Wolverine are undertaking a massive cleanup effort. So far, the company has installed about 700 whole-home filters and excavated tons of soil in the area. As part of a settlement in a lawsuit stemming from the pollution, Wolverine will pay $69.5m to extend municipal water service to those around House Street who have private wells. \u201cWolverine will also continue the cleanup and remediation efforts it began [last] fall around its former tannery and House Street sites in cooperation with the EPA,\u201d the company said in a statement. It\u2019s also suing 3M for allegedly concealing Scotchgard\u2019s dangers from it and other customers. The cleanup effort extends to areas outside Wolverine\u2019s former landfill where residents say it was also dumped. House Street resident Meaghan Schweinzger\u2019s kids used to camp out, sled, and have bonfires in a clearing at the edge of the woods behind their home. In 2017, Schweinzger was horrified to discover that Wolverine had also left barrels full of toxic waste and PFAS-laden animal hides now camouflaged with moss in the brush just a few feet from where her kids played. Schweinzger, Wynn-Stelt, and others aren\u2019t taking it lying down. They\u2019ve appeared in front of the Michigan legislature, Congress, and spoken at a number of conferences and events to help put a face on the crisis and share the distressing uncertainty. Wynn-Stelt said she thinks at night about Joel Stelt\u2019s bout with cancer, and how she faces what could be a difficult illness without him. \u201cTo know how painful that was for him, and how I literally had to carry him to the bathroom, and how I couldn\u2019t leave his side \u2013 it was horrible to watch, and now I think, \u2018Who\u2019s going to do that for me\u2019\u201d? she said. * This article was amended on 22 January 2020 to clarify a reference to dumping and to include Wolverine\u2019s stance on no deaths being proven to be linked to PFAS from the site.",

      "body": "<p>About halfway through Rob Doyle\u2019s third book, a writer and philosopher, who might exist as a fictional character, or only as a briefly assumed disguise of that character\u2019s author, tours a German art fair, the Kassel documenta. He\u2019s resentful that contemporary art has allowed itself to become \u201ca festival of piety\u201d. At the same time he\u2019s \u201cnumbly determined\u201d to encounter as much art as he can before leaving. He records this ambition shortly after a paragraph spent designing the ultimate \u201cperfectly self-erasing\u201d artwork: a piece conceived, made and hidden forever inside the imagination of the artist, never announced, never exhibited. Perhaps, he concludes, the world already contains many such \u201cinvisible marvels\u201d. Meanwhile, a self-erasing artwork in himself, he\u2019s being both led and pursued around the documenta by a mysterious Kurdish artist called Nisran, who might or might not have slept with two of the 9/11 hijackers. She\u2019s \u201cdefinitely evil, but in an interesting way\u201d, a friend warns him. He promptly allows himself to be suckered into a blackly comic, self-erasing parody of a serial killer thriller.</p> <p>The first thing you do after reading a chapter of <em>Threshold</em> is carry out a search to check that this is a novel \u2013 or if it isn\u2019t, what it is. For the reader, that\u2019s a matter of orientation. The critic and fiction writer Chris Power, quoted on the publisher\u2019s website, thinks of the book as \u201csomewhere between novel, essay collection, report, travelogue and confession\u201d. The novelist Rachel Kushner, more certain that it\u2019s a novel, nevertheless admits to having wondered what sort of a novel it might be. The author is in no such difficulty. On page 27 he tells us: \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject, let\u2019s define our terms. For my purposes, a novel is simply a long chunk of prose in which whatever is said to have happened may or may not have actually happened.\u201d</p> <p><em>Threshold</em>\u2019s central character, then, is a philosopher and critic, a man calling himself \u201cRob Doyle\u201d, who is destabilised by the realisation that he has reached the wrong edge of his third decade. His reminiscences of mysticism, psychedelia and excess, Buddhism, art and literature, are episodic and anecdotal. They sketch a lifelong gap year, during which he\u2019s mostly been drunk, high, masturbating or all three at once. In a houseboat on the Dal Lake in Kashmir, he records daily experiments with ketamine, concluding: \u201cI imagined I was conducting important research at the limits of consciousness, but I see now I was just getting fucked up on a boat.\u201d In Haight Ashbury he ingests enough magic mushrooms for two or three users, receiving in exchange a vision of \u201c21st-century America as a wasteland of broken, defeated people, a sorrowing mass of human wreckage and unanswered prayers\u201d. Versions of the phrase \u201cA year or so later ...\u201d switch the backdrop from east to west, South America to Berlin, and on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It is a book of experience in some quite old-fashioned, powerful sense</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They don\u2019t switch the perspective, which, sore and first person, always belongs to the life of this \u201cRob Doyle\u201d. \u201cBy drifting from city to city, I could maintain the appearance of motion,\u201d he admits, \u201cwhen in truth I was going nowhere.\u201d And, later, summing up the many sexual experiences he presents or at least alludes to: \u201cYou fucked until you could fuck no more, at which point you were really fucked.\u201d This compulsive trajectory, driven by self-disgust, is both \u201ctruth\u201d and an artful surface, paralleled by \u2013 in fact, predicated on \u2013 a deeper, more cunning inspection of the narrator\u2019s writerly influences, as he builds a self-portrait from what appears to be a record of cultural tourism. The grave of the problematic Romanian philosopher EM Cioran, viewed in Montparnasse, gives way to Georges Bataille\u2019s grave in V\u00e9zelay; then to a 17-stage walking tour of the town where Roberto Bola\u00f1o spent his last years. Each section of the book \u2013 cleverly masked as a tale told against its teller \u2013 blossoms critically in two or three directions, developing Doyle\u2019s assessment of his chosen subjects, and of himself. We\u2019re moved restlessly but determinedly along from his earlier writing, the novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/15/here-are-the-young-men-review-rob-doyle\" title=\"\"><em>Here Are the Young Men</em></a>, from 2014, and the short story collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/28/this-is-the-ritual-rob-doyle-review\" title=\"\"><em>This Is the Ritual</em></a>, 2016 (in which \u201cRob Doyle\u201d also made fleeting appearances).</p> <p>Whatever else it is, <em>Threshold</em> is surely the record of a voyage \u2013 a book of experience in some quite old-fashioned, powerful sense. It\u2019s replete with the indicators of retrospection, confession, autofiction. Some of the adventures leave the reader with a faint bad taste in the mouth. Possibly they\u2019ve been designed to. \u201cI used to live for hate but now I am often frightened of it,\u201d runs a line on page two, an admission both endearing and disconcerting enough to propel anyone through a book. Sometimes he trolls the reader so expertly it works, sometimes so obviously it doesn\u2019t; sometimes he seems to be effortlessly trolling himself. In the end, whatever you decide about the fictionality of the terrain or the kind of trip <em>Threshold</em> might have taken you on, you also decide that \u201cRob Doyle\u201d was a worthwhile spirit guide. He\u2019s good at aphorism, though he claims to have disowned it along with Cioran; he\u2019s very good at the comedy of self-aggrandising self-deprecation.</p> <p>He also believes that the moment you decide to travel, you leave yourself open to the \u201cmelancholy of the return\u201d. Weirdly enough, I didn\u2019t feel that. When I closed the book I felt briefly buoyed up by it and then as if I\u2019d been challenged to separate the genuine from the fabricated in a not entirely fair arena.</p> <p><em>\u2022 M John Harrison\u2019s The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again will be published by Gollancz in June.

In the end, whatever you decide about the fictionality of the terrain or the kind of trip Threshold might have taken you on, you also decide that \u201cRob Doyle\u201d was a worthwhile spirit guide. He\u2019s good at aphorism, though he claims to have disowned it along with Cioran; he\u2019s very good at the comedy of self-aggrandising self-deprecation. He also believes that the moment you decide to travel, you leave yourself open to the \u201cmelancholy of the return\u201d. Weirdly enough, I didn\u2019t feel that. When I closed the book I felt briefly buoyed up by it and then as if I\u2019d been challenged to separate the genuine from the fabricated in a not entirely fair arena. \u2022 M John Harrison\u2019s The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again will be published by Gollancz in June. Threshold is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a314.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over \u00a315.",

      "body": "<p>I was in my early 20s when I first saw Fidelio, Beethoven\u2019s only opera, on stage. I didn\u2019t know that much about it. I knew the rough plot \u2013 a woman, Leonore, disguises herself as a man, Fidelio, to get a job as a jailer\u2019s assistant in the hope of finding her political prisoner husband, and she manages to get him freed. I knew it was Beethoven\u2019s response to new thoughts percolating through Europe after the French revolution. And I had heard exactly two of the musical highlights before I went. One is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5lrq3d67es\">sublime, slow-burning quartet</a> near the beginning, in which four characters reveal their most heartfelt dreams directly to us, unheard by the other characters. (This may be the most beautiful thing Beethoven ever wrote.) The other is the super-famous Prisoners\u2019 Chorus, in which the men sing powerfully and movingly about our need and right to be free. So I went into the opera that night more than 40 years ago expecting to enjoy myself.</p> <p>Imagine my surprise to realise this opera has problems!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f64c545eff504a1ad2b1916d473dcc75c7770787\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f64c545eff504a1ad2b1916d473dcc75c7770787/412_187_1366_1706/801.jpg\" alt=\"David Lang: \u2018For me, my new opera goes straight to the heart of classical music.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Lang: \u2018For me, my new opera goes straight to the heart of classical music.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Serling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before you get mad at me for saying that <em>anything</em> Beethoven wrote has problems, you should know that Beethoven himself was unhappy with the opera. He drastically rewrote it several times over the course of many years, each time tasking a new librettist to fix what the last had written. When the opera originally premiered in 1805 it even had a different name \u2013 Leonore, or the Triumph of Conjugal Love. Beethoven ended up writing four Leonore overtures; every time he rewrote the opera he wrote a new one.</p> <p>Fidelio is full of beautiful music, and beautiful ideas, but it has real dramatic problems.

      "bodyText": "I was in my early 20s when I first saw Fidelio, Beethoven\u2019s only opera, on stage. I didn\u2019t know that much about it. I knew the rough plot \u2013 a woman, Leonore, disguises herself as a man, Fidelio, to get a job as a jailer\u2019s assistant in the hope of finding her political prisoner husband, and she manages to get him freed. I knew it was Beethoven\u2019s response to new thoughts percolating through Europe after the French revolution. And I had heard exactly two of the musical highlights before I went. One is the sublime, slow-burning quartet near the beginning, in which four characters reveal their most heartfelt dreams directly to us, unheard by the other characters. (This may be the most beautiful thing Beethoven ever wrote.) The other is the super-famous Prisoners\u2019 Chorus, in which the men sing powerfully and movingly about our need and right to be free. So I went into the opera that night more than 40 years ago expecting to enjoy myself. Imagine my surprise to realise this opera has problems! Before you get mad at me for saying that anything Beethoven wrote has problems, you should know that Beethoven himself was unhappy with the opera. He drastically rewrote it several times over the course of many years, each time tasking a new librettist to fix what the last had written. When the opera originally premiered in 1805 it even had a different name \u2013 Leonore, or the Triumph of Conjugal Love. Beethoven ended up writing four Leonore overtures; every time he rewrote the opera he wrote a new one. Fidelio is full of beautiful music, and beautiful ideas, but it has real dramatic problems. Here are a few: \u2022 The opera is about the noble ideas of love and freedom, but these concepts are more powerfully defined than the characters supposed to embody them. We don\u2019t learn much about who these characters are, except that one is devoted, one is imprisoned for seeking the truth, and that the prisoners all love freedom. There is also, however, a lot of activity that is off these noble topics \u2013 a mistaken-identity secondary romance plot that would feel more at home in a comic opera setting, for example. \u2022 The opera is set in a prison, and we are made to feel great empathy for the prisoners. The most famous part of the show is the stirring Prisoners\u2019 Chorus at the end of the first act: We trust in God! We will be free! And then, after they sing this very powerful and moving chorus, the prisoners disappear and we don\u2019t hear from them again until the very last moments of the opera, when they are saved by a totally incredible deus ex machina.

Other landowners along the line have reported a similar lack of clarity.</p> <p>\u201cEvery metre counts,\u201d said Vallance. \u201cEven if the land taken was reduced by a couple of metres, it saves a chunk of nature reserve because the track goes through so much of the reserve. Once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. You can recreate habitat but it takes an awfully long time.\u201d</p> <p>Like other landowners, BBOWT has not yet been paid compensation for land already taken by HS2. Another landowner, who asked not to be named, said compensation was being withheld to minimise local dissent. \u201cSome landowners feel bullied by HS2,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Another landowner close to Calvert Jubilee, Christopher Prideaux, whose farm is bisected by the line, described being surrounded by \u201call manner of chaos\u201d with expensive and ill-planned \u201cenabling works\u201d including the construction of \u201cnewt ponds without any newts\u201d on productive farmland.</p> <p>\u201cThis a national crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Westminster will care about the environment. Westminster will care about billions of expenditure.</p> <p>\u201cHS2 are hoping to get so far down the track that it is too difficult to cancel. This is not true. In financial terms, the first loss is the cheapest loss. What has been spent so far is a fraction of the overall sum. No government has got any right to be blundering ahead with this without a national transport policy.\u201d</p> <p>In his independent report, Lord Berkeley said HS2 was an \u201cexpensive\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d solution to improving the rail network and recommended spending half HS2\u2019s budget on upgrading existing commuter lines, particularly in northern England and the Midlands.</p>",

When the trust raised the alarm after volunteers working at the nature reserve spotted the work being done, an HS2 spokesperson initially insisted it had acted with \u201cthe full permission of the landowner\u201d. But in a letter to the wildlife trust seen by the Guardian, HS2 subsequently admitted it did not have permission to undertake the work. It claimed it had mistakenly believed the site belonged to another landowner from whom it had permission, despite contractors entering the site past signs clearly identifying it as a BBOWT nature reserve. Mark Vallance, reserves manager for BBOWT, said he was \u201clivid\u201d, and it was alarming that wildlife habitat could be destroyed by accident. \u201cIt terrifies me that this sort of thing can happen so easily,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to HS2 numerous times about the impact on our nature reserves. \u201cIf HS2 doesn\u2019t go ahead \u2013 and we accept that\u2019s a slim possibility \u2013 then there\u2019s been a loss of really good bat habitat here.\u201d Dozens of limbs from old ash and sallow were removed and several whole trees chopped down. Vallance said the destruction appeared to have deliberately targeted the best bat habitats. The presence of live bats \u2013 which are protected by law \u2013 has the potential to stop HS2 construction work, set to begin later this year. Following widespread local protests against the destruction of ancient woodland while the high-speed line is under review, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, ordered HS2 in September to \u201cconsider what works affecting ancient woodland clearances can be delayed for the duration of the review\u201d. But \u201cenabling works\u201d to remove ancient hedgerows and trees before the main contracting works are continuing apace, with miles of hedges grubbed up in recent weeks close to the proposed line through Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Warwickshire. A leaked copy of the review into HS2\u2019s spiralling costs by Douglas Oakervee revealed he is set to endorse the project but his deputy, Lord Berkeley, this week issued a \u201cminority report\u201d castigating the project for \u201cseriously misleading\u201d parliament, with the estimated final cost rising to \u00a3107bn. Boris Johnson admitted costs were likely to rise above \u00a3100bn during the election campaign. Of the environmental damage, Lord Berkeley \u2013 a rail expert who has worked for Eurotunnel, the Rail Freight Group and as a transport minister \u2013 said: \u201cCompared to improving existing lines, HS2 is not good for the environment, and HS2 Ltd has exacerbated the situation by its appalling treatment of stakeholders, residents, businesses and councils in the areas over which it plans to construct the lines.\u201d At Calvert Jubilee nature reserve, the high-speed line requires the removal of the eastern edge of the reserve, including orchid-rich grassland and scrub which until recently contained Buckinghamshire\u2019s last remaining populations of nightingales and turtle doves, as well as all five species of hairstreak butterfly. In a letter to BBOWT, David Bennett, the delivery director of HS2, apologised for undertaking work without permission and said it had incorporated feedback from the charity on the 75,000 trees it will plant this winter close to the nature reserve as compensation for the destruction. Bennett said: \u201cOver time these trees will connect areas of existing woodland \u2026 and form new bat flight lines away from the HS2 route.\u201d According to BBOWT, HS2 has repeatedly refused to provide it with precise information about how much of the nature reserve will be removed. Other landowners along the line have reported a similar lack of clarity. \u201cEvery metre counts,\u201d said Vallance. \u201cEven if the land taken was reduced by a couple of metres, it saves a chunk of nature reserve because the track goes through so much of the reserve. Once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. You can recreate habitat but it takes an awfully long time.\u201d Like other landowners, BBOWT has not yet been paid compensation for land already taken by HS2. Another landowner, who asked not to be named, said compensation was being withheld to minimise local dissent. \u201cSome landowners feel bullied by HS2,\u201d they said. Another landowner close to Calvert Jubilee, Christopher Prideaux, whose farm is bisected by the line, described being surrounded by \u201call manner of chaos\u201d with expensive and ill-planned \u201cenabling works\u201d including the construction of \u201cnewt ponds without any newts\u201d on productive farmland. \u201cThis a national crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Westminster will care about the environment. Westminster will care about billions of expenditure. \u201cHS2 are hoping to get so far down the track that it is too difficult to cancel. This is not true. In financial terms, the first loss is the cheapest loss. What has been spent so far is a fraction of the overall sum. No government has got any right to be blundering ahead with this without a national transport policy.\u201d In his independent report, Lord Berkeley said HS2 was an \u201cexpensive\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d solution to improving the rail network and recommended spending half HS2\u2019s budget on upgrading existing commuter lines, particularly in northern England and the Midlands.",

Speaking at a news conference in Kigali on Wednesday, Rwanda\u2019s foreign minister Vincent Biruta said the African nation was currently hosting more than 300 refugees and asylum seekers at the Gashora transit centre south of Kigali, most of whom hail from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, according to CGTN Africa. Only Norway and Sweden had so far agreed to resettle people from the camp, Biruta added. Norway agreed to resettle 600 people, while Sweden had so far accepted seven, according to Biruta. Rwanda signed a deal with the UN and African Union in September aimed at resettling people who had been detained in Libya while trying to reach Europe. More than 4,000 people are believed to still be living in Libyan detention centres, according to the latest figures. In a statement to Reuters, Norwegian justice minister J\u00f8ran Kallmyr said the plan to resettle 600 people proved that \u201cwe don\u2019t support cynical people smugglers, and instead bring in people who need protection in an organised manner\u201d. Kallmyr added: \u201cA transit camp like the one in Rwanda will contribute to that effort.\u201d Norway\u2019s four-party government coalition agreed last year to accept a total of 3,000 refugees from UN camps in 2020. The UN in Libya has come under intense criticism for complying with EU migration policy, which entails funding the Libyan coastguard to intercept boats with refugees and migrants destined for Europe. Many people end up detained in militia-run centres and subjected to grave human rights abuses, including sexual abuse, denial of food and water, and forced recruitment into the on-going Libyan conflict. Elisabeth Haslund, Nordic spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, said that of the 4,000-plus people estimated to still be detained in Libyan centres, roughly 2,500 people are refugees and asylum-seekers. \u201cAs the violence and unrest have been intensifying in Libya and thousands of refugees are still at risk in the country, the evacuations of the most vulnerable refugees are more urgent than ever,\u201d said Haslund. \u201cUNHCR very much welcomes Norway\u2019s decision to resettle refugees who have been evacuated to Rwanda and also notes the important and valuable financial contributions from Norway to help support the operation of the transit centre in Gashora.\u201d As the 600 people who are expected to be resettled this year in Norway had not yet been chosen, Haslund added, it was impossible to give details on their age, gender or country of origin.

To crave subtlety in a drama stuffed with drag, an art form not known for embracing minor notes, may be a stretch, but this veers from gags about sex to mushy lessons about what it means to be a woman, and the sincerity is regularly, reliably overcooked.

In its justification, it said no one had died.</p> <p>The court said any suspension of the internet, which it called intrinsic to free speech, must be accompanied by detailed reasons to allow aggrieved persons to challenge it in court.</p> <p>The ruling came in response to petitions filed by Anuradha Bhasin, the executive editor of the Kashmir Times, the opposition Congress party leader, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and others.</p> <p>\u201cThe ruling shows that liberty and security have to be balanced. The court has made it clear that it is people\u2019s freedoms that are paramount, not the government\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Sushmita Dev of the Congress party.</p> <p>The internet shutdown has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/the-personal-and-economic-cost-of-kashmirs-internet-ban\">devastated the economy</a> and caused job losses. Local businesses ranging from hoteliers unable to get bookings to the handicrafts sector unable to sell the region\u2019s famous shawls have been shattered. Indian mobile operators have also lost revenue.</p> <p>A report on Thursday by the internet research company Top10VPN said that India lost more than $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) in internet shutdowns last year, not just from Jammu and Kashmir but in other areas.</p> <p>\u201cWe welcome the ruling. It\u2019s a good decision after a long time. The entire industry has suffered and the economy is in a shambles,\u201d said Sheik Ashiq, the president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p> <p>While the Jammu and Kashmir administration is unlikely to ignore such a significant and emphatic ruling, it\u2019s not known whether it will opt to restore the internet in full or choose a partial and gradual restoration after its review.</p> <p>\u201cIn principle the ruling is good, though it has taken a long time. But in terms of immediate relief, there is none.

      "bodyText": "India\u2019s supreme court has ordered the government to review all restrictions in Indian-controlled Kashmir within a week, saying the indefinite suspension of people\u2019s rights amounted to an abuse of power. In a blow to the Hindu nationalist government of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, the country\u2019s highest court said the expression of opposition to state policy could not justify the crackdown. Last August, Modi revoked Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s autonomy and split the state into two territories under the direct control of Delhi. The move was followed by a series of draconian measures including curfews, the detention of political leaders and the cutting off of all communications including phones and the internet. The government has gradually restored landlines, and SMS services were restored on 31 December, but 7 million Kashmiris still do not have online access in the longest internet shutdown ever imposed in a democracy. The government has repeatedly justified the continued internet suspension as necessary for preserving human life and preventing terrorism. In its justification, it said no one had died. The court said any suspension of the internet, which it called intrinsic to free speech, must be accompanied by detailed reasons to allow aggrieved persons to challenge it in court. The ruling came in response to petitions filed by Anuradha Bhasin, the executive editor of the Kashmir Times, the opposition Congress party leader, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and others. \u201cThe ruling shows that liberty and security have to be balanced. The court has made it clear that it is people\u2019s freedoms that are paramount, not the government\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Sushmita Dev of the Congress party. The internet shutdown has devastated the economy and caused job losses. Local businesses ranging from hoteliers unable to get bookings to the handicrafts sector unable to sell the region\u2019s famous shawls have been shattered. Indian mobile operators have also lost revenue. A report on Thursday by the internet research company Top10VPN said that India lost more than $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) in internet shutdowns last year, not just from Jammu and Kashmir but in other areas. \u201cWe welcome the ruling. It\u2019s a good decision after a long time. The entire industry has suffered and the economy is in a shambles,\u201d said Sheik Ashiq, the president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry. While the Jammu and Kashmir administration is unlikely to ignore such a significant and emphatic ruling, it\u2019s not known whether it will opt to restore the internet in full or choose a partial and gradual restoration after its review. \u201cIn principle the ruling is good, though it has taken a long time. But in terms of immediate relief, there is none. The court has left it to the administration to decide,\u201d said Bhasin. On Thursday, the government took 15 ambassadors, including the US\u2019s envoy, to Kashmir to show them the situation on the ground. Critics called it \u201cfarcical\u201d and a \u201cguided tour\u201d. EU representatives declined to take part because they wanted access to people and groups of their choosing. The supreme court also directed the Indian government to make public all orders imposing a lockdown in Kashmir in August after article 370 of the constitution, granting Kashmir special status, was revoked, said Vrinda Grover, a human rights lawyer.",

More curious items include the 900-year-old preserved remains of the Lady In Blue and a log cabin depicting the interior of an early Icelandic home. Apparently settlers buried their food in winter and covered it with excrement to survive. You\u2019ll look at the locals in a whole new light. \u2022 \u00a312/free, thjodminjasafn.is Amy Den Gamley By, Aarhus, Denmark The European city of culture in 2017, Aarhus is fast becoming one of the best cities to visit on the continent \u2013 yet it\u2019s still not on many people\u2019s radars. Our highlight was Den Gamle By (Old Town), which covers life from the 1500s to the 1970s. You can spend days there, meandering from the 18th-century apothecary and 19th-century bakery to the 1970s sexual health clinic and basement jazz bar. And the beer and Danish open sandwich in the sunny terrace cafe were spot on. \u2022 \u20ac19/\u20ac10 dengamleby.dk Laura King M9, mainland Venice As the crowds flock to the more famous sights, cross the bridge and head inland to the M9 museum in Mestre for a different take on Italy. While so many Italian museums focus on its ancient and medieval past, M9 takes us on the rollercoaster ride that was 20th century Italy. Interactive displays connect us with the political, economic and social upheaval that was experienced from Trapani to Trieste, world wars to the European Union, abject poverty to economic boom, and emigration to immigration. It is an Italy unseen by many and offers a richer understanding of what makes it such a fascinating country. \u2022 \u20ac14/\u20ac10, m9museum.it Steve Bassett MAMbo, Bologna This outstanding museum houses permanent collections from the second world war to the present day, but its real strength lies in works from the heyday of Red Bologna in the 1970s, when political revolution was in the air and art \u201ctook to the streets and walls of the city\u201d. The second time I visited it had a remarkable exhibition on the politics and art of Italian filmmaker and writer, Pier Paolo Pasolini. And not least, it has a stylish cafe bar where you can sip an afternoon espresso while perusing its art and poetry books. \u2022 \u20ac6/\u20ac4, mambo-bologna.org Olivia arigho-stiles Haus Der Musik, Vienna The House of Music will bring out the child in everyone as sound and music are brought to life through interactive exhibits which show off classical composers, street noises and visual demonstrations of wavelengths. You can also conduct an orchestra, have Mozart write your name in music, compose a waltz using dice and walk up a piano staircase. We found ourselves running between the exhibits as the magic of the music took over. This museum is great for families and the inner child in all of us. \u2022 \u20ac14/\u20ac10/\u20ac6 hausdermusik.com Ellie C Palazzo Massimo, Rome Walking into a 2,000-year-old room lifted from a Roman palace and covered in perfectly preserved paintings depicting a garden full of different birds and trees is about as close as you can actually get to time travel. The museum also contains possibly the best collection of Roman frescoes and mosaics in the world. Some of the mosaics are so fine they look more like paintings. All of that is in only one of the three floors. Often overlooked by visitors to Rome but mind-blowing. \u2022 \u20ac10, museonazionaleromano.beniculturali.it Richard Ethnographic Museum, Pristina, Kosovo Expecting dusty pots and rugs? Not so in this charming museum in two gorgeously preserved Ottoman houses in the capital of Europe\u2019s youngest country. Guides will give you an enthusiastic tour around the elegant former living spaces \u2013 from the \u201croom of fire\u201d kitchen to the accommodation offered to guests at any hour of day or night, in accordance with strict Albanian rules of hospitality. Such traditions apparently die hard and the English-speaking guides will also pick walnuts and mulberries for you in the museum\u2019s gardens. \u2022 Entry free, museu.ms Elizabeth Gowing Museum of Natural Sciences, Brussels More than just the home of the EU, Brussels has an impressive 93 museums. The dinosaur gallery in the Museum of Natural Sciences is the largest in Europe and great fun for children and adults alike. The highlight for my nine-year-old was an incredible 30 fossilised iguanodon skeletons in lifelike poses. Sand trays give the chance to try your hand at being a palaeontologist, while a simulation allows you to challenge a virtual pachycephalosaurus. Tours available in English and there are discovery trails for children. \u2022 \u20ac7/\u20ac4.50, naturalsciences.be Kevin Munday Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Intelligence sources have told the Guardian that it appeared two surface-to-air missiles targeted Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people onboard.</p> \n<p>US officials told media that satellites picked up an anti-aircraft missile battery switching on, followed by infrared signals from two suspected missiles, then an infrared blip from the burning aircraft. Of the 176 people onboard, 78 were Iranian, 63 were Canadian and 11 were Ukrainian along with 10 Swedes, seven Afghans, four Britons and three German nationals. The Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence, that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles. Canadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Iranian officials on Thursday rejected the western intelligence assessments and said it was \u201cscientifically\u201d impossible for the plane to have been hit by one of their missiles. Boris Johnson said the shooting down \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/09/johnson-backs-missile-theory-in-tehran-plane-crash-as-uk-toll-rises\">may well have been unintentional.</a> We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d In the US, the House of Representatives has voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/09/house-war-powers-trump-iran\">curb Trump\u2019s power to make war against Iran</a>, though the resolution is not binding. A short time ago Trump spoke at a rally in Toledo where he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/10/killing-iran-general-suleimani-american-justice-donald-trump-ohio-rally\">unapologetic about the killing of Suleimani</a>, who he said was planning attacks on US interests. \u201cWe stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30accade-e85c-40f7-9f19-22f88db3001a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mzP4O61doNM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Police plea to ban burners \u2013 </strong>Anonymous pay-as-you-go mobile phones should be banned to help tackle county lines drug dealers, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary has recommended.

The report said school exclusions expose children to being recruited into county lines gangs \u2013 but HMIC\u2019s chief inspector, Sir Tom Winsor, said social workers were dealing with enormous caseloads without enough resources for services to protect the vulnerable. \u201cChildren\u2019s services are under extraordinary strain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>MoD not deterred from Trident waste \u2013 </strong>The cost of maintaining three British nuclear sites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/10/mod-blunders-caused-spiralling-trident-costs-nuclear-sites\">spiralled by \u00a31.35bn</a> because of poor management by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Whitehall\u2019s watchdog has found. The National Audit Office also said work to build and maintain the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent in Cumbria, Derbyshire and Berkshire will be completed more than six years later than planned. Civil servants rely on the work of three monopolistic suppliers \u2013 the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems \u2013 which means contracts cannot be terminated for poor performance. Auditors found three programmes \u2013 a new nuclear warhead plant, a nuclear core plant and shipyard work \u2013 were valued at \u00a32.5bn but found costs ballooned and delays ran at between 1.7 and 6.3 years. The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the report found.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Grassy slopes of Everest \u2013 </strong>Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/10/grass-growing-around-mount-everest-as-global-heating-intensifies\">most rapidly heating regions of the planet</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Transparency, accountability and justice\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray here, welcome to the round-up. The revelation that Iranian forces may have shot down the Boeing 737 airliner that crashed on Wednesday is prompting a reassessment of the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Intelligence sources have told the Guardian that it appeared two surface-to-air missiles targeted Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people onboard. US officials told media that satellites picked up an anti-aircraft missile battery switching on, followed by infrared signals from two suspected missiles, then an infrared blip from the burning aircraft. Of the 176 people onboard, 78 were Iranian, 63 were Canadian and 11 were Ukrainian along with 10 Swedes, seven Afghans, four Britons and three German nationals. The Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence, that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles. Canadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice.\u201d Iranian officials on Thursday rejected the western intelligence assessments and said it was \u201cscientifically\u201d impossible for the plane to have been hit by one of their missiles. Boris Johnson said the shooting down \u201cmay well have been unintentional. We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d In the US, the House of Representatives has voted to curb Trump\u2019s power to make war against Iran, though the resolution is not binding. A short time ago Trump spoke at a rally in Toledo where he was unapologetic about the killing of Suleimani, who he said was planning attacks on US interests. \u201cWe stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.\u201d * * * Police plea to ban burners \u2013 Anonymous pay-as-you-go mobile phones should be banned to help tackle county lines drug dealers, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary has recommended. The police inspectorate says the gangs use phones extensively and are able buy phones or sim cards without needing to prove their identity, despite police being able to order telephone companies to cut them off. \u201cWe were told of one example where a county lines network received and shared a new number within an hour of the service provider acting on the order,\u201d said the inspectorate in a report. The report said school exclusions expose children to being recruited into county lines gangs \u2013 but HMIC\u2019s chief inspector, Sir Tom Winsor, said social workers were dealing with enormous caseloads without enough resources for services to protect the vulnerable. \u201cChildren\u2019s services are under extraordinary strain,\u201d he said. * * * MoD not deterred from Trident waste \u2013 The cost of maintaining three British nuclear sites spiralled by \u00a31.35bn because of poor management by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Whitehall\u2019s watchdog has found. The National Audit Office also said work to build and maintain the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent in Cumbria, Derbyshire and Berkshire will be completed more than six years later than planned. Civil servants rely on the work of three monopolistic suppliers \u2013 the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems \u2013 which means contracts cannot be terminated for poor performance. Auditors found three programmes \u2013 a new nuclear warhead plant, a nuclear core plant and shipyard work \u2013 were valued at \u00a32.5bn but found costs ballooned and delays ran at between 1.7 and 6.3 years. The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the report found. * * * Grassy slopes of Everest \u2013 Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the most rapidly heating regions of the planet. The melting of Himalayan glaciers has doubled since the turn of the century. Studying images from 1993 to 2018 provided by Nasa\u2019s Landsat satellites, researchers from Exeter University measured the spread of vegetation in the \u201csubnival\u201d region, between the snowline and the treeline. There are fears it could lead to increased flooding in the vast Hindu Kush Himalayan region, as plants absorb more light and heat, and this warms the soil, leading to greater water run-off. \u201cThat would be bad news for the Himalayas,\u201d said Dr Karen Anderson from Exeter University. \u201cThe subnival zone is where seasonal snow is held and if it is warmer you will get flashy hydrology \u2013 quicker melt rates and an increased risk of flooding.\u201d * * * Maximum fine over Dixons hack \u2013 Dixons Carphone has been hit with the largest possible fine of \u00a3500,000 after \u201csystemic failures\u201d in its cybersecurity allowed a hack that affected millions of customers. An attacker installed malicious software on 5,390 tills in branches of its Currys PC World and Dixons Travel chains. The hack harvested payment card details of 5.6 million people as well as personal information from about 14 million, said data watchdog the ICO. Dixons Carphone has said it is considering appealing against the fine and argues there is \u201cno confirmed evidence of any customers suffering fraud or financial loss as a result\u201d. * * * \u2018Engaging and humanistic\u2019 \u2013 John le Carr\u00e9 has been named this morning as the latest recipient of the $100,000 (\u00a376,000) Olof Palme prize, an award given for an \u201coutstanding achievement\u201d in the spirit of the assassinated Swedish prime minister. Prize organisers praised the 88-year-old author, whose real name is David Cornwell, \u201cfor his engaging and humanistic opinion-making in literary form regarding the freedom of the individual and the fundamental issues of mankind\u201d. The acclaimed author of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Spy Who Came in from the Cold has been outspoken about abuses of power, his targets including governments, big pharma and arms dealing. Agent Running in the Field, his most recent book \u2013 which he has hinted will be his last \u2013 depicts collusion between Donald Trump\u2019s US and the British security services with the aim of undermining the European Union. Le Carr\u00e9 said he would donate the winnings to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. * * * In case you missed it \u2013 What with everything else going on \u2026 the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill has passed the Commons and is in the hands of the House of Lords. Peers are unlikely to block it, which means the UK is on track to leave the EU on 31 January. Downing Street has stressed that it is ready to begin the next stage of the Brexit process \u2013 negotiating a trade deal by the end of the year \u2013 on 1 February. Today in Focus podcast: The Ayia Napa rape case On 17 July 2019 an 18-year old British woman claimed she had been gang-raped by a group of Israeli tourists. Ten days later she was being charged with lying by the Cypriot police. Michael Polak, her lawyer, discusses the case, while Israeli journalist Noa Shpigel describes covering the story. And: Caroline Davies discusses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s decision to step back. Lunchtime read: Gary Younge\u2019s last Guardian column Gary Younge is leaving the Guardian after 26 years to become a sociology professor with Manchester University. \u201cIn my interview for a Guardian Scott Trust bursary to study a postgraduate course in journalism, I was asked what kind of job I would aspire to if I ever got to work at the paper. \u2018A columnist, like Hugo Young,\u2019 I said. \u2018There\u2019s only room for a handful of columnists on a newspaper,\u2019 I was told. \u2018And why shouldn\u2019t one of them be me?\u2019 I asked.\u201d \u201cThe bursary I was awarded emerged in the early 1990s and was a response to the uprisings among black youth in the 80s. Black people were always in the news, but rarely in the newsrooms. The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, wanted to offer a correction and so gave bursaries to under-represented groups in journalism. Without it I would have chosen another profession \u2026 \u2018Ingratitude\u2019 is the accusation launched by racists at black people in the public eye who have the audacity to highlight the racial injustice they see and have experienced. So I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the youth who took to the streets, and bereaved families who took to the courts, to make my career possible.\u201d Sport Andrew Strauss has insisted there must be an overwhelming case for the proposed switch to four-day Test cricket or it should not occur. Dan Evans\u2019s ATP Cup victory over Australia\u2019s Alex de Minaur proved in vain but the Great Britain coach, Tim Henman, has said the Briton\u2019s performances \u201cwere a huge positive\u201d as the Australian Open looms. Lewis Hamilton contributed $500,000 in an auction for Shane Warne\u2019s baggy green, which fetched $1m to aid those affected by Australia\u2019s bushfires. Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen would have been in line to replace Hamilton at Mercedes if the champion moves to Ferrari but instead the Dutchman may be the man who keeps Honda in Formula 1. Harry Kane will undergo surgery to repair the damage to his hamstring and has been ruled out by Tottenham until April. Sir Mo Farah has claimed he would have been the \u201cfirst one out\u201d of the Nike Oregon Project if he had known about Alberto Salazar\u2019s dubious practices \u2013 despite sticking with his former coach for two years after serious allegations were made against him in 2015. And Magnus Carlsen became No 1 in fantasy football during a highly successful year and the chess world champion now has his sights set on a record unbeaten streak in chess. Business Asian shares have risen with worries receding of war between the United States and Iran. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.2% in morning trading while gains were also recorded by the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng. The Shanghai Composite fell. On Wall Street money flowed into riskier investments, such as technology stocks, and trickled out of traditional havens such as gold. The pound is worth $1.308 and \u20ac1.178. The FTSE is trending higher by around 30 points ahead of the open. The papers The Sun deploys its well-worn \u201corf\u201d device with \u201cMeg\u2019s mugged us orf\u201d. \u201cMeghan flees to Canada\u201d says the Mail and it also plugs a \u201cCountdown to chaos\u201d leading up to the Sussexes\u2019 announcement. The Metro runs with \u201cHarry up and go\u201d saying the Queen wants a \u201cquickie split\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s top story is the plane crash in Iran and mounting suspicions the Iranians shot it down. The reluctant royals get the pic slot though. \u201cIran plane \u2018shot down by missile\u2019\u201d leads the i with Meghan and Harry relegated to a skybox, and the FT\u2019s news values lean that way as well: \u201cInternational fears mount that Iran missile downed jet in error\u201d. But the spotlight is back on the troubled royals in the Times: \u201cCharles threatens to halt Harry and Meghan\u2019s cash\u201d. \u201cFurious Queen orders: sort it out now\u201d, says the Express. \u201cQueen fights to save monarchy\u201d says the Mirror, which sounds a bit drastic considering her uncle quit the throne altogether and it is still there. The Telegraph says the Queen called a \u201cfamily crisis meeting\u201d to try and figure out how this is going to work.

Another 18 songs crashed the charts, including collaborations with Nicki Minaj, Chance the Rapper, Migos and J Cole. Not bad for a new rapper from a mid-sized US city with no previously notable hip-hop scene, who as recently as 2017 was walking around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/sxsw-music\">SXSW festival</a> in an adult nappy demanding that people pay attention to him (under his old alias, Baby Jesus).

If you accept his early mixtapes as confession, there is plenty of drug-dealer talk, but watching this side of DaBaby you understand the hustler streak, the confidence and ability to make money, and the shrewd wariness that allowed him to stay alive and out of jail.</p> <p>After a few minutes, his manager Arnold Taylor interrupts to tell him: \u201cWe got work to do.\u201d Silently tossing the dice over his right shoulder, DaBaby instantly changes his facial expression from carnivorous glee to a solemnity that\u2019s largely absent from his recorded output. To listen to a DaBaby record, you might assume that his life was circumscribed by hedonism, violence and the desire to be the best rapper alive. But there is also a meticulousness to the way he moves. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve studied the greats,\u201d DaBaby says. He leans back on an overstuffed couch, his voice pitched to a near-whisper, the exhaustion of the past 12 months hitting the moment he finally slows down. \u201cI studied people like Future, Lil Wayne and Kanye, who came up and consistently progressed. I\u2019ve studied all the genius marketers throughout the rap game. I borrow from anybody with something to offer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never studied marketing,\u201d he adds, his eyes half-closed. \u201cI\u2019ve just always been a hustler. I didn\u2019t even have a major decided at college. I only went to school for my parents.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvuQNNVrbtM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KvuQNNVrbtM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Even before he was famous, DaBaby acted like he was, rolling 50 deep in branded outfits to the Charlotte clubs. \u201cThe idea of being a locally famous rapper was never real to me. I was immediately trying to get on the same charts as Drake.\u201d His career received a massive boost when he signed to Arnold Taylor, the president of South Coast Music, the biggest radio promoter in the state, who was instrumental in the early rise of southern rap stars including Yo Gotti and Future.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to show his fun side but also the street side,\u201d says Taylor, who guided DaBaby from a gifted but obscure regional street rapper to a major label bidding war that ended with a seven-figure deal from Interscope. \u201cWe\u2019re from the hood and are serious and real, but at the end of the day, that don\u2019t get you anywhere. He can be a worldwide artist; he can act and do comedy. He can really spit with the best of them, but he can also make songs. Some spitters can\u2019t make songs.\u201d</p> <p>In this sense, DaBaby reflects an anachronistic approach to the rap game. If the charts are filled with opiated threnodies about addiction and sadness, he eschews singing in favour of raps that could take your head off (\u201cI can\u2019t sing, but I\u2019ll hit some notes here and there\u201d), usually starting the second the beat hits. It helps that he gets beats from his nascent fellow Carolina star, JetsonMade, whose productions blend post-trap grit with a springy trampoline bounce.</p> <p>His most poignant song, Intro, from Kirk, intersects with another less-seen side of DaBaby: the devoted family man. It\u2019s a tribute to his father, a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, who died the same week that his son reached No 1 in the charts. And in conversation, DaBaby\u2019s eyes most readily light up when talking about his love for his father and mother (who worked for a finance company), his older brothers and his young daughter. When I ask what he would be doing today if he didn\u2019t have any work responsibilities, he immediately answers: \u201cWhatever my daughter wants to do. She\u2019s bright and brilliant. I\u2019m just blessed to be able to establish a path for her before she even knows how to tie her shoe.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve studied all the genius marketers throughout the rap game.

She came to Britain just a month after the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 \u2013 branded by the then-Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell as a piece of <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/windrush-dexter-bristol-death-scandal-immigration-home-office-a9146221.html\" title=\"\">\u201ccruel and brutal anti-colour legislation\u201d</a> \u2013 was passed.

She was 44; I was 19. She never got to read my columns. My presence on these pages would have been, I think, as unlikely to her as anything else she hoped I might achieve as a child, as we padded around our living room.</p> <p>No amount of self-image reinforcement could have defied those odds. The space where those politics could be shared and the route through which I would come to it were paved by others whom I didn\u2019t know and (mostly) never met. \u201cMen make their own history,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/18th-Brumaire.pdf\" title=\"\">wrote Karl Marx</a> in The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. \u201cBut they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a6a7d3ba80880651a7937371a7c2e203e2c88c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a6a7d3ba80880651a7937371a7c2e203e2c88c2/0_115_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve McQueen in 1999, the year he won the Turner prize\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve McQueen in 1999, the year he won the Turner prize.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bursary I was awarded emerged in the early 1990s and was a response to the uprisings among black youth in the 80s. Black people were always in the news, but rarely in the newsrooms. The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, wanted to offer a correction and so gave bursaries to under-represented groups in journalism. Without it I would have chosen another profession.</p> <p>In 1999 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson report</a>, into the racist murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\" title=\"\">Stephen Lawrence</a>, made the concept of institutional racism mainstream. That was the year my first column appeared here, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown\u2019s column appeared in the Independent, my first book was published, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/01/fiachragibbons\" title=\"\">Steve McQueen</a> won the Turner prize. The year before, Chris Ofili won the Turner prize; the year after, Zadie Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith\" title=\"\">White Teeth</a> came out. The relationship between these events was not causal but contextual. This detracts not one iota from their creative abilities or the hard work that made their success possible. (Only the privileged and the naive believe people\u2019s achievements are purely the product of their own genius.) It simply acknowledges that there have been others who were similarly able and hardworking for whom space had not been cleared.</p> <p>\u201cIngratitude\u201d is the accusation launched by racists at black people in the public eye who have the audacity to highlight the racial injustice they see and have experienced. So I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the youth who took to the streets, and bereaved families who took to the courts, to make my career possible.</p> <p>I sign off from this column at a dispiriting time. With racism, cynicism and intolerance on the rise, wages stagnant and faith that progressive change is possible declining even as resistance grows. Things look bleak. The propensity to despair is strong, but should not be indulged. Sing yourself up. Imagine a world in which you might thrive, for which there is no evidence. And then fight for it.</p> <p>\u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/black-british-history-should-be-in-mainstream-says-campaigner\">Black British history 'missing from school curricula in England'</a> </p> </aside>",

She was 44; I was 19. She never got to read my columns. My presence on these pages would have been, I think, as unlikely to her as anything else she hoped I might achieve as a child, as we padded around our living room. No amount of self-image reinforcement could have defied those odds. The space where those politics could be shared and the route through which I would come to it were paved by others whom I didn\u2019t know and (mostly) never met. \u201cMen make their own history,\u201d wrote Karl Marx in The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. \u201cBut they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\u201d The bursary I was awarded emerged in the early 1990s and was a response to the uprisings among black youth in the 80s. Black people were always in the news, but rarely in the newsrooms. The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, wanted to offer a correction and so gave bursaries to under-represented groups in journalism. Without it I would have chosen another profession. In 1999 the Macpherson report, into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, made the concept of institutional racism mainstream. That was the year my first column appeared here, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown\u2019s column appeared in the Independent, my first book was published, and Steve McQueen won the Turner prize. The year before, Chris Ofili won the Turner prize; the year after, Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth came out. The relationship between these events was not causal but contextual. This detracts not one iota from their creative abilities or the hard work that made their success possible. (Only the privileged and the naive believe people\u2019s achievements are purely the product of their own genius.) It simply acknowledges that there have been others who were similarly able and hardworking for whom space had not been cleared. \u201cIngratitude\u201d is the accusation launched by racists at black people in the public eye who have the audacity to highlight the racial injustice they see and have experienced. So I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the youth who took to the streets, and bereaved families who took to the courts, to make my career possible. I sign off from this column at a dispiriting time. With racism, cynicism and intolerance on the rise, wages stagnant and faith that progressive change is possible declining even as resistance grows. Things look bleak. The propensity to despair is strong, but should not be indulged. Sing yourself up. Imagine a world in which you might thrive, for which there is no evidence. And then fight for it. \u2022 Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "It has been a devastating fire season in Australia, with millions of hectares burned, lives lost and almost 2,000 properties destroyed. Long-term drought conditions and record temperatures have combined with strong winds to create catastrophic fire conditions, resulting in widespread devastation in almost every state. However, it is hard to grasp the geographic scale and speed with which the fires spread. For example, the Gospers Mountain fires north of Sydney have covered more than 1m hectares, and a record 4.9m hectares have been burnt in New South Wales this season so far. One way to visualise the extent and spread of the fires is by using satellite data. Nasa operates a hotspot detection program which identifies fires on a daily basis. Here, we have animated the hotspots over time. It\u2019s not exactly to scale, as the satellite detection has a resolution of 375m square, and the detection of fires can be obscured from satellites by smoke or clouds (this is particularly noticeable in the more recent fires on the NSW south coast and on Kangaroo Island in South Australia). Hotspots can also show up where there is no bushfire, but we\u2019ve tried to filter these out where possible. The circles fade to black over time to give an idea of the area burned, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that it only covers fires within the time period shown, so the actual burned area will be greater than what is shown here, particularly in areas where fires have been burning on and off for months. We\u2019ve updated the animations below on 10 January to add fires on the south coast of NSW, eastern Victoria, and in the Snowy Mountains, as well as updating the Sydney region fires. Sydney region, NSW Showing the Gospers Mountain megafire north of Sydney, and fires in the Blue Mountains and western Sydney. Shoalhaven area, NSW Showing fires around Braidwood, Batemans Bay, Kangaroo Valley and other areas. East Gippsland, Victoria Showing fires across a large portion of East Gippsland in Victoria, which resulted in widespread evacuations. Snowy mountains and south coast NSW Showing fires encircling Batlow, and around Eden, near the NSW and Victorian border. And here are the older animations which have not been updated: Mid-north coast NSW Showing the fires burning around coastal towns such as Port Macquarie and Forster, and fires burning further west closer to Tamworth. Northern NSW and Queensland Further north, bushfires encircled the region around Grafton, destroying homes and other properties in small towns such as Nymboida, Busbys Flat and Drake, where two people died in October. Brisbane and Toowoomba regions, Queensland In the area around Brisbane and Toowoomba, fire swept through the Pechey state forest, destroying homes in the town of Crows Nest. Bushfires also affected Moreton Island.",

As firefighters continued to battle out-of-control bushfires across four states on Friday, the prime minister said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that people were conflating the ongoing fire crisis with Australia\u2019s emission reduction targets. \u201cWe don\u2019t want job-destroying, economy-destroying, economy-wrecking targets and goals, which won\u2019t change the fact that there have been bushfires or anything like that in Australia,\u201d Morrison told Sydney radio, 2GB. \u201cThe suggestion that there\u2019s any one emissions reduction policy or climate policy that has contributed directly to any of these fire events is just ridiculous and the conflation of those two things, I think, has been very disappointing.\u201d He said the government would \u201ccontinue to consider our policies carefully here\u201d, while conceding to the ABC that the bushfire crisis had elevated the debate over the government\u2019s stance on climate change. \u201cI think the public opinion on this issue, has been heightened across a whole range of factors and climate is one,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cBut I mean, there are a range of other things \u2026 the drought, which is not unrelated to the issues we\u2019re talking about, but the hazard reduction and how we manage that in the future, because hazard reduction has proved to be very difficult in recent times because of the drought.\u201d Experts have pointed to the link between climate change and an inability to undertake more hazard reduction burning, with hotter, drier conditions and a prolonged bushfire season narrowing the window of opportunity for the practice. When asked if a national inquiry into the fires that canvassed all issues, including climate change, could prompt a \u201crecalibration\u201d of the government\u2019s climate change policies, Morrison said the government would review any recommendations arising from an inquiry. \u201cI\u2019m up to discuss all of those things and there\u2019s no hesitancy or pushback from the government to address any of those things.

Coalition MPs have also been asked not to engage in public discussions about the government\u2019s climate change policies until after the current bushfire threat has passed, urging a focus on the government\u2019s emergency response. In a phone hook-up with government MPs on Thursday, Morrison also banned backbench MPs from doing any international media interviews, after conservative MP Craig Kelly was lambasted on UK television for denying the role of climate change. But as the prime minister fends off criticism for the government\u2019s climate policies, a growing number of MPs are privately conceding that more needs to be done to match the growing level of public concern about the links between climate change and Australia\u2019s drying climate. An update from the Bureau of Meteorology released on Thursday showed Australia recorded its hottest and driest year on record in 2019, with temperatures 1.52C above the long-term average. MPs say that the view being pushed by Labor and the Greens that the Coalition is not doing enough has penetrated, and will be politically damaging at the next election unless Morrison charts a more ambitious course. This would particularly be the case in inner-city seats where the issue was recognised as a key factor that won Labor votes in certain seats at the last election. A number of MPs have already joined a cross party pro-climate action group, the Parliamentary Friends of Climate Action group, including Liberals Tim Wilson, Dave Sharma, Jason Falinski, Katie Allen, Angie Bell and Trent Zimmerman. MPs told Guardian Australia that they believed the government needed to reposition on climate change, but recognised Morrison could not be seen to be responding in a knee-jerk fashion. The independent MP Zali Steggall, who defeated Tony Abbott on a platform of climate change action, is hoping that some Liberals wanting stronger action will cross the floor to support her bill to establish a climate change action framework. She is planning a public awareness campaign aimed at putting pressure on the government to allow a conscience vote on the legislation. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said the opposition wanted to see \u201cstrong action on climate change\u201d, but the party was still considering its position following last year\u2019s election loss. \u201cWe will announce our proposals based upon where we\u2019re at closer to the election. We won\u2019t let the government off the hook,\u201d Albanese said. \u201c[But] we want the government to act immediately.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s very little birdsong in this valley right now. Just thin wisps of notes from the robin, the see-sawing sounds of great tits on warm days or wild bursts from mistle thrushes that, in some years, I\u2019ve recorded in my diary around Christmas time. There\u2019s one bird, though, that sings throughout the year and that is the dipper. I listen for it when I step outside the back door. This song has a fluidity that seems all about the movement of the river where it lives, a stream of calmer moments followed by flurries of repeated notes. It has some of the sweetness of the skylark mixed with the variety of the thrush. In summer, I straighten from working the veg garden to take notice. In winter, when even the sheep are silent, it\u2019s especially uplifting. On this cold January morning I go out into the glinting world of the frosted field. There\u2019s ice on the pussy willows, ice on tufts of caught wool, ice turning barbed wire into tinsel. Where the river bends, a dipper sings from a boulder in the fast-flowing mid-current; favourite perching rocks are streaked in white droppings at intervals down the stream. They have a strong attachment to territory, with nest sites being traditional, and pairs are monogamous, sometimes for years. As a child, I first saw a dipper walking underwater below Jedburgh Abbey. Through the clarity of the Jed, I marvelled as it picked food from the gravel bed; mayfly nymphs, caddisfly larvae and tiny fish such as minnows are in its diet. Dippers have dense feathers, preened with oil to waterproof them, and they manoeuvre through the water using their wings. They are unfazed by cold. In the winter of 2010, when the East Allen had all but frozen over, water gurgling beneath a solid five inches as if in a cavern, I watched a dipper feeding. A dark blur, it moved resolutely this way and that, popping up occasionally, flicking its nictitating membranes over its eyes. Mating early in the season and being equipped for tough weather, the dippers of the East Allen may have their first clutch within only seven or eight weeks.",

      "bodyText": "Josh Frydenberg has demanded insurers provide Treasury with an unprecedented level of detail about claims for bushfire property losses, a proposal the industry doubts is feasible. The demand was outlined in a draft letter circulated to insurers on Thursday by the Insurance Council of Australia, which outlined 38 pieces of information about individual claims that Frydenberg wants provided to Treasury, including street address, the year the building was constructed and the amount for which the property was insured. Total insurance claims for Australia\u2019s bushfire season have climbed towards $1bn, with more to come as damage is assessed and fires continue to threaten. The demand would require insurers to continue to provide information for months or years, because Frydenberg is also seeking detailed data on the settlement of claims, including when rebuilding works are approved by local authorities and when cash payments are made. Insurers currently provide only aggregated data about total claims of various types to the ICA, which uses the information to maintain a catastrophes database. Frydenberg has not asked for information about insurance of motor vehicles or for business interruption, which typically also generate heavy claims during catastrophes such as bushfires. Guardian Australia understands insurers were given until the close of business on Friday to respond to the Treasurer\u2019s demands. An ICA spokesman said he could \u201cconfirm that insurers are being consulted on a request by Treasury for a large amount of data on property claims\u201d. \u201cThe Insurance Council is consulting with its members on the feasibility of this proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry\u2019s focus is on providing services and responding to its customers and data requests are an extra burden on insurers, but they also appreciate the need to provide data to government.\u201d He said about 11,500 bushfire-related insurance claims had been made since the start of September, for a total amount claimed of $995m. Frydenberg met insurance industry chief executives on Tuesday, a meeting the ICA CEO, Rob Whelan, described at the time as \u201chighly productive\u201d. Frydenberg said he and the CEOs \u201calso discussed how insurers and government can continue to work together, including sharing detailed data about the response, to help support insurers, government and others respond to the needs of communities in a timely manner\u201d. The level of detail demanded in the letter has alarmed some in the insurance industry. Some were also puzzled by Frydenberg\u2019s statement after the meeting that insurers gave \u201ca commitment to focus on local building and construction businesses and suppliers in fire-affected communities to carry out the necessary work\u201d at the meeting. Insurers already use local contractors wherever possible because it is generally cheaper than bringing in outsiders, an industry source told Guardian Australia. Frydenberg\u2019s office has been contacted for comment.",

And the shocking news emerged as the president <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-proposed-national-environmental-policy-act-regulations/\">announced a rollback</a> of environmental regulations at the White House, taking an axe to the environmental review process required for infrastructure projects. The move, which he pitched as a way around \u201cendless delays\u201d to various projects, poses a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/09/white-house-projects-permits-climate-impact-plan\">new threat to the climate</a> and is likely to face legal challenges. </p> \n<p>The president\u2019s war on the environment is nothing new. His plan to bury his nose in a book is.</p> \n<p>Trump isn\u2019t known for his literary bona fides. Though the bestseller The Art of the Deal helped make his name, it was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz \u2013 who <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\">deeply regrets his work on the book</a>. Ghostwriters have been involved in most, if not all, of his many other volumes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t read books and he doesn\u2019t write them,\u201d Schwartz <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-books-tweet-ghostwriter-tim-o-brien-tony-schwartz-writer-response-a8431271.html\">told the Independent</a> in 2018. (The late-night host Samantha Bee has developed a conspiracy theory that Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFkN7QGp2c\">can\u2019t read at all</a>.)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/24/trump-book-picks-recommendations-2018\">The presidential library: 10 books Trump recommended this year</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But one subject fascinates the president so much that he\u2019s willing to invest in a volume of prose. That subject is, of course, himself.</p> \n<p>The president highlighted Russo\u2019s volume in his own defense after a question over whether he feels the climate crisis is made-up. \u201cThe environment is very important to me. Somebody wrote a book that I\u2019m an environmentalist \u2013 it\u2019s actually called The Environmentalist \u2026 I\u2019d like to get it,\u201d he said, before apparently contradicting himself and suggesting he already had it \u201cin the other office\u201d.</p> \n<p>Russo, who has advised Trump, describes himself as a lifelong advocate for the planet. His self-published work claims to offer \u201ca personal picture of a man who doesn\u2019t just care about success but the impact of his success on the world\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump, the book\u2019s blurb says, offered Russo a job to ensure that Trump\u2019s business developments wouldn\u2019t \u201cnegatively affect habitats\u201d, conjuring an image of a concerned Trump nodding thoughtfully as Russo warns of the toll his latest golf course could take on the local squirrel population.</p> \n<p>The book seeks to counter a narrative \u2013 supported by robust evidence, including Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement, his assault on Obama-era environmental rules, and his complaints about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/06/trump-says-people-flush-the-toilet-10-times-and-seeks-solution\">excessive toilet flushing</a> due to low water pressure \u2013 that the president actually doesn\u2019t care very much about the planet.</p> \n<p>Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump sought to paint a very different picture of himself. Asked about the climate crisis, he said, according to the <a href=\"https://publicpool.kinja.com/subject-pool-report-6-more-questions-event-over-1840902369?_ga=2.63231535.1038075333.1578613040-1270064037.1578613040\">pool report</a>: \u201cNothing\u2019s a hoax about that. It\u2019s a very serious subject \u2026 I\u2019m a big believer in that word, the environment.\u201d That would seem to run counter to his previous claims that the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/09/politics/trump-proposal-national-environmental-policy-act/index.html\">climate emergency is a Chinese hoax</a> and casting doubt on global warming <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/11/ideology-behind-donald-trumps-paris-withdrawal/601462/\">during a snowstorm</a>.</p> \n<p>As for Russo, his own brand of environmentalism seems a little shaky. He has hailed proposed <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-by-edward-russo-on-trump-epa-cuts-300417094.html\">EPA budget cuts</a>, suggesting they will increase the agency\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s lightning or thunder that, oh, it\u2019s climate change,\u201d he told the<a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060066397\"> energy news site E&amp;E News</a> in 2017. \u201cClimate change is a natural change in balance of the Earth, it happens all the time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whether the book\u2019s claims of environmental heroism are accurate or not, the president appears to have developed an interest in the written word. We can only hope his newfound passion means a little less <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/26/fox-and-friends-donald-trump-news-relationship\">TV time</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump is going to acquire a book. The book in question, as Gizmodo reported on Thursday, is titled Donald J Trump: An Environmental Hero, by Edward Russo. And the shocking news emerged as the president announced a rollback of environmental regulations at the White House, taking an axe to the environmental review process required for infrastructure projects. The move, which he pitched as a way around \u201cendless delays\u201d to various projects, poses a new threat to the climate and is likely to face legal challenges. The president\u2019s war on the environment is nothing new. His plan to bury his nose in a book is. Trump isn\u2019t known for his literary bona fides. Though the bestseller The Art of the Deal helped make his name, it was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz \u2013 who deeply regrets his work on the book. Ghostwriters have been involved in most, if not all, of his many other volumes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t read books and he doesn\u2019t write them,\u201d Schwartz told the Independent in 2018. (The late-night host Samantha Bee has developed a conspiracy theory that Trump can\u2019t read at all.) But one subject fascinates the president so much that he\u2019s willing to invest in a volume of prose. That subject is, of course, himself. The president highlighted Russo\u2019s volume in his own defense after a question over whether he feels the climate crisis is made-up. \u201cThe environment is very important to me. Somebody wrote a book that I\u2019m an environmentalist \u2013 it\u2019s actually called The Environmentalist \u2026 I\u2019d like to get it,\u201d he said, before apparently contradicting himself and suggesting he already had it \u201cin the other office\u201d. Russo, who has advised Trump, describes himself as a lifelong advocate for the planet. His self-published work claims to offer \u201ca personal picture of a man who doesn\u2019t just care about success but the impact of his success on the world\u201d. Trump, the book\u2019s blurb says, offered Russo a job to ensure that Trump\u2019s business developments wouldn\u2019t \u201cnegatively affect habitats\u201d, conjuring an image of a concerned Trump nodding thoughtfully as Russo warns of the toll his latest golf course could take on the local squirrel population. The book seeks to counter a narrative \u2013 supported by robust evidence, including Trump\u2019s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement, his assault on Obama-era environmental rules, and his complaints about excessive toilet flushing due to low water pressure \u2013 that the president actually doesn\u2019t care very much about the planet. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump sought to paint a very different picture of himself. Asked about the climate crisis, he said, according to the pool report: \u201cNothing\u2019s a hoax about that. It\u2019s a very serious subject \u2026 I\u2019m a big believer in that word, the environment.\u201d That would seem to run counter to his previous claims that the climate emergency is a Chinese hoax and casting doubt on global warming during a snowstorm. As for Russo, his own brand of environmentalism seems a little shaky. He has hailed proposed EPA budget cuts, suggesting they will increase the agency\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s lightning or thunder that, oh, it\u2019s climate change,\u201d he told the energy news site E&amp;E News in 2017. \u201cClimate change is a natural change in balance of the Earth, it happens all the time.\u201d Whether the book\u2019s claims of environmental heroism are accurate or not, the president appears to have developed an interest in the written word. We can only hope his newfound passion means a little less TV time.",

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sources said the email had since been deleted from News Corp inboxes.</p> \n<p>News Corp papers have been accused of placing undue emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/08/twitter-bots-trolls-australian-bushfires-social-media-disinformation-campaign-false-claims\">issues such as arson and hazard reduction</a> in a way that diverts attention from climate change\u2019s role in creating longer, more severe fire seasons.</p> \n<p>That includes an editorial arguing no climate policy change would stop the current bushfires, and a perceived emphasis on inadequate hazard reduction and arson as causes.</p> \n<p>Miller issued a statement on Friday afternoon saying Townsend had resigned in December and was due to leave the company shortly.

      "bodyText": "A senior News Corp employee has accused the company of \u201cmisinformation\u201d and diverting attention from climate change during the bushfire crisis in an explosive all-staff email addressed to executive chairman Michael Miller. The email accuses News Corp papers, including the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun, of misrepresenting facts and spreading misinformation to focus on arson as the cause of the bushfires, rather than climate change. The email was sent by Emily Townsend, a commercial finance manager at News Corp, in response to an all-staff email from Miller detailing the leave arrangements available to staff and announcing other bushfire-related initiatives. \u201cThis does not offset the impact News Corp reporting has had over the last few weeks,\u201d Townsend wrote. \u201cI have been severely impacted by the coverage of News Corp publications in relation to the fires, in particular the misinformation campaign that has tried to divert attention away from the real issue which is climate change to rather focus on arson (including misrepresenting facts). \u201cI find it unconscionable to continue working for this company, knowing I am contributing to the spread of climate change denial and lies. The reporting I have witnessed in the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun is not only irresponsible, but dangerous and damaging to our communities and beautiful planet that needs us more than ever now to acknowledge the destruction we have caused and start doing something about it.\u201d The email landed in the inbox of all News Corp staff, and was leaked to the Guardian by multiple sources, but not Townsend herself. Sources said the email had since been deleted from News Corp inboxes. News Corp papers have been accused of placing undue emphasis on issues such as arson and hazard reduction in a way that diverts attention from climate change\u2019s role in creating longer, more severe fire seasons. That includes an editorial arguing no climate policy change would stop the current bushfires, and a perceived emphasis on inadequate hazard reduction and arson as causes. Miller issued a statement on Friday afternoon saying Townsend had resigned in December and was due to leave the company shortly. Miller said News Corp did not \u201cdeny climate change or the gravity of its threat\u201d. \u201cHowever, we \u2013 as is the traditional role of a publisher \u2013 do report a variety of views and opinions on this issue and many others that are important in the public discourse on the fires,\u201d he said. He said he respected Townsend\u2019s right to hold her views but \u201cwe do not agree with them\u201d. \u201cNews Corp stands by its coverage of the bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dedication and professionalism of our journalists and photographers have kept the community \u2013 particularly those Australians affected directly \u2013 informed and supported. \u201cOur coverage has recognised that Australia is having a serious conversation about climate change and how to respond to it. However, it has also reflected there are a variety of views and opinions about the current fire crisis. The role of arsonists and policies that may have contributed to the spread of fire are, therefore, legitimate stories to report in the public interest.\u201d The Australian has published pieces making clear the link between climate change and the bushfires, including a piece by Jack the Insider, which stated: \u201cIt is true that arson and acts of criminal stupidity are common reasons for the ignition of fires. We need to acknowledge that, understand it and take steps to prevent it. \u201cBut we also need to appreciate that while climate change doesn\u2019t start fires, it is the fundamental reason six million hectares and counting of this country have been ravaged by fire.\u201d But other pieces have tended to exaggerate the role arson played in the current bushfire season. This week, the Australian reported that 183 arsonists had been arrested during the current bushfire season. The figure was the sum of data from various states and territories.

With the passage of an Authorization for Use of Military Force in 2001 to fight terrorism, and another AUMF in 2002 for the war in Iraq, Congress\u2019 war powers have diminished since 9/11. Now many lawmakers \u2013 especially Democrats \u2013 are discussing how to rebalance war powers. </p> \n  <p>In the Senate, a similar war powers proposal by Democrat Tim Kaine faces much slimmer odds of passing, though Republican Senator Todd Young, an ex-marine who represents Indiana, and two other Republicans indicated yesterday the would back the plan.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T00:16:01.692Z\">at 12.16am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e17b1648f08c39722647e38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-09T23:10:39.882Z\">11.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Three Republicans voted for the resolution: Thomas Massie, Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Friday\u2019s blog: The House voted to limit Donald Trump\u2019s war powers. The measure compels the president to consult Congress before taking further action against Iran. As a \u201cconcurrent resolution\u201d, the legislation doesn\u2019t need to be ratified by Trump, but is not legally binding. Still, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted the War Powers Resolution \u201chas real teeth\u201d because \u201cit is a statement of the Congress of the United States\u201d. At a rally in Ohio (which is still ondoing), Trump repeated a claim that he ordered a strike on Iranian general Quassem Suleimani because of a threat to the US embassy in Baghdad. The president also derided Congress\u2019 War Powers resolution and implied it would have been impractical to coordinate schedules with lawmakers to discuss the strike before he ordered it. Pelosi said she won\u2019t publicly set a deadline to send the articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate, though Senate Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly expects them as early as tomorrow. Western officials believe the Ukrainian airliner that crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran on Wednesday was caused by an Iranian missile. OF the 176 passengers who died, 63 were Canadian. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau said his government \u201cwill not rest\u201d until it got justice. LA mayor Eric Garcetti has endorsed Joe Biden Joe Biden gained a high-profile supporter in Calfornia, ahead of the state\u2019s March 3 primary. The Los Angeles mayor joined Dianne Feinstein, the state\u2019s senior US senator, in endorsing Biden. \u201cWe need Joe Biden to bring our nation and world together during these most divided and dangerous times,\u201d Garcetti said in a statement. Although Biden is a front-runner in national polls, in California, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are neck and neck with the former vice president. Garcetti weighed entering the 2020 race himself but announced a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t be running. The president is now addressing his order to kill Iranian general Qassem Suleimani without consulting Congress. Trump said he\u2019s ended Suleimani\u2019s \u201crampage though not only that part of the world\u201d but also \u201cother parts\u201d, implying that Suleimani was targeting the US embassy in Baghdad and other embassies. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer a terror \u2014 he\u2019s dead,\u201d Trump said. He derided \u201cCrazy Bernie\u201d and Nancy Pelosi for criticizing his moves against Iran, and mocked Democrats who passed a War Powers Resolutions to prevent him from taking further action without consulting Congress, implying it would have been too difficult to coordinate schedules to discuss the \u201cexecution\u201d of the Iranian general before ordering it. Earlier today, Trump claimed he ordered the killing of Suleimani to stop a plot to destroy the US embassy in Baghdad, though he didn\u2019t provide any further details to reporters. The plot was \u201cobvious,\u201d he said, pointing to protesters who stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to provide more information on why, exactly, the Iranian general was targeted now. Donald Trump is speaking at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. An Ohio politics reporter fact-checks his claim that \u201cOhio just had the best year economically\u201d. Billionaire Tom Steyer is the sixth candidate to qualify for the Democratic debate Steyer qualified for the debate after two Fox News polls released today showed Steyer polling double-digits in South Carolina and Nevada. He tied alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren for third place in Nevada and landed in second place in South Carolina, with at 15%. Joe Biden took the lead spot in both polls. The debate is scheduled for Jan 14 in Des Moines, Iowa. Along with Steyer, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar have also qualified. Cory Booker, Deval Patrick and Andrew Yang, the three remaining candidates of color have not yet qualified; they have through tomorrow to do so. This post was amended on 10 January 2020. A previous version omitted Deval Patrick from the list of candidates of color. Having approved the war powers resolution, the House has now moved on to environmental policy. Members are debating legislation that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to designate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous. But Donald Trump \u2013 who today unveiled a plan to bypass environmental review of major infrastructure projects and has aggressively pursued cuts to environmental projection \u2013 insists he cares about the environment, too. Asked whether climate change was a hoax this morning, Trump told reporters \u201cit\u2019s a very serious subject\u201d and he\u2019s going to read a book about it. The New York Times\u2019 Lisa Friedman followed up \u2013 and discovered the title of the book he intends to read: Donald J Trump: An Environmental Hero, by Ed Russo. The book was self-published by Russo, who was an environmental advisor for the Trump Organization. A Super Pac set up to help defeat the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is releasing its first attack ad against the top Kentucky Republican. The 46-second web ad by the \u201cFire Mitch. Save America\u201d Super Pac is a compilation of clips of late night hosts lambasting McConnell. It starts with Daily Show comedian Trevor Noah saying McConnell is \u201ctruly the perfect movie villain\u201d while images of McConnell on the Senate floor and smiling directly into the camera. The ad shows a clip of comedian Samantha Bee saying \u201cMcConnell is so good at blocking things he\u2019s like the kidney stone of the Senate.\u201d Thr MSNBC host Joe Scarborough\u2019s voice then says \u201ckeeps killing any bill that would protect American democracy\u201d before going back to Bee saying McConnell has been \u201copenly bragging about he how he stole a supreme court seat\u201d \u2013 a reference to McConnell\u2019s refusal to hold hearings on Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland for the supreme court. The ad then switches to a clip of McConnell saying \u201cthink of me as the grim reaper\u201d. The ad frames McConnell as a nefarious figure in the Senate, a common sentiment among Democrats. \u201cMitch McConnell is the most unpopular senator in the entire country and yet he has enormous power to block progress on so many issues important to all of our families,\u201d Democratic strategist Eric Hyers, the founder of the Super Pac, said in a statement. \u201cHe is fueling the cynicism and distrust of Washington and it\u2019s time for him to go. Kentucky and all Americans deserve better.\u201d The ad is the first one by the Super Pac and is set to air on multiple digital platforms. It\u2019s the latest example of Democrats\u2019 efforts to oust the longtime senator by painting him as a consummate Washington insider motivated by partisanship above all else. McConnell is up for re-election in 2020 and multiple Democrats are running in the primary for the party nomination to face him. But Democrat Amy McGrath, the former Democratic congressional candidate, is the heavy favorite. The Super Pac plans to produce more content against McConnell. The House resolution came about after Donald Trump chose to take unilateral action last week to assassinate the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani without consulting or even notifying before Congress. To stop the president from taking further action against Iran without consulting them, House Democrats have invoked the War Powers Act of 1973, which draws out the parameters of presidential and congressional war powers. With the passage of an Authorization for Use of Military Force in 2001 to fight terrorism, and another AUMF in 2002 for the war in Iraq, Congress\u2019 war powers have diminished since 9/11. Now many lawmakers \u2013 especially Democrats \u2013 are discussing how to rebalance war powers. In the Senate, a similar war powers proposal by Democrat Tim Kaine faces much slimmer odds of passing, though Republican Senator Todd Young, an ex-marine who represents Indiana, and two other Republicans indicated yesterday the would back the plan. Three Republicans voted for the resolution: Thomas Massie, Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz. Eight Democrats voted against. This is a \u201cconcurrent resolution\u201d \u2013 which doesn\u2019t go to the president for a signature, and also isn\u2019t usually legally binding. However, House Democrats are arguing that a concurrent resolution under the War Powers Act is a special case, and is binding. The debate over the implications of this resolution has gotten a bit... catty. Voting mostly but not entirely along party lines, the House approved a resolution to limit the president\u2019s war powers, 224-194 The measure compels the president to go to Congress for authorization before taking further military action against Iran. As the House continues to debate a war powers resolution, Donald Trump is en route to Ohio, where he\u2019s holding a campaign rally later today. He\u2019s accompanied today by aides Dan Scavino, Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi would not commit to a specific timeline on transmitting the articles of impeachment, only telling reporters at the House speaker\u2019s weekly press conference that she would \u201csoon\u201d send the articles to the Senate. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, reportedly expects Pelosi to transmit the articles as soon as tomorrow, with a trial scheduled to begin early next week, but that prediction is not based on any personal intel. The House is currently debating a War Powers Resolution aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran following the Suleimani strike. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, blamed the Ukrainian passenger jet crash, which killed dozens of Canadians, on Iran, echoing reports that the plane was mistakently hit by an Iranian missile. Trump claimed Suleimani was \u201clooking to blow up our embassy\u201d when he was killed in a US drone strike, although the president did not provide evidence to back up that claim. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump just left for his Ohio campaign rally without stopping to talk to reporters who were gathered at the White House to pose questions about impeachment and Iran. The president and vice president are hosting a campaign rally tonight in Toledo, Ohio, where Trump is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. ET. Congressman Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said his panel has no plans of calling John Bolton to testify before the Senate impeachment trial. Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, has said he would testify in a Senate trial if he were subpoenaed, but it\u2019s unclear whether the Republican-controlled Senate would issue a subpoena. House Democrats previously decided against issuing a subpoena to Bolton because the former official signaled he would join a lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena or the White House guidance not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Nancy Pelosi delivered a floor speech in favor of the War Powers Resolution, which would limit Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. The House speaker criticized the administration for not seeking congressional authorization before the Suleimani strike, which she called \u201cprovocative and disproportionate.\u201d Democratic lawmakers are racing to backtrack on their earlier comments suggesting the time had come for Nancy Pelosi to submit the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Congressman Adam Smith already walked by his comments about the House speaker, and now senator Dianne Feinstein has abandoned her criticism of Pelosi. The California senator had previoulsy said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, she should send them over. I don\u2019t see what good delay does.\u201d Feinstein already started to backtrack on those comments earlier today, but this statement underscores her change of heart. In it, the senator says she believes Pelosi is acting out of a \u201csincere desire to ensure a fair process that allows the Senate to consider available evidence -- a goal that all of us should share.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has signed on as a co-sponsor of a resolution from Republican senator Josh Hawley, which would make it possible to dismiss impeachment charges even if the House does not transmit the articles. Hawley\u2019s resolution would change Senate rules to allow senators to render a verdict on impeachment charges starting 25 calendar days after the House has impeached, even if the speaker has not yet submitted the paperwork or named impeachment managers. But it would require two-thirds of the Senate to break a filibuster on the proposal, which seems unlikely given Republicans\u2019 narrow majority. Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, reportedly plans to endorse Joe Biden tomorrow as the former vice president visits the city. The endorsement comes as polls have shown Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren leading in the crucial state, which awards nearly 500 delegates at the nominating convention. Garcetti toyed with the idea of launching his own White House bid before ultimately deciding against entering the field. Congressman Adam Smith, the Democratic chairman of the House armed services committee, said he was not \u201cthreatened\u201d to walk back his earlier comments about it being time for Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment. Smith said on CNN this morning, \u201cI think it was perfectly advisable for the speaker to leverage that, get a better deal. At this point, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen, and yes, I think it is time to send the impeachment to the Senate.\u201d But Smith quickly walked that back in a pair of tweets, saying, \u201cI misspoke this morning, I do believe we should do everything we can to force the Senate to have a fair trial.\u201d The Washington Democrat claimed he did not communicate with the speaker\u2019s office before walking back the comments, but he added that his staff may have spoken to Pelosi\u2019s team. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country and others have gathered intelligence indicating the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed yesterday was shot down by an Iranian missile. At least 63 Canadians were among the 176 people on board, all of whom died in the crash. Trudeau said the attack may have been \u201cunintentional,\u201d echoing earlier reports that the plane may have been targeted by mistake. As reports emerged that she would transmit the articles of impeachment as soon as tomorrow, Nancy Pelosi dodged reporters\u2019 questions about the timing of her next steps, saying she stood by her earlier statement. The House speaker told reporters earlier today that she did not intend to hold the articles indefinitely. \u201cI\u2019ll send them over when I\u2019m ready,\u201d Pelosi said at her weekly press conference. \u201cAnd that\u2019ll probably be soon.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell reportedly expects House speaker Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment as soon as tomorrow, clearing the way for a trial to begin early next week. Politico reports: While senators and aides cautioned that McConnell does not have inside intelligence, the remarks serve as key scheduling advice for senators. Most Republicans are now gearing up for the relentless pace of the impeachment trial to start on Monday or Tuesday. \u2018At lunch, we all heard that. And he says: \u2018That\u2019s my best guess,\u2019\u2019 said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). \u2018Which means that we\u2019d get started next week.\u2019 Most senators immediately left the chamber after voting on Thursday afternoon, a signal that the trial will not start until after the weekend. The House has now taken up the War Powers Resolution, which is aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. Members will debate for two hours before taking a vote, which will not be binding but will force lawmakers to take a position on the issue. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign manager lashed out against Facebook after the social media company announced it would continue to allow political candidates to advertise on its platform without policing content for accuracy. The Biden team has previously criticzed Facebook for allowing Trump\u2019s reelection campaign to air an ad that includes falsehoods about Biden\u2019s record on Ukraine. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign can (and will) still lie in political ads,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy communications director said in a statement. \u201cFacebook can (and will) still profit off it. Today\u2019s announcement is more window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation.\u201d Meanwhile, the Trump campaign celebrated the news as a victory for democracy. \u201cOur ads are always accurate so it\u2019s good that Facebook won\u2019t limit political messages because it encourages more Americans to be involved in the process,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. Congressman Max Rose, a freshman Democrat from New York, has said he will oppose the War Powers Resolution aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. \u201cUnfortunately, today\u2019s War Powers Resolution is a non-binding resolution that simply restates existing law and sends the message that war is imminent,\u201d Rose said in a statement explaining his vote. \u201cI refuse to play politics with questions of war and peace.\u201d Trump has already encouraged Republicans to oppose the resolution, which faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Another Democratic lawmaker who had said it was time for Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment is now changing her tune. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fellow California Democrat, previously said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, she should send them over. I don\u2019t see what good delay does.\u201d Earlier today, another Democratic lawmaker, congressman Adam Smith, had to walk back comments he made indicating he believed it was time to send the articles to the Senate. Avenatti set for trial(s) Former thorn in Donald Trump\u2019s side and very much ex-omnipresence on our television screens and at the side of former client and alleged past-Trumpian paramour Stormy Daniels - attorney Michael Avenatti - had a bad day in court today. A New York judge rejected Avenatti\u2019s bid to dismiss a criminal charge that he defrauded a client whom he said knew about improper payments that sportswear giant Nike allegedly made to families of college basketball recruits. US district judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan ruled three days after refusing to dismiss two extortion charges accusing Avenatti of threatening a news conference about the payments unless Nike paid him up to $25 million. Nike has denied wrongdoing. \u201cWhen the actual evidence is heard at trial rather than the baseless allegations in the indictment, I will be fully cleared because I did nothing wrong,\u201d Avenatti, 48, said in a text message. \u201cI am innocent,\u201d Reuters reports. The fraud count and one extortion count carry maximum 20-year prison terms, with the trial scheduled for January 21. Avenatti also faces an April 21 trial in Manhattan for allegedly cheating StormyDaniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and a May 19 trial in Santa Ana, California for allegedly defrauding clients out of millions of dollars and lying to the Internal Revenue Service. Avenatti denies all the charges. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi said she would \u201csoon\u201d transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, but the House speaker declined to provide a specific timeline for her next steps. US officials are confident the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed on Wednesday was accidentally shot down by Iran. Trump claimed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was \u201clooking to blow up our embassy\u201d when he was killed in a US drone strike, but he did not provide evidence for that. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. A newly released poll found former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders leading the Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire. According to the Monmouth University poll, Buttigieg is attracting the support of 20% of New Hampshire Democrats, putting him 1 point ahead of Biden and 2 points ahead of Sanders. Considering the margin of error of 4.9 points, the three candidates are in a statistical tie for the lead, while Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren trails slightly at 15%. New Hampshire will hold its primary on February 11, eight days after Iowa holds the first caucuses of the race. Although the two states are viewed as critically important for helping presidential candidates to build momentum, they are both much whiter than the broader Democratic Party, raising questions about whether the results there will indicate the eventual nominee. The poll also does not help any additional candidates qualify for the next debate, which will be held Tuesday in Des Moines. Currently, only five candidates -- Biden, Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar -- have qualified. Asked about John Bolton\u2019s potential testimony during the impeachment trial, Trump again said the question of whether to subpoena his former national security adviser would be left up to the Senate. \u201cI always got along with him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get along with some of our people, but that\u2019s really going to be up to the Senate.\u201d But the US president interestingly noted he would confer with his lawyers to determine how to \u201cprotect presidential privilege,\u201d indicating the White House might seek to limit Bolton\u2019s testimony. \u201cWe have to protect presidential privilege for me but for future presidents,\u201d Trump told reporters attending his environmental regulation event. Speaking to reporters during his environmental regulation event, Trump said he had come up with a \u201cbeautiful\u201d name for NATO Middle East, emphasizing his desire for the international alliance to get more involved in the region. The US president also said that the name of the renegotiated North American trade deal -- USMCA to stand for for the United States, Mexico and Canada agreement -- was inspired by the song \u201cYMCA.\u201d As reports emerged that US officials believe Iran struck down the Ukrainian airliner that went down yesterday, Trump said he thought the crash may have been the result of a \u201cmistake\u201d on the \u201cother side.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh and Michael Safi have more details on the crash: The Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile, western security officials believe. UK sources told the Guardian that the UK had seen US intelligence that suggested that the plane was hit by an Iranian air defence missile. Separately, officials told US media they had identified the signature from an Iranian anti-aircraft missile battery being activated shortly before the aircraft crashed into countryside south-west of the Iranian capital, killing all on 176 on board. The officials also said they had identified the infrared signature from two suspected missile launches followed shortly afterwards by the infra red blip from the burning and fatally disabled aircraft. Speaking to reporters during an event regarding environmental regulation, Trump said the US targeted Iranian general Qassem Suleimani because he was \u201clooking to blow up our embassy.\u201d \u201cWe did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy,\u201d the US president said. \u201cWe also did it for other reasons that were very obvious. Somebody died, one of our military people died, people were badly wounded just a week before.\u201d US officials have said Suleimani was planning an \u201cimminent\u201d attack on Americans, but they have declined to provide further details about the threat. It\u2019s unclear whether the planned embassy strike Trump described was the same \u201cimminent\u201d attack that US officials have referenced. US officials reportedly believe Iran shot down the Ukraine International Airlines plane that crashed yesterday, killing all 176 people on board. According to CBS News, the plane may have been mistakenly targeted just hours after Iran launched its missile attack in response to the US strike on Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Nancy Pelosi was wrapping up her news conference but came back to the podium to take a question about whether she would attend the San Francisco 49ers game this weekend. The House speaker also laughed along with reporters as she took a question about whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to California now that they\u2019re stepping back from their royal duties. Nancy Pelosi said it is \u201cfor sure\u201d time to get rid of the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq, which the Trump administration is using as its legal justification for launching military missions against Iran. But the House speaker noted the complicated nature of crafting a new AUMF, which would have to determine the timing, geography and scope of conflict. Pelosi earlier criticized Trump for launching the strike against Iranian general Qassem Suleimani without seeking congressional authorization. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments this morning, saying she would \u201csoon\u201d transmit the articles of impeachment, cast doubt on the possibility of starting a Senate trial next week. A number of senators, including some Democrats, had said they hoped the trial could start next week, but Pelosi did not provide a specific timeline for when the articles would be sent over. Although Nancy Pelosi said she would \u201csoon\u201d transmit the articles of impeachment, the House speaker did not provide a specific timeline. \u201cI think we should move smartly and strategically,\u201d Pelosi said of Democrats\u2019 thinking on holding back the articles. Asked how long she was willing to delay transmitting the articles of impeachment, Nancy Pelosi argued her stalling had been successful because of the developments that have unfolded in the past few weeks. The House speaker pointed to the release of administration emails revealing new details about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military aid and former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s willingness to testify. However, Pelosi said she did not plan to hold the articles indefinitely. \u201cI\u2019ll send them over when I\u2019m ready,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cAnd that\u2019ll probably be soon.\u201d Speaking to reporters at her weekly press conference, Nancy Pelosi repeated her desire to understand the parameters of a Senate trial before transmitting the articles of impeachment. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said right from the start: we need to see the arena in which we are sending our managers,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIs that too much to ask?\u201d The speaker added that she was concerned senators would not live up to their oath to hold an impartial trial to determine whether Trump should be removed from office. \u201cNonetheless, at some point, we would hope that we would see from them what the terms of engagement will be,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe are ready, we are proud of our defense of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Nancy Pelosi told reporters that the House would today pass a war powers resolution aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. Trump has told Republicans to vote against the resolution, and it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the podium for her weekly press conference at the Capitol. She opened her remarks by saying lawmakers would be celebrating the recent wedding of congresswoman Barbara Lee, who was married on new year\u2019s eve in California. Entering the Capitol this morning, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she knows \u201cexactly when\u201d to transmit the articles of impeachment. But Pelosi added, \u201cI won\u2019t be telling you right now.\u2033 The speaker said her thinking on the matter has not changed. \u201cSame thing I\u2019ve said before,\u201d Pelosi told the AP. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see how we\u2019re going to proceed, and then we\u2019ll know who to send. \u201cI have an obligation to my members, especially those on the committees, to do justice to their work.\u201d Pelosi is expected to speak to reporters at her weekly press conference in the next couple minutes. Trump was the target of some Twitter jokes after he mistakenly referred to the common retirement fund 401K as a \u201c409K.\u201d The typo immediately set off a round of Twitter jokes about needing to set up a 409K. Democratic congressman Adam Smith, the chairman of the House armed services committee, walked back his comments this morning about Nancy Pelosi transmitting the articles of impeachment. Smith said this morning that he believed the time had come for the House speaker to send the articles to the Senate. \u201cI think it was perfectly advisable for the speaker to leverage that, get a better deal,\u201d Smith told CNN. \u201cAt this point, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen, and yes, I think it is time to send the impeachment to the Senate, and let Mitch McConnell be responsible for the fairness of the trial. He ultimately is.\u201d Another House Democrat, freshman Ben McAdams of Utah, has joined the growing chorus of lawmakers saying it\u2019s time for Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment. Pelosi has previously shown a high level of concern for freshman lawmakers like McAdams, who will face difficult reelection races later this year. Asked about Democratic congressman Adam Smith\u2019s comments this morning on transmitting the articles of impeachment, Nancy Pelosi offered no comment. Smith, the chairman of the armed services committee, told CNN this morning that he believed the time had come to send the articles to the Senate. Pelosi has a press conference scheduled for 10:45 a.m. ET, where she will likely address her timeline for transmitting the articles. Some Senate Democrats have said they think it\u2019s time for House speaker Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, she should send them over. I don\u2019t see what good delay does,\u201d senator Dianne Feinstein said. Senator Chris Murphy predicted the impeachment trial would soon get underway. \u201cMy expectation is that we\u2019ll be able to start this trial next week,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe leverage over Republicans exists in the votes we take inside the trial.\u201d And senator Joe Manchin similarly said it was time to send over the articles, but he said Pelosi\u2019s delay strategy had at lease one success, pointing to former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s statement about his willingness to testify if subpoenaed. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell again made clear yesterday that he had no intention of allowing Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to delay sending the articles of impeachment to affect the parameters of the Senate trial. The Senate leader reportedly met with Trump yesterday to discuss the looming impeachment trial. CNN reports: McConnell, one of the sources said, walked Trump through the trial format and discussed how Senate Republicans were reacting to the developments around the trial. McConnell was at the White House to introduce Trump to a judge, and later the Senate leader and the President met privately. The senator from Kentucky has not shared with the White House the text of the resolution that would set up the trial, according to one of the sources, who insists there\u2019s no negotiation with the GOP leader\u2019s office on how the language should be drafted. Democrats have previously complained about improper coordination between the White House and McConnell\u2019s office as the Senate moves toward the impeachment trial, and this meeting with Trump will only intensify those gripes. Good morning, live blog readers! House speaker Nancy Pelosi is coming under increasing pressure to transmit the articles of impeachment, as even some of her own Democratic caucus members say it\u2019s time to advance the issue to the Senate. Democratic congressman Adam Smith, the chair of the armed services committee, said this morning that he thought the time had come to send the articles to the Senate. \u201cI think it was perfectly advisable for the speaker to leverage that, get a better deal,\u201d Smith told CNN. \u201cAt this point, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen, and yes, I think it is time to send the impeachment to the Senate, and let Mitch McConnell be responsible for the fairness of the trial. He ultimately is.\u201d Pelosi will hold her weekly press conference later this morning, which could provide some clues on when the Senate might be able to hold a trial on whether to remove Donald Trump from office. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will announce proposed National Environmental Policy Act regulations and receive his intelligence briefing before traveling to Toledo, Ohio, for a campaign rally alongside Pence. The House will vote on a resolution to limit Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. Joe Biden is campaigning in California, touring the Gerald Desmond Bridge Replacement Project in Long Beach and holding a fundraiser. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

Just the same, they can enter parliament.\u201d Lai is part of a group of five young, unorthodox candidates running for legislative seats in Taiwan\u2019s general election on Saturday, in which incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen is seeking reelection against her main opponent, Han Kuo-yu, of the Kuomintang party (KMT). Some like to think of them as the \u201cTaiwanese Squad\u201d, after the four US congresswomen elected in 2018. The election, which sees voters choose their next president as well as their legislative representatives, has implications for regional security, ties with China and the US, as well as the future of the functionally independent country home to 23 million people that Beijing says is an inalienable part of China, despite the fact that the Chinese Communist party has never ruled the island. Lai\u2019s group \u2013 a coalition known as Democracy frontline, or qianxian, \u201cfrontline\u201d \u2013 includes Freddy Lim, a death metal musician and lawmaker, Enoch Wu, a former special forces officer who was previously an investment banker, Chen Bo-wei, once a movie producer, as well as Hung Tzu-Yung, a marketing executive who got into politics after her army corporal brother died in 2013, causing mass protests over abuses in the military. Lai was a prominent activist in the 2014 youth-led Sunflower movement against a trade deal with China where she was arrested after chaining herself to other protesters to block traffic. She is also well known for cosplay, dressing up as anime characters. They are popular, often appearing in memes and viral videos, and known for their activism and socially liberal views. Lev Nachman, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Irvine, who focuses on Taiwan, says: \u201cThe biggest thing that makes them similar to the Squad is they are progressive in a way that\u2019s so radically different from what we think of when we imagine what a Taiwanese politician looks like. They are the young progressive faces that a lot of Taiwanese have been looking for.\u201d All five, either independent, third party or members of Tsai\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), are calling for protection of Taiwan\u2019s independence and oppose unification with China, something Chinese leader Xi Jinping has said is \u201cinevitable\u201d, to be achieved by all means necessary, including force. Lai and her colleagues are part of broader efforts by the DPP, civil society groups and others to mobilise young voters \u2013 a generation sometimes described as tianrandu, the \u201cnaturally independent\u201d born after the mid-1980s and who came of age in a democratic and economically stable Taiwan. Previous generations lived through almost four decades of martial law under the Kuomintang, who fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the communists in 1949, and set up a rival Chinese government. Taiwan had previously been a Japanese colony until 1945. Martial law ended in 1987 and Taiwan has since become one of the most competitive democracies in the region. Tsai, facing off against Han, the populist plainspoken mayor of Kaohsiung, is depending on younger voters to help repair losses her party suffered in 2018 mid-term elections. After years of watching surveillance and repression increase in China, including months of police cracking down on protesters in Hong Kong whose one country two systems model is meant to be a model for Taiwan, younger Taiwanese tend to lean toward Tsai. They see her as better able to protect Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, compared with the explicitly pro-China KMT, which advocates for closer economic cooperation and trade. \u201cThe role of young people [in this election] is incredibly important,\u201d says Wu Jieh-min, a sociologist at Academica Sinica, noting that Tsai will need them to contest Han. \u201cHan\u2019s supporters are older and their turnout is higher and their intensity is stronger,\u201d he said. New voters between the ages of 20 and 23 make about 6% of Taiwan\u2019s eligible electorate, a proportion large enough to help tip the election for Tsai or secure the hold of pan-green parties, those allied with the DPP, over parliament. But older voters make up the largest voting bloc and voter turnout has traditionally been lowest among younger people. In the 2016 election, average turnout of those between the ages of 20 and 39 was 58%, but 70% for those in their 50s and 74% for those 60 or older, according to data from the Central Election Commission. The Frontline cohort also represents a generation of young Taiwanese who want to move beyond the question of independence to address social issues. Kevin Zhou, 27, who works in Taipei, says: \u201cMy parents\u2019 generation grew up when the political environment was more restrictive. Having enough to eat was what was important. \u201cBut my generation grew up at a stable time. We care about public issues beyond the economy, such as the environment, and gender.\u201d Frontline candidates, several of whom have activist backgrounds, have pushed for same-sex marriage, indigenous rights, and reforms aimed at young people such as lowering the voting age from 20 to 18. Freddy Lim has called for more work to investigate abuses during the era of martial law. Hung Tzu-Yung is running in Taichung and has campaigned on policies to improve air quality and child welfare. Enoch Wu is running in Taipei against the great-grandson of the KMT general and leader Chiang Kai-shek, and has made military reform a key pledge. For Lai, who has called for improved transportation links and elderly care, the point is to align with lawmakers of the same social values in a political landscape where the two main parties are not defined by liberal or conservative policies, so much as by their stance on China and statehood. \u201cI belong to the DPP but can this party or every member always have the same values or position as me? Not necessarily, because this is a big party. The good thing about Frontline is that at the very least, the few of us share very similar values. If we are all elected, we can work together and push proposals,\u201d she says. \u201cFor so long in political circles, we have not had young people\u2019s voices. So us getting into office \u2026 and representing different communities is really important.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and William Yang",

      "body": "<p>Once in a generation, a musical becomes a cultural phenomenon. When Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Hamilton landed in New York, it joined the story-focused Oklahoma, the rock opera Hair, the highbrow, complicated Company and, yes, even the box office-smashing spectacle of Cats in breaking the form open and changing its course.</p> <p>Hamilton, with its revisionist history, contemporary storytelling and referential hip-hop score quickly became a milestone genre work \u2013 and just a few years later, musical theatre creators are already taking a leaf out of its book.</p> <p>Six, the West End hit whose Australian production opened in Sydney last night \u2013 a month ahead of the show\u2019s upcoming Broadway debut \u2013 is one of the first true post-Hamilton musicals. Only this time the reclamation of history is for the women we\u2019ve dismissed, or judged as villains.</p> <p>The musical comes in a decade which has seen Monica Lewinsky, Lorena Bobbitt and Marcia Clark each seize and reframe their own stories, but in Six we go back 500 years further, as the wives of Henry VIII take the floor. Their marriages were bloody, messy, church-reforming, and pored over by gossipy historians \u2013 but this time they\u2019re telling their stories, their way: with a live performance contest starring the hottest pop ghost-girl group you\u2019ve ever seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0d0bb56c936ed33d786fea4dadf6d16990119b09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d0bb56c936ed33d786fea4dadf6d16990119b09/0_0_3712_5568/667.jpg\" alt=\"Chlo\u00e9 Zuel as Catherine of Aragon\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When each take the spotlight and go solo, the audience just about loses their minds\u2019: Chlo\u00e9 Zuel as Catherine of Aragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James D Morgan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They are Fifth Harmony, sure \u2013 singing together with tight sounds and tighter choreography \u2013 but all six are also that group\u2019s breakout star Normani: when each get their moment to take the spotlight and go solo, the audience just about loses their minds. And like Hamilton\u2019s deep cut homages to R&amp;B artists (and Normani\u2019s, for that matter), they do it by remixing, referencing and shouting out the women of pop. Come for the Spice Girls easter eggs, stay for the Geensleeves ones.</p> <p>Written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss \u2013 who have also written for Australia\u2019s pre-eminent singing drag queen Courtney Act \u2013 Six takes the proto-feminism of Hamilton\u2019s women along with the populist feminism of the 2010s, and folds them into a bright, short and snappy musical revue that sees the Queens go from competing with to supporting one another. This happens via often funny and occasionally moving musical numbers that are drenched with a love for pure pop, royal history, and giving women their due.</p> <p>The show is a viral hit with musical theatre\u2019s young fanbase \u2013 it\u2019s the second-most streamed cast album in the world \u2013 and in Sydney, at the Opera House no less, that bright musical theatre-pop still manages to sound cool.

      "bodyText": "Once in a generation, a musical becomes a cultural phenomenon. When Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Hamilton landed in New York, it joined the story-focused Oklahoma, the rock opera Hair, the highbrow, complicated Company and, yes, even the box office-smashing spectacle of Cats in breaking the form open and changing its course. Hamilton, with its revisionist history, contemporary storytelling and referential hip-hop score quickly became a milestone genre work \u2013 and just a few years later, musical theatre creators are already taking a leaf out of its book. Six, the West End hit whose Australian production opened in Sydney last night \u2013 a month ahead of the show\u2019s upcoming Broadway debut \u2013 is one of the first true post-Hamilton musicals. Only this time the reclamation of history is for the women we\u2019ve dismissed, or judged as villains. The musical comes in a decade which has seen Monica Lewinsky, Lorena Bobbitt and Marcia Clark each seize and reframe their own stories, but in Six we go back 500 years further, as the wives of Henry VIII take the floor. Their marriages were bloody, messy, church-reforming, and pored over by gossipy historians \u2013 but this time they\u2019re telling their stories, their way: with a live performance contest starring the hottest pop ghost-girl group you\u2019ve ever seen. They are Fifth Harmony, sure \u2013 singing together with tight sounds and tighter choreography \u2013 but all six are also that group\u2019s breakout star Normani: when each get their moment to take the spotlight and go solo, the audience just about loses their minds. And like Hamilton\u2019s deep cut homages to R&amp;B artists (and Normani\u2019s, for that matter), they do it by remixing, referencing and shouting out the women of pop. Come for the Spice Girls easter eggs, stay for the Geensleeves ones. Written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss \u2013 who have also written for Australia\u2019s pre-eminent singing drag queen Courtney Act \u2013 Six takes the proto-feminism of Hamilton\u2019s women along with the populist feminism of the 2010s, and folds them into a bright, short and snappy musical revue that sees the Queens go from competing with to supporting one another. This happens via often funny and occasionally moving musical numbers that are drenched with a love for pure pop, royal history, and giving women their due. The show is a viral hit with musical theatre\u2019s young fanbase \u2013 it\u2019s the second-most streamed cast album in the world \u2013 and in Sydney, at the Opera House no less, that bright musical theatre-pop still manages to sound cool. We can thank the band for that \u2013 led by musical director Claire Healy on keys, with Ali Foster on drums, Debbie Yap on guitar, and Jessica Dunn on bass \u2013 who find the dirty, hot fun in the score and elevate it. Tim Deiling\u2019s lighting is explosively colourful, and Gabriella Slade\u2019s costumes, which remix Tudor finery into sequinned performance gear, are a delight. But you come for the Queens, and these queens do not disappoint.

Six is constantly at risk of sliding into syrup: its feminist message is the lightest and most easily consumable one possible, some of the lyrics and lines are a little heavy handed, and the whole thing is so music-forward that the brief dialogue scenes threaten its collapse.

      "bodyText": "A report into the death of university student Mason Pendrous \u2013 and the month-long delay in discovering his body in his dormitory \u2013 has called for better pastoral care of vulnerable first-year students amid a rise in isolation and reliance on online rather than face-to-face interaction. The 19-year-old e-commerce student was found on 23 September in his dorm room at Canterbury university, Christchurch. Pendrous had been dead for a month, New Zealand police said, and his father has expressed anguish that his son\u2019s absence was not noted from university classes, tutorials or meals. Former high court Judge Kit Toogood was commissioned by the university to investigate the substantial delay in discovering Pendrous\u2019 body. Toogood was not tasked with investigating how and why Pendrous died, and a coronial investigation last year was inconclusive due to the state of decomposition. In the months before his death Pendrous withdrew into his room, staying up on his computer all night and sleeping during the day, Toogood found. He skipped meals and disengaged from his university studies, isolating himself and withdrawing from friends and acquaintances. A 2017 restructure and the closing of the reception area at the Sonoda residence meant there has been no Campus Living Villages (CLV) staff member routinely present throughout the day. A staff member on site might have meant they had more contact with Pendrous \u201cwhether he welcomed it or not\u201d, Toogood said. From interviews with students, Toogood discovered many students were spending increasing amounts of time alone in their rooms, as the number of online lectures boomed, and they chose to socialise on their computer rather than in person. This made it difficult for students, university staff and accomodation providers to build rapport and trust, and meant wellbeing issues could be missed, Toogood found. The principal reason for the delay in discovering Pendrous\u2019 death was that his absence from 26 August to the 23 September 2019 was not noticed by any fellow Sonoda resident, or by CLV staff. Primary factors contributing to this were the closure of the reception at Sonoda in 2018, the absence of regular room checks, Pendrous\u2019 decision to stay in his room for \u201cextreme periods\u201d and not socialise with other residents, and the lack of face-to-face contact between staff and students. Toogood recommended student living providers place more emphasis on face-to-face interaction between students and staff, require students tell the facility if they plan an extended break away, and do weekly room checks. In response the University of Canterbury said it plans to introduce a buddy system for first-year students, boost orientation programmes, and introduce an early warning system to be activated when students start disengaging from classes and tutorials. Following Pendrous\u2019 death the New Zealand government created a new offence that makes serious breaches of student pastoral care punishable by a fine of up to NZ$100,000 (\u00a350,000). Education minister Chris Hipkins said his death had \u201cexposed the limitation of our current system\u201d. \u201cHalls and hostels charge a premium for their accommodation and parents have every right to expect a high level of care for their sons and daughters \u2026 students should also be assured that there are minimum standards of safety and that there is support available to them if they need it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Police want a ban on the anonymous purchase of pay-as-you-go mobile phones to help tackle county lines drug dealers, a report reveals. The report by the police inspectorate says criminals get round laws meant to restrict their activities by being able to buy phones or sim cards without the need to prove their identity. Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary in the report on the law enforcement response to county lines says the government should start a review. As part of county lines, phone lines are set up by drugs gangs for users to call and also involves urban drug gangs operating in smaller towns and rural areas to boost their profits. Like the rest of Britain\u2019s drugs trade it relies on exploiting vulnerable youngsters and sometimes extreme violence. The report reveals that laws to restrict mobile phone use by suspected drugs criminals are barely being used because they are difficult to enact and criminals find it easy to get round. The police inspectorate said: \u201cInterviewees told us that county lines organisers are likely to keep lists of their customers\u2019 contact details so they can simply transfer them to a replacement phone. \u201cIt is easy for anyone (including drug dealers) to anonymously get a replacement mobile phone and number through \u2018pay as you go\u2019 services. We were told of one example where a county lines network received and shared a new number within an hour of the service provider acting on the order.\u201d For the report inspectors talked to police officers and others trying to combat county lines. One solution was offered up by police: \u201cInterviewees often suggested that people should have to register personal details when buying a mobile phone or replacement sim card. \u201cThose seeking to open a bank account must present official documents to prove their identity first. This safeguard makes it harder for criminals to launder money or commit fraud.\u201d HMIC said: \u201cThe present arrangements that enable criminality by allowing the anonymous acquisition of phones and numbers, should be re-examined.\u201d One flaw in any crackdown would be criminals moving to internet phone services via Skype or WhatsApp, which are encrypted. Law-abiding people who prefer contract-less mobile phones would be inconvenienced. Elsewhere, the report says police need to be more joined up in tackling county lines with the 43 forces in England and Wales needing to improve how they share information and work together. The report said in some cases vulnerable children were placed on trains on their own after being caught by police away from where they live, and sent back to their home area. The report also said that school exclusions expose children to exploitation, and in one case an excluded child settled into a new school where he then tried to recruit other children into county lines. The truth is that police rely on other public services to help protect children, such as social services, which are overwhelmed by demand and cuts from austerity. HMIC\u2019s chief inspector, Sir Tom Winsor, said social workers are dealing with enormous caseloads and the state has not got enough resources for services to protect the vulnerable, who are preyed on by drug dealers. \u201cChildren\u2019s services are under extraordinary strain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would require an enormous devotion of resources of the state \u2013 not just talking about the police, but social services, housing, etc, to protect every child.\u201d Mark Russell, the chief executive at the Children\u2019s Society, said: \u201cToo many children experiencing horrific criminal exploitation through county lines continue to be let down by the frontline services best placed to protect them.\u201d The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for county lines, deputy assistant commissioner, Graham McNulty, said: \u201cWe know there is room to improve and the report has outlined some areas which we are already working towards.\u201d He said police were \u201creviewing the use of orders that can disable a dealer\u2019s phone\u201d.",

Just seven extra shops may seem like a small victory, but this year-on-year increase comes after more than 20 years of decline and marks the third consecutive year of growth.

Around 3,700 state schools in England will be affected by the rule change, which the DfE said underlined the government\u2019s view that school inspection \u201cserves a vital purpose\u201d in improving standards. \u201cParents want to know that they are making the best, most informed choices about their children\u2019s education. Making sure that all schools are regularly inspected means they will benefit from the expert insight Ofsted provides when making these decisions,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cWe know parents trust Ofsted \u2013 and with good reason. It serves a valuable purpose as the only organisation that gives a clear, accessible and impartial view on school and college performance. \u201cBut it\u2019s also far more than that \u2013 it\u2019s a driver of improvement. Although we continue to trust our best schools and colleges to get on with the job of educating, without Ofsted standards would go unchecked and the exemption meant there is often not an up-to-date picture.\u201d The changes are subject to a formal consultation launched by the DfE, with the proposals subject to parliamentary approval. The DfE said the schools that have gone the longest without inspection will be Ofsted\u2019s top priority. During last year\u2019s election campaign the Conservatives also pledged to make all Ofsted inspections no-notice, as well as extending the length of full inspections from two to three days, with the extra time used to examine \u201cbehaviour, bullying and a school\u2019s extracurricular offer,\u201d including sport. Duncan Baldwin, deputy director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents many secondary school heads, said the union supported the change. \u201cThe policy of exempting them from the normal inspection cycle was well-intentioned and safeguards were built into the system in the event of there being concerns at a school or college. \u201cHowever, it has resulted in parents going too long without the verification of an inspection at a number of schools and colleges, and it is time to reverse the policy,\u201d Baldwin said. Last year the National Audit Office found that hundreds of schools have not been inspected in the past eight years, and nearly 300 had not been inspected for a decade. During the 2018-19 academic year Ofsted upped its inspections of outstanding schools, after a request from ministers. Of the 382 schools inspected, only 63 retained their outstanding rating, while 89 were classed as requiring improvement and 19 were inadequate.",

Both Barcelona and Liverpool passed over his services, choosing instead to turn to Pep Guardiola and Rafa Ben\u00edtez, by little consequence two managers he has most enjoyed getting the better of. Only recently arrived at Tottenham, his latest club are near powerless to stop Liverpool\u2019s procession to the Premier League title, save for performing the unlikely act of ending the leaders\u2019 unbeaten run. To do so would be one of the shocks of the season. Where Liverpool have suffered a fair share of injuries, with James Milner\u2019s muscle injury adding to a shortfall in midfield, Tottenham are completely riven, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/07/tottenham-moussa-sissoko-out-april-knee-surgery-mourinho-injury-list\">Moussa Sissoko out until April</a> and Tanguy Ndombele succumbed to a hip injury that in the words of Mourinho offers \u201cno continuity in his development\u201d.

Mings\u2019s return to fitness has made Villa more solid, as has Dean Smith\u2019s decision to switch to a back three, which has the added merit of freeing up Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert to attack more down the right. \u201cI like it, I think I\u2019ve got what it takes physically to go up and down so the system suits me well,\u201d said Guilbert after scoring at Leicester. \u201cWhen we press [in this system] we\u2019re quite high, so we can cause danger very quickly when we win the ball ... we\u2019re trying to make the team more solid overall and we hope that will help us gain as many points as possible.

The teenager had barely played a senior match at his previous clubs (Braga and a loan spell at Lazio) before arriving at Wolves last summer but, having got up to speed with life at Molineux, he has started his team\u2019s past two Premier League matches and made a big impact in both. Beyond scoring in each game (even if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/liverpool-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">his strike at Liverpool</a> was expunged by VAR at its most pernickety), the fast and tricky 19-year-old has been full of menace on the left wing.

In their fifth season in the Premier League, Bournemouth have never been as low after 21 games as the 18th place they will kick off Sunday\u2019s match in. Eddie Howe\u2019s teams have usually got most of the dirty work done by now, but Christmas was harrowing for them. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t look like a team, which is the worrying thing,\u201d said the defender Steve Cook after the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/west-ham-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\"> 4-0 defeat on New Year\u2019s Day at West Ham</a>. Watford, revived by Nigel Pearson\u2019s back-to-basics approach, are just the sort of opposition that Howe\u2019s team have struggled against. That London Stadium loss continued an unfortunate habit of losing to the clubs they are competing with to avoid the drop; Newcastle, Burnley, Brighton have also taken three points from them.

      "bodyText": "1) Can depleted Spurs cope with Liverpool? Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s life in football can be measured out in vendettas. There are two clubs he reserves a special enmity for, and for much the same reason. Both Barcelona and Liverpool passed over his services, choosing instead to turn to Pep Guardiola and Rafa Ben\u00edtez, by little consequence two managers he has most enjoyed getting the better of. Only recently arrived at Tottenham, his latest club are near powerless to stop Liverpool\u2019s procession to the Premier League title, save for performing the unlikely act of ending the leaders\u2019 unbeaten run. To do so would be one of the shocks of the season. Where Liverpool have suffered a fair share of injuries, with James Milner\u2019s muscle injury adding to a shortfall in midfield, Tottenham are completely riven, with Moussa Sissoko out until April and Tanguy Ndombele succumbed to a hip injury that in the words of Mourinho offers \u201cno continuity in his development\u201d. And, crucially, there will be no Harry Kane, a huge loss for a manager with such a tactical reliance on centre-forwards, and no obvious replacement within a squad he already appears dissatisfied with. JB \u2022 Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool (Saturday, 5.30pm, all times GMT) 2) Mutual admiration society at Bramall Lane While several clubs deal with midwinter injury crises, Chris Wilder declared this week that at Sheffield United \u201ceverybody is fit and ready to go\u201d, an achievement as remarkable as any in what has been an astonishingly successful reintroduction to the top flight. Bramall Lane should be the site of a managerial mutual appreciation society, with David Moyes praising Wilder\u2019s path to the top (though mainly for being not dissimilar to his own) \u2013 \u201cI quite enjoy seeing managers who have to earn their stripes, prove themselves in the lower leagues, and then they move up\u201d \u2013 and Wilder doing likewise in return: \u201cHis record, from Preston to Everton, was incredible. For the vast majority of his career he\u2019s been hugely successful and they\u2019re definitely a different proposition with David Moyes in charge\u201d. SB \u2022 Sheffield United v West Ham United (Friday, 8pm) 3) What are Everton made of? The humiliating elimination from the FA Cup by Liverpool\u2019s reserves proved to be the last straw for a posse of Everton fans, who turned up at the club\u2019s training ground this week to give players and staff some forthright feedback. How will the players react to all that? And how will Carlo Ancelotti respond to the flop at Anfield, other than by scouring the transfer market even more frantically than before? Everton\u2019s lineup and attitude will be revelatory on Saturday when they face Brighton, who are one point below them in the table, have spent far less than Everton and have a much clearer idea of what they are doing. PD \u2022 Everton v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (Saturday, 3pm) 4) Vardy v Ings another appetising battle of strikers Having been thrashed 9-0 by Leicester at home in October, Southampton will be motivated by revenge but fearful of further failure. Still, there is hope: the Foxes may only have lost this season to Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool, but they did draw at home against Norwich last month and against a weakened, striker-less Aston Villa on Wednesday, when they kept possession well but were largely muted in the final third. Besides, as Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl says, his team now \u201clooks completely different\u201d and \u201care in a different moment\u201d. Wednesday\u2019s match saw James Maddison and Jack Grealish come head to head in the battle of in-form English midfielders vying for Gareth Southgate\u2019s affection; this one sees Jamie Vardy and Danny Ings meet in the battle of in-form English strikers. SB \u2022 Leicester City v Southampton (Saturday, 3pm) 5) Stricken Villa still up for battle Aston Villa have had rotten luck with injuries but can also count blessings as they prepare to host Manchester City on Sunday. The goalkeeper Orjan Nyland again filled in well for the stricken Tom Heaton in Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup draw at Leicester, where Tyrone Mings performed even better. Mings\u2019s return to fitness has made Villa more solid, as has Dean Smith\u2019s decision to switch to a back three, which has the added merit of freeing up Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert to attack more down the right. \u201cI like it, I think I\u2019ve got what it takes physically to go up and down so the system suits me well,\u201d said Guilbert after scoring at Leicester. \u201cWhen we press [in this system] we\u2019re quite high, so we can cause danger very quickly when we win the ball ... we\u2019re trying to make the team more solid overall and we hope that will help us gain as many points as possible.

He was making the point that modern management is a much altered beast since Sir Alex Ferguson was launching hairdryers around The Cliff training ground, but that had the unfortunate byproduct of reminding us that the past continues to be a foreign country for Manchester United. It could never be 1999 forever but the new year has got off to a horrendous start, and just when there had been signs of revival during December. Tuesday\u2019s Carabao Cup footballing lesson from Manchester City was chastening, and it appeared the last place a befuddled Solskj\u00e6r wanted to be post-match was at Manchester United in 2020. A home defeat to Norwich in a 3pm kick-off, the type of fixture United gobbled up in the late 20th century, and terminal velocity for the Norwegian might soon be reached. JB \u2022 Manchester United v Norwich City (Saturday, 3pm) 8) Chelsea\u2019s home form remains a reason for concern Chelsea\u2019s away record this season is the same as Leicester\u2019s and inferior only to Liverpool\u2019s, but the 14 points they have won at home is the same as Aston Villa and only one more than Watford \u2013 and that\u2019s with Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester United and Manchester City to come.

Chelsea were, however, dominant in the reverse fixture, winning 4-2 thanks to a Christian Pulisic hat-trick, a game which came in a six-game Premier League winning streak bookended by 2-1 defeats against Liverpool and Manchester City. SB \u2022 Chelsea v Burnley (Saturday, 3pm) 9) Wolves benefit from Neto gains The only good thing about Diogo Jota\u2019s absence through injury is that it most likely means we will see a lot more of the hugely promising Pedro Neto. The teenager had barely played a senior match at his previous clubs (Braga and a loan spell at Lazio) before arriving at Wolves last summer but, having got up to speed with life at Molineux, he has started his team\u2019s past two Premier League matches and made a big impact in both. Beyond scoring in each game (even if his strike at Liverpool was expunged by VAR at its most pernickety), the fast and tricky 19-year-old has been full of menace on the left wing. At Watford on New Year\u2019s Day he was even more dangerous than Adama Traor\u00e9, Wolves\u2019 wideman on the other side. Newcastle\u2019s defence best be aware that they face serious threats on both flanks this weekend. PD \u2022 Wolverhampton Wanderers v Newcastle United (Saturday, 3pm) 10) Bournemouth can\u2019t afford to lose to relegation rivals again Worries about Bournemouth would deepen further if they were to lose to Watford, and be leapfrogged in the league table by resurgent Watford. In their fifth season in the Premier League, Bournemouth have never been as low after 21 games as the 18th place they will kick off Sunday\u2019s match in. Eddie Howe\u2019s teams have usually got most of the dirty work done by now, but Christmas was harrowing for them. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t look like a team, which is the worrying thing,\u201d said the defender Steve Cook after the 4-0 defeat on New Year\u2019s Day at West Ham. Watford, revived by Nigel Pearson\u2019s back-to-basics approach, are just the sort of opposition that Howe\u2019s team have struggled against. That London Stadium loss continued an unfortunate habit of losing to the clubs they are competing with to avoid the drop; Newcastle, Burnley, Brighton have also taken three points from them. In the next month that sequence must be broken if Bournemouth are to survive; Norwich, Brighton and Aston Villa await them. JB \u2022 Bournemouth v Watford (Sunday, 2pm)",

      "bodyText": "The cost of maintaining three nuclear sites spiralled by \u00a31.35bn because of poor management by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Whitehall\u2019s watchdog has found. The National Audit Office has also said that work to complete the building and maintenance of the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent in Cumbria, Derbyshire and Berkshire will also be completed more than six years later than planned. In a damning conclusion to a report released on Friday, auditors said the MoD has failed to learn from past mistakes while upgrading the UK\u2019s nuclear defence capabilities. Civil servants have relied on the work of three monopolistic suppliers \u2013 the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Rolls Royce and BAE Systems \u2013 which means that contracts cannot be terminated if poor performance is identified, the report said. Nearly half of the extra costs \u2013 \u00a3647m \u2013 has been put down to the revision of work which was launched without proper plans. The findings follow confirmation that Dominic Cummings is seeking to launch a review of the MoD\u2019s spending strategy following concerns that it has wasted billions over misjudged procurement. The ministry was given a \u00a32.2bn increase in funds in September\u2019s spending review. In February, parliament\u2019s public accounts committee identified a \u00a37bn blackhole in its 10-year plan for equipment. Auditors examined three programmes within the nuclear enterprise programme to replace ageing facilities, some dating back to the 1950s. They were the construction of a new nuclear warhead assembly facility in Burghfield, Berkshire; the erection of a new nuclear core production facility in Raynesway, Derbyshire; and the construction of a facility at the BAE shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness. While the three projects were valued at \u00a32.5bn, auditors found that costs had risen by \u00a31.35bn with delays running at between 1.7 and 6.3 years. The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the report found. They included \u201cstarting to build before requirements or designs were sufficiently mature, increasing risks through inappropriate contracts and failing to engage with regulators to understand requirements\u201d. Similar problems had also been encountered in UK civil nuclear projects and US defence programmes, but the NAO said it had found no evidence of lessons being shared or learned. Among the specific problems highlighted, auditors said delays to project Mensa \u2013 the Burghfield scheme \u2013 had meant the MoD had to spend an additional \u00a321m to keep existing facilities going. Some of the work was subjected to specific and expensive designs, sometimes referred to as \u201cgold-plating\u201d, the report said. This forced costs up but could not be challenged because the MoD and the site operators struggled to recruit staff able to challenge complex demands by regulators. \u201cThroughout our study, the department, regulators and site operators all considered it had occurred and remained a potential risk,\u201d it said. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cWhile these infrastructure projects are complex, the MoD has encountered similar challenges before in its nuclear work. \u201cAlthough it has recently introduced changes to enhance its oversight of the projects and improve its contracts with suppliers, it should have learnt earlier from past mistakes and the experience of others in the nuclear sector. \u201cInstead, the MoD\u2019s failure to mitigate commercial and delivery risks early on has led to project delays and cost increases, as well as impacting its wider work.\u201d An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cAs the National Audit Office has acknowledged, nuclear infrastructure projects are often large and complex with niche designs.
