      "bodyText": "Anthony Albanese has described the decision to recommit to a 45% emissions reduction target by 2030 as \u201ca mistake\u201d and declared Labor would not take the same franking credits policy to the next election. In comments to Sky News on Sunday, Albanese confirmed Labor had repositioned by dumping its 2016 election commitments since \u201cour policies aren\u2019t there until we announce them proactively, positively\u201d. Albanese promised Labor would \u201ctake climate change seriously\u201d and had a \u201cvery strong\u201d policy that aimed to be \u201cas ambitious as possible\u201d but did not commit to outbid the Coalition because he hoped the Morrison government would take action before the next election. Albanese said that after the 2016 election, Labor had \u201cadded on policies \u2013 everything stayed the same and we just added more on \u2026 [which] doesn\u2019t end well\u201d. The Labor leader suggested he would avoid that mistake by having a proper shadow cabinet and caucus process to determine new policies before the next election, which he expected to fall between October 2021 and March 2022. The 45% emissions reduction target was first adopted by Shorten\u2019s opposition in 2015 and was Labor\u2019s policy at both the 2016 and 2019 federal election, which Labor lost despite a record number of Australians nominating global warming or the environment as their top concern. The shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, has suggested copying the Coalition\u2019s target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030, but the climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, has rejected the idea. On Sunday, Albanese backed Butler\u2019s position by saying Labor\u2019s policy would be \u201cvery strong\u201d and \u201cas ambitious as possible\u201d. Albanese said Scott Morrison was correct that Australia \u201cneeds the whole world to act\u201d on climate change, but Australia was \u201cnot only [not] doing anything domestically, but on the world stage we\u2019re a handbrake\u201d. Albanese said that at the most recent climate talks in Madrid \u2013 at which Australia argued for use of Kyoto carryover credits to meet 2030 targets \u2013 the energy minister, Angus Taylor, had positioned Australia as \u201cone of the recalcitrants \u2026 arguing for less action\u201d. \u201cThe government says \u2018oh we\u2019re going to meet our emissions [targets]\u2019 \u2013 the lie of that was exposed by the fact that they went to Madrid and argued for an accounting trick.\u201d Albanese said that when Labor set its 45% target in 2015, it was a 15-year target, suggesting that \u201cin 2022 our 15-year target would be very different\u201d. He said climate change was one area where Labor is \u201clikely \u2026 to announce a longer term target\u201d before it releases a full policy. \u201cWe\u2019ll make our announcements at an appropriate time,\u201d he said. \u201cTo an AFL analogy: it\u2019s a four-quarter game between 2019 and 2022. You\u2019re asking me how it will play out in the final quarter \u2013 you\u2019ve got to know what the three-quarter time score is first. \u201cFrankly, I think it was a mistake in 2019 to continue to say \u2018well we\u2019ll do exactly what we\u2019re doing in 2015\u2019, as if [the task] hadn\u2019t changed.\u201d Asked why he didn\u2019t promise to do more than the Coalition, Albanese replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to be generous to them \u2013 hopefully they\u2019ll wake up tomorrow and say \u2018there\u2019s something in this climate change thing\u2019 and take action\u201d, suggesting he didn\u2019t want to let the Morrison government \u201coff the hook\u201d. On taxation policy, Albanese said that \u201cvery clearly we won\u2019t be taking the same policy\u201d on franking credits to the 2022 election, although he did not rule out grandfathering the policy so existing shareholders paying no tax can receive taxpayer-funded rebates while future shareholders miss out. Asked about whether Labor would abandon a high-taxing high-spending approach, Albanese replied: \u201cIf you have less revenue you will have less expenditure. Certainly, it\u2019s the case we intend to match up the two things.\u201d Albanese refused to commit to no new taxes, explaining that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t shy away from\u201d the fact \u201cin a civilised society\u201d taxes fund schools and hospitals. He said he believed in running surpluses but it \u201cdepends on the circumstances\u201d, arguing Labor was right to run a deficit to stimulate the economy during the global financial crisis but would have run a surplus if it had been in government this year. Labor has been urging the government to do more to stimulate the economy for months and the former prime minister and treasurer Paul Keating has suggested it should abandon the surplus to do so.",

You have to find solutions on the pitch and for that you need a clear mindset.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r believes his side are improving in confidence and awareness, and Klopp, too, thinks Sunday\u2019s opponents could be a force in the second part of the season. \u201cI think United will probably qualify for the Champions League,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was five points off that target I would be trying 100%. They have a really good team, the transfer window is still open and maybe they can bring in a couple of players who suit Ole\u2019s style of play, that is possible. They can beat us but they can only play as well as we let them play. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play as well as we could have in Manchester, but we can think about that for next season. Right now we only need to think how we do it here at Anfield. It\u2019s our stadium, our place, and we have to make sure everybody knows that before the first whistle. \u201cWe have to make sure we are at our best. If we are, then it\u2019s really difficult for anyone else.\u201d",

Nor does it herald a newfound unity or even an emerging national consensus.</p> <p>Recent events are better understood as resulting from the power of competing nationalisms: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/20/brexit-withdrawal-bill-whats-new-and-whats-different\" title=\"\">Brexit</a> nationalism, seeking national independence from Europe; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/14/boris-johnson-refuses-to-grant-scotland-powers-to-hold-independence-vote\" title=\"\">Scottish nationalism</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/plaid-cymru-election-could-spark-push-for-welsh-independence\" title=\"\">Welsh nationalism</a>; and Irish and Ulster nationalisms. The risk is that \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d is leaving Britain undone and, by destabilising the careful balance between the Irish and British identities in Northern Ireland, threatening the very existence of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>While each nationalism considers itself unique and incontrovertibly powerful, their rise owes far more to common problems shared in every part of the UK: anxieties about stagnating incomes, the rundown of manufacturing, insecure employment, poor-quality public services, boarded-up high streets, a lethal cocktail when combined with a strong sense of cultural loss and of a globalisation that seems akin to a train that has run out of control.</p> <p>How often do we hear people saying \u201cour country is not what it used to be\u201d and that \u201cit has changed beyond recognition\u201d? With that comes a breakdown in trust (\u201cthey\u2019re all out for themselves\u201d) and demands to \u201ctake back control\u201d, with both main parties seen as out of touch and easily accused of being patronising London elites who act as if the man in Whitehall still knows best.</p> <p>In this respect, last month\u2019s election result seems less like an enthusiastic endorsement of any party than a plea for radical change. The old postwar social contract, based on times when manufacturing, making a product in which you had pride, and mining which kept the nation\u2019s lights on, gave people dignity and respect, is seen as at breaking point, with each of its four pillars approaching collapse.</p> <p>First, for millions, work no longer pays. Second, no matter how hard many strive, opportunities for upward mobility seem limited. Parents no longer feel confident that the next generation will do as well as the last. Third, with boardroom excesses, a bankers\u2019 bonus culture and shocking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/23/a-tale-of-two-cities-londons-rich-and-poor-in-tower-hamlets\" title=\"\">inequalities in income</a>, top people\u2019s pay can never again be justified as the result of merit and hard work. Finally, our 75-year-old safety net looks threadbare when in every town and city child poverty and homelessness are rising and food banks, clothing banks, bedding banks, baby banks and other charities are substituting for a welfare state in retreat. All of this is magnified by the growing income and wealth gap between London and the north that is far more extreme than in almost every European nation and the US\u2019s richer and poorer states. There is an ever-widening divide in how people perceive their future: how, the further you are from the centre of power, the more you feel undervalued and unfairly treated. Only as NHS patients do people feel treated as equals, though there are increasing regional and social class disparities.</p> <p>This widespread and rising dissatisfaction is the context for today\u2019s populist nationalisms. The 19th- and 20th-century nationalism that underpinned anticolonial movements and the breakup of the imperial dynasties was driven by anger at cultural discrimination, political exclusion and the economic exploitation of one ethnic group by another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cb257dfd8f109bd3431c5e01a540749425d6803\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cb257dfd8f109bd3431c5e01a540749425d6803/0_1800_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman at a food bank in Northampton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman at a food bank in Northampton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the nationalisms we are now witnessing have different origins; at a time when class, religious and even local loyalties have become less salient, nationalists are successfully leveraging economic insecurity, cultural fears and an anti-politics sentiment. Yet none of these grievances can ever be answered by simply changing our borders or raising new flags \u2013 or by the act of leaving the European Union.</p> <p>Nationalism can exploit these injustices but it cannot end them.

      "bodyText": "If the United Kingdom is to survive, it will have to change fundamentally, so that Scotland does not secede and our regions can once again feel part of it. The shift in votes that gave the Conservatives an 80-seat majority does not signal a country at ease with itself or settling down to a post-Brexit stability. Nor does it herald a newfound unity or even an emerging national consensus. Recent events are better understood as resulting from the power of competing nationalisms: Brexit nationalism, seeking national independence from Europe; Scottish nationalism; Welsh nationalism; and Irish and Ulster nationalisms. The risk is that \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d is leaving Britain undone and, by destabilising the careful balance between the Irish and British identities in Northern Ireland, threatening the very existence of the United Kingdom. While each nationalism considers itself unique and incontrovertibly powerful, their rise owes far more to common problems shared in every part of the UK: anxieties about stagnating incomes, the rundown of manufacturing, insecure employment, poor-quality public services, boarded-up high streets, a lethal cocktail when combined with a strong sense of cultural loss and of a globalisation that seems akin to a train that has run out of control. How often do we hear people saying \u201cour country is not what it used to be\u201d and that \u201cit has changed beyond recognition\u201d? With that comes a breakdown in trust (\u201cthey\u2019re all out for themselves\u201d) and demands to \u201ctake back control\u201d, with both main parties seen as out of touch and easily accused of being patronising London elites who act as if the man in Whitehall still knows best. In this respect, last month\u2019s election result seems less like an enthusiastic endorsement of any party than a plea for radical change. The old postwar social contract, based on times when manufacturing, making a product in which you had pride, and mining which kept the nation\u2019s lights on, gave people dignity and respect, is seen as at breaking point, with each of its four pillars approaching collapse. First, for millions, work no longer pays. Second, no matter how hard many strive, opportunities for upward mobility seem limited. Parents no longer feel confident that the next generation will do as well as the last. Third, with boardroom excesses, a bankers\u2019 bonus culture and shocking inequalities in income, top people\u2019s pay can never again be justified as the result of merit and hard work. Finally, our 75-year-old safety net looks threadbare when in every town and city child poverty and homelessness are rising and food banks, clothing banks, bedding banks, baby banks and other charities are substituting for a welfare state in retreat. All of this is magnified by the growing income and wealth gap between London and the north that is far more extreme than in almost every European nation and the US\u2019s richer and poorer states. There is an ever-widening divide in how people perceive their future: how, the further you are from the centre of power, the more you feel undervalued and unfairly treated. Only as NHS patients do people feel treated as equals, though there are increasing regional and social class disparities. This widespread and rising dissatisfaction is the context for today\u2019s populist nationalisms. The 19th- and 20th-century nationalism that underpinned anticolonial movements and the breakup of the imperial dynasties was driven by anger at cultural discrimination, political exclusion and the economic exploitation of one ethnic group by another. But the nationalisms we are now witnessing have different origins; at a time when class, religious and even local loyalties have become less salient, nationalists are successfully leveraging economic insecurity, cultural fears and an anti-politics sentiment. Yet none of these grievances can ever be answered by simply changing our borders or raising new flags \u2013 or by the act of leaving the European Union. Nationalism can exploit these injustices but it cannot end them. While the Conservatives are the current beneficiaries of the revolt of the regions, their promise of a northern renaissance will have to mean more than love-bombing the regions with a few infrastructure projects and an airline rescue. Instead, we must deliver a radical alternative to nationalism. It must start with a plan to address economic insecurity. But it must also recognise that, in a multinational state that is asymmetric (83% of its voters lie in one nation) and where financial, political and administrative power is concentrated in just one city far to the south, the outlying nations and regions require new powers of initiative as decision-making centres \u2013 which, given our history as a unitary state, would be something akin to a British constitutional revolution. I would call a constitutional convention, preceded by region-by-region citizens\u2019 assemblies to listen closely to what communities are thinking and aspire to. But a start could be made with a forum of the nations and regions that will become essential if transferring decision-making powers out of Brussels is not to lead to even more centralisation in Whitehall, and could be a forerunner for a very different second chamber. The Treasury should also devolve decisions about the allocation of regional resources to new councils of the north and Midlands, comprising mayors, councillors and MPs. With proper financial backing, whether in research, science, technology, new industries or culture, cities and towns in every region \u2013 not just London \u2013 could become leaders for the UK, capitals in their own right. If the government won\u2019t act, the regions and nations should mobilise their collective power. For now, it is easy for a PM to prioritise the claims of the centre over any one area. But if Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England\u2019s regions come together as a pressure group for a \u201cBritain beyond the south-east\u201d, their demands could become irresistible and each would carve out a new role and status within the UK. When George Orwell made the distinction between patriots who love their country and nationalists who see life as a constant struggle between an \u201cus\u201d and a \u201cthem\u201d and invent enemies \u2013 and grievances \u2013 where none exist, he called for a \u201cmoral effort\u201d to defeat nationalist ideologies. In 2020, that means rediscovering the value of empathy and solidarity between nations and regions and the benefits that can flow from cooperation and sharing in pursuit of great causes: from jointly tackling climate change to offering the same floor of rights to universal health, social care and welfare services in every part of the UK. Only then will we start to prove that the United Kingdom is united by more than its name. \u2022 Gordon Brown was prime minister from 2007 to 2010",

A parliamentary inquiry into how to safeguard the UK\u2019s democratic processes from abuse advocates abolishing the \u00a320,000 cap on fines for breaking spending laws, a penalty considered so minor that some donors are believed to dismiss it as \u201cjust the cost of doing business\u201d. The suggestion is one of 20 recommendations in a landmark report from a cross-party group of MPs who point out that electoral law has not been properly updated since 2001 \u2013 when the internet was relatively undeveloped and long before the arrival of social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter. \u201cThe outdated nature of UK election law has pitched us into a battle for the very soul of our democracy,\u201d said the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, the group\u2019s chair. The all-party parliamentary group on electoral campaigning transparency was formed last year to act on the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The data firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook profiles without consent and used it for political advertising purposes. The Observer story on the scandal was a watershed moment in the public\u2019s awareness of personal data and prompted global demands for tighter regulation of tech companies. Kinnock added: \u201cFacebook and other digital giants now play a hugely significant role in our elections and referendums, but most of the current legislation was created before the phrase \u2018social media\u2019 even existed.\u201d Facebook, along with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and the Electoral Commission, was among more than 70 organisations and experts who submitted evidence to the inquiry. Its recommendations include measures to challenge foreign interference in UK elections, with the report underlining that foreign donor loopholes needed to be closed and that \u201cpermissibility check requirements\u201d \u2013 the size of donation below which there is no requirement to confirm that the donor is on the electoral roll or registered with Companies House \u2013 should be reduced from \u00a3500 to 1p. Moderating the ability of campaigns to \u201cmicro-target\u201d voters based on personal data, a concern raised by the Cambridge Analytica saga, also needed to be addressed, the report said. Other recommendations include giving the Electoral Commission the power to prosecute, as well as establishing a new \u2018\u2018office for election integrity\u201d to stop offenders \u201cslipping through the regulatory gaps\u201d. Deidre Brock, an SNP MP and a vice-chair of the parliamentary group, said: \u201cThis is the campaigning issue of the modern age.

We arrive few. The spirit was there. We tried and we tried. It was a pity at the end to drop two points in this way but that is football and we have to learn from these situations. It was a tight game and unfortunately we could not win it.\u201d Guardiola was asked about the City penalty overruled by VAR after the ball hit Jairo Riedewald\u2019s hand after his boot. \u201cIt looks like hands but \u2026\u201d said the manager. Stones appeared to hurt his knee. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak with the doctors,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cWe are going to have to see.\u201d Roy Hodgson said: \u201cIt would have been cruel to have lost it. We held out well and our defence was still strong until the equaliser in the 82nd minute. It came after such a fine piece of play, the cross and movement from Ag\u00fcero. You have to hold you hands up and say I just don\u2019t know what would have been possible to stop that. It was wonderful to see the lads not give up and accept what would have been their fate and get an equaliser. I am happier with 2-2 than 1-1.\u201d Tosun\u2019s opener came in the on-loan Everton striker\u2019s full league debut for Palace. \u201cThe credit for Cenk Tosun should go to Doug Freedman,\u201d Hodgson said of the director of football. \u201cCenk was scouted two years ago in the January transfer window and Doug Freedman had watched him a lot of times for Besiktas and was of the opinion he would be a good player for Palace.\u201d",

You have to get your head round it quickly. The feel of the game was domination. They had a header against the bar, three headers in the game, and one of them they score with. Other than that, I don\u2019t remember them endangering our box. We camped around their box, creating chances. You won\u2019t always create clear-cut against Newcastle because they have so many defenders around their box, and fair play to them. But we absolutely controlled it. At 0-0 I was going to say to the lads \u2018you gave everything\u2019. They pushed and pushed. We know we have problems at the top of the pitch, we don\u2019t get enough goals if we want to bridge the gap. And if you don\u2019t score, you\u2019re always liable for a sucker punch, and we got hit. It\u2019s something we need to address. We need to be clinical. I am pleased with the players we\u2019ve got, but we can\u2019t work any more in training on finishing. We finish and we finish, and sometimes you need to have that killer instinct. It\u2019s quite clear from what I\u2019m saying that we know where we need to strengthen ... so we\u2019ll see.\u201d January transfer action ahoy!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e235e588f0879d539efab2e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T19:43:35.161Z\">7.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A word with Steve Bruce.</strong> \u201cThe players worked so hard. But talk about smash and grab! The one thing we did do, and you can\u2019t fault the boys, is we defended really well. We showed great resilience. We\u2019ve nicked it, sneaked it, whatever you want. You can\u2019t fault them to a man, for their effort and endeavour. We\u2019ve got to look after the ball better, but we tried to change earlier on [this season] and I didn\u2019t think we were ready. The players are used to playing this way for a couple of years, it suits them. We will gradually get better, we\u2019ll have to improve. That\u2019s the next step. But we\u2019ve got a few results against the big teams.\u201d He also reports that Jetro Willems has \u201ctwisted his knee badly ... it looks a nasty one\u201d.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e235d3d8f08a6950eb447e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T19:36:11.263Z\">7.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chelsea\u2019s defeat has given Manchester United extra incentive - not that they need it - to beat leaders Liverpool tomorrow. </strong>If they manage a result at Anfield, they\u2019d move to within two points of the Blues, who stay on 39 points in fourth place.

Another curate\u2019s egg of a side.</p> <p><strong>But Chelsea are in fourth spot despite it all, and will be favourites to prevail this evening. </strong>Not least because they\u2019ve won six of the last seven matches between these two clubs, the exception being a final-day 3-0 breeze for Newcastle at the end of the 2017-18 season, when Antonio Conte\u2019s head was elsewhere. Frank Lampard\u2019s men have also had the week off to prepare, while Steve Bruce\u2019s side were forced to replay their third-round FA Cup tie with Rochdale. The Toon will hope the mental boost of a 4-1 win will offset any physical consequences.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 5.30pm GMT. </strong>Saturday night prime-time entertainment is ON!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So that, my good friends, is that. Louise Taylor was on point at St James\u2019 Park tonight. Here\u2019s her verdict. Click and enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Frank Lampard\u2019s analysis. \u201cThat\u2019s football. You have to get your head round it quickly. The feel of the game was domination. They had a header against the bar, three headers in the game, and one of them they score with. Other than that, I don\u2019t remember them endangering our box. We camped around their box, creating chances. You won\u2019t always create clear-cut against Newcastle because they have so many defenders around their box, and fair play to them. But we absolutely controlled it. At 0-0 I was going to say to the lads \u2018you gave everything\u2019. They pushed and pushed. We know we have problems at the top of the pitch, we don\u2019t get enough goals if we want to bridge the gap. And if you don\u2019t score, you\u2019re always liable for a sucker punch, and we got hit. It\u2019s something we need to address. We need to be clinical. I am pleased with the players we\u2019ve got, but we can\u2019t work any more in training on finishing. We finish and we finish, and sometimes you need to have that killer instinct. It\u2019s quite clear from what I\u2019m saying that we know where we need to strengthen ... so we\u2019ll see.\u201d January transfer action ahoy! A word with Steve Bruce. \u201cThe players worked so hard. But talk about smash and grab! The one thing we did do, and you can\u2019t fault the boys, is we defended really well. We showed great resilience. We\u2019ve nicked it, sneaked it, whatever you want. You can\u2019t fault them to a man, for their effort and endeavour. We\u2019ve got to look after the ball better, but we tried to change earlier on [this season] and I didn\u2019t think we were ready. The players are used to playing this way for a couple of years, it suits them. We will gradually get better, we\u2019ll have to improve. That\u2019s the next step. But we\u2019ve got a few results against the big teams.\u201d He also reports that Jetro Willems has \u201ctwisted his knee badly ... it looks a nasty one\u201d. Chelsea\u2019s defeat has given Manchester United extra incentive - not that they need it - to beat leaders Liverpool tomorrow. If they manage a result at Anfield, they\u2019d move to within two points of the Blues, who stay on 39 points in fourth place. Newcastle move up to 12th spot on 29 points, seven clear of the relegation places. Hayden\u2019s late goal has proved so precious. Chelsea had done all the attacking, Newcastle all the defending. But the hosts made one last surge, Joelinton winning a corner that would prove decisive. Saint-Maximin\u2019s deep cross was forced home by Hayden from close range, and the Toon will be bouncing tonight. A massive three points in their bid to stay clear of trouble. I wonder whether Kepa could have done better? Hayden\u2019s bouncing header wasn\u2019t the most powerful, and the keeper got a hand to it. But the points are Newcastle\u2019s. Steve Bruce smiles warmly; Frank Lampard looks sick. St James\u2019s Park erupts! A huge three points, won by Isaac Hayden, with additional thanks to Joelinton and Saint-Maximin. Drama worth waiting for. Ritchie\u2019s corner is appalling, cleared easily by first man Willian, who heads upfield. But Saint-Maximin curls one back in from a deep position on the left. Hayden rises highest at the far post and heads down. Kepa can\u2019t parry as the ball bounces back up, and Newcastle have snatched all three points at the death! 90 min +3: Steve Bruce prowls the touchline. He\u2019ll be pleased with his side\u2019s resolve in defence. He might be even happier if Newcastle can snatch a dramatic late goal ... because Joelinton has just won a corner with a bustle down the left. They couldn\u2019t, could they? 90 min +2: Kante tries to slip Barkley into the Newcastle box with a sliderule pass down the middle, but Lascelles is on point to clear. 90 min +1: Hudson-Odoi drops a shoulder and glides infield from his beat on the left. He tries to plant a curler into the top right, but gets far too much on it and the ball sails into the stand behind. 90 min: \u201cThis is what we are reduced to,\u201d writes this MBM\u2019s co-author Mary Waltz. \u201cA RADA rejection audition of a wounded soldier.\u201d Do you think Mary is looking forward to the four added minutes? 88 min: Some rare quality in attack from Newcastle, as Almiron puts his foot on the ball 30 yards from goal. He sizes up the options and dinks a ball left for Saint-Maximin, who cushions it down for Joelinton. Newcastle\u2019s number nine snatches at his shot, sending it sailing wide left. Kepa should have been called into action, at the very least. 86 min: Barkley feeds Hudson-Odoi down the left. Hudson-Odoi wins a corner and takes it himself. Emerson, in the middle of the mixer, cocks his leg back to shoot ... but at the last second the ball is clattered clear by Sean Longstaff. Newcastle are hanging on a little here. 85 min: Matty Longstaff comes on for Shelvey. 84 min: From the set piece, Emerson twists and turns just inside the Newcastle box. Sean Longstaff sticks out a leg. Emerson runs into it deliberately and flops over. No penalty, though, the referee deciding it was a dive. Emerson goes in the book. 83 min: Emerson sends a rising screamer towards the top right. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner by Fernandez. Chelsea are getting closer and closer. 82 min: Hudson-Odoi, out on the left, nearly finds Batshuayi at the far post. An inch or two too high. 80 min: That\u2019s Abraham\u2019s last contribution. He\u2019s replaced by Batshuayi. 79 min: Jorginho crosses from the left. Azpilicueta rises to win a header at the far post. Abraham, in the middle, hooks past Dubravka. The ball bounces slowly towards the net. But it won\u2019t go in, because Ritchie tracks back to hook clear. Dubravka might have got a piece of Abraham\u2019s effort, in fact, allowing Ritchie to perform his heroics. 77 min: James, having picked up his injury on the far side of the field, is at least able to make his own way back round the pitch to the dugouts. \u201cAt my advanced age seething isn\u2019t an option,\u201d replies Mary Waltz. \u201cSliding into a quiet depression is more accurate.\u201d 75 min: At the next break in play, Chelsea replace James with Emerson. Then they win a corner down the left. Hudson-Odoi takes, but it\u2019s no good. 74 min: Poor James is in the wars. Now he goes down holding his leg. Having left the pitch, he tries to roll back on for treatment, but the referee wants the game to continue and orders him back off. Chelsea aren\u2019t happy about it, but this is how it\u2019s going to be. 73 min: Jorginho and Barkley one-two their way down the left. Sean Longstaff tries to break up the move, only to prod the ball down the channel towards his own goal, and straight to Abraham, who rounds Dubravka on the outside ... before slicing a poor effort into the side netting. 72 min: Good news, as James is good to continue. His first post-recovery act is an overhit cross from the right that flies out of play on the other side of the field. Chelsea are just glad to see him back. 71 min: As James receives treatment, Sean Longstaff comes on for Emil Krafth. 70 min: James writhes in agony, having landed awkwardly on his arm after a non-event of a challenge in the middle of the park. Not sure whether he\u2019s hurt his elbow or jarred his shoulder. He called for the physio immediately. His captain Azpilicueta stands over him with a concerned look on his face. 68 min: Chelsea make their first change of the evening, hooking a below-par Mason Mount and replacing him with Ross Barkley. 66 min: More low-quality wizardry. Nothing is coming off. Mary Waltz will be seething by now. 64 min: Hudson-Odoi takes a corner out on the right, and flies it over a crowded box. Newcastle try to spring upfield through Saint-Maximin, but the move breaks down quickly enough. These impotent attacks continue to cause Mary Waltz great discomfort. In an email with the subject heading Bad Magic, she writes: \u201cWhen either side approaches the penalty box all their skills seem to be removed from their bodies.\u201d 62 min: Hudson-Odoi dribbles in from the right in style. Just as he begins to think about pulling the trigger, Clark executes the perfect slide tackle to put a stop to his gallop. The crowd enjoyed that, and why not? A satisfying crunch wonderfully timed. 60 min: Some staunch work by Joelinton, who bustles his way up the left flank and moves infield. He eventually gives up possession to his team-mate Shelvey, who tries his luck from 30 yards. His luck\u2019s not in. Chelsea go up the other end, Hudson-Odoi working his way down the right and pulling back for Abraham, who hooks over harmlessly. 58 min: Kante has a whack from the best part of 30 yards, sending a bobbler towards the bottom left. It\u2019s meat and drink for Dubravka. 56 min: Mount works his way down the inside-left channel and is unceremoniously flipped into the air by Hayden. In the book you go, sir. A free kick in a very dangerous position, 25 yards out. Chelsea work a routine, and make a total hash of it, Jorginho clipping a ball down the inside-right channel to absolutely nobody. The ball trundles apologetically out for a goal kick. 55 min: Willian glides in from the left. He feeds Jorginho, who shuttles the ball further infield for Azpilicueta. Chelsea\u2019s captain slaps a shot towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Dubravka is behind it all the way. 53 min: Newcastle fling a few men upfield, and are nearly caught out on the counter, hoist by their own petard. Chelsea sling a long ball up the right. Abraham turns and feeds Willian, who drifts towards the left of the D before dragging a weak shot across goal and out on the right. He should have worked Dubravka at the very least. 52 min: There really isn\u2019t much going on right now. Mary Waltz is not impressed: \u201cIs the field icy? Does the ball have corners?\u201d 50 min: Space for Ritchie out on the left. But there\u2019s nobody making a move, and he\u2019s forced to turn tail. It\u2019s all a bit slow from Newcastle. 48 min: The early signs suggest Willian is just fine. He skedaddles in from the left wing, slipping past two men and shooting from the edge of the box. His effort is blocked, but there didn\u2019t appear to be any problem with his movement there. 47 min: All very scrappy at the start of the second half. St James\u2019 Park is a quiet place as a result. We\u2019re off again! Newcastle get the second half underway. Willian was holding his groin as he walked off for half-time, and he was doing the same just before kick-off now. Pedro has been out warming up, but Willian\u2019s good to continue. For now. Half-time entertainment. And that\u2019s your lot for the first 45 50 minutes. Not a classic yet, but eventful enough. Chelsea have dominated, but it\u2019s Newcastle who have come closest to scoring, Joelinton smashing a McDonald/Shearer/Carroll-esque header off the crossbar. 45 min +5: The home crowd accuse the referee of ineptitude via the medium of song, but that was the correct decision, and VAR would have spotted it anyway. 45 min +4: Joelinton has the ball in the net, Ritchie having taken a quick free kick from the centre circle with Chelsea light at the back. The striker raced free down the right, and slapped the ball past Kepa, but Chelsea had stopped playing because the referee had noticed the ball was rolling when Ritchie took the set piece, and whistled accordingly. 45 min +3: Some pinball in the Newcastle box, instigated by Azpilicueta\u2019s low left-wing cross. Willian nearly gets a chance to shoot. Instead, Ritchie hooks hysterically over the bar. Hudson-Odoi\u2019s resulting corner is no good. 45 min +2: Willian sashays in from the left, then feeds Azpilicueta on the overlap. Corner. Mount takes, and it\u2019s easily snaffled by Dubravka. 45 min: There will be five added minutes, a result of the Willems injury. 44 min: Mount whips a low free kick towards the bottom right, but can\u2019t get past the Newcastle wall. Not great. The resulting deflection does earn a corner, mind ... but that particular set piece is easily cleared by the home defence. Chelsea come back at Newcastle, but there\u2019s more misery for Mount as he slips while crossing from the left. Shank! Goal kick. 42 min: Almiron clumsily runs into the back of Jorginho, 25 yards out, just to the right of centre. A free kick in a very promising position for the visitors. 40 min: Hudson-Odoi finds Mount, 12 yards out, with a cross from the right flank. Mount slaps a header harmlessly over. Both sides have had their chances. 39 min: James drops a shoulder to diddle Ritchie down the right. His cross hits the first man, but top marks for the way the young full-back earned himself the space and right to do so, even if the final product was uncharacteristically lacking this time. 38 min: A free kick for Newcastle out on the right. Shelvey swings it in from deep. Fernandez rises highest, but can\u2019t keep his header from six yards down. 37 min: Hayden\u2019s absolutely fine. This much we know because he\u2019s just foolishly run the ball out of play at high speed, with Newcastle developing a rare, promising attack down the right. 35 min: Christensen climbs on the back of Joelinton, but Newcastle don\u2019t get the free kick. On the touchline, Steve Bruce critiques the referee in the Anglo Saxon style, and earns a bollocking from the official for his trouble. 34 min: The busy James pearls a low shot-cum-cross into the Newcastle six-yard box from a tight angle on the right. Dubravka is in the right position to block and clear. Newcastle are beginning to look a little ragged. 33 min: A stunning move by Chelsea. Willian curls in from the left. Kante flicks a header on. Abraham is a little ahead of the ball, so sticks out a boot and backheels an effort onto the underside of the crossbar! That was an inch or so away from flying into the top left. Ah, he was offside, so had it gone in, it wouldn\u2019t have counted. But what improvisation by Abraham. 31 min: The ref blows up, pausing the play to allow Fernandez to put his boot back on. It\u2019s slowly turning into that sort of game. Excitement, please! 29 min: Abraham tries to make up for it, taking a shot from 25 yards. It flies 25 yards over the bar. Meanwhile Oliver Lewis isn\u2019t having it that Newcastle are currently cursed with injuries: \u201cA few injuries are bad luck, this many is consistently throwing players back in too soon, playing players even though the medical team say they are likely to be injured and I suspect some \u2018old school\u2019 training methods. Of course some is bad luck but something has to change, this is preposterous. So many millions of pounds of investment out of action for large parts of the season.\u201d 28 min: James curls an Alexander-Arnoldesque low cross into the Newcastle box from deep. That\u2019s a fine pass that nearly sticks on Abraham, six yards out. But Abraham takes his eye off the ball as he attempts to trap and turn, and the chance is gone. James is one hell of a prospect. 26 min: Chelsea pin Newcastle back. Not that Newcastle need much encouragement to sit deep. They keep their shape as Willian, Mount and Azpilicueta toil on the left, unable to open up the hosts. 24 min: That\u2019s woken St James\u2019 Park up a bit. The home faithful had been subdued since the early loss of Willems. Incidentally, it seems like Hayden is moving around in a much freer style now. 22 min: Joelinton crashes a header off the underside of the crossbar! He beat Kepa all ends up, having met Fernandez\u2019s wonderful right-wing cross, but his luck still isn\u2019t in. Chelsea hack clear. So unlucky. That was a wonderful header. Andy Carroll would have been proud of it. 20 min: Newcastle have had just 31% possession so far, which is low even by their own standards, the aforementioned 33.6%. If they keep this up all season, they\u2019ll easily break the lowest possession record since records began in 2003, beating Neil Warnock\u2019s 2018-19 Cardiff team (33.9%) and four different Tony Pulis vintages (at Stoke, West Brom and Palace, between 36.6% and 38.6%). 19 min: Almiron bustles down the right and hooks a cross into the mixer. Chelsea half clear, and Saint-Maximin tries to curl a spectacular one into the top right from distance. His effort just about stays in the stadium. 18 min: Ah this is good to see. Hayden caught a sore one there, but he\u2019s able to get up and after a quick trot around to check what\u2019s what, continues to play. He\u2019s not moving around totally smoothly, but here\u2019s hoping it\u2019s not too serious and he can run it off. 16 min: This is preposterous. Now Hayden is down, clutching his ankle while contesting a ball with Mount. Newcastle appear cursed at the minute. 14 min: Mount busies himself down the left and squirts the ball across the face of Newcastle\u2019s goal. The ball refuses to spin into the net, and there\u2019s nobody in blue there to force it home. A goal immediately after Willems\u2019 departure really would have added insult to injury. 12 min: Not sure whether Willems\u2019 injury has been caused by the impact of knee on knee, or a twist as he landed. It was completely accidental, a garden-variety 50-50 challenge with Hudson-Odoi. Poor Willems departs on a stretcher and is replaced by Matt Ritchie. On the touchline, Steve Bruce shakes his head in disbelief and despair. His pre-match quotes look particularly poignant now. Newcastle and their players can\u2019t catch a break. 10 min: Oh no, is this more injury woe for Newcastle? Willems clatters into Hudson-Odoi, falls to the ground, and batters the turf dramatically with his fist in a mix of frustration and pain. He immediately waves to his bench. It was a whack of knee on knee, and Willems shakes his head repeatedly as the trainer assesses the damage. 8 min: Willian threatens to break clear down the left, but changes his mind and pulls the ball back for Azpilicueta, who blooters a shot into a thicket of players just inside the Newcastle box. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s blocked and cleared. But this is all Chelsea in the opening exchanges. 7 min: This corner leads to a small game of head tennis, and eventually the flag pops up for offside. Chelsea\u2019s first sustained period of pressure comes to an end. 6 min: Willian earns the first corner of the game, bursting down the left and playing the ball off Fernandez. Chelsea take it short, working it back to Hudson-Odoi, who tears down the inside-left channel and wins a second corner, this time off Almiron. 5 min: So having said that, Newcastle build a patient attack, hogging the ball down the right flank. Eventually Almiron hooks a deep cross towards Saint-Maximin, who can\u2019t keep his header, intended to flash back across goal from the left, in play. 4 min: Newcastle seem happy to sit back, coiled and ready to spring on the counter when they break up Chelsea\u2019s attacks. This shouldn\u2019t come as a huge surprise: they\u2019ve got the lowest possession percentage of any team in this season\u2019s Premier League: 33.6%. Burnley are the next cab on the rank with a whopping 40.1%. 2 min: All a bit scrappy in the opening exchanges. Clark taking an aeon over a throw near the halfway line doesn\u2019t help the early momentum. Here we go, then! Chelsea get the ball rolling. A lively afternoon-spent-in-the-Strawberry atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park. Long may it continue. Howay the lads! The teams are out! Newcastle are in their famous black and white stripes, while Chelsea sport their storied royal blue. A quick blast of the theme from the greatest film ever made, and we\u2019ll be off. Here\u2019s Frank Lampard, who has never lost to Steve Bruce in the Premier League either as a player or manager. It\u2019s 14 wins and four draws from 18 games! \u201cA lot of results Newcastle have got, and they\u2019ve got some good results this year, have been in a certain way. So we can look at that. But they also have threats in forward areas. They have some danger as well.\u201d He adds that they\u2019ve been working on breaking down packed defences, admitting it\u2019s something they occasionally struggle to do. As for the recall of N\u2019Golo Kante? \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to have competition, so Ross Barkley can and should feel disappointed, and that\u2019s part of my job. Everyone has to be on their toes and playing well.\u201d Steve Bruce talks! \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the bigger players back. We have been up against it. I\u2019ve never witnessed anything like the Leicester thing when we lost four players in 12 minutes. Let\u2019s hope we stay fit and healthy. When your better players are not there, you\u2019re up against it. Joelinton has been having a tough time, he\u2019s got a goal the other night, so let\u2019s hope it\u2019s done the trick. He\u2019s a good player. Almiron was the same, he\u2019s now got four in the last six. So let\u2019s hope that continues.\u201d Newcastle make six changes to the XI sent out against Rochdale in midweek. Martin Dubravka, Jonjo Shelvey, Ciaran Clark, Jetro Willems, Federico Fernandez and Allan Saint-Maximin are back; Karl Darlow, Florian Lejeune, Matt Ritchie, Christian Atsu and both Longstaffs step down. Chelsea make one change to the team that beat Burnley 3-0 last Saturday. N\u2019Golo Kante relegates Ross Barkley to a seat on the bench. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Krafth, Fernandez, Lascelles, Clark, Willems, Almiron, Hayden, Shelvey, Saint-Maximin, Joelinton. Subs: Schar, Ritchie, Lejeune, Darlow, Atsu, Sean Longstaff, Matthew Longstaff. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, James, Christensen, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Kante, Jorginho, Mount, Hudson-Odoi, Abraham, Willian. Subs: Barkley, Pedro, Caballero, Zouma, Kovacic, Batshuayi, Emerson Palmieri. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). It\u2019s hard to get a handle on these two teams. Newcastle started the Premier League season with five losses in their first nine. They then won six from 11, magically transforming themselves into a comfortable mid-table team. And now another slide: one point from the last 12 on offer. Thirteenth place in the table is about right, but they\u2019ll have to start winning a few more games soon, or they\u2019ll be back in the basement lickety split. Chelsea aren\u2019t exactly the most predictable either. Just two wins from their first eight fixtures in all competitions this season, followed by seven victories on the spin. In the last month or so they\u2019ve been turned over by the likes of West Ham, Everton, Bournemouth and Southampton; during the same period they\u2019ve also enjoyed big wins at Arsenal and Tottenham. Another curate\u2019s egg of a side. But Chelsea are in fourth spot despite it all, and will be favourites to prevail this evening. Not least because they\u2019ve won six of the last seven matches between these two clubs, the exception being a final-day 3-0 breeze for Newcastle at the end of the 2017-18 season, when Antonio Conte\u2019s head was elsewhere. Frank Lampard\u2019s men have also had the week off to prepare, while Steve Bruce\u2019s side were forced to replay their third-round FA Cup tie with Rochdale. The Toon will hope the mental boost of a 4-1 win will offset any physical consequences. Kick off is at 5.30pm GMT. Saturday night prime-time entertainment is ON!",

The storm began moving on Friday, leading to trouble at airports from Chicago to Kansas City. According to the federal National Weather Service (NWS), the \u201cdeepening\u201d storm was set to move \u201cacross the Central Plains [and] will move north-east into the Great Lakes on Saturday and into northern New York state and New England on Sunday\u201d. Between 6in and 12in of snow were possible under the storm\u2019s \u201cwidespread footprint\u201d, the NWS said. \u201cStrong winds on the north-west side of this storm are expected to produce blizzard conditions into Saturday afternoon across the eastern half of North Dakota, the eastern half of South Dakota, far western Minnesota and north-west Iowa,\u201d a forecast said. \u201cWinds across these regions may gust to over 50mph, producing considerable blowing and drifting of snow and life-threatening travel conditions.\u201d It added: \u201cOverall, this storm has the potential to produce widespread hazardous conditions across much of the north-eastern quarter of the nation over the next day and a half.\u201d For southern New England it would be the first significant snowfall of the winter, with up to half a foot expected in many areas of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

Officials closed hundreds of miles of Interstate 29 from Grand Forks, North Dakota to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. A stretch of Interstate 94 from Fargo, North Dakota to Bismarck, North Dakota was also closed and farther west in Wyoming, officials closed down stretches of Interstate 80 as a precaution.

The video showed a state trooper and a person involved in a crash on Interstate 80 near Council Bluffs on Friday looking at the damage. Another truck then lost control and barrelled into the crash scene, barely missing the trooper and other man. On Friday night, the Federal Aviation Administration halted all flights in and out of Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport for several hours, and a plane slid off an icy taxiway at Kansas City International Airport. The Chicago Department of Aviation reported about 200 cancellations at O\u2019Hare on Saturday morning out of nearly 2,000 total flights, and the FAA said some flights were being delayed because of the weather.

The crowded city runs regularly without power, has few cinemas or sporting clubs and a bare handful of parks in which children can play.</p> <p>The trips to the beach were signal occasions in a young life in the territory, and while the gentle waves and blue water appealed, Saleh and his siblings were forbidden from swimming.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother would never let us,\u201d Saleh tells the Guardian through an interpreter. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed in the water.

Last summer, in 2019, seven people died.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here in Australia, the beach is very safe, it\u2019s very clean and well-organised.</p> <footer> <cite>Hasan Alhabil</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Saleh\u2019s family are Palestinian refugees who fled to Gaza when they were forced from their ancestral home in 1948. For 10 of Saleh\u2019s formative childhood years his father was in an Israeli jail; his extended family has lost dozens of members to the violence of the occupation over decades. His mother\u2019s over-protectiveness, he says, was a response to the precariousness of his family\u2019s existence.</p> <p>\u201cBut I want children in Gaza to learn to enjoy the beach, and to be safe when they swim. I want to establish a program like Nippers to teach children about lifesaving.\u201d</p> <p>Nippers is the Australian surf lifesaving program for children, with more than 60,000 currently enrolled, beginning at age five.</p> <p>But beyond the surf club\u2019s mandate for patrolling the beach and saving lives in the water, a surf club in Gaza can provide a powerful sense of solidarity and fellowship. In a territory where youth unemployment runs at 60%, a surf club can serve as a place of community, an outlet of physical activity and shared purpose for young Palestinians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcd4fd95b0cc8de2bad99255e6dd15af301e3534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcd4fd95b0cc8de2bad99255e6dd15af301e3534/0_0_5333_3555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammed Saleh and Hasan Alhabil will be assessed for their bronze medallion, the fundamental Australian lifesaving qualification, in late January\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammed Saleh and Hasan Alhabil will be assessed for their bronze medallion, the fundamental Australian lifesaving qualification, in late January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe want to re-create a system like [that] here in Australia, that involves the whole society.

      "bodyText": "In isolated, impoverished Gaza, Mohammed Saleh remembers visits to the beach as a child. His mother took him once each summer. Living in the narrow and besieged strip of land abutting the warm waters of the Mediterranean, the beach was, and remains, one of the few entertainments freely available to residents of Gaza. The crowded city runs regularly without power, has few cinemas or sporting clubs and a bare handful of parks in which children can play. The trips to the beach were signal occasions in a young life in the territory, and while the gentle waves and blue water appealed, Saleh and his siblings were forbidden from swimming. \u201cMy mother would never let us,\u201d Saleh tells the Guardian through an interpreter. \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed in the water. She wanted us to be safe, and she was worried because we couldn\u2019t swim well.\u201d He is determined to change this for the next generation of Palestinian children. For the month of January, Saleh is in Sydney, guest of the North Steyne Surf Lifesaving Club, training to be one of Gaza\u2019s first qualified lifesavers. He aims to return to Palestine to establish its first surf club: the Gaza Beach Surf Lifesaving Club. \u201cWe want to build a lifesaving club of our own, for Gazans, to keep people safe,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though the sea is more gentle in Gaza than the ocean in Australia, unfortunately, still many people drown because they cannot swim safely. Last summer, in 2019, seven people died.\u201d Saleh\u2019s family are Palestinian refugees who fled to Gaza when they were forced from their ancestral home in 1948. For 10 of Saleh\u2019s formative childhood years his father was in an Israeli jail; his extended family has lost dozens of members to the violence of the occupation over decades. His mother\u2019s over-protectiveness, he says, was a response to the precariousness of his family\u2019s existence. \u201cBut I want children in Gaza to learn to enjoy the beach, and to be safe when they swim. I want to establish a program like Nippers to teach children about lifesaving.\u201d Nippers is the Australian surf lifesaving program for children, with more than 60,000 currently enrolled, beginning at age five. But beyond the surf club\u2019s mandate for patrolling the beach and saving lives in the water, a surf club in Gaza can provide a powerful sense of solidarity and fellowship. In a territory where youth unemployment runs at 60%, a surf club can serve as a place of community, an outlet of physical activity and shared purpose for young Palestinians. \u201cWe want to re-create a system like [that] here in Australia, that involves the whole society. Everyone working together to make it a safe place to share.\u201d Hasan Alhabil, also a refugee, was taught to swim by an older brother, and as a teenager became one of a handful of lifeguards employed by the municipality to patrol Gaza beach. \u201cThe beach is all we have, it\u2019s the only recreation, the only entertainment for the Gazan people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut even there we have problems. Because there is no electricity and power often, raw sewage is pushed into the sea. So that means there is less space where it is safe for people to swim. \u201cHere in Australia, the beach is very safe, it\u2019s very clean and well-organised. The facilities you have here, we don\u2019t have in Gaza.\u201d In a city ringed by a fortifications, and whose only exits are militarised checkpoints, Gaza\u2019s 45km of shoreline on the Mediterranean is one of the few places to offer a sense of space and of freedom. But even this is illusory. A bare few miles off the coast, Israeli navy ships are permanently patrolling, blockading all movement in or out. Saleh and Alhabil are in the middle of a month of intensive training at North Steyne club, on Sydney\u2019s Manly Beach. They will be assessed for their bronze medallion, the fundamental Australian lifesaving qualification, in late January. The president of the North Steyne Surf Lifesaving Club, Chris Gibbs Stewart, says dozens of club members had volunteered to assist their Gazan guests. \u201cWe feel this is a hugely important project,\u201d she says. \u201cLifesaving is, of course, about keeping people safe on the beach, but it\u2019s about more than that, it\u2019s about building a community, building a sense of family.

Caring for country and ranger programs in protected areas has delivered a degree of autonomy to traditional owners to walk the country, burning according to seasonal need and cultural knowledge.</p> <p>Indigenous fire management involves \u201ccool\u201d fires in targeted areas during the early dry season, between March and July.

Wombats, for example, dig burrows to escape, while koalas climb into the canopy. \u201cWhen you understand the fire relationships they have, their own fire culture, then you are really applying the right fire for that culture so that you\u2019re supporting the identity of that place. \u201cWhen you do that, you get more productive landscapes, you get healthier plants and animals, you get regeneration, you discourage invasive elements, which are sometimes native species that might belong in the system next door. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to apply that right fire for right country, so you can maintain the right balance.\u201d Dr David Bowman is a professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the University of Tasmania. Bowman describes Indigenous fire management as \u201clittle fires tending the earth affectionately\u201d. \u201cThe affectional is the opposite of mechanical. It\u2019s with emotion. So it can be reverence, affection, fear, a whole range of emotions, but it\u2019s an emotional relationship you have with land using fire to create mosaics and flammable habitat mosaics, which are really good for biodiversity and a really good way of managing fuel load.\u201d Where is it used in Australia? In northern Australia, Indigenous land ownership is widespread. Caring for country and ranger programs in protected areas has delivered a degree of autonomy to traditional owners to walk the country, burning according to seasonal need and cultural knowledge. Indigenous fire management involves \u201ccool\u201d fires in targeted areas during the early dry season, between March and July. The fires burn slowly and in patches. In the Kimberley, the Land council holds community fire planning meetings throughout the early dry season to ensure the correct people are burning their country. \u201cTraditional owners are consulted and native title holders design burn lines and fire walk routes,\u201d the KLC acting CEO Tyronne Garstone says. \u201cThese burn lines are approved by the group and Indigenous rangers perform the on-ground work, backed up by modern technology with rangers taking constant weather readings and recording the conditions of the day. \u201cThey work very well at combining the old people\u2019s fire practices with modern techniques.\u201d Even so, climate change is affecting their ability to do \u201cright way\u201d fire management, Garstone says. \u201cThese \u2018right way\u2019 fire days are getting fewer and fire behaviour is changing along the same lines as over east. Late season conditions are also driving more fires in unusual ways due to the climatic conditions we are currently facing.\u201d How effective is it? The Darwin centre for bushfire research at Charles Darwin University maps bushfires weekly. Since traditional burning was reintroduced on a large scale, the centre has collected enough data to show that the area of land destroyed by wildfires has more than halved, from 26.5m hectares in 2000, to just 11.5m hectares in 2019. \u201cWe have annual fires up here,\u201d the centre\u2019s research fellow Andrew Edwards says. \u201cForty per cent of the top end could burn every year. So we had to do something about that.\u201d \u201cWe were originally much more interested in biodiversity, Aboriginal employment and getting people back on country to manage it properly, but when the carbon economy came along we saw a way to manage fire to abate greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cIt was pretty bad before that happened,\u201d Edwards says. \u201cIt was just fires running wild across huge tracts of north Australia that nobody was doing anything about.\u201d Edwards says the top end cooperative model can be adapted to southern conditions. \u201cThat\u2019s what needs to be looked at. Obviously there\u2019s a lot more infrastructure to set up, but it\u2019s collaboration and education. \u201cIf we want to manage our natural environment properly, we need to be doing prescribed burning. There\u2019s so much cultural knowledge out there still, and it\u2019s being totally ignored. There\u2019s hundreds of Indigenous rangers out there now doing this work.\u201d Will these practices be widely adopted? In southern Australia, Oliver Costello says, Aboriginal knowledge systems are far less valued but hold important solutions. The Coag national bushfire management policy includes a commitment to \u201cpromote Indigenous Australians\u2019 use of fire\u201d, but Indigenous fire groups like Firesticks Alliance say they need more resources to build capacity. \u201cThere are a lot of policy settings at a high level that support us, but there\u2019s nothing in between. There\u2019re no resources,\u201d Costello says. \u201cThere\u2019s no investment really outside of northern Australia Indigenous fire management of any significance, and they had to build a whole new economy to support it through carbon. \u201cThere\u2019s always investment going into future firefighting capacity, more trucks, more helicopters, more this, more that. What we need is people getting out into the landscape now, with the knowledge to start to heal it. Professor Bowman says it is possible to \u201cblend Aboriginal with European and modern scientific approaches to create an opportunity for all land users and land owners\u201d. He suggests small-scale local \u201cGreen fire\u201d groups modelled on the Landcare program. \u201cI would like to see a crossover between Indigenous and mainstream fire management groups, where there can be exchange and recognition. \u201cBecause in the end there\u2019s two things which are important to [remember]: all humans have come from a fire management background in their cultures, it\u2019s just that some cultures ended up obliterating that knowledge because of industrialisation. \u201cWe should really prioritise employment of Aboriginal people. But when there\u2019s a gap we could be filling that gap with community groups. And there\u2019s a really good opportunity for Aboriginal people to be involved in training. \u201cWe need to encourage and promote the philosophy of Aboriginal fire practice because that\u2019s going to be a really important pathway for sustainable fire management and also for healing because so many communities have been traumatised and shocked by the scale of the burning.\u201d Costello says the areas that haven\u2019t burned this time around are now even more vulnerable. \u201cThey are critical parts of the landscape [that need] to be able to support the animals and plants that have survived. And so those areas are going to be under increasing pressure and they\u2019re also at risk of a future fire. \u201cThere was an economy before settlement that supported this, a resource economy based on people looking after the land and having all that they needed. \u201cNow in the modern society it revolves around money. So we need to build economies that support cultural practice and acknowledge traditional custodianship. \u201cThere\u2019s all this canopy that\u2019s been burnt away. We\u2019ve got knowledge and techniques that can help heal that country in the future. It\u2019s going to take some time. We\u2019ve got probably two or three years before we can really be effective in some of that country because it needs to recover. But if we don\u2019t get in there after that, then we miss our chance.\u201d",

That was my job: chief catcher of produce. </p> <p>These gourds were enormous, each a foot or more long. I\u2019m certain one could feed a family of four. Though after you\u2019ve peeled away the woody angles and most of the outer skin, what is left has halved in volume and weight.</p> <p>The way I usually ate them, which is the most common method throughout the Chinese and South East Asian traditions, was stir fried with garlic and an egg beaten in at the end, seasoned with oyster sauce and white pepper. It\u2019s still the way I cook it for my kids \u2013 except now I pick the gourds when they are a little larger than a Sharpie marker. This makes them an entirely different vegetable.</p> <p>When they are picked with their yellow flower still attached, similar to a baby zucchini, they are tender with a satisfying crunch and require no peeling. All they need is a lick of heat from a smoking wok.</p> <p>Though this is hardly the only way they can be eaten, these tender young members of the cucurbit family have a curious aroma, reminiscent of fresh peanuts. They are just as delicious very lightly steamed and dipped into bagna cauda \u2013 garlic and anchovy whipped into a good quality new season olive oil.</p> <p>The prettiest way I\u2019ve seen them served was by my mate Ben Devlin at his restaurant Pipit, paired with some fresh tiger striped peanuts which we also grow.

      "bodyText": "Most commercial fruit is picked underripe. It is stored for weeks or months, then gassed when it\u2019s ready to be freighted and stocked on shop shelves. While there are logistical benefits to this, it does not allow us to consume the produce at maximum nutrient density. A delightful discovery of farming is learning the point of maturity that things can, and perhaps should, be harvested at. Farming means I don\u2019t have to have my choices dictated by perishability in a supermarket. For instance, we have been picking our bananas and mangoes when they have reached maximum ripeness, which often means part of the bunch has been nibbled by some other critter first. When you gently place your palm underneath a fruit, and it falls into your patient hand, that is a clear sign the fruit is now yours. This notion of sacredness was talked about by Yuin elder Uncle Max Dulumunmun Harrison at Sydney\u2019s MAD Monday Indigenous Foodways event last year. The sentiment of respectful ease in nature is present in almost every traditional culture and yet, in our modern times of supermarket convenience, we forget this. Produce also tends to be selected for maximum sweetness \u2013 which is what we\u2019ve conditioned our tastebuds to want. Complex flavours and nutritional qualities are abandoned in its favour. We\u2019ve forgotten that many fruits are supposed to be sour, sometimes bitter and even sometimes sting our lips with terpenes, due to the anti-oxidant compounds present. As a young child, most Saturday mornings were spent with my mum sitting outside markets minding the bags while she was inside doing the weekly shop. During the summer I\u2019d watch the parade of brightly dressed ladies waltzing in and out of the markets with lengthy gourds. They refused compliance; no bag could fit them neatly. So shoppers would come out with gourds hazardously tucked under their arms. And then finally there my mother would be, eyes wide open, mouth pursed in concentration, striding towards me communicating without words that she needed me to relieve her of some of the six or seven gourds that threatened to tumble from her arms as she carried multiple bags in her hands. That was my job: chief catcher of produce. These gourds were enormous, each a foot or more long. I\u2019m certain one could feed a family of four. Though after you\u2019ve peeled away the woody angles and most of the outer skin, what is left has halved in volume and weight. The way I usually ate them, which is the most common method throughout the Chinese and South East Asian traditions, was stir fried with garlic and an egg beaten in at the end, seasoned with oyster sauce and white pepper. It\u2019s still the way I cook it for my kids \u2013 except now I pick the gourds when they are a little larger than a Sharpie marker. This makes them an entirely different vegetable. When they are picked with their yellow flower still attached, similar to a baby zucchini, they are tender with a satisfying crunch and require no peeling. All they need is a lick of heat from a smoking wok. Though this is hardly the only way they can be eaten, these tender young members of the cucurbit family have a curious aroma, reminiscent of fresh peanuts. They are just as delicious very lightly steamed and dipped into bagna cauda \u2013 garlic and anchovy whipped into a good quality new season olive oil. The prettiest way I\u2019ve seen them served was by my mate Ben Devlin at his restaurant Pipit, paired with some fresh tiger striped peanuts which we also grow. Sadly, if you aren\u2019t growing it, it is almost near impossible to buy them young. So best to get growing! Luffa acutangula gourds make up a wide range of incredible vegetables.

Back in November, he\u2019d evacuated his family and animals in northern New South Wales as bushfires raged around them, and had begun to put together a benefit for the beleaguered NSW RFS.

      "body": "<p>I first met Roger Scruton almost 20 years ago at a symposium in Sweden. I admired the eloquence with which he could talk about Kant and the elegance of his writing on beauty. I learned from his conservatism, even as I disagreed with what he said. But although I got to know him quite well over the years, our relationship was always fraught. For there was another Roger Scruton, not the philosopher but the polemicist. For all his warmth and generosity, and for all the poise of his writing, his views were often ugly. \u201cWhatever its defects,\u201d Scruton wrote in his memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/05/roger-scruton-interview\" title=\"\">Gentle Regrets</a></em>, \u201cmy life has enabled me to find comfort in uncomfortable truths.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/14/sir-roger-scruton-obituary\" title=\"\">His death last week</a> seems an appropriate moment to reflect on the \u201cuncomfortable truths\u201d of Scruton\u2019s conservatism, and on the relationship between the philosopher and the polemicist.</p> <p>It was Scruton the polemicist who became the founding editor of the <em><a href=\"https://www.salisburyreview.com\" title=\"\">Salisbury Review</a></em>, established in 1982 to defend a traditional conservatism that many felt was being eroded by the Thatcherite revolution.</p> <p>Today, the <em>Review</em> is remembered largely for the Ray Honeyford affair, in which the Bradford headmaster was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/was-1980s-headteacher-who-criticised-multiculturism-right\" title=\"\">forced to resign</a> after a furore over a1984 article critical of multiculturalism. Honeyford\u2019s polemic was, however, bland by the standards of the <em>Review</em> in the 80s.</p> <p>The first issue published a talk by <a href=\"http://nationalconservatism.blogspot.com/2010/10/one-nation-politics-of-race.html\" title=\"\">John Casey </a>on the politics of race. The presence of \u201cWest Indian communities\u201d, he claimed, \u201coffends\u2026 a sense of what English life should be like\u201d and \u201ca sense of what is civilised behaviour\u201d. Only the \u201crepatriation of a proportion of the immigrant and immigrant-descended population\u201d could forestall \u201cthe possible destruction of civilised life in the centres of the big cities\u201d.</p> <p>If race was one obsession, sex was another, especially gay sex. \u201cA concern with social order,\u201d Scruton wrote in an editorial, \u201cprompts us to view\u2026 homosexuality as intrinsically threatening.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was, for Scruton, impossible to conceive of society without prejudices and exclusions, discrimination and inequality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the 1980s, the <em>Salisbury Review</em>, and Scruton himself, was seen as occupying the fringes of politics. In many of the past week\u2019s eulogies, he was presented as a figure ostracised by political correctness but ultimately proved right. In fact, many old <em>Salisbury Review</em> authors, including Casey, have long since disavowed their views. Scruton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/05/roger-scruton-interview\" title=\"\">said in 2010</a> that homosexuality was a \u201ccomplicated\u201d issue, but he no longer believed it to be \u201crepellent\u201d.</p> <p>The reactionary views about immigrants and gays do not however merely reflect the attitudes of a less enlightened time. They expose also the character of the conservatism that Scruton espoused, which drew deeply upon Edmund Burke\u2019s vision of society and human nature. Both men <a href=\"https://newcriterion.com/issues/2003/2/why-i-became-a-conservative\" title=\"\">viewed society</a> as a kind of \u201ctrust, with the living members as trustees of an inheritance that they must strive to enhance and pass on\u201d.</p> <p>For both, \u201cprejudice\u201d was the key social cement. \u201cOur most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable,\u201d Scruton insisted, \u201cand the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss.\u201d The <a href=\"https://newcriterion.com/issues/2003/2/why-i-became-a-conservative\" title=\"\">ideal society</a> was built not on values such as liberty or equality but on obedience, \u201cthe prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them. In the good society one accepted one\u2019s station in life.\u201d</p> <p>It was, for Scruton, impossible to conceive of society without prejudices and exclusions, discrimination and inequality. That\u2019s why his views, despite mellowing over the years, never substantially altered. Scruton the philosopher required Scruton the polemicist. Immigration, he claimed in a 2006 defence of Enoch Powell, had led to \u201cthe people of Europe\u2026 losing their homelands\u201d. He echoed Casey\u2019s argument about the inherent unsuitability of non-white immigrants, applying it this time not to blacks but to \u201cpious Muslims from the hinterlands of Asia\u201d who would never \u201cproduce children loyal to a secular European state\u201d. In 2007, he wrote that although homosexuality \u201chas been normalised, it is not normal\u201d.</p> <p>Scruton\u2019s ideas about society and nationhood possess, nevertheless, considerable appeal. In an age in which societies have become more fractured, and notions of belonging more fraught, many are drawn to Burkean ideas of social being. In trying to find an answer to the corrosive effects of liberal individualism, many have jettisoned a broader sense of liberalism. David Goodhart, for instance, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcnewsnight/status/986725734935769089?lang=en\" title=\"\">insisted</a>, in the wake of the Windrush scandal, on the necessity of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d policy. Academic Eric Kaufmann has suggested it is <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/10/white-majorities-feel-threatened-age-mass-%0Dmigration-and-calling-them-racist-won\" title=\"\">legitimate to restrict non-white immigration</a> \u201cso as not to disrupt radically the sense of ethnicity and nationhood of large numbers of people\u201d.</p> <p>Does all this mean that we can only embrace the need for society if we also accept illiberal policies?

      "bodyText": "I first met Roger Scruton almost 20 years ago at a symposium in Sweden. I admired the eloquence with which he could talk about Kant and the elegance of his writing on beauty. I learned from his conservatism, even as I disagreed with what he said. But although I got to know him quite well over the years, our relationship was always fraught. For there was another Roger Scruton, not the philosopher but the polemicist. For all his warmth and generosity, and for all the poise of his writing, his views were often ugly. \u201cWhatever its defects,\u201d Scruton wrote in his memoir Gentle Regrets, \u201cmy life has enabled me to find comfort in uncomfortable truths.\u201d His death last week seems an appropriate moment to reflect on the \u201cuncomfortable truths\u201d of Scruton\u2019s conservatism, and on the relationship between the philosopher and the polemicist. It was Scruton the polemicist who became the founding editor of the Salisbury Review, established in 1982 to defend a traditional conservatism that many felt was being eroded by the Thatcherite revolution. Today, the Review is remembered largely for the Ray Honeyford affair, in which the Bradford headmaster was forced to resign after a furore over a1984 article critical of multiculturalism. Honeyford\u2019s polemic was, however, bland by the standards of the Review in the 80s. The first issue published a talk by John Casey on the politics of race. The presence of \u201cWest Indian communities\u201d, he claimed, \u201coffends\u2026 a sense of what English life should be like\u201d and \u201ca sense of what is civilised behaviour\u201d. Only the \u201crepatriation of a proportion of the immigrant and immigrant-descended population\u201d could forestall \u201cthe possible destruction of civilised life in the centres of the big cities\u201d. If race was one obsession, sex was another, especially gay sex. \u201cA concern with social order,\u201d Scruton wrote in an editorial, \u201cprompts us to view\u2026 homosexuality as intrinsically threatening.\u201d In the 1980s, the Salisbury Review, and Scruton himself, was seen as occupying the fringes of politics. In many of the past week\u2019s eulogies, he was presented as a figure ostracised by political correctness but ultimately proved right. In fact, many old Salisbury Review authors, including Casey, have long since disavowed their views. Scruton said in 2010 that homosexuality was a \u201ccomplicated\u201d issue, but he no longer believed it to be \u201crepellent\u201d. The reactionary views about immigrants and gays do not however merely reflect the attitudes of a less enlightened time. They expose also the character of the conservatism that Scruton espoused, which drew deeply upon Edmund Burke\u2019s vision of society and human nature. Both men viewed society as a kind of \u201ctrust, with the living members as trustees of an inheritance that they must strive to enhance and pass on\u201d. For both, \u201cprejudice\u201d was the key social cement. \u201cOur most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable,\u201d Scruton insisted, \u201cand the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss.\u201d The ideal society was built not on values such as liberty or equality but on obedience, \u201cthe prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them. In the good society one accepted one\u2019s station in life.\u201d It was, for Scruton, impossible to conceive of society without prejudices and exclusions, discrimination and inequality. That\u2019s why his views, despite mellowing over the years, never substantially altered. Scruton the philosopher required Scruton the polemicist. Immigration, he claimed in a 2006 defence of Enoch Powell, had led to \u201cthe people of Europe\u2026 losing their homelands\u201d. He echoed Casey\u2019s argument about the inherent unsuitability of non-white immigrants, applying it this time not to blacks but to \u201cpious Muslims from the hinterlands of Asia\u201d who would never \u201cproduce children loyal to a secular European state\u201d. In 2007, he wrote that although homosexuality \u201chas been normalised, it is not normal\u201d. Scruton\u2019s ideas about society and nationhood possess, nevertheless, considerable appeal. In an age in which societies have become more fractured, and notions of belonging more fraught, many are drawn to Burkean ideas of social being. In trying to find an answer to the corrosive effects of liberal individualism, many have jettisoned a broader sense of liberalism. David Goodhart, for instance, insisted, in the wake of the Windrush scandal, on the necessity of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d policy. Academic Eric Kaufmann has suggested it is legitimate to restrict non-white immigration \u201cso as not to disrupt radically the sense of ethnicity and nationhood of large numbers of people\u201d. Does all this mean that we can only embrace the need for society if we also accept illiberal policies? That we have to choose between a liberal individualism that corrodes social life and a notion of a society that is intolerant and exclusionary? Burke developed his ideas in response not to liberal individualism but to a different kind of threat: the actions of what he called the \u201cswinish multitude\u201d, ordinary people acting collectively to transform the conditions of their lives. From struggles for suffrage to battles for decent working conditions, the swinish multitude challenged the traditional social order and through organisations such as trade unions nurtured new ideas of solidarity, community and belonging that confronted both the individualism of liberalism and the conservative demand for inequality and obedience. But as such organisations have crumbled in recent years, so have radical ideas of what society could be. For many, the only way to think of the \u201csocial\u201d today is through Burkean notions of exclusion and prejudice. But this is to abandon any notion of a society that can enhance the lives of those with least power \u2013 the working class, migrants, minorities, the swinish multitude. I am glad to have known Roger Scruton, grateful for our conversations, fractious though they often were, and saddened by his death. What I learned from him, however, only strengthened my conviction that I am not, and could never be, a conservative. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "The International Spy Museum in Washington DC features a waterboard used to make petrified detainees think their interrogators are drowning them. \u201cWould you be willing to have the US government torture suspected terrorists if they may know details about future attacks?\u201d it asks visitors. The US Senate found in 2014 that the waterboarding, the beating, the stripping, the sleep deprivation and the threats to prisoners\u2019 families produced no \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cvaluable\u201d intelligence. It succeeded only in driving inmates half-mad and disgracing the Bush administration and the CIA. If you don\u2019t know that torture does not produce intelligence, or if you know but don\u2019t care and enjoy the thought that real and alleged enemies will have their minds scrambled and bodies broken, you will answer the museum\u2019s question with an exuberant \u201chell, yeah, let my government torture\u201d. True to form, and from his first days in office, Donald Trump has said he believes torture \u201cabsolutely\u201d works. Boris Johnson\u2019s government is more slippery. It is vindicating Britain\u2019s reputation as perfidious Albion by maintaining it is against torture and war crimes, while working to give soldiers immunity from prosecution. Not that it says so openly. Britain will \u201censure there are no further unfair prosecutions of people who served their country when there is no new evidence to be brought forward\u201d, Johnson said last week. No one would have grounds to object if the government merely wanted to stop the hounding of honourable servicemen and women. In the 2010s the disgraced UK lawyer Phil Shiner made thousands of allegations against British soldiers who served in Iraq in the hope of winning compensation for \u201cvictims\u201d and, naturally, fees for himself. An inquiry that cost the public \u00a331m found the stories of murder and torture he propagated were \u201cdeliberate lies\u201d spread with the help of \u201csweeteners\u201d paid to an Iraqi middleman. Liberty and the Law Society had named him \u201csolicitor of the year\u201d in 2007. In 2017, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal struck him off. A government that is serious about limiting vexatious litigation has many options. The attorney general has powers to stop prosecutions that are against the public interest. If these powers could not be used in the case of the Iraq veterans, the government might reform and extend the law. Shiner lost his livelihood when he was struck off. Outsiders might think he got off lightly and that lawyers like him are engaged in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice or plain fraud. But although the Solicitors Regulation Authority sent a file to the National Crime Agency in 2017, no criminal prosecution followed. Johnson could tighten the law. He could compel the attorney general, the judiciary, police and prosecutors to take abuse of the legal process seriously. Everyone who has been on the receiving end of a \u201clawfare\u201d attack and seen rich men, corporations and special interest groups use the threat of legal action as a weapon to intimidate critics and hit them with enormous costs would rise from their seats and applaud. Nothing of the sort is happening. The government has fooled journalists \u2013 many of whom are on their knees and begging to be fooled, I should add in fairness \u2013 into believing it wants to stop fee-hungry lawyers exploiting vulnerable troops. Yet instead of offering restraints on the legal profession, the government is removing constraints on the armed forces. Ministers want to create a presumption that current or former personnel will not normally face prosecution for alleged offences committed in the course of duty abroad more than 10 years ago, and a new and partial defence, which would allow the courts to recognise the operational context in which soldiers murder. The British campaign group Freedom from Torture has asked which crimes that the British authorities now prosecute will get a free pass in future. Do they include torture or the execution of an enemy soldier who has surrendered? Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Russia use torture as a matter of routine and not to extract information. The Senate investigation that revealed the CIA\u2019s scandalous behaviour agreed Napoleon had it right when he said: \u201cThe poor wretches\u2026 say what they think the interrogator wants to hear.\u201d Or as The Report, Amazon\u2019s recent dramatisation of the Senate CIA inquiry, has Senator Dianne Feinstein say of the waterboarding of the Islamist suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: \u201cIf it works, why do you have to do it 183 times?\u201d States torture because they want to punish an enemy and leave scars on their beaten and raped opponents as a warning to others. Britain cannot condemn them if it is engaged in minimising military crime to the point of normalising it. The Ministry of Defence is saying nothing. It told me it could not answer questions until its consultations on legal changes are over. Another silence bothers me more.

The party\u2019s federal board set out a timetable on Saturday that nominations for candidates would open on 11 May and close on 28 May. The ballot for the new leader will start on 18 June and conclude on 15 July. Swinson resigned after losing her East Dunbartonshire seat in December\u2019s election to the SNP\u2019s Amy Callaghan by 149 votes. Swinson\u2019s defeat means the party has 11 seats, one fewer than after the 2017 election. The party says it has more than 100,000 members eligible to take part in the selection process. The former cabinet minister Sir Ed Davey and the party\u2019s president, Mark Pack, will continue as joint acting leaders of the Lib Dems until the election process is completed, the party said. Pack said: \u201cI want first to thank Jo Swinson for her determined leadership of the Liberal Democrats. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are the home for everyone who shares our vision of an outward-looking, caring country that celebrates diversity and benefits from high-quality public services. \u201cWith our party membership at record levels, I urge everyone else who shares our values to join us in the coming days and vote in the leadership election.\u201d Swinson became the party\u2019s first female leader last July after beating Davey to succeed Sir Vince Cable. Davey wrote on Twitter that the decision enables the Lib Dems to \u201cfocus on May\u2019s local elections and [the] election review can conclude\u201d. \u201cAs acting leader my priorities will not just be opposing Brexit but fighting for action against climate emergency &amp; providing a strong liberal, progressive voice in parliament.\u201d",

Teacher, 44, Newcastle A: Ay\u00f2b\u00e1mi Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u00f2, author of Stay With Me, which was shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction and the Wellcome book prize, writes: These books are all shorter than 250 pages and I chose them because of the remarkable characters that make them so unforgettable. While a couple can be categorised as novellas, all have an expansive vision that belies their length. Go Tell It on the Mountain, James Baldwin\u2019s lodestar debut, is a perfect book to begin with. In this lyrical meditation on faith and family, John, a 14-year-old boy who has grown up under the oppressive influence of a preacher stepfather experiences a dual awakening while the social and psychological complexities that undergird the lives of his mother, aunt and stepfather are excavated with a precision that compels compassion for even the most villainous character. In Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun, Sarah Ladipo Manyika illuminates lives that are often stereotyped or rendered invisible in many societies. With lucid prose, the book creates a layered and complex protagonist in the indomitable Dr Morayo Da Silva \u2013 a Porsche-loving retired English professor who must balance her determination to live on her own terms with the realities of old age. Kopano Matlwa\u2019s Evening Primrose weaves the endometriosis and period pain of a young doctor called Masechaba into a fragmented yet cohesive narrative. Structured around her journal entries, the book blends the intimate and political to create visceral and poignant motifs about its narrator and post-apartheid South Africa. \u201cYou, though, are as beautiful as light splitting through glass,\u201d writes Janice Pariat in her poignant and exquisite The Nine-Chambered Heart, foregrounding the novel\u2019s splintered yet luminous portraiture of one woman\u2019s life through the perspectives of her lovers and would-be lovers. As the nine narrators recall their interactions with this woman, what emerges is a figure who is at once real and mythical, the pulsing heart of an enthralling book.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maaza-mengiste\" title=\"\">Maaza Mengiste\u2019s</a> second novel, <em>The Shadow King</em>, is a reimagination of Italy\u2019s invasion of Ethiopia. Told from a range of perspectives, it focuses on the experience of the Ethiopian women who played a vital role in winning the war, as well as that of the Italian soldiers and the exiled king, Haile Selassie. Mengiste was born in Ethiopia in 1974, but her family fled the Ethiopian revolution when she was a child (a history she explored in her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/24/benath-lions-gaze-maaza-mengiste\" title=\"\"><em>Beneath the Lion\u2019s Gaze</em></a>). She lives in New York and spoke to us from Zanzibar.</p> <p><strong>Your first novel clearly drew on personal history</strong><strong>. Did this new subject feel more distant from your own </strong><strong>experience?</strong><br>It was not until I was well into my research for this book, when I was on a trip to Ethiopia, just visiting some of the locations where the battles were set, that my mother very casually mentioned the story of my great-grandmother who had enlisted to fight on the frontlines.</p> <p>My mother had been with me on so many research trips; I had told her so many times about the problems of finding women, how it felt so often that I was reaching in the dark trying to capture these women, who would evaporate into the air, and here was one of them in my own family. I remember I turned to her and said: \u201cWhy did you never tell me this?\u201d Because I had met my great-grandmother before she passed away. And she looked at me and said: \u201cWell, you never asked.\u201d And I thought, \u201cOh my God, this is what happens.\u201d</p> <p>The language of war is always masculine, and we automatically position history in terms of what men did. It was the same with my great-grandmother.</p> <p><strong>Did you ever think of writing a factual account of the female fighters in this colonial war?</strong><br>I was really interested in looking at the kinds of truth that perhaps historians couldn\u2019t tell, because they\u2019re so indebted to data and to finding hard evidence. As a novelist, if I found one or two or three women, I could say I suspect there are more and I could work with that.</p> <p><strong>You learn</strong><strong>ed Italian</strong><strong> to research this book. Did that bring you closer to the experience of the </strong><strong>fascist soldiers?</strong><br><strong> </strong>I was touring for the first book and went to Calabria, in the south of Italy. I understood that many of the foot soldiers in 1935 were from Calabria, and from Sicily. The generals came from the north. The southern people of Italy, their blood is in Ethiopian ground.</p> <p>I was in a tiny bookstore in a small town in Calabria, and during the question and answer session a man stood up and said: \u201cI would like to talk to you about 1935.\u201d The entire room tensed up.</p> <p>Italy has not talked about this history; it\u2019s still difficult for Italians to comprehend what they did in east Africa. A few people grumbled for him to sit down. But he was visibly shaken and emotional. He told me that his father was a pilot during the war. He said: \u201cMy father dropped poison on your people. How do I ask for your forgiveness?\u201d And he started crying.</p> <p>It was at that moment that I said to myself: \u201cMy God, this history is not done, this war that feels distant but is not distant. There\u2019s still the question, How do we bridge this gap between us?\u201d</p> <p><strong>One of the </strong><strong>devices </strong><strong>in the novel is descriptions of photo</strong><strong>s taken by one of the characters</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>I\u2019m very interested in the middle ground between what\u2019s visible and invisible in a photograph. When we see a photo of an Ethiopian prisoner, are we seeing the prisoner or are we seeing the Italian photographer who took it? That photo is not a statement about Ethiopia, it\u2019s a statement about Italian colonial power, about masculinity, about cruelty. It reflects back on the photographer and the Italians that it\u2019s framing. It\u2019s a language of violence and power.

He also repeated an erroneous claim that the Iraqi was \u201cthe head of Hezbollah\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Addressing Republican donors at his Florida resort on Friday night, Donald Trump said Qassem Suleimani was \u201csaying bad things about our country\u201d before the US president authorised the drone strike which killed the Iranian general and pitched the Middle East to the brink of war. \u201cHow much of this shit do we have to listen to?\u201d Trump said he asked. \u201cHow much are we going to listen to?\u201d The speech was not open to reporters but CNN obtained a recording of Trump\u2019s remarks at Mar-a-Lago, which it said undermined official explanations for the decision to kill Suleimani at Baghdad airport on 3 January. The White House has claimed Iran posed an \u201cimminent\u201d threat to US interests and lives. Trump\u2019s own statements, including the claim that four embassies were threatened, have muddied the water considerably. He has also claimed \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter\u201d whether the attack was imminent or not or whether his advisers were in agreement, because of \u201cthe terrorist\u201d Suleimani\u2019s \u201chorrible past\u201d. Congress was not informed of the strike in advance, its eventual notification was heavily classified and a congressional briefing prompted bipartisan protest. Democrats have proposed legislation to rein the president in. The death of Suleimani prompted Tehran to launch retaliatory rocket strikes on US targets in Iraq. Having said no one was hurt, the Trump administration said on Friday 11 US service members in fact suffered blast-related concussions. Iran has also admitted shooting down a Ukrainian passenger jet in error, killing 176 people. Amid anti-regime protests in Tehran, the threat of a US-Iran war has receded. In the audio from Florida, CNN reported, \u201cTrump did not describe an \u2018imminent threat\u2019\u201d but \u201cdescribed Suleimani as a \u2018noted terrorist\u2019 who \u2018was down on our list\u2019.\u201d Trump also described listening to US military officials as they narrated the strike. \u201cThey\u2019re together sir,\u201d Trump said he was told. \u201cSir, they have two minutes and 11 seconds. No emotion. \u2018Two minutes and 11 seconds to live, sir. They\u2019re in the car, they\u2019re in an armoured vehicle. Sir, they have approximately one minute to live, sir. Thirty seconds. Ten, nine, eight ...\u2019 \u201cThen all of a sudden, boom. \u2018They\u2019re gone, sir. Cutting off.\u2019\u201d \u201cI said, where is this guy? That was the last I heard from him.\u201d Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, was also killed. The pro-Iranian Iraqi militia was responsible for rocket attacks on US targets in December which wounded troops and killed a contractor, prompting US strikes in retaliation which lead in turn to a siege of the US embassy in Baghdad. Reporting in the US has cited the embassy siege as a motivation for the strike on Suleimani, as Trump did not want to look weak. Nor did he reportedly wish to be compared to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who were in power when a facility in Benghazi was attacked in September 2012 and a US ambassador killed. According to CNN, Trump told his audience in Florida the death of al-Muhandis meant the US took out \u201ctwo for the price of one\u201d. He also repeated an erroneous claim that the Iraqi was \u201cthe head of Hezbollah\u201d. Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed militant group based in Lebanon. Trump also reportedly repeated his claim that the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was \u201cscreaming, going crazy\u201d when he was killed by US special forces in Syria in October. US officials have declined to elaborate on that claim. CNN said the audio of Friday\u2019s speech also included a complaint that Conan, a Belgian Malinois dog wounded in the Baghdadi raid, \u201cbecame very famous\u201d and \u201cgot more credit than I did\u201d. After the raid Trump welcomed Conan to the White House, where he praised it expansively. Conan became a media talking point, not least because of prolonged confusion fed by conflicting official statements, over whether it was a girl or a boy. According to Reuters, the Mar-a-Lago event raised $10m for the president\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee. The White House did not immediately comment.",

While a guest on James Corden\u2019s Carpool Karaoke in December, Eilish said she had been writing music since she was aged six \u2013 with a self-aware eye-roll at how precocious that might sound. She performed one of her first compositions for Corden, a ukulele-driven song that featured the line, \u201cWe lay all day in a comfy bed / What a wonderful life\u201d. The teen-goth pessimism and angsty hyperbole for which she would become known was yet to emerge.</p> <p>When it came, it was magnificent, brooding and appealed across generations.

Throughout 2019, Eilish hoovered up awards and accolades. She was nominated for the Grammys and MTV Awards, and is up for best international female at the Brits. She was Billboard\u2019s woman of the year, and Spin and the Guardian both named her artist of the year. Her fanbase is as broad as it is substantial. She appeals across the generations, though the devotion of younger fans is so fierce they have been known to burst into tears on meeting her. \u201cShe was the same age as her fans for a long time,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey were her peers, and she has a real connection with them.\u201d As well as a similarity in age, that connection is built on Eilish\u2019s perceived openness and candour. \u201cWhat\u2019s different now, compared with 10 years ago, is that artists are allowed to say what\u2019s on their mind more,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cShe\u2019s a reflection of that change, but she\u2019s also driving it.\u201d Eilish has discussed her mental health, and revealed that she has Tourette\u2019s syndrome, albeit after being forced to do so by fans putting together a compilation of tics captured during various video interviews. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want it to define who it was,\u201d she told Ellen Degeneres, on her chat show. \u201cReally, it\u2019s just a bunch of tics.\u201d She seems to handle her considerable fame (she has almost 50 million Instagram followers, and is one of the most-streamed artists on Spotify) with preternatural maturity, and is largely positive about her experience in the limelight. \u201cI never had any issues with people trying to pull me in a different direction,\u201d she told Williams. \u201cI think that might just be because I\u2019ve always been the kind of person that knows what the fuck I want, and if it\u2019s not what I want, I am not going to do it.\u201d She\u2019s the Bond guy. Duh.

      "body": "<p>Others may have grabbed most attention on the first three days here, notably Ollie Pope and Dom Bess, but the performance of Mark Wood in his first Test for 11 months has given England cause for real excitement for next week\u2019s series finale in Johannesburg.</p> <p>Coming into this match, the Durham fast bowler had not played competitive cricket since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\" title=\"\">England\u2019s World Cup final win against New Zealand at Lord\u2019s</a> in July. Despite having to battle back from a combination of knee and side injuries, Wood appears to have lost none of his pace.</p> <p>In his last Test appearance, against West Indies at St Lucia last February, the 30-year-old sent down one of the quickest spells seen by an England bowler as he claimed his maiden Test five-wicket haul. Although he did not quite reach the 95mph he clocked in that match, Wood was back bowling consistently above 90mph here and it has only been through luck rather than the judgment of South Africa\u2019s batsmen he has not yet taken a wicket.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/dom-bess-takes-five-wickets-rain-dropped-catches-south-africa-england-third-test-day-three\">Dom Bess takes five wickets but rain, drops and South Africa stall England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wood has come back from injury numerous times, most seriously from three career-saving operations on his left ankle early in his international career. So it is remarkable he has not only retained his hunger to succeed at the highest level but also his pace.</p> <p>Many have likened Wood\u2019s skiddy style to that of Darren Gough, arguably England\u2019s best bowler of the 1990s who took 229 wickets in 58 Tests. There is probably no better judge of where Wood is right now then than the Yorkshireman, who worked as a bowling consultant for England on their tour of New Zealand before Christmas. \u201cI believe when Mark Wood gets it right he\u2019s England\u2019s quickest bowler,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of him, he\u2019s very similar to what I was \u2013 he\u2019s quicker than I was, but very similar. His spell in St Lucia last year was just devastating and you\u2019ve seen him bowl here at 91-92mph and it looked like 98mph. When he gets it right and he\u2019s fit and fresh he\u2019s unbelievable to watch.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to accept now he will get injured but he\u2019s come into this tour slimmer than I\u2019ve ever seen him. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing. Short-term it might be great.

      "bodyText": "Others may have grabbed most attention on the first three days here, notably Ollie Pope and Dom Bess, but the performance of Mark Wood in his first Test for 11 months has given England cause for real excitement for next week\u2019s series finale in Johannesburg. Coming into this match, the Durham fast bowler had not played competitive cricket since England\u2019s World Cup final win against New Zealand at Lord\u2019s in July. Despite having to battle back from a combination of knee and side injuries, Wood appears to have lost none of his pace. In his last Test appearance, against West Indies at St Lucia last February, the 30-year-old sent down one of the quickest spells seen by an England bowler as he claimed his maiden Test five-wicket haul. Although he did not quite reach the 95mph he clocked in that match, Wood was back bowling consistently above 90mph here and it has only been through luck rather than the judgment of South Africa\u2019s batsmen he has not yet taken a wicket. Wood has come back from injury numerous times, most seriously from three career-saving operations on his left ankle early in his international career. So it is remarkable he has not only retained his hunger to succeed at the highest level but also his pace. Many have likened Wood\u2019s skiddy style to that of Darren Gough, arguably England\u2019s best bowler of the 1990s who took 229 wickets in 58 Tests. There is probably no better judge of where Wood is right now then than the Yorkshireman, who worked as a bowling consultant for England on their tour of New Zealand before Christmas. \u201cI believe when Mark Wood gets it right he\u2019s England\u2019s quickest bowler,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of him, he\u2019s very similar to what I was \u2013 he\u2019s quicker than I was, but very similar. His spell in St Lucia last year was just devastating and you\u2019ve seen him bowl here at 91-92mph and it looked like 98mph. When he gets it right and he\u2019s fit and fresh he\u2019s unbelievable to watch. \u201cI\u2019ve come to accept now he will get injured but he\u2019s come into this tour slimmer than I\u2019ve ever seen him. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing. Short-term it might be great. But he\u2019s had to work hard to get back to his full fitness.\u201d The Wanderers, the venue for the final Test of this series that starts on Friday, has a reputation as one of the quickest pitches in the world. England may be tempted to field an all-seam attack there and if Jofra Archer recovers from the elbow injury that has ruled him out of the past two Tests, the prospect of him teaming up with Wood is a tantalising one. Before play started on this third day, Archer was on the outfield bowling quicker than he has at any point since sustaining his injury during training on New Year\u2019s Day in Cape Town. The prospects then for England to field two men who can comfortably exceed 90mph in Johannesburg are hopeful, although the real aim for Joe Root will be making sure both are fit and firing when the next Ashes series starts in Australia next year. \u201cI am excited about Jo\u2019burg,\u201d says Gough. \u201cIf Wood gets through this game I\u2019d love to see him and Archer there. But the dream would be to see them two together during the Ashes. I\u2019d love to see that and I\u2019d want to be at that game to see it as well.\u201d Archer has found Test cricket far harder this winter than he did during his debut summer in England, when he took 22 Australian wickets at 20.27 apiece. Gough, who worked with the 24-year-old in New Zealand, says: \u201cEvery Test you\u2019re learning and Jofra has found it difficult this winter. A lot of his cricket the last two years has been 50-over and 20-over. I think it got in his mind early on in New Zealand that the pitches were slow and flat and he never got over that. \u201cI still believe that\u2019s a massive learning curve for him. He\u2019s still young, we expect a lot out of him but you have got to remember he\u2019s learning on the job. I still think he\u2019s an amazing talent. He has got a massive part to play for England for many, many years.\u201d Hopefully alongside Wood.",

Roy Hodgson loves testing himself against Pep Guardiola and has done pretty well in the past. The Eagles were victorious at the Etihad last season thanks to a helluva strike from Andros Townsend, so the former England boss will be hoping for similarly positive result this time around with his ramshackle bunch. Wilfried Zaha will also been keen to show what he can do against a side not known for its defensive competence as he looks to prove he should be playing for a top four side. </p> <p>There is also a fascinating tussle at the Emirates where Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal welcome Sheffield United, a side in fantastic form and looking up the league rather than down. The Basque has put an imprint on this Arsenal side already, making them more creative and energetic, with slightly more competent back four to go with it. Chris Wilder has certainly got his trademark pending on the Blades with their aggressive and slick style of play which few have been able to cope with since their promotion and will undoubtedly cause problems in north London.</p> <p>Is it too early to discuss \u2018six-pointers\u2019? Well, Norwich host Bournemouth in a must-win match for both sides as they look to arrest their miserable form and give themselves some hope of staying up. It\u2019s 20th versus 19th and neither side has won in their last five games and really something needs to budge if they are to give themselves a sniff of survival.</p> <p><strong>3pm kick-offs:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Arsenal v Sheffield United</li> <li>Brighton v Aston Villa</li> <li>Manchester City v Crystal Palace</li> <li>Norwich v Bournemouth</li> <li>Southampton v Wolves</li> <li>West Ham v Everton</li> </ul> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, that is all from me. Thanks for joining me. The football is not over, though. Join Scott Murray for Newcastle v Chelsea. Pukki the man for Norwich again. Norwich will be boosted by their win over relegation rivals Bournemouth but look set to lose key centre-back Godfrey for a few games at his sending off today, which is a blow. Not sure this will change things ... Ben Fisher witnessed a cracker at St Mary\u2019s ... Nick Ames was our man at Arsenal v Sheffield United. Where would Aston Villa be without Grealish? All even at West Ham. Football League results: The title race was over in November, so I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about City dropping more points at home. A decent last 10 minutes at the Etihad ... I think this lad might make it ... A Scottish update from Simon McMahon: \u201cNo big shocks in the Scottish Cup today, the closest being at Pittodrie where Dumbarton, sixth in Scottish League One, held Aberdeen until the 86th minute before a Sam Cosgrove penalty won it for the Dons. Giant killers of the day award therefore goes to Ayr, third in the Scottish Championship, who beat SPL Ross County 1-0, and there were comfortable wins for Hamilton, Hearts, Kilmarnock, St. Johnstone and St. Mirren.\u201d Regrets, I\u2019ve had a few ... Arsenal 1-1 Sheffield United Brighton 1-1 Aston Villa Manchester City 2-2 Crystal Palace Norwich 1-0 Bournemouth Southampton 2-3 Wolves West Ham 1-1 Everton A big win for Norwich as both sides end with 10 men. Maupay and (I think) Konsa have a little scuffle at the end after something was said. What a comeback! Aguero thought he had won it but Fernandinho turned the ball into his own net late on. The points are shared, which seems about right. A throughly deserved point for the Blades who put in a cracking display. Will we get some more drama in the final stages?! A VAR check at West Ham looks set to result in Ajeti being sent off just minutes after coming on. The striker seemed to headbutt Holgate but the officials don\u2019t seem to think it merits a red. Zaha gets past Stones, whacks it across the goal and all Fernandinho can do is divert it into this own net! WHAT A PLAYER! WHAT A MAN! When City need something special they can always rely on Aguero who moves superbly to head home a Mendy cross from the left. Martinelli endorsed. A decent record ... Robinson fires in a cross, which Sharp wins and then Fleck fires the ball home to level things up and it thoroughly deserved. Jesus sends in a cross from the left and Aguero does the rest with a lovely finish. Eight minutes left on the clock. Ancelotti has brought on Niasse. Bold. Barry Bryan is as confused as the rest of us, he writes: \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but I thought I at least understood the new handball rule. Now I\u2019m just totally lost.\u201d What a turn around at St Mary\u2019s as Jimenez completes a cracking counter-attack. WHAT A CRACKER! Douglas Luiz sends the ball into Grealish, who controls it, drives into the box and smashes it into the net on the half-volley. Godfrey goes over the top on Callum Wilson. It goes to VAR and then the referee wanders over to the monitor at the side of the pitch. It\u2019s a reckless challenge and Paul Tierney belatedly produces the red card. Casemiro gets his second of the match to make it Real Madrid 2-1 Sevilla. We all know VAR needs work. Will it get it, though? PENALTY TO MAN CITY?! Riedewald sees the ball bounce onto his arm in the box. The referee gives it but it goes to VAR and it is NOT GIVEN. Pukki fluffs his lines after getting beyond the Bournemouth defence, getting one-on-one with the goalkeeper only to put it too close to Ramsdale who gets down to save. Redmond dribbles round a couple of Wolves players and launches a shot but it clips the crossbar and goes over. De Jong quickly levels things for Sevilla at Real Madrid! \u201cJesus coming on for Man City. Well, they certainly need a miracle if they\u2019re to win the league this season,\u201d says Simon McMahon. They certainly do. After the long VAR delay, Jimenez steps up and converts from the spot, sending McCarthy the wrong way. Wolves are calling for a penalty where Jonny is squashed by Soares and Stephens, the latter catching the wing-back. VAR is checking ... it must be ... surely ... they are looking ... it is a pen! No surprise at the Etihad, where Jesus is stripped off and preparing to come on. Fleck whips in a corner, McBurnie heads towards the net only to see his effort cleared off the line. So close to an equaliser. Casemiro has put Real Madrid ahead against Sevilla. A shame about the answers ... Haaland now has a hat-trick for Dortmund! Traore gets past his man on the right, crosses into the box for Neto to chest down and fire beyond McCarthy. VAR checks it for handball but it\u2019s all fine. WHAT A SAVE! Aguero has a shot blocked and then Guaita gets out quickly to repel Silva\u2019s follow-up. City really need to up things at the Etihad. Sheffield Wednesday are now 4-0 down against Blackburn. Lewis Holtby has scored two of those. Ancelotti has taken off Bernard and replaced him with teenager Anthony Gordon at West Ham. A bold substitution. Not a bad debut from Haaland, scoring twice within 15 minutes of coming on. I think he might be quite good. Haaland has put Dortmund 4-3 up at Augsburg! Charles Antaki writes: \u201cI\u2019m sure that it\u2019s been noted before, but when the TV dwells on Chris Wilder in the Sheffield Utd dugout, it immediately brings to mind an older, grittier, more hard-bitten version of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Also a more successful and fulfilled one, but he doesn\u2019t look it, to his credit.\u201d I\u2019ve not seen it mentioned before ... Here we go again! Tony Barr on VAR: \u201cAt first look I thought Stones had shouldered him off the ball. No foul. \u201cThe replay shows he clearly didn\u2019t get the ball and tripped Zaha - how the hell did the VAR ref review it and not see that? \u201cUnless of course they didn\u2019t review it..or I\u2019m more biased that I though.\u201d Augsburg and Borussia Dortmund are currently drawing 3-3 with half an hour remaining. Haaland and Sancho on the scoresheet. Simon McMahon with an update from Scotland: \u201cHalf time in Scotland, Will, and some SPL teams have work to do to avoid a shock against lower league opposition. Aberdeen are being held 0-0 by Dumbarton, Ayr lead Ross County 1-0, Raith are up at Livingston by the only goal, and St. Mirren are level 0-0 at home to Broxburn. In the league it\u2019s Cove 2 Cowdenbeath 0.\u201d JR emails: \u201cThe contest for the funniest moment of the weekend is over! In the Mike Dean 500 game at the Emirates around the 19th minute Oli McBurnie got kicked in the, um, bathing suit area. When Mike Dean realised this he had himself a little chuckle then, as the physio was approaching him you could see Mike Dean say to him very clearly \u2018Balls\u2019.\u201d As a Manchester City fan, I am used to these frustrating performances now. Get Jesus on a half-time and go two up top. Arsenal 1-0 Sheffield United Brighton 1-0 Aston Villa Manchester City 0-1 Crystal Palace Norwich 1-0 Bournemouth Southampton 2-0 Wolves West Ham 1-1 Everton Ozil and Lacazette combine well to get the ball out to the wing for a cross to be whipped in which Martinelli reacts, gets into space taps the ball into an empty net. In-form striker Calvert-Lewin reacts first to Holgate\u2019s glancing header from a cross to divert the ball home. Our man in East London. Trossard absolutely thwacks one beyond Reina to give Brighton the lead after good work from Maupay. Snodgrass whips in a cross from the right and Diop does the rest with a header in off the post. And City pay the price! Cenk Tosun is allowed a free header after Cahill wins the first header from a corner, allowing the Turkish striker to complete the job. It\u2019s their first attempt on goal and they\u2019ve made it count. City are being frustrated by Palace but they are not helping themselves with some slow passing and movement by their standards. Expect a rocket from Pep and a few changes if nothing changes. A rare goal for Shane Long - a first in 19 games. Soares crosses into the box for Long to make a run and flick the ball into the net beyond Rui Patricio. Southampton have certainly made the most of being on top. A proud record lost. A huge goal in the relegation battle as Pukki steps up and whacks the ball down the middle! Norwich are a goal and a man to the good. Bournemouth are down to 10 men after Cook dives to fantastically tip a shot onto the post. Sadly, Cook is a centre-back and that is a certain handball. There\u2019s a VAR check for some reason or other. Sheffield United are putting Arsenal in their place at the Emirates but have yet to test Leno. Southampton are now very much in charge against Wolves since going ahead. Soares almost makes it 2-0 but his header at the back post is directed straight at compatriot Rui Patricio. Now Sheffield Wednesday are down to 10 men after Massimo Luongo is dismissed. Holtby just keeps working his magic. Players you\u2019ve forgotten about No 37383: Lewis Holtby has put Blackburn ahead at Sheffield Wednesday. Swansea loanee Rhian Brewster has equalised for Swansea against Wigan. The first of many in his career? Noble lifts the ball into the box for Haller to head towards goal but he does not trouble Pickford. VAR CHECK! Zaha goes down in the area after Stones leaves a leg out. The referee on the pitch gives nothing and he is backed up by the official at Stockley Park. Many would disagree. Ward-Prowse whips in set-piece which no Wolves player can deal with, allowing defender Bednarek to calmly steer it home. Manchester City are certainly knocking on the door. Aguero has just whacked one into Guaita\u2019s face and then De Bruyne has crashed against the bar. Gosling gets on the end of a Harry Wilson cross but gets too much onto it. He is given offside, anyway, but it is a sign of content. Mousset and McBurnie are taking the attack to Arsenal\u2019s questionable defence, who are just holding it together. Sheffield United are controlling proceedings at the Emirates. Jordan Ayew is supposed to be tracking back for Crystal Palace but you will be unsurprised to hear he is not and that is allowing Mendy plenty of space. He has already put in four crosses in the opening stages. City very much on top. Jude Bellingham has put Birmingham a goal up against Cardiff. Will the teenager still be at St Andrew\u2019s when the transfer window closes? Plenty of Premier League teams have an eye on him. Wolves are on top at Southampton with Moutinho whipping in a couple of dangerous corners into the box but nothing has come of them. Crystal Palace look set to stick at least nine men behind the ball for the entire game and they seem pretty happy to sit back and rely on Zaha to counter-attack. Mendy already looks dangerous going down the left with a couple of dangerous crosses. There go the whistles all round the country. Bubbles are blowing around Stratford, so we must be closing on kick-off. Are the wheels coming off for Leeds? Mary Waltz wants United to pay up: \u201cAfter United is dragged around the pitch Sunday the 68 million will seem reasonable.\u201d The report from Vicarage Road ... Manchester United do need some new players ... Lots of milestones today ... It\u2019s all about Mike. Today he referees his 500th Premier League match. This is how close Spurs were winning in injury-time: Birthday boy! Simon McMahon is here to fill the gaps I leave short of the border: \u201c Scottish Cup fourth round today, though tie of the round is not until tomorrow when high flying Championship leaders Dundee United welcome Hibs to Tannadice. The pick of today\u2019s matches with potential for upsets include Aberdeen v Dumbarton, Ayr v Ross County, Bonnyrigg v Clyde, Hamilton v Edinburgh City, Hearts v Airdrieonians, Kilmarnock v Queens Park, and St. Mirren v Broxburn. Partick Thistle v Celtic is a tea time kick off. Worth mentioning also the Scottish League Two fixture between leaders Cove Rangers and chasing Cowdenbeath, aka the Blue Brazil.\u201d Deeney saw a penalty saved and Lamela had a last-gasp chance cleared off the line to ensure the game ended goalless. All the transfers! Sheffield United\u2019s forwards will be hopeful of getting some spare change out of an Arsenal back four consisting of Maitland-Niles, Mustafi, Luiz and Saka. Pepe Reina comes straight into the Aston Villa XI after arriving from Milan this week. Can he make the difference in the relegation battle? Sterling up against Riedeweld could be fun if Guardiola decides to go that way. It\u2019s more likely to be Bernardo Silva against the left-back, which also seems a mismatch. Norwich: Krul, Aarons, Zimmermann, Godfrey, Byram, Tettey, McLean, Buend\u00eda, Duda, Cantwell, Pukki Subs: Trybull, Drmic, Rupp, Hanley, Hern\u00e1ndez, Lewis, F\u00e4hrmann Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Smith, Cook, Ak\u00e9, Rico, Billing, Lerma, Gosling, Wilson, Wilson, Fraser Subs: Surridge, Simpson, Cook, Boruc, Solanke, Francis, Surman Southampton: McCarthy, Soares, Stephens, Bednarek, Redmond, Hojbjerg, Ward-Prowse, Redmond, Armstrong, Long, Ings Subs: Gunn, Vestergaard, Adams, Djenepo, Romeu, Boufal, Obafemi Wolves: Patricio, Doherty, Coady, Saiss, Jonny, Dendoncker, Moutinho, Neves, Neto, Traore, Jimenez Subs: Ruddy, Jordao, Gibbs-White, Giles, Kilman, Ashley-Seal, Rasmussen Brighton: Ryan, Webster, Dunk, Propper, Stephens, Bernardo, Alzate, Mooy, Connolly, Maupay, Trossard Subs: Button, Duffy, Bissouma, Gross, Jahanbakhsh, Murray, Montoya Aston Villa: Reina, Konsa, Mings, Hause, Guilbert, Nakamba, Drinkwater, Targett, El Ghazi, Grealish, Trezeguet Subs: Nyland, Chester, Luiz, Lansbury, Hourihane, Elmohamody, Vassilev West Ham: Randolph, Cresswell, Zabaleta, Diop, Ogbonna, Noble, Rice, Fornals, Snodgrass, Lanzini, Haller Subs: Martin, Reid, Balbuena, Cardoso, Masuaku, Ajeti, Ngakia Everton: Pickford, Coleman, Dige, Mina, Holgate, Davies, Delph, Bernard, Walcott, Kean, Calvert-Lewin.

Subs: Verrips, Sharp, Robinson, Jagielka, Freeman, Osborn, Besic. Speaking of being busy in January ... Norwich have brought in a couple of new faces from the Bundesliga this week in the form of Ondrej Duda and Lukas Rupp. Will they slot into the side today and can they make the requisite difference to the team? Could Reiss Nelson start for Arsenal today? How will City lineup today? Will Pep start Aguero and Jesus once more? Will he stick Sterling up against whichever left-back Hodgson is forced to play? Who will be at the back? Will Angelino be brought back in for no reason whatsoever? Guardiola is not looking up. Ps Happy Birthday, Pep! Good afternoon! In a strange turn of events for a Saturday at 3pm there are plenty of intriguing games happening in the Premier League. Firstly, Manchester City host Crystal Palace. Roy Hodgson loves testing himself against Pep Guardiola and has done pretty well in the past. The Eagles were victorious at the Etihad last season thanks to a helluva strike from Andros Townsend, so the former England boss will be hoping for similarly positive result this time around with his ramshackle bunch. Wilfried Zaha will also been keen to show what he can do against a side not known for its defensive competence as he looks to prove he should be playing for a top four side. There is also a fascinating tussle at the Emirates where Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal welcome Sheffield United, a side in fantastic form and looking up the league rather than down. The Basque has put an imprint on this Arsenal side already, making them more creative and energetic, with slightly more competent back four to go with it. Chris Wilder has certainly got his trademark pending on the Blades with their aggressive and slick style of play which few have been able to cope with since their promotion and will undoubtedly cause problems in north London. Is it too early to discuss \u2018six-pointers\u2019? Well, Norwich host Bournemouth in a must-win match for both sides as they look to arrest their miserable form and give themselves some hope of staying up. It\u2019s 20th versus 19th and neither side has won in their last five games and really something needs to budge if they are to give themselves a sniff of survival. 3pm kick-offs: Arsenal v Sheffield United Brighton v Aston Villa Manchester City v Crystal Palace Norwich v Bournemouth Southampton v Wolves West Ham v Everton",

      "bodyText": "Thank you for following our coverage of today\u2019s Labour leadership hustings in Liverpool. Diane Abbott\u2019s take on the hustings. Reaction to the deputy leadership hustings from the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. In her closing remarks, Allin-Khan said she \u201cgets modern multiculturalism and racism\u201d given her Polish and Pakistani heritage. And she \u201clives public service\u201d as she still does hospital shifts as a doctor in the NHS. That brings to an end the hustings event from Liverpool. Murray said \u201cstatistically he is more likely to be in jail then in Parliament\u201d as he was brought up by on a council estate in Scotland. He also pledged to go to all of the seats the party won, lost and are never likely to win to learn. Burgon vows to be a campaigning deputy leader rather than a \u201cmischief maker or leader in waiting\u201d. He concluded by saying \u201clet\u2019s fly together\u201d. Butler gets a rousing reception after highlighting her experience serving under two Labour prime ministers and Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet and \u201cnever being part of a coup\u201d. In her closing remarks, Rayner championed her Labour values and how to tackle child poverty and rooting out anti-semitism and discrimination from the party. Murray said he is not suggesting devolving the accountability but the power to do it. He added: \u201cScotland, Northern Ireland shows it works. it is not about moving departments but moving power.\u201d Allin-Khan revealed she is a life-long Liverpool FC fan, adding she would support having meetings across the country but \u201cpower has to go back to the people\u201d. Butler said: \u201cCan we start having shadow cabinet meetings around the country so we can discussions with you.\u201d Burgon revealed his dream is for the location of Parliament to be \u201chalfway between Leeds and Bradford.\u201d The candidates have all championed decentralising power from London. Rayner said it is \u201cimportant to move away from London. \u201cCoastal and rural areas also felt they haven\u2019t been given the support needed.\u201d Burgon also explained why he did not sign the ten pledges. \u201cI will support the Labour leader in fighting anti-Semitism. \u201cI won\u2019t be signing the ten pledges however because of some concerns I have. \u201cOutsourcing complaints and how that would work in practise. I want to work with all groups.\u201d Butler explains why she has not signed the ten pledges on addressing anti-Semitism and gets a positive reception from the audience. \u201cThe EHRC is investigating us at the moment, I am waiting for them to report. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush this, we have to get this right.\u201d She added: \u201cI hate racism, I have suffered it every single day. \u201cThe majority of people in the party are not racist nor anti-Semitic but there are a few which need to be booted out. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to be scared about having a debate about racism.\u201d Did you miss the leadership hustings? Here\u2019s a video highlighting the most important moments Allin Khan makes a commitment to fight austerity. She said: \u201cI grow up with one heater in the house and my little brother and I had to move it around room to room in order to stay warm. There are 3,000 homeless children in Wandsworth tonight, which is my borough, I know what hunger tastes like, I know what it feels like to be cold. It doesn\u2019t know or understand regional variation. It matters. You have a commitment from me, an unequivocal one that I will fight austerity with every fibre of my being. That is the reason why I joined the Labour party and that\u2019s the reason why I work in our NHS, and it\u2019s the reason I\u2019m standing to be deputy leader.\u201d All the other candidates have also spoken out fiercely against austerity. Burgon got a big round of applause when he defended Jeremy Corbyn. He said: \u201cI want to speak out against the demonisation of a decent man. There\u2019s no city in this country that knows as much as you do about how newspapers like the right wing Sun newspaper demonised decent people and that\u2019s why I was proud to take the Sun to court, be cross-examined by them for two days, defeat them in court and use the compensation to set up a local internship for young people in Leeds. \u201cJust as they demonised you in this city, they demonised Jeremy.\u201d On the manifesto, he said: \u201cI back our progressive policies in both the 2017 and 2019 manifesto. I do think we need to learn the lesson of this devastating election, defeat because our communities are suffering the consequences.\u201d While Rayner admits there wasn\u2019t an overarching message in Labour election manifesto, she said: \u201cI have nothing bad to say about what we were trying to achieve in our manifesto, which to me was socialism.\u201d In response to a question on party unity, Dawn Butler said: \u201cPeople talk about unity, but I walk the walk on unity. It\u2019s great everyone is talking about being united, but I walk that walk. I have served under two Labour prime ministers and they don\u2019t come around that often, but we need to get us back there again and we need a Labour government. I have served in the shadow cabinet and I would never, ever, ever, join a coup because no one votes for a disunited party.\u201d Candidates were first asked to spell out the key message from their campaign that can inspire the membersh. Rayner, the current-front runner for the position, said: \u201cThe key message is utilising every inch of our movement...energising it, and bringing us together to sell what socialism is about, what the labour movement is about. She added: \u201cMy role, my backstory talks about how we can unify the party and we can get behind our leader and that we win the next general election because I don\u2019t think we can wait any longer.\u201d There are five MPs running to be the deputy leader of the Labour party. This includes Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray, and Angela Rayner, who got the most nominations from the parliamentary Labour party. Afternoon, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the live-blog for a bit so Nadeem can have a break. PA media has some reactions from some of the Labour members at the leadership hustings. Most of those approached by PA Media said there was no \u201cknock-out\u201d blow by any of the candidates. Duncan Hannant, a member from Rochdale, said: I thought they all performed admirably. I do have concerns about Emily Thornberry and how she may be seen in the north. I\u2019ve seen her at the dispatch box, she\u2019s very good but in terms of going down with northern men or Workington man, I\u2019m not so sure. I think we need someone from the north and Nandy is I think the best option at this stage. Keith Hebron, from Bootle, Liverpool, said: I think probably the weakest was Jess. The person who spoke most about socialism and community was Long-Bailey. I will be supporting her. I think the issue on abortion may be an issue for her in the Labour Party. Danuta Brooke, from Sheffield, said: I thought they were all good candidates capable of leading the Labour Party. For me it is who would make the best opposition leader and for me, Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry would be best for that. A man from Riverside Labour Party in Liverpool, who did not want to give his name, said: \u201cMy personal view is the best person is Long-Bailey. I think she performed better than I thought she would, maybe she\u2019s had a negative press recently, so I was pleasantly surprised.\u201d Labour MP Wes Streeting tweeted: \u201cProud of (Jess Phillips) at the first Labour hustings - absolutely rooted in the issues and conversations that shift votes and win elections. \u201cMost importantly, a good-natured debate.\u201d Former Labour adviser Ayesha Hazarika believes Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey performed the best in the first public hustings. More from Paul Mason on the questions asked during the hustings. Journalist Paul Mason on the format of the debate where candidates gave monologues with no room for debate. Lewis Goodall\u2019s take on the leadership race - Some reaction to the hustings - In his closing remarks, Sir Keir said he has spent his lifetime campaigning against injustices. \u201cRising homelessness, people trapped in low pay, global corporations paying next to no tax, I think another future is possible only if we fight for it. \u201cWhen our movement is united it is unstoppable. \u201c I never want a night like that 12th December last year ever again for our party.\u201d Nandy concluded: \u201cFor 15 years we have been doing the same thing. \u201cWe need to make waves, make connections. Why not be the party of the migrant children that inspired me into politics? \u201cI know there hasn\u2019t been a leader who looks or sounds like me, but in Finland and New Zealand it has happened.\u201d In her closing speech, Thornberry said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be about who is going to take us to the left, right or centre but who should take us forward. \u201cI think I said I am a tough old bird. I represented the miners in the 1980s, stood up against the Iraq war. I want to be the campaigner in chief.\u201d Phillips said \u201cWe could be bold and get back into power in five\u201d rather than take safe option of another Tory government. \u201cWhen we win elections, we offer optimistic visions for the future that people actually believe in. \u201cWe need to be diverse to win. Celebrate immigration, provides cradle to grave care for everyone, never turn our back on Europe.\u201d In her closing remarks, Long-Bailey said \u201cI learnt my politics working in a pawn shop 18 years after Tory rule. You can really see when a government has washed its hands of the people. \u201cWe cannot afford to be despondent, we have to urgently rebuild.\u201d She also called for the end of the decentralisation of power in London and the \u201cgentlemen\u2019s club of Westminster\u201d. On climate change, Phillips said: \u201cWe have to turn a crisis into a genuine opportunity. \u201cInvestment in battery tech which provide jobs. As a mother of two sons with inhalers, this is our children\u2019s lives, we can only do that through investment.\u201d Nandy said: \u201cI saw what they did in Silicon Valley. Providing tax breaks and toughest environmental standards, their young people are designing [technologies] of the future whereas ours are building solar panels on the minimum wage.\u201d Sir Keir stressed \u201cthis is a global issue, we need the world to come together.\u201d On Labour\u2019s manifesto, most of the candidates talked about how difficult it was to sell as a package (Lisa Nandy) and said there was just too much in there but they didn\u2019t disagree with any of the policies (Emily Thornberry). In contrast, Jess Phillips was more blunt in her criticism: she talked about how the broadband policy got laughed at on the doorstep, and how there wasn\u2019t enough emphasis on crime in it. It feels like Phillips is shaping up to be the only candidate who is really trying to create some significant ideological distance between herself and Labour\u2019s 2019 policy platform. Long-Bailey championed the \u201cgreen industrial revolution, the biggest economic lever we have seen in a generation whether tidal power in Merseyside, solar panels on the top of schools and homes.\u201d On the climate crisis, Thornberry said we need a \u201cdeal which is internationalised, every country able to harness natural resources. \u201cWe can take the lead, we created the first industrial revolution.\u201d On the last election manifesto, Sir Keir said: \u201cMy rule is don\u2019t trash the last Labour government and don\u2019t trash the last four years because what Jeremy Corbyn brought to this party, he made us an anti-austerity party.\u201d He added the manifesto \u201cwas overloaded.\u201d Nandy said: \u201cWe need to understand the language of priority and security in their lives. The failure in the last three manifestos is the failure to tackle questions about social security and putting money back into people\u2019s pockets.\u201d Thornberry said: \u201cThe programme was a 25 year programme. The manifesto was too broad too ambitious, I couldn\u2019t keep up with it. There was too much in it.\u201d All the candidates made strong statements on the party\u2019s failure to deal with antisemitism. But some were stronger than others - most notably those who weren\u2019t part of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet. Jess Phillips pointed out that not everyone on the stage had, to her knowledge, been actively arguing for a stronger approach behind closed doors in recent months (something shadow cabinet members Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer, who followed her, strongly denied). Lisa Nandy said she never wants to see a situation again where Jewish Labour MPs were begging the party to adopt an internationally accepted definition of antisemitism with the people at the top saying \u201cwe know better\u201d, and was clear that there has been a monumental failure of leadership on this issue. Phillips said the manifesto \u201cwasnt strong enough on crime and security\u201d. What were the problems with the Labour manifesto? Long-Bailey said: \u201cI was proud of the green industrial reform. But we didnt have that shining conviction of making people\u2019s lives better than the previous generation.\u201d Sir Keir said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible to be critical of Israeli policies without being anti-Semitic. If you are anti-Semitic you shouldn\u2019t be in the Labour party, its simple as that. \u201cI would require a report every week to know what is happening.\u201d Nandy said: \u201cI am ashamed of where our party ended up. We gave the green light to anti-Semites. Never want to see again the response of top table of \u2018we know better than you\u2019 on the definition of anti-Semitism. Never again do I want to be door knocking with members of the party and be called racist. That starts with these pledges.\u201d Thornberry gets a huge cheer when she said: \u201cAnti-Semitism is a problem for society as a whole and for the Labour party. \u201cWe hold ourselves to a higher standard. Two years ago I made this point, you can, you must be critical of far right government of Netanyahu and what they are doing to Palestine. \u201cBut that is not the fault of the Jews and what\u2019s where racism begins.\u201d Phillips said: \u201cWe need a leader who has spoken out against antisemitism and other forms of harassment. \u201c I dont remember some of the people in this room who were there pushing for these fights. Jewish people were scared of Labour winning the election, that is deeply serious.\u201d On addressing anti-Semitism within Labour, Long-Bailey said: \u201cWe cannot allow that level of mistrust to happen again. We were not dealing with the issue effectively ands responding to complaints. I have signed up to the board of deputy pledges, I agree with many of the principles.\u201d She added that education is important to address conspiracy theories and smears. That was an inevitable question on the hostility of the media to the Labour Party. The answers were telling. Some candidates - especially Rebecca Long Bailey and Jess Phillips - chose to focus on the challenges they have personally faced in the media. The most convincing analysis came from Lisa Nandy - she argued that in seeking permission from voters to change the status quo, Labour are always going to be held to a tougher standard by the press, and it\u2019s something the party needs to confront head-on. On the Red Wall, Nandy said: \u201cOur task is bigger, rebuilding the Red Bridge from Lewisham to Leigh. \u201cWe don\u2019t know better than other parts of the country. We need to shift the centre of gravity in the UK. Moving Labour HQ out of central London would be a major symbol of change.\u201d Thornberry said: \u201cI\u2019ve visited 137 constituencies around the country. Whether dealing with deindustrialisation or saving our high streets, thats what I have heard. Also a credible opposition, so they believe what we can deliver.\u201d Phillips said\u201d \u201cPeople didn\u2019t trust us to deliver for our families or deliver what we said we were going to do. We wern\u2019t very optimistic, just talking about what was bad. \u201cWe need to understand the basics of what people talk about on their doorstep. No-one talks about federalism.\u201d Sir Keir said: \u201cWe have to win back in the Midlands and North and identify every reason that we lost. We have to celebrate what we have in our towns, the businesses and community spirit. \u201cBut we cannot just get back to where we were. We need to win in Scotland, Wales, South East and South West.\u201d How do you plan on rebuilding the Red Wall? Long-Bailey said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get our messaging right. People thought we were offering handouts instead of empowerment. We have to talk about aspiration. \u201cSweeping away things like the House of Lords and replacing it with an elected senate that represents our regions.\u201d The candidates are now speaking about getting tougher on social media and fake news and how the Conservatives ran a \u201cslicker\u201d and \u201cinsidious\u201d election campaign. And how trying to turn sections of the press will be insufficient. On beating Johnson, Sir Keir said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to unite our party or we wont win. I think I have the experience, skillset and determination. I have led a large organisation. We need to win the next general election.\u201d Long-Bailey: \u201cI have lived through the 40 years of deindustrialisation. That child from Old Trafford who saw her family struggle is angry. We do that through ambition. Make sure prosperity reaches every corner of our communities.\u201d Phillips: said: \u201cI have managed to take on Boris Johnson from the back benches and have silenced him. \u201cWe have got to start talking to people\u2019s hearts, in a language they can understand. \u201cThat\u2019s what Boris Johnson has done, \u2018make Brexit happens\u2019. This is the fight of our lives, and we are not even in the terrain. Johnson would be terrified at facing me.\u201d Nandy said: \u201cLabour needs to elect someone able to speak for both north, south, east and the west. \u201cThe next leader has to go out into the country and makes waves and empower the movement, thats what I have always done.\u201d Why are you the person to beat Boris? Thornberry said: \u201cI am a girly swot, I would quote things at him. He would look confused. You need to hold him to account. He doesnt care. He plays with people\u2019s lives. He was the single worst foreign secretary, I was part of exposing that.\u201d Sir Keir\u2019s Brexit stance: \u201cI think people are really fed up of it. \u201cEurope tore the Tory party apart for 40 years, we cannot allow it to tear us apart for 10-20 years.\u201d Long-Bailey said: \u201cWe have got to recognise Brexit will happen. We have to show a clear vision, what our place in the world is going to be. \u201cPeople talked about power being centralised in Brussels but Westminster is no different.\u201d On Brexit, Thornberry said: \u201cHe\u2019s [Johnson] not going to get a deal in 2020. I know, you know, he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cWe might be dealing with a no deal Brexit.\u201d Phillips said: \u201cWe have got to send that fight to Boris Johnson so in Grimsby to ensure he does what he promised on the side of a bus. Also in our London seats.\u201d On Brexit, Nandy said: \u201cWe should never allow the Tories to divide us. We have to raise our game. We must raise our game.\u201d Sir Keir said: \u201cWe have had far too much division. We want to come together, we have to end factualism. \u201cWe need to draw the strength, passion of our members together. Nandy: \u201cOur breadth is what gives us reach in the country. I love the energy and dynamism in our party in recent years and loyalty and experience. \u201cWe must raise the bar and move forward together.\u201d Thornberry: \u201cWe have to stick together. Every day we spend fighting in the media is a day lost fighting with the Tories. We need to have a leader from the heart of the party.\u201d Phillips: \u201cThe namecalling has been horrendous. Build a broad team of people. What we have found in the past few years is the membership felt they were not being included.\u201d The first question is how would you reunite the party? Long Bailey said: \u201cOver the last four years we haven\u2019t been united. It\u2019s not acceptable for our members to call other members a cult. Yes we will disagree but in private.\u201d Each candidate will have 40 seconds to answer each question with a stopwatch counting down. Liam Thorp said no interruptions or heckling allowed. All five leadership candidates are now on stage. The Liverpool Echo\u2019s political editor Liam Thorp is the host and joked there should be no mention of football today or the Liverpool and Everton rivalry. Each of the Labour leadership hopefuls must secure the backing of trade unions and local parties in order to make the final ballot. The five candidates need the support of five per cent of local parties or at least three affiliates - two must be unions - by February 14th to make the final ballot. Members of the public who join the party or become affiliated supporters before Monday will be eligible to vote in the contest. The hustings is set to get underway at 11:30am. Emily Thornberry warned earlier this week that Labour faces \u201ca long, tough road back to power\u201d after the party suffered its worst general election defeat since 1935. The Islington South and Finsbury MP, who narrowly secured the support from MPs to enter the race on Monday, insisted she was the best placed to oust Boris Johnson within five years. She said: \u201cBoris Johnson has all sorts of problems with women. \u201cAnd he is going to have an even bigger one if I become leader of the Labour Party. \u201cI think that he has a problem with women. \u201cI have spoken to a number of women who have said that the way he deals with them - and they are younger women - is that he flirts with them.\u201d Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey kicked off her campaign with a speech in Manchester, admitting the party did not talk enough about \u201caspiration\u201d. She also vowed to \u201cshake up\u201d the way government works, and put power into the hands of voters. She was asked why Labour had failed with voters, returning their worst electoral result since 1935. Mrs Long-Bailey said: \u201cI think for me we had some fantastic policies, I know because I helped write some of them, and really the message didn\u2019t resonate with our voters. \u201cAnd what we should have been talking about is aspiration.\u201d Deputy leadership candidates Rosena-Allin Khan, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner will also make also their case at today\u2019s event. Other events are planned in cities including Durham, Bristol, Cardiff, Nottingham, Glasgow and London, as well as in the West Midlands and Bedford over the coming weeks. The result of the contest will be announced on 4 April. Good morning. The first regional hustings in the Labour leadership race will kick off this morning. Sir Kier Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey are among those seeking support to take over from Jeremy Corbyn as party leader. Long-Bailey and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, officially launched their campaigns to lead Labour last night. Backbenchers Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy are also in the race to succeed Corbyn in the ballot. All five candidates are expected to appear at today\u2019s event in Liverpool to mark the start of their hustings tour around the UK.",

      "body": "<p>You can make a team run harder, recalibrate their tactics and offer everyone a clean slate, but you cannot correct an entire mentality in the space of a month. Mikel Arteta is finding out the hard way that Arsenal\u2019s lack of resolve is deep-rooted and the latest evidence, a third occasion during his six-game tenure in which they have thrown away a lead, carried a particular sting.</p> <p>Arsenal were rarely in too much trouble against a Sheffield United side that were, by Chris Wilder\u2019s admission, some way short of their best. But they did not exactly brim with threat themselves despite going ahead through a goal on the verge of half-time by their outstanding 18-year-old forward Gabriel Martinelli; efforts to kill the game off lacked conviction and John Fleck\u2019s well-taken equaliser ensured an outcome that was probably fair on a scrappy, stop-start afternoon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/manchester-united-baulk-sporting-bruno-fernandes-80-million-valuation\">Manchester United baulk at Sporting\u2019s \u00a368m valuation of Bruno Fernandes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed today, I think the performance deserved three points,\u201d Arteta said. He would probably have been celebrating them if, with just under 20 minutes to play, his side had been awarded a penalty after Jack O\u2019Connell appeared to illegally halt a weaving run in from the right by Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. The case was scrutinised by VAR after Mike Dean, refereeing his 500th Premier League game, opted not to penalise the defender and the decision taken at Stockley Park was the same. P\u00e9p\u00e9 had perhaps leaned in towards the right leg wafted out by O\u2019Connell, but contact seemed clear enough and the overriding impression was that Arsenal had been hard done by.</p> <p>Arteta described the incident as \u201cvery clear\u201d, his distaste perfectly evident. But that did not dilute his acceptance that no spot-kick should have been required to see things out. Although Sheffield United got a fresh foothold on proceedings after in effect going missing in the middle third of the game, they had not been bashing the door down in their search for a leveller.</p> <p>How different the narrative looked like being \u2013 to naive eyes anyway \u2013 when Martinelli tapped in the impressive left-back Bukayo Saka\u2019s deflected delivery from the left byline. The Brazilian had missed a good early opening, volleying P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s cross wide, but has that wonderful knack of showing up in the right areas and certainly did not hide here. It was the perfect answer to Arteta\u2019s plea for his players to compensate for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s absence.</p> <p>Aubameyang was serving the first game of a three-match suspension and, from the stands, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aubameyang7/status/1218567546066042883\" title=\"\">tweeted a lavish appreciation</a> of his understudy. \u201cGabi\u2019s gonna be a superstar,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot because of the goal, because of the attitude, energy and mindset.\u201d It was hard to argue, nor to think of a more exciting forward of Martinelli\u2019s age currently playing in this country. But not everyone of an Arsenal stripe shares his fortitude.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/manchester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City hit by Fernandinho own goal as Crystal Palace grab draw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was made clear seven minutes from time. The visitors had squandered an early chance to take the lead through Lys Mousset, and Granit Xhaka had cleared off the line from Oli McBurnie in the second half. But they had rarely cut Arsenal open, looking uncharacteristically skittish in possession, and Arteta was left to despair at the conception of Fleck\u2019s goal. It came from a straightforward diagonal cross by the substitute Callum Robinson, which was duly flicked on by his fellow replacement Billy Sharp. Fleck, running on to the ball on the left side of the box, shaped his body perfectly to volley across Bernd Leno via a bounce and a snick off Ainsley Maitland-Niles.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one long ball, a second ball and then someone put it in the goal from an incredible angle,\u201d Arteta lamented. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to control it.\u201d But it was hardly a one-off in context and McBurnie could have made things much worse if Maitland-Niles had not blocked his late effort at the death.</p> <p>Defeat would have been hard on Arsenal, much as scrutiny of their weak resolve is appropriate. It would also have flattered United, who disappointed Wilder despite the outcome. \u201cI don\u2019t think a win for us would have been a deserved win,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were anywhere near our best today. The result is better than the performance.\u201d</p> <p>Wilder\u2019s frustration said plenty about the standards he has instilled, just as the draw his team salvaged spoke volumes for their redoubtable attitude. Arteta wants a similar mental approach from Arsenal but this period is about seeing who is capable of rising to the challenge. \u201cI inherited a team that was in a difficult situation and we\u2019re trying to improve it as much as possible,\u201d he said. There are some positive signs, but the journey will manifestly be a long one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "You can make a team run harder, recalibrate their tactics and offer everyone a clean slate, but you cannot correct an entire mentality in the space of a month. Mikel Arteta is finding out the hard way that Arsenal\u2019s lack of resolve is deep-rooted and the latest evidence, a third occasion during his six-game tenure in which they have thrown away a lead, carried a particular sting. Arsenal were rarely in too much trouble against a Sheffield United side that were, by Chris Wilder\u2019s admission, some way short of their best. But they did not exactly brim with threat themselves despite going ahead through a goal on the verge of half-time by their outstanding 18-year-old forward Gabriel Martinelli; efforts to kill the game off lacked conviction and John Fleck\u2019s well-taken equaliser ensured an outcome that was probably fair on a scrappy, stop-start afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed today, I think the performance deserved three points,\u201d Arteta said. He would probably have been celebrating them if, with just under 20 minutes to play, his side had been awarded a penalty after Jack O\u2019Connell appeared to illegally halt a weaving run in from the right by Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. The case was scrutinised by VAR after Mike Dean, refereeing his 500th Premier League game, opted not to penalise the defender and the decision taken at Stockley Park was the same. P\u00e9p\u00e9 had perhaps leaned in towards the right leg wafted out by O\u2019Connell, but contact seemed clear enough and the overriding impression was that Arsenal had been hard done by. Arteta described the incident as \u201cvery clear\u201d, his distaste perfectly evident. But that did not dilute his acceptance that no spot-kick should have been required to see things out. Although Sheffield United got a fresh foothold on proceedings after in effect going missing in the middle third of the game, they had not been bashing the door down in their search for a leveller. How different the narrative looked like being \u2013 to naive eyes anyway \u2013 when Martinelli tapped in the impressive left-back Bukayo Saka\u2019s deflected delivery from the left byline. The Brazilian had missed a good early opening, volleying P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s cross wide, but has that wonderful knack of showing up in the right areas and certainly did not hide here. It was the perfect answer to Arteta\u2019s plea for his players to compensate for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s absence. Aubameyang was serving the first game of a three-match suspension and, from the stands, tweeted a lavish appreciation of his understudy. \u201cGabi\u2019s gonna be a superstar,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot because of the goal, because of the attitude, energy and mindset.\u201d It was hard to argue, nor to think of a more exciting forward of Martinelli\u2019s age currently playing in this country. But not everyone of an Arsenal stripe shares his fortitude. That was made clear seven minutes from time. The visitors had squandered an early chance to take the lead through Lys Mousset, and Granit Xhaka had cleared off the line from Oli McBurnie in the second half. But they had rarely cut Arsenal open, looking uncharacteristically skittish in possession, and Arteta was left to despair at the conception of Fleck\u2019s goal. It came from a straightforward diagonal cross by the substitute Callum Robinson, which was duly flicked on by his fellow replacement Billy Sharp. Fleck, running on to the ball on the left side of the box, shaped his body perfectly to volley across Bernd Leno via a bounce and a snick off Ainsley Maitland-Niles. \u201cIt\u2019s just one long ball, a second ball and then someone put it in the goal from an incredible angle,\u201d Arteta lamented. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to control it.\u201d But it was hardly a one-off in context and McBurnie could have made things much worse if Maitland-Niles had not blocked his late effort at the death. Defeat would have been hard on Arsenal, much as scrutiny of their weak resolve is appropriate. It would also have flattered United, who disappointed Wilder despite the outcome. \u201cI don\u2019t think a win for us would have been a deserved win,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were anywhere near our best today. The result is better than the performance.\u201d Wilder\u2019s frustration said plenty about the standards he has instilled, just as the draw his team salvaged spoke volumes for their redoubtable attitude. Arteta wants a similar mental approach from Arsenal but this period is about seeing who is capable of rising to the challenge. \u201cI inherited a team that was in a difficult situation and we\u2019re trying to improve it as much as possible,\u201d he said. There are some positive signs, but the journey will manifestly be a long one.",

      "body": "<p>After the deluge, a draw that gives Aston Villa hope that the tide is turning in their season. Dean Smith\u2019s side came into this game on the back of a 6-1 defeat by Manchester City and could have gone under again after Leandro Trossard fired Brighton into the lead. Instead they rallied and earned an equaliser thanks to a wonderful goal by Jack Grealish.</p> <p>A typically excellent strike from their talisman was only one of the aspects of this game from which Villa could take encouragement, with others being their combativeness, a terrific late save from their new goalkeeper, Pepe Reina, and the fact that the draw was achieved without a recognised striker. That vacancy will soon be filled, as the Tanzanian forward Mbwana Samatta has passed a medical as the club puts the finishing touches to his \u00a38.5m transfer from Genk. \u201cThe paperwork is being ticked off,\u201d said Smith.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/manchester-city-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City hit by Fernandinho own goal as Crystal Palace grab draw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brighton, meanwhile, were left to reflect on another match in which they were superior in spells but failed to profit. They remain just three points ahead of Villa and at risk of replacing them in the relegation zone if they do not find a way of translating periods of promising play into regular rewards. \u201cYou can\u2019t just win by playing well, you have to be able to suffer,\u201d said Graham Potter.</p> <p>Brighton had the advantage of being able to field a balanced lineup here. Villa, by contrast, had to start without a specialist striker for the third match in a row, with Anwar El Ghazi again asked to do his best impersonation of a natural striker. He is game but plainly no predator.</p> <p>Villa have had problems at the other end, too, but Reina helped bring solidity to a backline that was blown apart by City last Sunday. The 37-year-old former Liverpool player was put straight into the starting lineup here for his first game since October, when he made his solitary outing for his parent club, Milan, and his first Premier League appearance since he kept a clean sheet for Liverpool, against Queens Park Rangers in May 2013.</p> <p>For a while Reina may have fancied his chances of marking his Villa debut with a clean sheet. He had little to do in the opening minutes, other than dash off his line to punch the ball clear as Aaron Connolly tried to make the most of a cross from Trossard.</p> <p>Smith had demanded more aggression from his team after being angered by their timidity against City, when Villa committed five fouls.

      "bodyText": "After the deluge, a draw that gives Aston Villa hope that the tide is turning in their season. Dean Smith\u2019s side came into this game on the back of a 6-1 defeat by Manchester City and could have gone under again after Leandro Trossard fired Brighton into the lead. Instead they rallied and earned an equaliser thanks to a wonderful goal by Jack Grealish. A typically excellent strike from their talisman was only one of the aspects of this game from which Villa could take encouragement, with others being their combativeness, a terrific late save from their new goalkeeper, Pepe Reina, and the fact that the draw was achieved without a recognised striker. That vacancy will soon be filled, as the Tanzanian forward Mbwana Samatta has passed a medical as the club puts the finishing touches to his \u00a38.5m transfer from Genk. \u201cThe paperwork is being ticked off,\u201d said Smith. Brighton, meanwhile, were left to reflect on another match in which they were superior in spells but failed to profit. They remain just three points ahead of Villa and at risk of replacing them in the relegation zone if they do not find a way of translating periods of promising play into regular rewards. \u201cYou can\u2019t just win by playing well, you have to be able to suffer,\u201d said Graham Potter. Brighton had the advantage of being able to field a balanced lineup here. Villa, by contrast, had to start without a specialist striker for the third match in a row, with Anwar El Ghazi again asked to do his best impersonation of a natural striker. He is game but plainly no predator. Villa have had problems at the other end, too, but Reina helped bring solidity to a backline that was blown apart by City last Sunday. The 37-year-old former Liverpool player was put straight into the starting lineup here for his first game since October, when he made his solitary outing for his parent club, Milan, and his first Premier League appearance since he kept a clean sheet for Liverpool, against Queens Park Rangers in May 2013. For a while Reina may have fancied his chances of marking his Villa debut with a clean sheet. He had little to do in the opening minutes, other than dash off his line to punch the ball clear as Aaron Connolly tried to make the most of a cross from Trossard. Smith had demanded more aggression from his team after being angered by their timidity against City, when Villa committed five fouls. They equalled that tally in the first half-hour here, with Danny Drinkwater earning a booking as early as the 14th minute for crunching into Neal Maupay. Brighton still had the majority of possession but there was a regrettable lack of quality from both sides in an opening half-hour that brought to mind a tug-of-war between two earnest oafs of equal weight. Villa created the first really clear chance thanks to a hopeful pass forward from the back in the 37th minute. Grealish latched on to it and held off two defenders as he made his way into the box. But he then shot wide from 16 yards. One minute later, as if to compound the pain of that miss, Trossard showed him how it should have been done. Maupay drove from midfield before reaching the edge of the D and slipping the ball to Trossard, who lashed the ball across Reina and into the far corner. Villa have had the tendency to disintegrate after conceding this season but here they rebelled. But they did not look like equalising until Smith made a double substitution in the 67th minute. He introduced the 18-year-old American striker Indiana Vassilev for his first Premier League appearance and replaced Drinkwater with Douglas Luiz. The switch soon paid off with the help of negligent defending. When Douglas Luiz angled a fine pass into the box from the right touchline, Grealish was somehow free to collect it.

In an email, the campaign group said: \u201cIt is clear why these companies want to be associated with positive causes, and why they want to work with respected personalities and role models. \u201cWe respect and admire all of the excellent advocacy work that you do, which is why we are asking you to reconsider your attendance and cancel your speech.\u201d After being told that the Observer intended to write a story about Balding\u2019s appearance at the dinner, a spokesman for her representatives, YMU Group, said: \u201cI can confirm that Clare is in fact no longer attending the event due to various reasons and to clarify, this decision was made before we were made aware of the article.\u201d The ADS website continued to promote Balding\u2019s attendance. It carries a quote from her saying: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting the ADS members and sharing a great evening together.\u201d Sarah Waldron, of CAAT, said: \u201cWe are glad that Clare Balding has withdrawn her support for the ADS dinner and encourage any other public figures that are approached to do the same. This dinner is a major networking opportunity for the arms companies, and the deals being discussed and furthered over dinner could have devastating consequences for years to come.\u201d",

The recorders will first be sent to Ukraine, the plane\u2019s home base, where French, Canadian and US experts will help examine them, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. They are reportedly badly damaged, and could be sent on to France if the team in Kyiv are not able to read the flight data, Hassan Rezaeifer, head of accident investigations for Iran\u2019s civil aviation department, was quoted as saying. All 176 people on board the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 were killed when the plane came down, with many of them being Iranian citizens or of Iranian heritage.

Iran had also initially insisted that it would not send the black boxes overseas for investigation, despite pressure from the Ukrainian authorities and the governments of other countries who lost citizens in the crash.

The shooting came hours after Iran targeted US airbases in Iraq with ballistic missiles, in retaliation for the killing of Gen Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top commander and the most influential military figure in the Middle East.

However Wilfried Zaha raced upfield with the clock in added time and the winger hit a cross at Fernandinho, which the Brazilian turned beyond his own goalkeeper, Ederson. This quietened the home crowd, and the draw means Liverpool can pull 16 points ahead of City if Manchester United are beaten on Sunday, with the leaders still having another game in hand to play. On David Silva\u2019s 300th league appearance Pep Guardiola made three changes, drafting in Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling, with Roy Hodgson introducing only the on-loan Tosun as Palace\u2019s forward. There is no doubt Benjamin Mendy enhances City \u2013 the issue is if he can stay fit. Here the left\u2011back\u2019s ability to hit a curving cross that is difficult to defend was illustrated on countless occasions, with an early one aimed at Sterling coming close to creating an opening goal.

The Palace midfielder was lucky this went undetected as he had just been booked by Graham Scott for the foul that led to De Bruyne taking aim from the dead ball. When Hodgson had a fierce word with Guaita for hitting a clearance straight to Ederson, this indicated how the visitors could ill-afford to waste the scant possession they had. Zaha is expected to carry Palace\u2019s attacking threat and it was noticeable how Bernardo Silva and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo worked hard to go tight on him when he received. John Stones, who was shaky throughout, may have been lucky not to concede penalty when attempting a tackle on Zaha: the Palace man went down but VAR, to the centre-back\u2019s relief, ruled him innocent. Sterling is not renowned for headed finishes but he went near to opening the scoring from a Bernardo Silva ball in from the right. By now the half-hour had passed and Hodgson could be pleased at the goalless scoreline. The City support, though, were becoming frustrated at having nothing to show for their team\u2019s superiority. Ag\u00fcero looked to have fashioned a clear chance when he left James McCarthy on his backside but unfortunately for City the midfielder\u2019s trailing leg cleared the ball. Palace then performed a classic smash-and-grab act. After winning a corner on the right McCarthy swung the ball in, Gary Cahill beat Stones and his header was turned home by Tosun. City\u2019s shock did not last long, with Bernardo Silva forcing Guaita to tip a shot over but when the second half began they still trailed and while Palace had hardly attacked the home side were staring at conceding further ground to Liverpool. Guardiola\u2019s instructions looked to be that his men should use the flanks more \u2013 Stones drawing his ire when turning infield instead.

Sterling managed to reach the ball in the Palace box moments later when found by David Silva but his effort went wide. Mendy\u2019s next delivery caused havoc as first Ag\u00fcero and then Bernardo Silva had attempts blocked desperately, deepening the sense that Palace would soon be breached.

      "body": "<p>Archaeologists of the future, should they find themselves sifting through the rubble of early 21st-century London, will find a distinctive layer. It will contain taps and door handles of Nordic design and manufacture, long sections of structural steel and the remnants of sliding glass doors. There might be chairs designed by mid-20th-century Danes, if they haven\u2019t rotted away: by <a href=\"https://fritzhansen.com/en/designers/Arne%20Jacobsen\" title=\"\">Arne Jacobsen</a> in the older part of the layer, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/09/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Hans Wegner</a> in the later.</p> <p>From this evidence the archaeologist will know that they are looking at a period that started around the dawn of the Blair era and continues until the present. It\u2019s a long enough time \u2013 almost a generation \u2013 but one in which a remarkably consistent style of home improvement, a sort of metropolitan vernacular, has grown up. It is well represented in the shortlist for the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Don\u2019t Move, Improve!</a> award for home makeovers, now in its 10th edition, and the subject of a forthcoming exhibition at the gallery space of <a href=\"https://nla.london/\" title=\"\">New London Architecture</a>. The winner will be announced on 11 February.</p> <p>Such projects typically start with a relic of Victorian or Georgian London, a brown-brick, slate-roofed terraced house originally thrown up by a speculative builder, usually with a damp basement, compartmentalised into rooms that suited the lifestyle of the clerks or artisans for whom it was originally built. It might be a bit rickety, its foundations minimal, its walls and openings out-of-true, but its sash-windowed front will have a certain cachet with both estate agents and the heritage officers of local planning authorities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If modern technology allows for more glass than before, why not exploit it to the full? The Georgians did exactly this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The facade will therefore be kept and repaired. Behind it, lifestyles having changed in the past century or so, there will be much opening up and scooping out. The watchwords will be daylight and generosity of space. Two rooms will be made into one, thanks to the magic of rolled steel joists. There will be, in the walls facing the garden, a lot of glass. The walls will mostly be white. The doors of kitchen cupboards will be flush. There may well be an island unit. There might be some clever use of plywood, in the interests of keeping costs down, offset by the sparing use of some choice veneer on significant surfaces.</p> <p>An area of cleaned-up brickwork might be retained, as if placatory to the household gods, but the new work will mostly be everything the old is not. The latter is porous, approximate and uneven, the former engineered, clean-lined and rigid. One is happy to let moisture, cold and draughts breeze in an out, the other keeps the elements under control. Yet the two strike up some kind of alliance, the two philosophies of domesticity and construction combining to form a successful hybrid. The retained fronts maintain an idea of inherited propriety; the revamped interiors express contemporary ideas of openness.</p> <p>And why not? If a formula has been found that works, why change it?

      "bodyText": "Archaeologists of the future, should they find themselves sifting through the rubble of early 21st-century London, will find a distinctive layer. It will contain taps and door handles of Nordic design and manufacture, long sections of structural steel and the remnants of sliding glass doors. There might be chairs designed by mid-20th-century Danes, if they haven\u2019t rotted away: by Arne Jacobsen in the older part of the layer, by Hans Wegner in the later. From this evidence the archaeologist will know that they are looking at a period that started around the dawn of the Blair era and continues until the present. It\u2019s a long enough time \u2013 almost a generation \u2013 but one in which a remarkably consistent style of home improvement, a sort of metropolitan vernacular, has grown up. It is well represented in the shortlist for the Don\u2019t Move, Improve! award for home makeovers, now in its 10th edition, and the subject of a forthcoming exhibition at the gallery space of New London Architecture. The winner will be announced on 11 February. Such projects typically start with a relic of Victorian or Georgian London, a brown-brick, slate-roofed terraced house originally thrown up by a speculative builder, usually with a damp basement, compartmentalised into rooms that suited the lifestyle of the clerks or artisans for whom it was originally built. It might be a bit rickety, its foundations minimal, its walls and openings out-of-true, but its sash-windowed front will have a certain cachet with both estate agents and the heritage officers of local planning authorities. The facade will therefore be kept and repaired. Behind it, lifestyles having changed in the past century or so, there will be much opening up and scooping out. The watchwords will be daylight and generosity of space. Two rooms will be made into one, thanks to the magic of rolled steel joists. There will be, in the walls facing the garden, a lot of glass. The walls will mostly be white. The doors of kitchen cupboards will be flush. There may well be an island unit. There might be some clever use of plywood, in the interests of keeping costs down, offset by the sparing use of some choice veneer on significant surfaces. An area of cleaned-up brickwork might be retained, as if placatory to the household gods, but the new work will mostly be everything the old is not. The latter is porous, approximate and uneven, the former engineered, clean-lined and rigid. One is happy to let moisture, cold and draughts breeze in an out, the other keeps the elements under control. Yet the two strike up some kind of alliance, the two philosophies of domesticity and construction combining to form a successful hybrid. The retained fronts maintain an idea of inherited propriety; the revamped interiors express contemporary ideas of openness. And why not? If a formula has been found that works, why change it? While these high-specification domestic investments are a reflection of the London property values that underwrite them, there\u2019s not much point blaming them for the housing crisis of which they are side effects. That would be a case of shooting the messenger. If modern technology allows for more glass than before, why not exploit it to the full? The Georgians did exactly this with the more limited means at their disposal, the history of domestic architecture being at least partly one of ever-enlarging windows. And so Don\u2019t Move, Improve! contains works such as the Soffit House by Proctor and Shaw and Handen House by Selencky///Parsons, which on the available evidence are well-made and civilised interiors of a kind which wouldn\u2019t have been possible until relatively recently.

      "bodyText": "The BBC will consider waiving controversial confidentiality clauses that employees were previously forced to sign as part of settlements for equal pay disputes, amid rising scrutiny and in the wake of Samira Ahmed\u2019s landmark tribunal victory against the broadcaster. Employees who brought complaints against the BBC before 2016 were required to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from discussing their settlement with colleagues, friends, or the media. Claimants who were previously banned from speaking out about their dispute and settlement could now do so, according to a report by The Times and confirmed by the Guardian. The BBC will consider waiving these confidentiality clauses on a case by case basis. The broadcaster stopped asking claimants to sign NDAs in pay disputes four years ago. But it still uses such clauses in settlement agreements which restrict employees from disclosing trade secret type of confidential information. The BBC is understood to have agreed to consider releasing staff from confidentiality clauses in equal pay settlements before Ahmed\u2019s landmark case. Ahmed, who was paid a rate of \u00a3440 per an episode for presenting the viewer feedback programme Newswatch, took the BBC to court for paying Jeremy Vine \u00a33,000 an episode for hosting the similar show Points of View. The public broadcaster was dealt a heavy blow after an employment tribunal unanimously concluded that it had failed to provide convincing evidence that the reason for the pay gap was not due to gender discrimination. Lawyers have warned that the BBC could face a bill running into the millions for similar claims by other female staff. The hearings revealed that 120 female employees had pursued gender pay complaints against the corporation. Ahmed\u2019s employment tribunal victory was the latest scandal in BBC\u2019s long-standing gender pay gap row, which has engulfed the corporation since it was forced to reveal the salary details of its top earners in 2017. A review of pay published in 2017 showed the gender pay gap at the corporation was 9.3%. Leading male news and current affairs presenters were shamed into taking pay cuts, as the broadcaster was investigated by the equality watchdog over claims men were consistently paid more than women for doing the same job. Most recently, the BBC has come under fire again for hiring an employment consultancy with a gender pay gap twice the size of the broadcaster\u2019s to help tackle its gender pay gap. According to the Financial Times, the Croner consultancy, which was first brought in by the BBC in 2018 to handle equal pay complaints, became a central player in the BBC\u2019s attempts to tackle its gender pay gap problems.",

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time flower arranging was the preserve of the 1950s housewife accessorising the kitchen table, perhaps with help from doughty members of the Women\u2019s Institute. Now, floristry is attracting a younger, cooler crowd out to impress their Instagram followers. The owners of Sage, a flower shop in Peckham, south London, that hosts monthly bouquet and vase arranging classes, have seen a huge increase in interest from young people since they opened. \u201cIt\u2019s young people in their mid-20s to mid-30s that are coming. It\u2019s super popular and they\u2019re fully booked,\u201d says the 25-year-old co-founder, Iona Mathieson. Others agree. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely becoming more popular, especially with younger people,\u201d says Helena Willcocks, 31, founder of The Allotment Florist, whose flower arranging workshops in West Yorkshire and London, cost about \u00a360 for an hour and a half. \u201cIn the last year we have seen a 30% increase in the number of people coming. It\u2019s a trendy thing to do. It\u2019s obvious by who is booking them.\u201d What\u2019s behind the surge in popularity? Some say it\u2019s an extension of the recent trend for house plants, the sense of pride in being a \u201cplant parent\u201d and the homemade movement. Others, less idealistically, attribute it to Instagram. \u201cFlower arranging is so colourful and immediate and that\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing life these days, in these bright coloured squares,\u201d says Emma Weaver, 30, founder of Palais in Shoreditch, east London.

The first three can be shorter in duration (24 overs each) to ensure the same amount of significant play happens in the fourth one, with the players recharged and at the top of their games more frequently than what a Test\u2019s current format allows. The presence of this \u2018fourth session\u2019 will contribute to more dynamic passages of play tactics, and help the players stay energised, especially during times of extreme weather. Thoughts?\u201d Interesting idea, but have you ever been to a Test, Abhijato? The 20 minutes of the tea interval are too little to get to he front of the queue for a cup of tea, let alone go to the bathroom as well. So it\u2019s hard to see 15 being much use to anyone. A fourth session, though, is well worth thinking about: the third session is often uncomfortably long, as we may find this afternoon.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e22ebee8f08e97ed2125b47\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T11:30:31.515Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cDoes anyone know,\u201d </strong>asks John Starbuck, \u201cif Bess already has a nickname, either from school or his county?

Where would this match probably be headed if this was the third day of four? It will become far easier for teams on the wrong end of a drubbing to play out for a draw. Personally I expect that far more Tests will end up as a draw, rain or light stopped play or not. Do we really want that? On the other hand it may push teams to keep up a higher scoring rate than say England did here on the first day. But to me that\u2019s part of the magic of 5 day Tests. It enables a longer term strategy to play out and really tests the mental and physical mettle of the two opponents. That\u2019s what makes Test cricket one of the greatest \u2018all round\u2019 sporting contests there are.\u201d Very true. </p> <p>Now that Sourav Ganguly has come out against them in his capacity as president of the BCCI, it looks as if mandatory four-dayers are dead in the water. I suspect we\u2019re heading for a mixture, which, technically, is what we have now. There will be more four-day Tests, but still plenty of places where the full five-act drama lives on.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T11:26:09.043Z\">at 11.26am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e22e85d8f0879d539efa787\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T11:15:07.166Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Not that we\u2019re done with the redheads yet. </strong>\u201cMorning, Tim,\u201d says Phil Sawyer. \u201cAnyone putting together an England red-head eleven and not including the legend that is Glen Chapple is going to incur my ire.

Yesterday they had one fresh-faced 22-year-old making a masterly hundred, and then another grabbing two top-order wickets. England finished the day 439 ahead, with Dom Bess lording it at one end and Mark Wood delivering thunderbolts at the other. The good news for South Africa is that their task is simple enough: all they have to do is dig themselves out of a deep hole. </p> <p>One piece of evidence is on their side. So far in the third Test, not a single wicket has fallen before lunch. England should be able to change that curious fact with their tails up and a nightwatchman to bowl at \u2013 although, the last time he found himself doing this job, Anrich Nortje made a handy fortje. </p> <p>Dean Elgar has been his usual craggy self with 32 not out, and the pitch is slow, verging on dead for the seamers once the ball goes soft. So there may yet be a twist, but, for the moment, England are right on top.<br></p> <p>Joe Root even got away with impersonating the rather dopey captain he used to be \u2013 keeping Sam Curran on too long, bringing Wood on too late, and being so slow to surround the bat that you wondered if he\u2019d misread the scoreboard and thought he had 299 to play with, not 499. As it is, South Africa need 300 to avoid the follow-on, and they\u2019ve got one-fifth of the way there, at the cost of one-fifth of the wickets. So that element of the match is nicely poised. </p> <p>The weather forecast, alas, is gloomy, with every hour of the day being given a 50-to-60-per-cent chance of rain. But still, the glass is almost half full. See you at 10am Port Elizabeth time, 8am GMT, for the next episode in an absorbing series.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-17T22:38:44.611Z\">at 10.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "82nd over: South Africa 208-6 (de Kock 63, Philander 27) With three balls remaining, Bess takes the new ball. It\u2019s a nice idea from Joe Root but doesn\u2019t yield the desired wicket. That\u2019s the end of a long, rain-affected day\u2019s play. It belonged to Dom Bess, who took his first Test five-for, and Quinton de Kock, whose 95% sublime/5% ridiculous innings of 63 not out gave South Africa a realistic chance of saving the game. He was dropped three times by Ben Stokes, believe it or not. 81st over: South Africa 207-6 (de Kock 63, Philander 26) Joe Denly comes onto to bowl the penultimate over of the day - and Stokes drops a third chance at slip! de Kock tried to cut a big legspinner and sliced it towards Stokes, who couldn\u2019t hold on to a very tough chance by his right ankle. He almost grabbed it at the second attempt - and the third and fourth - before it finally hit the ground. 80th over: South Africa 207-6 (de Kock 63, Philander 26) Philander inside-edges a lovely off-break from Bess onto the pad, with the ball dropping short of the diving Buttler. A maiden. 79th over: South Africa 207-6 (de Kock 63, Philander 26) 78th over: South Africa 205-6 (de Kock 62, Philander 25) Bess gives the ball a bit more air to de Kock. He resists the temptation and settles for a no-risk single off the final delivery. 77th over: South Africa 204-6 (de Kock 61, Philander 25) South Africa continue to bat comfortably. A wicket before the close would be such a bonus for England because there is no sense that one is about to fall. 76th over: South Africa 201-6 (de Kock 59, Philander 24) After another quiet over, Bess has figures of 28-11-49-5. A spinner would be happy with those in the first innings of any Test match anywhere in the world. 75th over: South Africa 200-6 (de Kock 58, Philander 24) A maiden from Root to Philander. England are racing through the overs; seven to go. 74th over: South Africa 200-6 (de Kock 58, Philander 24) More solid defence from Philander, who has settled down after that flying start to the innings. A single off Bess\u2019s final delivery brings up the 200. South Africa, who were 113 for five when rain stopped play this morning, have batted extremely well since the resumption. 73rd over: South Africa 199-6 (de Kock 58, Philander 23) The light has deteriorated, so England have no choice but to bowl spin at both ends. Joe Root thus replaces Stuart Broad - and he has de Kock dropped again by Stokes at slip! Oh my, what a chance. de Kock played a really loose stroke at a ball that bounced more than he expected. It took the edge and looped towards slip, where Stokes failed to hang on with his outtstretched left hand. It was a pretty straightforward chance, certainly for Stokes. I suspect he was deceived by the lack of pace. 72nd over: South Africa 197-6 (de Kock 56, Philander 23) Bess switches round the wicket to the right-hander Philander, who gets an inside-edge onto the pad that loops up and lands safely. 71st over: South Africa 197-6 (de Kock 56, Philander 23) Stuart Broad replaces Stokes, who bowled a mixed spell of 5-1-26-1. Quinton de Kock treats him as he has all the other England seamers, driving delightfully through mid-on for four. He has played outrageously well. 70th over: South Africa 193-6 (de Kock 52, Philander 23) I think England have done really well to pick up six wickets in 70 overs, because this pitch is so unhelpful. There are 12 overs remaining tonight, although I suspect bad light will stop play in the next 15-20 minutes. 69th over: South Africa 193-6 (de Kock 52, Philander 23) Philander pulls Stokes round the corner for four, with the ball going straight through Bess on the long leg boundary. Then a push-drive for four takes de Kock to a delicious half-century, his 20th in Tests. Even by his standards, it\u2019s been full of glorious strokes. 68th over: South Africa 184-6 (de Kock 48, Philander 18) Bess replaces Root, who bowled a decent spell of 7-3-18-0 and had de Kock dropped. His first ball is short, wide and scythed for four by de Kock. 67th over: South Africa 180-6 (de Kock 44, Philander 18) \u201cWith a lead of roughly 330 as I type, why, when I watch, is there only one slip?\u201d asks Jeremy Deacon. The logic is that it\u2019s a slow, almost subcontinental pitch, so there is less chance both of the edge being found and of any edges carrying. Most of the catchers are in front of the wicket for mistimed drives and the like. I\u2019d still have at least two slips for Stokes, though. 66th over: South Africa 177-6 (de Kock 41, Philander 18) A delicate drive from Philander beats Broad at mid-off and runs away for four. He always could play - he averages 37 with the bat against England - and he has started superbly in this innings. An emphatic drive through extra cover takes him to 18 from 10 balls. That might be the end of Root\u2019s spell. 65th over: South Africa 167-6 (de Kock 40, Philander 9) Philander gets off the mark with consecutive boundaries off Stokes. The first was a swaggering flick-pull, the second a sweet drive between extra cover and mid-off. A clever leg-glance from de Kock makes it three boundaries in the over, at the end of which Stokes waves his cap in disgust. 64th over: South Africa 154-6 (de Kock 36, Philander 0) South Africa\u2019s big target in this innings is 300, which would ensure England have to bat again. Either way, so much depends on the weather in the next two days. 63rd over: South Africa 154-6 (de Kock 36, Philander 0) Nortje played heroically, eating up 136 balls as nightwatchman. It looks like Stokes and Root waved him off the field, though I\u2019m not sure why. He\u2019s done it again. Ben Stokes smiles, almost in embarrassment at his Boy\u2019s Own brilliance, after making a vital breakthrough. Nortje was lured into a slightly loose stroke outside off stump, and Joe Root took a seriously good low catch at second slip. 62nd over: South Africa 154-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 36) Root continues. I\u2019d be tempted to try Denly to de Kock, especially after what happened at Cape Town. Root is not bowling badly, though,and gets one to turn sharply past de Kock\u2019s outside edge. Another maiden. That\u2019s drinks. 61st over: South Africa 154-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 36) With England needing a wicket, Ben Stokes puts his cape on for the first time in the innings. His first over is a quiet one, with everything played comfortably by de Kock. 60th over: South Africa 153-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 35) Another harmless over from Root. I suppose this passage of play is a reminder of how well England - or rather Dom Bess - did to pick up the first five wickets so cheaply. 59th over: South Africa 152-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 34) Curran tries something unusual, thrusting his right hand out for no reason in the middle of his run up. Nortje pulls away so Curran has to do it all again, this time without the comedy gamesmanship. This spell from Curran looks good on paper (4-1-6-0), but he hasn\u2019t really threatened the batsmen. It might be time for Ben Stokes to put his cape on. 58th over: South Africa 152-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 34) 57th over: South Africa 150-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 32) Curran switches round the wicket to Nortje, who blocks everything that moves. There are 25 overs remaining tonight. 56th over: South Africa 149-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 31) Oh my, Stokes has dropped de Kock! That came out of nothing. It was a very sharp chance at slip off the bowling of Root, after de Kock played an absent-minded dab off the back foot, and it went through the hands of the crouching Stokes. 55th over: South Africa 144-5 (Nortje 18, de Kock 26) Nortje plays a rare attacking stroke, jumping up to force Curran through the covers for two. It\u2019s all very quiet out there. England haven\u2019t looked like taking a wicket since the resumption. 54th over: South Africa 142-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 26) Joe Root replaces Dom Bess (23-9-43-5), presumably with a view to de Kock doing something rash. Not in that over: he offers a dead, straight bat (comma optional) and it\u2019s a maiden. \u201cI started out as a journalist Rob,\u201d says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \u201cI saw the path ahead of me and ran. I now make TV programmes, so... we all make bad decisions.\u201d Well, nobody\u2019s John Eales. 53rd over: South Africa 142-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 26) Sam Curran replaces Mark Wood, who was hit out of the attack by de Kock. That\u2019s a smart move from Joe Root as de Kock much prefers pace on the ball. He edges Curran\u2019s first delivery for a couple, all along the floor, and generally struggles to time the ball. A decent start from Curran. 52nd over: South Africa 139-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 23) England have been a bit flat since the resumption, although Nortje and de Kock, in very different ways, have played superbly. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d always greet a dog walker, if only to acknowledge a fellow sufferer,\u201d says Andy Blamey. \u201cI say this having walked ours home this morning after she\u2019d repeatedly rolled in something spectacularly unpleasant.\u201d 51st over: South Africa 138-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 22) Another majestic stroke from de Kock, who pings a full ball from Wood through midwicket for four. Wood responds with an excellent swinging yorker, yet even that is defended with an ease that verges on the contemptuous. It takes a special talent to have this much time against a 90-95mph bowler, and de Kock helps himself to another boundary when an exasperated Wood strays onto the pads. Wood conceded 10 runs from his first 9.2 overs. Since then, de Kock has hit him for 20 off 10 balls. Sublime batting. 50th over: South Africa 128-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 13) A thick edge from de Kock runs along the ground for a single. That allows Bess four more balls at Nortje, who blocks the lot. \u201cNot strictly a nickname,\u201d says Robert Ellson, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always enjoyed the idea of the Sheffield Wednesday fans singing about Sam Sodje, \u2018He ain\u2019t Efe, he\u2019s his brother.\u2019\u201d 49th over: South Africa 127-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 12) Wood is driven delightfully through mid-on for four by de Kock. He has so much time to play even the fastest bowling, which he demonstrates again by larruping a cut to the cover boundary. Wood conceded only one boundary in his first 50 balls, and that was an inside edge; de Kock then hit two of the next three for four. \u201cI\u2019ve never owned a dog (and walking a parrot is just strange),\u201d says Bob O\u2019Hara, \u201cbut my impression is that there\u2019s a dog walking subculture, so that you\u2019re more likely to be trending on twitter by 9am if you don\u2019t greet a fellow dog walker. It might be safest to let your dog go to a better home where these social niceties are better understood. Then get a parrot.\u201d Nobody understands any social niceties. That\u2019s the whole point of them. 48th over: South Africa 116-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 1) A maiden from Bess to the strokeless Nortje, who is acting as a nightwatchman for the second day in a row. He\u2019s doing an admirable job. \u201cRob,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cWasn\u2019t the quote about Aristotle\u2019s view on premature banter the whole foundation of the plot in The Name of the Rose?\u201d 47th over: South Africa 116-5 (Nortje 16, de Kock 1) England would love to take at least one South African with them, ideally de Kock, before rain stops play again. Wood whistles a quite vicious bouncer past Nortje, who actually played it pretty well by snapping his head out of the way. He\u2019s got plenty of moxie, has Nortje: he made a vital 40 from 89 balls as a nightwatchman in the first Test, and here he has batted 95 balls for 16. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Peter Gluckstein. \u201cArsenal used to have a youngster called Mark \u2018Blocka\u2019 Flatts, which always seemed an advanced option for, well, a footballer...\u201d If only he\u2019d been a middle-order batsman who specialised in rearguard actions. 46th over: South Africa 115-5 (Nortje 15, de Kock 1) The groundstaff look fidgety, which is bad news for England. A maiden from Bess to de Kock. \u201cI\u2019m sure I read or heard somewhere, years ago, that Owen Parkin was referred to as \u2018Disabled\u2019 by his Glamorgan colleagues (granted, somewhat inappropriate),\u201d says Clare Dowding, \u201cand that Jacques Kallis was known as \u2018Scrumpy\u2019 - although that probably says a lot about a) when he was at Glamorgan and b) drinking habits in South Wales at the time. I\u2019m allowed to say that, I was born in Cardiff and brought up in the area.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be offensive if I said it, would it? I haven\u2019t a clue anymore. Whenever I walk the dogs in the morning and greet a passer-by, a small part of me fears my world will come crashing down as a result, and that I\u2019ll be trending on Twitter by 9am for thinking it\u2019s acceptable to say hello to a fellow dogwalker #dogwokers 45th over: South Africa 115-5 (Nortje 15, de Kock 1) Mark Wood goes straight round the wicket to the nightwatchman Anrich Nortje, who is dropped by Ollie Pope at short leg. It was a really sharp chance, off the face of the bat, and Pope couldn\u2019t hang on. 44th over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) Dom Bess bowls the last four balls of the over he started before rain stopped play. Quinton de Kock defends each and every one, and life goes on. \u201cTwo things,\u201d brasstacks Matt Dony. \u201cFirstly, Robert Blanchard has made a colossal, \u2018We\u2019re gonna have a bowl\u2019-scale error. If we\u2019re looking at qualification through residency, then omitting the magnificent Tori Amos from his XI is a heinous oversight that might cause me to turn my back on OBOs once and for all. Secondly, we attribute \u2018Nature abhors a vacuum\u2019 to Aristotle. Might it have been a mistranslation? Did he actually say, \u2018Nature abhors a competent English cricket performance. So enjoy the rain, suckers!\u2019?\u201d You should have heard what Aristotle said about premature banter. The restart has been delayed by a few minutes: 3.30pm local time. 1.30pm in England. \u201cJohn Mallett, bruising Bath and England prop, was always known as \u2018Shep\u2019 at The Rec, which was in turn hacked down from the name of a cider-producing town not so far away,\u201d says Jill Shepherd. \u201cHe now terrorises coaches and kids as director of Rugby at Millfield School, also not so far way...\u201d Play will resume at 1.26pm! That\u2019s a helluva turnaround from the groundstaff; well played them. If it doesn\u2019t rain again, we\u2019ll have 39.4 overs tonight. And, no, I haven\u2019t a clue why the restart time is 1.26pm rather than 1.25pm. A bit of news from India... \u201cBarbara Castle should definitely be in the Redheads XI,\u201d says Jacqueline. \u201cWicketkeeper maybe?\u201d Elliot Carr-Barnsley has another suggestion for Dom Bess. \u201cSurely, given Bess\u2019s county side and evident world-class status, must be The Apple Kumble.\u201d When I read that I thought , \u2018Ha, that\u2019s nice\u2019. And then a split-second later - if that - a voice in my head screamed, \u2018But \u2018crumble\u2019 and \u2018Kumble\u2019 is only an eye rhyme, it doesn\u2019t work phonetically.\u2019 This is what journalism has done to me. This is the person I have become. Thanks for all your nickname suggestions. All the old favourites are there: Martin \u2018Chariots\u2019 Offiah Mark \u2018Afghan\u2019 Waugh \u2018One Size\u2019 Fitz Hall Kiki \u2018Chris\u2019 Musampa \u2018Nobody\u2019 John Eales Paul \u2018Human\u2019 Romaines \u201cWhat would happen in event of the game being rained off?\u201d asks Manish Ravala. \u201cWould it be a tie or have there been enough overs for possible Duckworth Lewis?\u201d It would be a draw, at least under the old laws. The covers are coming off! You heard. That\u2019s an extremely pleasant surprise, although no time has been set for a resumption. \u201cNot elaborate,\u201d says James Hodgins, \u201cbut one of the best nicknames has to be Monde Zondeki, who was nicknamed \u2018All Hands\u2019.\u201d Yep, that\u2019s a good one. Although shouldn\u2019t it have been \u2018All Hand\u2019? Oh for heaven\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve actually become a nickname pedant. This is a low. It\u2019s raining again. I\u2019d imagine play will be abandoned for the day in the next hour or so. But keep pressing that refresh button, because I get paid \u00a30.000001p for every page view and I\u2019d love a bit of bread \u2018n\u2019 spread tonight otherwise you might miss a Dom Bess ten-for! \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matt Emerson. \u201cGiven the professional sportsman\u2019s inclination to add a -y to the end of every surname I presume Dom Bess\u2019s nickname is \u2018Aunt\u2019.\u201d On that note, I wonder what\u2019s the most elaborate nickname in sport. Not that \u2018Aunt\u2019 is especially elaborate, but it\u2019s two moves from name to nickname rather than the usual one. \u201cI love a long post-tea session,\u201d cackles Gary Naylor. \u201cWhat a delight it is to see bowlers and captains who slow the game into 25 overs in the mornings and afternoons try to cope with 40 before they can go off. Comeuppance is the mot juste, I believe. If a captain can\u2019t deliver at least 28 overs in two hours in the absence of major delays, they\u2019re not playing it right.\u201d I\u2019m loath to be too critical, especially as most mornings it takes me the best part of an hour to decide which playlist to put on in the office. Will it be Britpop 1993-94 or Britpop 1995-97? \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Robert Blanchard. \u201cOnce again, the OBO and its contributors have been shown up as sexist: all proposals for the ginger cricket team are/were men. Here is my proposal for an all-female team of redheads. I\u2019m sure you will agree it combines leadership, aggression, poise, the ability to keep one\u2019s head, and steady accumulation (scoring 111 is not to be sneezed at). I will brook no argument about their qualifications: Google says they are/were all redheads so it must be true. Boadicea Elizabeth I Margaret Thatcher Lady Mary Boleyn Geri Halliwell Gillian Anderson (qualifies by residency) Elizabeth Siddal Julia Gillard (qualifies by birth) Emma Lady Hamilton Mary Read Kate Winslet \u201cSub: Eleanor Tomlinson.\u201d I can\u2019t believe you omitted Christina Hendricks, daughter of the unsung England seamer Mike, or Six Feet Under Lauren Ambrose, sister of Sir Curtly and Tim. If you need a fix of live sport, we have a few other options This is a bit more promising. The rain has relented and the groundstaff are milling around, trying to decide what to do next. \u201cSurely a Tina Turner- inspired nickname: \u2018Simply\u2019?\u201d says Tom Pugh. \u201cBecause at the moment, he\u2019s Simply Dom Bess.\u201d You say \u2018at the moment\u2019. Does that mean he\u2019ll be Complicatedly Dom Bess in the future? The covers are back on. I suspect they will stay there until tomorrow morning. Cwicket fwends Thanks Tim, hello everyone. England have already secured a moral victory in this match, but an actual win is far from guaranteed. I\u2019d be surprised if we get any more play today, and the forecast for the rest of the match is mixed. At least England, in the parlance of our time, moved the game along in the 25.2 overs that were possible this morning. They are one wicket away from if not the tail then certainly the rump. The rain has gone from cats and dogs to mere drizzle, so there may be hope. Time for me to hand over to Rob Smyth. Thanks for your company, your redhead XIs and your thoughts on how long a piece of cricket should be. A man with a plan. \u201cFollowing is an amended version of a proposal I have sent to the OBO earlier,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWe should take a fifteen-minutes break at the end of the third session, and return for a \u2018fourth session\u2019 during each playing day of a Test match. The first three can be shorter in duration (24 overs each) to ensure the same amount of significant play happens in the fourth one, with the players recharged and at the top of their games more frequently than what a Test\u2019s current format allows. The presence of this \u2018fourth session\u2019 will contribute to more dynamic passages of play tactics, and help the players stay energised, especially during times of extreme weather. Thoughts?\u201d Interesting idea, but have you ever been to a Test, Abhijato? The 20 minutes of the tea interval are too little to get to he front of the queue for a cup of tea, let alone go to the bathroom as well. So it\u2019s hard to see 15 being much use to anyone. A fourth session, though, is well worth thinking about: the third session is often uncomfortably long, as we may find this afternoon. \u201cDoes anyone know,\u201d asks John Starbuck, \u201cif Bess already has a nickname, either from school or his county? I\u2019d have thought he should be known as \u2018Good Queen\u2019, with a soundtrack of a Brian May guitar solo.\u201d A thought from John Galpin. \u201cOne thing I haven\u2019t heard mentioned in the 4 vs 5 day Test debate is the impact of the weather such as we have now. Where would this match probably be headed if this was the third day of four? It will become far easier for teams on the wrong end of a drubbing to play out for a draw. Personally I expect that far more Tests will end up as a draw, rain or light stopped play or not. Do we really want that? On the other hand it may push teams to keep up a higher scoring rate than say England did here on the first day. But to me that\u2019s part of the magic of 5 day Tests. It enables a longer term strategy to play out and really tests the mental and physical mettle of the two opponents. That\u2019s what makes Test cricket one of the greatest \u2018all round\u2019 sporting contests there are.\u201d Very true. Now that Sourav Ganguly has come out against them in his capacity as president of the BCCI, it looks as if mandatory four-dayers are dead in the water. I suspect we\u2019re heading for a mixture, which, technically, is what we have now. There will be more four-day Tests, but still plenty of places where the full five-act drama lives on. Not that we\u2019re done with the redheads yet. \u201cMorning, Tim,\u201d says Phil Sawyer. \u201cAnyone putting together an England red-head eleven and not including the legend that is Glen Chapple is going to incur my ire. Alright, yes, technically he never played a Test for England, but that\u2019s an injustice that I only bring up four or five times a day.\u201d Back to the Pope and Bess show. \u201cHello, fellow Tim,\u201d says Tim Sanders in Leeds. Always good to meet one. \u201cIf at a tangent from the religious theme, we can adapt the Gershwins and Heywards to give us \u2018Bess, You Is My Spinner Now\u2019, \u2018I Loves You Popey\u2019, whilst Somerset fans might mourn his absence on Test duty with \u2018Bess, O Where\u2019s My Bess?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s absence from the 2nd XI, presumably. \u201cAs a South African who\u2019s lived in England for a long time,\u201d says Matthew Kentridge, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at the state of this Test match. However, when it came to Rabada\u2019s face, yesterday evening, as Pope scooped him backwards over his head for six, more or less with his eyes closed, there was no contest \u2013 I had to laugh. I was afraid Rabada would burst a blood vessel with the effort of keeping his mouth shut. Hope the weather clears up, but that Eastern Province rain has been known to settle in and spoil a good day\u2019s cricket, not to mention a good holiday.\u201d Lovely to have a bit of local knowledge, especially when it comes from my next-door neighbour in London. We got him as a Kolpak, obviously. We interrupt this rain break to bring you more on red hair and the passing of time. \u201cBen Heywood (10.24) seemed down on his brown,\u201d says Nick Killick, \u201cbut he\u2019s revealed the great blessing of redheads \u2013 generally we transition to another colour before the grey sets in \u2013 in my case a bit blonde. We may suffer in the playground, but by middle age our revenge is being served very cold on our white-haired persecutors from youth.\u201d Nice. And nobody ever wrote a headline about a brown-haired ninja. \u201cFor inclusion in your red-headed team,\u201d says Steve Hudson. \u201cKP and Jimmy both had red streaks at some point, so they qualify by ... residence, or something?\u201d Ha. In my memory, KP\u2019s streak was blue, but then my memory is hazy from around the time Pat Pocock made his exit. \u201cPat Pocock,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201cwas a classic example of face not fitting. I remember his first sixfer. Elegant and interesting bowler, but the selectors were so incompetent at the time that they\u2019d pick almost any other bowler ahead of him. He managed only 25 Tests in 17 years. These were the same selectors who routinely ignored Tom Cartwright. I\u2019m still very cross with them fifty years later.\u201d Great stuff. And yes, Percy Pocock was hard done by. But wasn\u2019t it partly the fact that Ray Illingworth became captain, and he was an off-spinner too? And then Tony Greig took up off-breaks and bagged 14 wickets in a match. At least Pocock had an Indian summer, turning up as a golden oldie in David Gower\u2019s team that went to India in 1984-85 and won. And then he was harshly dropped again, for John Emburey, who came straight back in after a ban, bearing his superior batting and a dismal strike rate. \u201cIt\u2019s lashing down,\u201d says Ian Ward on Sky, and the camera pans around to show that, yes, Port Elizabeth has turned into Old Trafford. Back to the serious stuff. \u201cSpeaking as a former redhead,\u201d says Ben Heywood, \u201cit can go one of two ways \u2013 it can all fall out (can\u2019t think of anyone this has happened to, ahem), or the ginge tinge turns grey, white or in my case, weirdly, brown. My younger son (carrots) didn\u2019t believe I was a ginger until I inadvisedly showed him some old pictures. Now he thinks I used to look like Ronald McDonald.\u201d Even this weather may be on England\u2019s side. \u201cMight a rain-interrupted day with perhaps an early finish be of benefit to England,\u201d wonders Geoff Wignall. \u201cAssuming they manage to take the remaining first-innings wickets or at least most of them? I\u2019m thinking of course of an enforced follow-on with the bowlers sufficiently fresh and well rested.\u201d Poor old Faf: it never rains, but it pours. Anything Pope can do, Bess can do almost as well. No sooner has Pope become the youngest right-hander to make a Test century for England since 1954 (the early days of Colin Cowdrey), than Bess becomes the youngest English spinner to take a Test five-for since 1968, when Pat Pocock grabbed six for 79 against Australia at the age of 21. Hat-tip to Cricinfo, full list here. \u201cFrom Bangkok on a boozy afternoon,\u201d says Mike Brady. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the most promising start to an OBO email ever, or the most worrying. \u201cObviously Stokes is God, and he has a Pope, but how should we worship Bess?\u201d As the new leader of the Dominicans, following a brief stint from Dom Sibley. \u201cLovely scoreboard to wake up to,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI wonder if there\u2019s a winning formula for future England home Tests? Prepare pitches for spin and select an attack of Bess, Leach, Rashid and Moeen, backed up by pace variation from Curran and Stokes. And possibly play all home Tests at Taunton.\u201d Hang on, what about Wood? He\u2019s just taken one of the all-time great none-fors. \u201cA very good morning Tim.\u201d You can say that again, Brian Withington. \u201cJust catching up with this morning\u2019s OBO, not knowing who was on duty, when my heart lifted at the sight of a Norwegian Wood lyric casually yet deftly inserted into proceedings (over 34). Could I have safely addressed this email without even checking who was responsible?\u201d Oh I don\u2019t know \u2013 some of my colleagues have come across this old beat combo too. \u201cWhat would you give to have penned the original lyric?\u201d That is a good question. Only last Saturday, I heard Judy Collins sing it in Liverpool, bringing an 80-year-old\u2019s elegance to bear on John Lennon\u2019s youthful audacity. \u201cRoot\u2019s drop,\u201d says the subject line of an email from George Wigley. \u201cGreat captaincy from Root: he wants Bess\u2019s five-for to be top order, unsullied by tail enders. The foresight!\u201d Mid-44th over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) The rain gets heavy quite quickly, like a conversation about your love life. The umpires take the players off and signal an early lunch. The morning belongs to Dom Bess, with a little help from Ollie Pope \u2013 just a couple of 22-year-olds, living the dream. \u201cJust woken (Well, it IS Saturday) and checked in,\u201d said Adam Goves, \u201cin sleepy Norfolk\u201d, a quarter of an hour ago. \u201cSurely Bess could have parried that C&amp;B to Pope?! It\u2019s totally messed up the aesthetic of an otherwise perfect scorecard, or am I being a bit greedy?\u201d 43rd over: South Africa 113-5 (Nortje 14, de Kock 0) Denly is still on, and still collecting dots, though he does dish up one bad ball which Nortje dispatches through midwicket. Bad news, lads: rain is falling. 42nd over: South Africa 109-5 (Nortje 10, de Kock 0) So the best day of Pope\u2019s career has been followed by the best day of Bess\u2019s. Amazing stuff. For the good of the game, we could now do with a scintillating counter-attack from de Kock. Dom Bess gets his five-for! Not his best ball, short and wide, but it turns enough to take the inside edge as van der Dussen shapes to cut. Bess has five for 41, and Joe Root no longer has to feel bad about that drop. 41st over: South Africa 109-4 (Nortje 10, van der Dussen 24) One batsman\u2019s aggression infects the other as Nortje cuts Denly for his first four and reaches double figures off his 81st ball. At this rate, he\u2019ll be 42 not out when South Africa secure the draw on Monday night. 40th over: South Africa 103-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 23) Out of nowhere, van der Dussen tucks into Bess. A lofted on-drive for four, a force into the covers for two, a slog-sweep for four more, and then, with the field in sudden retreat, an easy single. Is this a change in the weather? 39th over: South Africa 93-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 12) Spin from both ends! Bess\u2019s Laker finds his Lock in the form of Joe Denly. who took his first Test wickets in Cape Town. He makes a tidy start, going for just a single. 38th over: South Africa 92-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 11) The scoreboard is suddenly rocking, but only because a big turner from Bess goes for four byes. \u201cAn English red-headed XI?\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cBell, Crawley Z, Collingwood, Bairstow J, Morgan (captain), Pope, Stokes, Bairstow D (wkpr), Batty, Sidebottom A, Sidebottom R. 12th man: Fairbrother.\u201d Combustible but effective. 37th over: South Africa 88-4 (Nortje 6, van der Dussen 11) Nortje, after making three off 66 balls, sensationally doubles his score with a leg glance off Broad. \u201cThe Smarmy Army,\u201d muses Peter Gingold (26th over). \u201cNice idea. But, sad to say, they\u2019d have to stay in the UK on account of emissions from international flights.\u201d 36th over: South Africa 84-4 (Nortje 3, van der Dussen 10) Bess\u2019s arm ball kisses the edge as Nortje goes back and Root, at slip, spills a simple chance. Bess responds with no more than a rueful grimace, which is big of him given that that should have been his first Test five-for. Here\u2019s David Winter in Paris, questioning the very process of the OBO. \u201cAre you live reporting on the third Test from the press box in Port Elizabeth, in the newsroom at Guardian HQ whilst surrounded by dynamic colleagues breaking news stories from around the world, or are you sat in your pants on your sofa at home?\u201d That would be telling. 35th over: South Africa 83-4 (Nortje 3, van der Dussen 9) Broad tries a bouncer. Nortje faces the music, gets the splice on it, and would give a simple catch to short leg if Pope wasn\u2019t so deep. 34th over: South Africa 83-4 (Nortje 3, van der Dussen 9) Nortje takes a single off Bess, who is now coming round the wicket, and van der Dussen plays the first attacking stroke since du Plessis. And it\u2019s a very good one \u2013 a dance down the track and a clean hard hit past mid-on. \u201cMorning Tim.\u201d Morning, Diana Powell. \u201cWhat a magnificent bird on the photograph of the ground. What is it? Does it take catches on the boundary?\u201d That bird has flown, alas \u2013 though perhaps somebody spotted it and can answer the question. All the time I should have spent with Observer\u2019s Book of Birds went into Wisden. 33rd over: South Africa 78-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 5) This collapse began with a caught-and-bowled and Broad comes close to another one as van der Dussen is deceived by a leg-cutter. And that\u2019s drinks, with England so dominant that it\u2019s hard to believe. Matthew Doherty has a question. \u201cHas this Test secretly been re-allocated to Old Trafford 1956?\u201d It\u2019s true that Bess is in with a chance of being both Laker and Lock here. According to our friends at Cricinfo, he\u2019s the first England spinner to take four wickets in the first 25 overs of a Test innings since Graeme Swann at Cardiff in 2011. But that was a second innings, and it didn\u2019t even last 25 overs. 32nd over: South Africa 78-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 5) Bess keeps it tight as van der Dussen clips to midwicket for a single and Nortje blocks his way to 50 (balls). \u201cWell,\u201d says Richard Mansell, \u201cif one is South African this is as depressing as it must be exhilarating for England fans. It looks like we are heading for an innings defeat.\u201d I realise that words of comfort from an Englishman may only make things worse, but ... Long way to go, and that rain has to come along some time. 31st over: South Africa 77-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 4) Broad has two short covers and no fine leg, so they might as well be in Sri Lanka already. He breaks off from bowling cutters to present Nortje with a lovely inswinger, which very nearly clips the off bail. 30th over: South Africa 77-4 (Nortje 2, van der Dussen 4) Anrich Nortje keeps Bess out and nicks a single off the last ball. He\u2019s now faced 39 balls, more than anyone else in this innings except Elgar. \u201cMorning Tim,\u201d says David Horn, \u201cand what a fine one it\u2019s turning out to be. Was wondering how Matt Parkinson might be feeling? Dom Bess wasn\u2019t even in the original squad. Are we picking leg spinners for a tour just for the craic? I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s heading for the door marked \u2018Mason Crane\u2019 about now.\u201d Ha, you\u2019d be spot-on if there wasn\u2019t a tour of Sri Lanka next. Parkinson will presumably be there unless Adil Rashid finds a miracle cure for his shoulder. 29th over: South Africa 76-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 4) By playing noticeably straight, van der Dussen deals better with Broad and picks up another two. \u201cGood morning from Port Elizabeth,\u201d said Piet Morant, half an hour ago. \u201cLooking forward to your fine commentary, especially since I turned down tickets at work from my colleague Alan when I saw how likely it was to rain, hour on hour [Preamble, below]. He was sure the rain would not come until this evening, but said you can\u2019t count on the forecasters. \u2018No, Alan, you can\u2019t!\u2019 Now he\u2019s at the ground and I\u2019m stuck at home with my windy dog.\u201d As Rob Smyth would say: ach, sorry. 28th over: South Africa 74-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 2) Another maiden from Bess, who has 11-4-22-4 and has surely inked his name into the tour party for Sri Lanka. 27th over: South Africa 74-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 2) Mark Wood takes a break to rest on Bess\u2019s laurels. Stuart Broad enters the fray and almost joins in the fun as Rassie van der Dussen, flummoxed by a cutter, chips into the covers, not far from Joe Denly. 26th over: South Africa 72-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 0) Bess whistles through a maiden to Nortje, with scarcely a thought for people trying to write OBOs. \u201cLooking forward to a great day,\u201d wrote Leo a couple of wickets ago. \u201cMeanwhile... \u2018not even Jerusalem dampens the excitement\u2019? [08:02] So what do we really think of the Barmy Army? Did I also detect a slight world-weariness creeping into the OBO yesterday as whoever was writing suggested he or she was somewhat unbeguiled by the continued carryings-on of the Crazy Corps? Has what started so many years ago as a slightly self-deprecatory unit of hard-core England supporters willing to brave the rigours of sometimes challenging foreign travel developed into something that, instead, now rather prominently displays elements of the Great British psyche perhaps better kept at home? And, if so, what can be done? \u201cLast night I had a dream... that, as an antidote, we Guardian Readers started to consider organising a small rival force of travelling supporters that will go out of their way to show another side of the English character. A group that will aim to ingratiate themselves with the host nation, cheering rather than denigrating the opposition at every opportunity, backing wholeheartedly the umpires\u2019 adjudications, and taking care to compliment the ground staff on preparing such superb wickets! Who knows, taking the lead from the delightful Japanese World Cup fans a couple of years ago, this newly Regenerated Regiment could even stick around to help clean up the stadium after the day\u2019s play. Come on, Guardian Readers! Why not?! After, of course, each of us has dutifully subscribed and contributed to the paper proper, let us join together to form our own brand of more \u2018woke\u2019 and enlightened supportership, We could do it! Come on! Let\u2019s hear it for The Guardian\u2019s own Smarmy Army.\u201d 25th over: South Africa 72-4 (Nortje 1, van der Dussen 0) The nightwatchman is in danger of ending up not out here. Nortje almost falls to Wood, fending close to the inevitable Pope at short leg, but then plays a wily tuck that gets him off the mark, and, more importantly, up the other end. Wood has the unlikely figures of 7-4-7-0. He has been far more threatening than Bess, but the pitch is on Bess\u2019s side, and so are the gods. \u201cOn the pop quiz question [22nd over],\u201d says Alex Bramble, \u201cit has to be the stylistically contrasting David Ivon Gower and Alastair Nathan Cook.\u201d We have a winner. \u201cAnd,\u201d he goes on, \u201cI\u2019m struggling to contain my enthusiasm about Pope; I haven\u2019t felt this excited since, well, Joe Root, and Iron Bell before that (and yes it looks like Pope deserves such exalted comparisons!).\u201d It does. 24th over: South Africa 71-4 (Nortje 0, van der Dussen 0) Faf had actually started well, dancing down the track to off-drive Bess for four, then repeating the trick next ball. But Bess stuck at it and got lucky. Poor old South Africa \u2013 they\u2019re making England\u2019s youngest players look like world-beaters. Another one! Another big one! Faf du Plessis tucks Bess round the corner, where the unstoppable Pope pops up to take a simpler catch at square short leg. Dom Bess has FOUR FOR 22. The world has gone completely mad. 23rd over: South Africa 63-3 (Nortje 0, du Plessis 0) Another maiden from Wood, who seems to be adding parsimony to his arsenal. If he could just stay fit, he might well be England\u2019s Mitchell Johnson. \u201cI know this is so yesterday,\u201d says James Gladstone, \u201cbut what kept me awake here in Chiangmai last night was \u2018what the hell is a former redhead\u2019, and subsequently \u2013 could there ever be or have been an XI of redheads given we\u2019ve got potentially 3 already...?\u201d I shudder to think what you\u2019ve started. 22nd over: South Africa 63-3 (Nortje 0, du Plessis 0) Root had just moved Pope to silly point, so full credit for that and time for the doubters to be silenced. What a match Pope is having. Yesterday, aged 22, he became the youngest right-hander to make a hundred for England since Colin Cowdrey in 1954 (hat-tip, the Times). In the past 66 years, two left-handers were even younger \u2013 can you name them? An inside edge, a pop off the pad, a dive forwards from silly point \u2013 and England have the wicket they most wanted. 21st over: South Africa 61-2 (Elgar 33, Nortje 0) Wood\u2019s pace again bothers Elgar, who flaps at a short one. The ball loops up and would be caught if there were two leg slips. Can\u2019t blame Root for that. 20th over: South Africa 60-2 (Elgar 32, Nortje 0) It\u2019s Dom Bess at the other end, so no Stuart Broad for now. He too opens with a maiden, but there are no alarms for the nightwatchman Nortje. 19th over: South Africa 60-2 (Elgar 32, Nortje 0) Wood does it again, third ball, and twice hurries Elgar into crabby deflections with a crooked bat. As first overs of the day go, that\u2019s superb. But already the commentators are chuntering about a missing catcher, at second slip. Root did well on one side, with a short leg and a leg slip, but something in him keeps on wanting to overdo the caution. Maybe it\u2019s the years he spent watching Alastair Cook setting the field. It\u2019s Mark Wood (hooray) and he opens with a jaffa \u2013 angled into the left-handed Elgar, and jagging past him. Not even Jerusalem can dampen the excitement. \u201cWhat times we live in,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cLooking forward avidly to a day\u2019s Test coverage. Thanks, in advance, for the great commentary, Tim.\u201d Steady on. That could be like saying thanks, in advance, for the great captaincy, Joe. Not only are England in charge, but the weather is better than forecast and the day seems to be starting on time. Something must be about to go horribly wrong, and Abhijato Sensarma is onto it. \u201cThe England Test side is easily one of the most volatile sporting outfits in the world. They oscillate from positions of comfort and advantage to ones of disarray and disadvantage, often within the same session. Yesterday was their best day in Test cricket for quite some time - the experienced players kept a cool head, while the young ones showed adequate style on their way to substance. The media is printing positive headlines for this team after a long time. If they do not follow it up with classical confusion, rusty bowling, and average fielding to surrender their advantage today, would the world even make sense anymore?\u201d Morning everyone. England\u2019s cricketers have just woken up to face an unfamiliar challenge: how do you follow a perfect day? Yesterday they had one fresh-faced 22-year-old making a masterly hundred, and then another grabbing two top-order wickets. England finished the day 439 ahead, with Dom Bess lording it at one end and Mark Wood delivering thunderbolts at the other. The good news for South Africa is that their task is simple enough: all they have to do is dig themselves out of a deep hole. One piece of evidence is on their side. So far in the third Test, not a single wicket has fallen before lunch. England should be able to change that curious fact with their tails up and a nightwatchman to bowl at \u2013 although, the last time he found himself doing this job, Anrich Nortje made a handy fortje. Dean Elgar has been his usual craggy self with 32 not out, and the pitch is slow, verging on dead for the seamers once the ball goes soft. So there may yet be a twist, but, for the moment, England are right on top. Joe Root even got away with impersonating the rather dopey captain he used to be \u2013 keeping Sam Curran on too long, bringing Wood on too late, and being so slow to surround the bat that you wondered if he\u2019d misread the scoreboard and thought he had 299 to play with, not 499. As it is, South Africa need 300 to avoid the follow-on, and they\u2019ve got one-fifth of the way there, at the cost of one-fifth of the wickets. So that element of the match is nicely poised. The weather forecast, alas, is gloomy, with every hour of the day being given a 50-to-60-per-cent chance of rain. But still, the glass is almost half full. See you at 10am Port Elizabeth time, 8am GMT, for the next episode in an absorbing series.",

And in spite of everything that has been written, I didn\u2019t feel like we had done the question justice. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re taking seriously this idea that there might not be enough well-paid work for everyone to do because of technological advances that are taking place.</p> <p><strong>Is that partly because of the way the question is framed, that \u201crobots are stealing our jobs\u201d when that\u2019s not how these changes are happening? </strong><br>Yes.

      "bodyText": "Daniel Susskind is an economist and fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He has held policy roles in the Blair and Cameron governments. His new book, A World Without Work, explores how society should respond to the increasing automation of employment. This isn\u2019t an unexplored topic, so why did you write this book? My view is that this is one of the greatest questions of our time. And in spite of everything that has been written, I didn\u2019t feel like we had done the question justice. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re taking seriously this idea that there might not be enough well-paid work for everyone to do because of technological advances that are taking place. Is that partly because of the way the question is framed, that \u201crobots are stealing our jobs\u201d when that\u2019s not how these changes are happening? Yes. There are two mistakes there. One is the sort of anthropomorphisation of technology \u2013 these robots exist but they are often gimmicks. The technologies that are really very powerful don\u2019t look, think or reason like us. The second mistake is to think of entire jobs being replaced. These technologies tend to displace people from tasks \u2013 what I call task encroachment. Many of the boundaries economists and computer scientists developed in the second part of the 20th century for thinking about what machines could and couldn\u2019t do have been crossed. For example, driving a car, making a medical diagnosis or identifying a bird from a fleeting glimpse. All these tasks can be accomplished by software now. And machines are often performing these tasks using strategies that are new to humans? We thought many of these tasks would be difficult to automate because humans couldn\u2019t articulate how they performed them. They relied on experience, intuition and gut reaction \u2013 so how could you write a set of instructions for a computer to follow? But by using lots of data and computing power, machines are creating new strategies. In the light of this technological change, what career path would you advise a 16-year-old to follow? Very crudely, I\u2019d say, there are two strategies: either you learn to be good at the sorts of things these systems and machines cannot do or you try to build the machines. But forecasting which jobs and tasks will be automated is hard. Should people bother training to be doctors or lawyers when automation is already encroaching on these careers? For young professionals, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, I say the best thing to do is pursue the traditional path. But be far more agnostic and open minded along the way about opportunities that come up. Because what\u2019s interesting is that if you look at these technologies \u2013 take the systems developed by DeepMind or the ones that recognise melanomas by Sebastian Thrun\u2019s team at Stanford \u2013 these teams contain lots of domain experts, such as trained doctors. Technological unemployment appears be growing alongside rising inequality \u2013 is there a direct relationship between the two? Work is our traditional way of distributing income, so one of the great challenges of a world with less work is how we slice up the pie. The labour share of income is falling in many parts of the developed world. Should robots be taxed and that money funnelled back to the victims of automation? There are various problems with this idea. What do we mean by a robot? A driverless car isn\u2019t driven by an android. How do we do a robot headcount? We do need to tax capital, the owners \u2013 however that has a branding problem. But the owners of the these technologies are often quite good at avoiding tax. If the trends in inequality continue, focusing on how we resolve that problem is going to become more pertinent. You advance the idea of a \u201cconditional\u201d universal basic income. I think the challenge in a world with less work is how you maintain that sense of social solidarity. At the moment, that comes from a sense that everyone is paying into the collective economic pot through their taxes or, if they\u2019re not in work, they are actively looking for work or training for work. I think one of the problems of a universal basic income [a payment made to the entire population regardless of employment status] is that too many people take offence at the idea that you give something and don\u2019t expect anything in return. But perhaps we can introduce conditions to a UBI, for example that you undertake some valuable voluntary work in return. There are something like 15 million people doing a hugely valuable set of voluntary activities in the UK \u2013 why not recognise that? The UBI solves the distribution problem \u2013 how do you share income if the labour market doesn\u2019t do it very well? \u2013 and if everyone is contributing, some in economic and others in non-economic ways, that may solve the we\u2019re-all-in-it-together problem. Volunteering requires empathy and hands-on skills that computers find hard and such activities are not rewarded very well. There is a paradox. Machines can\u2019t do them and they tend to be unpaid by the market. There\u2019s this huge gap between the social value of a lot of this work and the value that\u2019s recognised in the market.

Some of the exchanges are graphic. In one \u2013 on 16 November 2016 \u2013 an employee flying the Max simulator reports that the MCAS autopilot software, which is believed to have caused the two fatal crashes of the plane, is continually frustrating his attempts to control it. \u201cIt\u2019s running rampant in the sim [simulator] on me,\u201d he emails a colleague. \u201cI\u2019m levelling off at like 4,000 feet and the plane is trimming itself like crazy.\u201d This is the behaviour that the pilots on the two doomed flights experienced: they kept on trying to keep the nose up while the software continually overrode them and turned it down.

Interestingly, Bosworth, who continually flaunts his \u201cliberal\u201d credentials, does not mention Myanmar in his memo, but focuses instead on the 2016 US presidential election, when he was head of Facebook\u2019s advertising operation. He maintains that almost all media coverage of the company\u2019s influence in that electoral contest (including our coverage) was misguided or uninformed.

(I am not making this up.) This then leads to the conclusion that Bosworth should do nothing except ensure it is business as usual, even if that leads to Trump\u2019s re-election.</p> <p>And that\u2019s OK, apparently, because if people are taken in by political propaganda then that\u2019s their problem, just as people who become addicted to tobacco, sugar or opioids ultimately bear the responsibility for their plights.

Sugar is delicious and for most of us there is a special place for it in our lives. But like all things it benefits from moderation. At the end of the day, we are forced to ask what responsibility individuals have for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>So, ultimately, it\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s responsibility to, say, ban political advertising that is demonstrably misleading or malevolently false. This has the convenient result of enabling Bosworth to burnish his liberal credentials behind that Rawlsian veil while the money rolls in. There\u2019s an old English word for this: hypocrisy.

At the end of the day, we are forced to ask what responsibility individuals have for themselves.\u201d So, ultimately, it\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s responsibility to, say, ban political advertising that is demonstrably misleading or malevolently false. This has the convenient result of enabling Bosworth to burnish his liberal credentials behind that Rawlsian veil while the money rolls in. There\u2019s an old English word for this: hypocrisy. If he ever needs another job, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a place for him at Boeing. What I\u2019m reading Sticking point There is a nice essay by John Kay on his blog about whether Adam Smith ever actually visited a pin factory (the economist used one to explain the division of labour in The Wealth of Nations). Answer: probably not, but it doesn\u2019t matter because his sources were good. Twitter ye not An article about our recent election in the Atlantic declares \u201cthe Twitter electorate isn\u2019t the real electorate\u201d. I wish more journalists understood that.

      "body": "<h2>Cheesy buckwheat crepes with egg and ham</h2> <p>Buckwheat flour is one of my favourite flours to bake with, it goes with both savoury and sweet so the toppings or fillings for these crepes are endless. This will probably make a few more crepes than you need but the mixture keeps well in the fridge for up to a week.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><strong>vegetable oil</strong> for frying<br><strong>gruyere </strong>200g, grated<br><strong>eggs </strong>4 <br><strong>coppa, speck or prosciutto </strong>100-150g</p> <p><em><strong>For the crepe batter</strong></em><br><strong>buckwheat flour </strong>100g <br><strong>millet flour </strong>100g <br><strong>eggs </strong>3 <br><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tbsp <br><strong>salt </strong>\u00bd tsp <br><strong>milk </strong>450ml <br><strong>malt extract </strong>1 tbsp</p> <p>Whisk all of the ingredients for the crepe batter together, strain the batter into another bowl and leave to rest for 20 minutes.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 100C/gas mark \u00bc and line a baking tray with parchment paper; you will need to keep the crepes warm in between frying the rest.</p> <p>Rub some oil into a 20-23cm cast iron frying pan with kitchen paper, then heat until the pan is very hot but not smoking.</p> <p>Keep stirring the batter to prevent it from separating before ladling it into the hot pan. Ladle in about 50ml for each crepe, then sprinkle 50g of the grated gruyere over. When the underside of the crepe is becoming golden and the edges easily come away from the frying pan, fold the crepe in half from edge to edge.</p> <p>Place the folded crepe onto the lined baking tray and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining batter and cheese.</p> <p>Once all of the crepes are warming in the oven, fry the four eggs in a separate pan. Serve the crepes with the fried eggs and cured ham on top.</p> <h2>Radicchio frittata with warm bacon salad</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"577c172e691b114f1b037ae60485603f2acb87f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/577c172e691b114f1b037ae60485603f2acb87f8/0_1277_6085_6083/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radicchio frittata with warm bacon salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I love salad for every meal of the day but especially brunch. Radicchio can often be on the bitter side, but grilling or frying it really tempers that bitterness. The crisp texture is amazing with the silky egg frittata. </p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><br><em><strong>For the frittata</strong></em><br><strong>radicchio</strong> 1 head, cut into 8 wedges <br><strong>plain flour </strong>40g <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 125ml, plus 3 tbsp <br><strong>sea salt and black pepper </strong><br><strong>eggs</strong> 8 large <br><strong>parmesan</strong> 20g</p> <p><em><strong>For the salad</strong></em><br><strong>oak leaf lettuce </strong>1 head, leaves separated \u2013 little gem can be used instead, but use 2 heads<br><strong>smoked streaky bacon</strong> 4 rashers <br><strong>sourdough bread</strong> 2 small pieces <br><strong>garlic</strong> \u00bd peeled clove<br><strong>flat-leaf parsley</strong> \u00bd bunch, leaves picked, to finish<br><strong>sea salt </strong><strong>and black pepper</strong> to taste</p> <p><em><strong>For the dressing</strong></em><br><strong>sherry vinegar</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>banana shallot</strong> \u00bd, very finely sliced and broken apart <br><strong>garlic</strong> \u00bd clove, peeled, finely minced</p> <p>First, prepare the dressing for the salad by whisking all of the ingredients together, then set aside. Thoroughly wash and dry the lettuce leaves and place in the fridge.</p> <p>To make the frittata, remove the outer leaves of the radicchio, trim the bottom and cut the head into eight equal wedges. Rinse the wedges and shake off excess water, pat dry with kitchen paper then gently press each wedge into the flour to cover all over. Shake off any excess.</p> <p>Heat the 125ml of olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the wedges on a high heat for about 3-4 minutes on each side. Remove them from the frying pan, leave to drain on a paper towel and sprinkle with sea salt.</p> <p>In another pan, fry the bacon for the salad over a medium to high heat until crisp; remove from the pan and leave to drain on a paper towel while you make the frittata. Reserve the excess bacon fat in the pan for later.</p> <p>Beat the eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt and crack of pepper. In a 25cm ovenproof frying pan, heat the remaining three tablespoons of olive oil until very hot but not smoking. Arrange the fried radicchio in the pan in a single layer and then pour the egg mixture over.</p> <p>Using an oven mitt, hold the frying pan handle with one hand and support it with the other. Swirl the pan in a circular motion to evenly distribute the egg, then cook the frittata for around 7 minutes. Resist the temptation to stir as this will cause it to stick.</p> <p>While the frittata is cooking, warm the pre-made dressing in the pan you used to fry the bacon, being careful not to brown the shallots and garlic. Rub the two slices of bread with the halved garlic clove and tear the bread into the pan. Add the contents of the pan to a large bowl along with the salad leaves and toss with the whole parsley leaves. Drizzle the salad with a little more oil, as the bread will absorb a lot of the oil from the pan. Season with salt and pepper.</p> <p>Take the frittata pan off the heat and place under a preheated grill for 2 minutes and then sprinkle with the parmesan. Serve immediately with the salad.</p> <h2>Ana\u00efs Nin\u2019s cheese souffl\u00e9</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7685aff9d5a6da20ef479b0711230aa577adf555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7685aff9d5a6da20ef479b0711230aa577adf555/19_926_5589_5589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ana\u00efs Nin\u2019s cheese souffl\u00e9.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been thinking about this souffl\u00e9 since I first watched <em>Henry &amp; June</em>, the 1990 film by Philip Kaufman, where the then unpublished Henry Miller is beginning his affair with Ana\u00efs Nin, who serves the souffl\u00e9 to her guests and Henry takes the entire top for himself.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 80g, plus 25g very soft butter for greasing the dish<br><strong>parmesan</strong> 20g, grated, plus more for grating over <br><strong>eggs</strong> 4 large <br><strong>flour</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>milk</strong> 240ml <br><strong>gruyere</strong> 125g, grated <br><strong>cream of tartar </strong>1 tsp <br><strong>salt </strong><strong>and pepper</strong> to taste <br><strong>salad or wilted greens</strong><strong> </strong>to serve</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 8.</p> <p>Rub a 20-23cm souffl\u00e9 dish or any other ovenproof baking dish with the 25g of very soft butter, sprinkle with the 20g of grated parmesan and set aside.</p> <p>Separate your eggs, place the whites into a clean stainless steel bowl and reserve the yolks for later.</p> <p>Melt the 80g of butter in a medium-sized saucepan.

In a saucepan, melt the butter, the salt and the 100g of sugar, and then add the chopped apples and the water. Stir the mixture regularly over medium heat until the apples are soft.</p> <p>Divide the dough into 12 even pieces and shape each into a small ball. You can evenly distribute 6 balls on to your lined baking tray.</p> <p>Cover with a clean cloth and leave to rest in a warm place for an hour and a half. Make the egg wash by whisking together the egg yolks and milk, then brush it on the rested buns. Use the back of a spoon to create a dip in the back of each bun. Add a heaped tablespoon of custard and a heaped tablespoon of the apple filling to each bun and sprinkle with the extra golden caster sugar.</p> <p>Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Serve warm or at room temperature, but they are best eaten on the day of making. <br><em>Claire Ptak is chef-owner of <a href=\"http://www.violetcakes.com/\" title=\"\">Violet Bakery</a>, London E8</em></p>",

Preheat the oven to 100C/gas mark \u00bc and line a baking tray with parchment paper; you will need to keep the crepes warm in between frying the rest. Rub some oil into a 20-23cm cast iron frying pan with kitchen paper, then heat until the pan is very hot but not smoking.

When the underside of the crepe is becoming golden and the edges easily come away from the frying pan, fold the crepe in half from edge to edge. Place the folded crepe onto the lined baking tray and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining batter and cheese. Once all of the crepes are warming in the oven, fry the four eggs in a separate pan. Serve the crepes with the fried eggs and cured ham on top.

Combine all the ingredients for the pre-ferment in a standing electric mixer and beat until smooth with the dough hook attachment. If you don\u2019t have a standing mixer, you can hand mix with a wooden spoon. Once you have a smooth mixture, refrigerate for 30 minutes to one and a half hours. While the pre-ferment is in the fridge, weigh out all the ingredients for the brioche dough except for the butter. Whisk together the eggs and milk in one bowl and in a separate bowl, whisk together the bread flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Remove the pre-ferment from the fridge and gradually add the wet and dry dough ingredients to the pre-ferment mixture until combined and smooth. Let the mixture rest for 20 minutes and then add the cold cubed butter and mix for another 10 minutes or until smooth. Put the dough into a small airtight container that will fit in your freezer for 2 hours or refrigerate overnight. Make the custard while the dough is chilling. Prepare a bowl in an ice bath to have on hand for when you need to stop the cooking process of the custard. Heat the milk, salt and sugar over a medium heat \u2013 be careful not to burn it. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and cornflour and add to the heated (not boiling) milk mixture. Whisk until thick but not curdled. Sieve the heated mixture into the bowl that is sitting in the ice bath, and once you have done this add the cubed butter and mix until completely melted. If the mixture becomes lumpy, you can use a food processor to blend it smooth again. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Peel, core and roughly chop the apples. In a saucepan, melt the butter, the salt and the 100g of sugar, and then add the chopped apples and the water. Stir the mixture regularly over medium heat until the apples are soft. Divide the dough into 12 even pieces and shape each into a small ball. You can evenly distribute 6 balls on to your lined baking tray. Cover with a clean cloth and leave to rest in a warm place for an hour and a half. Make the egg wash by whisking together the egg yolks and milk, then brush it on the rested buns. Use the back of a spoon to create a dip in the back of each bun. Add a heaped tablespoon of custard and a heaped tablespoon of the apple filling to each bun and sprinkle with the extra golden caster sugar. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Serve warm or at room temperature, but they are best eaten on the day of making. Claire Ptak is chef-owner of Violet Bakery, London E8",

The Financial Times last week declared the 2010s to have been \u201cthe decade of the Fangs\u201d, and said that most experts predicted the tech companies to \u201ccontinue to reign in the coming decade\u201d. Amazon, which has turned its chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, into the world\u2019s richest man, first reached the trillion-dollar milestone in the summer of 2018. The company\u2019s value is now hovering around $930bn. Facebook, whose shares have risen by 50% in the past year, is closing on the landmark with a valuation of $632bn. Shares in almost all the companies have soared in recent weeks, as the market expects them to report strong figures when they release their full-year financial earnings, starting with Netflix on Tuesday. Alphabet\u2019s figures will be released on 3 February. The five largest companies \u2013 Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook \u2013 now make up 19% of the S&amp;P 500 index of America\u2019s biggest companies. The fast-growing dominance of tech is highlighted by the fact that in 2015 the five largest companies made up just 12% of the index. \u201cIn the past year, the aggregate market capitalisation of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet has gone up by 45%, or almost $1.3tn, even as combined consensus earnings estimates for 2019 and 2020 have fallen by 7% and 8%, or $10.7bn and $9.6bn respectively,\u201d said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell. \u201cThis combination of soaring share prices and sliding earnings means that the Faangs as a group have been hugely re-rated, from 21 times earnings for 2020 to nearly 30 times now. \u201cAt the moment, investors are being very forgiving in the view that new product or services releases will fire earnings growth; customers are being more tolerant of data use than regulators; and those investments will pay off in the long term by opening new markets or boosting returns from the existing one.\u201d Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on tech companies at Synovus Trust, said Alphabet, led by Sundar Pichai, had \u201creally been a cash cow\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve been steadily continuing to post 15% to 20% growth, which is pretty amazing when you consider how mature that model is.\u201d Christopher Rossbach, the chief investment officer of Knightsbridge-based investment manager J Stern &amp; Co, which helps advise ultra-high-net-worth families, reckons that Alphabet could double its market value despite the threat it is facing of intense scrutiny from politicians and regulators across the world. \u201cAs Alphabet joins Apple, Microsoft and (from time to time) Amazon among tech companies that have reached this level, it marks just the start for the company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt still has significant further room to grow, both in its core online advertising business and as it innovates in advertising monetisation and formats, and in its cloud computing business.\u201d Rossbach said that despite the 27% increase in Alphabet\u2019s share price in the past 12 months, the stock was still \u201cat a very attractive valuation\u201d. \u201cAlphabet is laying the foundations for a much larger company as it is the unequivocal leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning,\u201d he said. \u201cAlphabet can be a $2tn company in the near future and is a compelling opportunity for long-term investors.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>One of the options on a fully loaded Tesla is \u201cludicrous mode\u201d, a setting offering a 0-60mph acceleration time of 2.8 seconds for drivers who find its \u201cinsane mode\u201d too sedate.</p> <p>To some investors, that\u2019s similar to chief executive Elon Musk\u2019s bonus package: if the electric carmaker\u2019s share price goes above $554.80 \u2013 which would value the firm at $100bn, and which it came very close to last week \u2013 the mercurial entrepreneur could reap the first $350m instalment of a potential $50bn share-based pay package.</p> <p>In the event, Tesla didn\u2019t break through the key $100bn valuation last week \u2013 its share price was affected by new Chinese GDP figures showing the slowest growth in 29 years and a stock downgrade which together pushed Tesla\u2019s shares below $500. Still, rising demand in Europe and China, coupled with record deliveries, has contributed to a remarkable change of fortune for the world\u2019s leading electric-vehicle maker, which has pushed its shares up nearly 180% since last summer.</p> <p>Last year, Tesla\u2019s stock sank as low as $179 in the aftermath of Twitter comments by Musk that he planned to take the company private. There were production problems, and regulators forced Musk to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/29/elon-musk-tesla-40m-sec-case-tweets\" title=\"\">relinquish his chairmanship and pay a $20m fine</a>.</p> <p>But six months later, Tesla was in turnaround. Its stock price more than doubled from October to December, and has climbed another 24% this year to a peak on Wednesday, helped by a surprise third-quarter profit, fourth-quarter delivery numbers that beat expectations, and the first cars rolling off the production line <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/30/tesla-delivers-first-china-made-cars-from-shanghai-factory\" title=\"\">at Tesla\u2019s new \u201cGigafactory\u201d in Shanghai</a>.</p> <p>Over the same period, Musk\u2019s 18.9% stake in the company doubled in value to $18.3bn; Oracle founder Larry Ellison made $1.6bn on his holdings; and Tesla\u2019s value neared 27.2 times its earnings, according to Bloomberg. For comparison, General Motors trades at a multiple of 2.6 and Ford at 2.3.</p> <p>Analysts are nonetheless divided on the company\u2019s future path. On Tuesday, investment bank Jefferies raised its target price on the stock to $600, calling Tesla \u201cthe only carmaker engaged in a positive-sum game in EVs amid rising market acceptance\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The recent rally may be the final tipping point for the mother of all short squeezes</p> <footer> <cite>S3 Partners, analysts</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two days later, Morgan Stanley recommended selling Tesla, its first downgrade on the stock in seven years, arguing that sales growth in China was already priced in. \u201cNear-term momentum and sentiment around the stock is admittedly very strong, but we ultimately question the sustainability of the momentum,\u201d said Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas.</p> <p>But others take a diametrically opposed view. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cDemand in Europe has helped counter some of the choppiness in the US but China ramping up is the key that we think is worth $100-$150 to the stock.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s steep rise in value also hasn\u2019t stopped the short sellers, who are betting on the share price taking a dive; Musk has described them as saboteurs who \u201cwant the company to die\u201d. </p> <p>Tesla is reckoned to be the most shorted company on the US stock markets. The value of shares that have now been borrowed by these short sellers \u2013 a move necessary to take a short position on a stock \u2013 reached $14.5bn last week, according to data analytics firm S3 Partners. Apple, by comparison, which is far larger than Tesla and valued at $1.4tn, has about $14.3bn invested in shorting its stock.</p> <p>So far, says S3, those Tesla short-sellers have racked up $2.8bn in mark-to-market losses. The analytics firm added: \u201cThe recent rally may be the final tipping point for the mother of all short squeezes.\u201d</p> <p>But the shorts are convinced the business is heading for a crash. In the US, demand for its cars has dropped, particularly in green-focused California. There, the number of new Tesla registrations nearly halved over the last three months of 2019, from 25,402 to 13,584, according to sales data company Dominion Cross-Sell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/index-html-zip/giv-3902HpQhOWus24wA/\" data-alt=\"Tesla share price\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/index-html-zip/giv-3902HpQhOWus24wA/\">Tesla share price</a> </figure>  <p>The massive drop follows the ending of a tax credit for Tesla buyers last year which allowed buyers to deduct up to $7,500 from the purchase price. At the same time, competition in the market is increasing, with companies such as the electric pickup maker Rivian, Audi, Mini, Nissan and the big three US carmakers introducing new electric models for 2021. </p> <p>But in Shanghai recently, Musk danced on stage to celebrate delivering the first Model 3 saloons in China and he spent the new year at the company\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, to mark a record 112,000 cars delivered in the last quarter.</p> <p>His stake in Tesla is now worth more than $18bn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the options on a fully loaded Tesla is \u201cludicrous mode\u201d, a setting offering a 0-60mph acceleration time of 2.8 seconds for drivers who find its \u201cinsane mode\u201d too sedate. To some investors, that\u2019s similar to chief executive Elon Musk\u2019s bonus package: if the electric carmaker\u2019s share price goes above $554.80 \u2013 which would value the firm at $100bn, and which it came very close to last week \u2013 the mercurial entrepreneur could reap the first $350m instalment of a potential $50bn share-based pay package. In the event, Tesla didn\u2019t break through the key $100bn valuation last week \u2013 its share price was affected by new Chinese GDP figures showing the slowest growth in 29 years and a stock downgrade which together pushed Tesla\u2019s shares below $500. Still, rising demand in Europe and China, coupled with record deliveries, has contributed to a remarkable change of fortune for the world\u2019s leading electric-vehicle maker, which has pushed its shares up nearly 180% since last summer. Last year, Tesla\u2019s stock sank as low as $179 in the aftermath of Twitter comments by Musk that he planned to take the company private. There were production problems, and regulators forced Musk to relinquish his chairmanship and pay a $20m fine. But six months later, Tesla was in turnaround. Its stock price more than doubled from October to December, and has climbed another 24% this year to a peak on Wednesday, helped by a surprise third-quarter profit, fourth-quarter delivery numbers that beat expectations, and the first cars rolling off the production line at Tesla\u2019s new \u201cGigafactory\u201d in Shanghai. Over the same period, Musk\u2019s 18.9% stake in the company doubled in value to $18.3bn; Oracle founder Larry Ellison made $1.6bn on his holdings; and Tesla\u2019s value neared 27.2 times its earnings, according to Bloomberg. For comparison, General Motors trades at a multiple of 2.6 and Ford at 2.3. Analysts are nonetheless divided on the company\u2019s future path. On Tuesday, investment bank Jefferies raised its target price on the stock to $600, calling Tesla \u201cthe only carmaker engaged in a positive-sum game in EVs amid rising market acceptance\u201d. Two days later, Morgan Stanley recommended selling Tesla, its first downgrade on the stock in seven years, arguing that sales growth in China was already priced in. \u201cNear-term momentum and sentiment around the stock is admittedly very strong, but we ultimately question the sustainability of the momentum,\u201d said Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas. But others take a diametrically opposed view. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities told the Observer: \u201cDemand in Europe has helped counter some of the choppiness in the US but China ramping up is the key that we think is worth $100-$150 to the stock.\u201d The company\u2019s steep rise in value also hasn\u2019t stopped the short sellers, who are betting on the share price taking a dive; Musk has described them as saboteurs who \u201cwant the company to die\u201d. Tesla is reckoned to be the most shorted company on the US stock markets. The value of shares that have now been borrowed by these short sellers \u2013 a move necessary to take a short position on a stock \u2013 reached $14.5bn last week, according to data analytics firm S3 Partners. Apple, by comparison, which is far larger than Tesla and valued at $1.4tn, has about $14.3bn invested in shorting its stock. So far, says S3, those Tesla short-sellers have racked up $2.8bn in mark-to-market losses. The analytics firm added: \u201cThe recent rally may be the final tipping point for the mother of all short squeezes.\u201d But the shorts are convinced the business is heading for a crash. In the US, demand for its cars has dropped, particularly in green-focused California. There, the number of new Tesla registrations nearly halved over the last three months of 2019, from 25,402 to 13,584, according to sales data company Dominion Cross-Sell. The massive drop follows the ending of a tax credit for Tesla buyers last year which allowed buyers to deduct up to $7,500 from the purchase price. At the same time, competition in the market is increasing, with companies such as the electric pickup maker Rivian, Audi, Mini, Nissan and the big three US carmakers introducing new electric models for 2021. But in Shanghai recently, Musk danced on stage to celebrate delivering the first Model 3 saloons in China and he spent the new year at the company\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, to mark a record 112,000 cars delivered in the last quarter. His stake in Tesla is now worth more than $18bn.",

Willie Mullins, trainer of the runner-up, evidently wanted to run the race again. \u201cI thought the winner had improved hugely but I was disappointed in my fella,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we went fast enough.\u201d In the winner\u2019s enclosure, Philip Hobbs was naturally in another mood entirely, his eyes red-rimmed by the emotion of the moment. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised, very surprised, by how easy he did it,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine he would go and beat Un De Sceaux as easily as he did. He\u2019s won seven Grade Ones for us. No other horse we\u2019ve had has ever done anything like that. And he\u2019s only just turned seven.\u201d There now remains the question of which race to shoot for at the Cheltenham Festival in March, bearing in mind that Defi Du Seuil won over two miles and five furlongs there last year. For that reason, he was expected to be a Ryanair horse this term but he has proved so electric over the minimum distance that he is now 2-1 with most firms for the Champion Chase. Surely no owner diverts a Champion Chase favourite to another target and it is worth noting that JP McManus has yet to win the two\u2011mile championship race. But Defi Du Seuil has not faced horses of the quality of Altior or Chacun Pour Soi this season and the Ryanair, against A Plus Tard and Min, would be easier. Meanwhile, Haydock\u2019s Champion Hurdle Trial seems as unlikely as ever to live up to its name, Ballyandy having snatched victory in the last stride from a paddling Pentland Hills. The winner is extremely game but you can get 33-1 about his chance in the big one at Cheltenham. For the second time this winter, Pentland Hills raced too freely and failed to get home. Perhaps the faster pace and better ground of a Champion Hurdle will show him to better advantage but he has a lot to prove now. Nicky Henderson, his trainer, professed himself \u201cgutted\u201d.",

Chuck went before the parole board last month and we are optimistic that he will be released in the very near future.\u201d The Guardian told the story of Del Africa and his fellow Move 9 member Janine Phillips Africa in a series of articles on black radicals who have been incarcerated for decades as a result of their activities in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

He is reluctant to ask people not to take pictures of the food before they start to eat, however, despite his disapproval. \u201cWe\u2019ve debated this for several years now,\u201d he told the <em>Radio Times</em>. \u201cIf you say to people, \u2018Your food\u2019s going cold\u2019, you put up a barrier between you and the diner.\u201d</p> <p>Blumenthal knows that the Fat Duck is an expensive restaurant. Its set menu is \u00a3325 per person and that\u2019s before drinks or service. It has three Michelin stars and four out of four pound signs. My immediate and instinctive reaction was that if customers are paying that much for their meal, a dinner that is inevitably beautiful to look at, then they have every right to ask their food to pose. Snap away. Fill your camera-roll boots.</p> <p>And yet I find myself sympathetic to Blumenthal\u2019s frustrations. As social media has taken hold, there has been a growing inability to enjoy an experience without documenting and broadcasting it. To feel resistant to that can feel like trying to hold back the tide.</p> <p>It may be hopeless to resist it at all. I often think about the recent Australian <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40558-019-00151-4\" title=\"\">study</a> that suggested that documenting an experience, and presenting it for an audience, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/27/what-happened-when-six-travellers-were-told-they-were-not-allowed-to-post-to-instagram\" title=\"\">turned into the experience itself</a>. People enjoyed their holiday less when they couldn\u2019t take a picture and tell other people about it online. That doesn\u2019t mean that those people were less engaged, simply that the rules of engagement have changed, quickly and emphatically.</p> <p>It made me far more understanding of those viral shots of massive crowds at tourist destinations, queueing and jostling for the perfect, seemingly solitary Instagram post. It is as much a part of travel, for instance, as a dip in the pool or that first wave of a warm breeze that hits you in the face when you step off the plane.</p> <p>\u201cIf I see something beautiful like a sunset, I try to be in the moment, then take a picture afterwards,\u201d added Blumenthal, though if he waits until the sun has set, the picture won\u2019t be much to look at. \u201cA lot of people now are more interested in capturing a photograph so they can post it, which disconnects them from the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps, though, saying we were there, with a picture, with a post, is simply part of being there now and that is more connected than it seems.</p> <h2>Jessica Raine: call the dog whisperer</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e109ff10853b970eae50ff353445559da4063445\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e109ff10853b970eae50ff353445559da4063445/0_203_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Raine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Raine: a dog\u2019s best friend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I never thought I\u2019d find myself drawn into a five-hour podcast for dogs that is mostly made up of ambient sounds and the actress <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jessica-raine\" title=\"\">Jessica Raine</a> giving a canine audience the kind of positive affirmations for which you\u2019d pay an annual subscription on an app like Headspace.

      "bodyText": "Heston Blumenthal has spoken about the ongoing issue of diners picking up their phones before their knives and forks while eating at his Berkshire restaurant, the Fat Duck. He is reluctant to ask people not to take pictures of the food before they start to eat, however, despite his disapproval. \u201cWe\u2019ve debated this for several years now,\u201d he told the Radio Times. \u201cIf you say to people, \u2018Your food\u2019s going cold\u2019, you put up a barrier between you and the diner.\u201d Blumenthal knows that the Fat Duck is an expensive restaurant. Its set menu is \u00a3325 per person and that\u2019s before drinks or service. It has three Michelin stars and four out of four pound signs. My immediate and instinctive reaction was that if customers are paying that much for their meal, a dinner that is inevitably beautiful to look at, then they have every right to ask their food to pose. Snap away. Fill your camera-roll boots. And yet I find myself sympathetic to Blumenthal\u2019s frustrations. As social media has taken hold, there has been a growing inability to enjoy an experience without documenting and broadcasting it. To feel resistant to that can feel like trying to hold back the tide. It may be hopeless to resist it at all. I often think about the recent Australian study that suggested that documenting an experience, and presenting it for an audience, has turned into the experience itself. People enjoyed their holiday less when they couldn\u2019t take a picture and tell other people about it online. That doesn\u2019t mean that those people were less engaged, simply that the rules of engagement have changed, quickly and emphatically. It made me far more understanding of those viral shots of massive crowds at tourist destinations, queueing and jostling for the perfect, seemingly solitary Instagram post. It is as much a part of travel, for instance, as a dip in the pool or that first wave of a warm breeze that hits you in the face when you step off the plane. \u201cIf I see something beautiful like a sunset, I try to be in the moment, then take a picture afterwards,\u201d added Blumenthal, though if he waits until the sun has set, the picture won\u2019t be much to look at. \u201cA lot of people now are more interested in capturing a photograph so they can post it, which disconnects them from the moment.\u201d Perhaps, though, saying we were there, with a picture, with a post, is simply part of being there now and that is more connected than it seems. Jessica Raine: call the dog whisperer I never thought I\u2019d find myself drawn into a five-hour podcast for dogs that is mostly made up of ambient sounds and the actress Jessica Raine giving a canine audience the kind of positive affirmations for which you\u2019d pay an annual subscription on an app like Headspace. But if this is what 2020 sounds like, then I\u2019m all in. Raine, best known for her role as Jenny Lee in Call the Midwife, narrates the first of Spotify\u2019s My Dog\u2019s Favourite Podcast (bit presumptuous; mine likes This American Life), an epic show intended to be left on to relax pets when their owners go out. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brilliant about dogs like you? You help people make friends,\u201d Raine purrs. It\u2019s far more articulate than what my dog usually hears, which is either \u201cwho\u2019s a good girl?\u201d or \u201cget your muddy paws off that\u201d. I tried My Dog\u2019s Favourite Podcast out on her, to see how she reacted. She looked at me for a second, pricked her ears up at the word \u201cdog\u201d (dogs are supposed to understand at least 165 words, but mine pretends she only knows three: biscuit, breakfast and dog) and then sauntered out of the room, with a minor air of disgust. I, however, was too relaxed to care.

The move to blockade oil exports is a new show of strength as world leaders try to force Haftar, the leader of the Libyan National Army who runs the east of the country, and Fayez al-Sarraj, the leader of the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, into a ceasefire agreement that can end a 10-month battle over control of the capital. A blockade could result in the shutdown of Libyan oil production within five days, the Libyan National Oil Corporation warned. Haftar has been attacking Tripoli since April, but Europe has so far done little to prevent the assault, apart from calling for a ceasefire. Turkey and Russia have recently taken advantage of European neglect, caused by divisions, by sending in forces and turning the oil-rich country, a gateway for African migrants into Europe, into a playground for international intervention, akin to Syria. Russia has dispatched mercenaries in support of Haftar, while the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has come to the defence of Tripoli\u2019s government, sending a mix of Turkish troops and Syrian fighters.

      "body": "<p>A controversial film highlighting \u201cdisappearances\u201d in Kashmir that premieres in Britain this week has led to fears of heightened tension between the country\u2019s Indian and Pakistani communities.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUkR6395p44\" title=\"\">No Fathers in Kashmir </a></em>tells the story of a British-Kashmiri teenage girl who travels to the Indian Himalayan state to search for her father, only to discover that he \u201cdisappeared\u201d and was then killed after being taken away by Indian soldiers for interrogation.</p> <p>The film is set against the backdrop of the continuing turmoil in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir\" title=\"\">Indian-administered Kashmir</a> and vividly addresses the contentious issue of human rights violations that are alleged to have been committed by security forces as they battle to suppress a popular insurgency that has raged for the past 30 years.</p> <p>According to human rights campaigners, an estimated 8,000 people have \u201cdisappeared\u201d during this time.</p> <p>The film, partly funded by a group of British Kashmiris, opens in Bradford followed by screenings in London and other cities where there is a substantial South Asian population.</p> <p>Last year, Kashmir exploded into renewed turmoil after the Indian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/india-strips-kashmir-of-special-status-and-divides-it-in-two\" title=\"\">revoked its special status</a> and placed it in lockdown. Known as Article 370, the move stripped away the autonomy Kashmir had been granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. Another part of the state remained within Pakistan. Both countries claim it as their own.</p> <p>The move prompted anger in Britain and protests outside the Indian High Commission, which resulted in violence, vandalism and several arrests. Demonstrations were also held in other cities, including Birmingham and Manchester.</p> <p>Of the 1.1 million British Pakistanis, more than one million originate from the part of Kashmir governed by Pakistan. While there are no official figures for the number of Indian Kashmiris in Britain, the overall British Indian community numbers almost 1.4 million people, and support for India\u2019s position is strong among some sections of that community.</p> <p>Sabir Gull, a senior member of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, which was founded in Birmingham in 1977 and campaigns for the state\u2019s independence, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want this film to create more problems but there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that it definitely could \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be shown.</p> <p>\u201cKashmir is a sensitive matter for both British Indian and Pakistani communities. Drawing attention to human rights violations through film or any other medium is giving the oppressed a voice. Disappearances and the other crimes that have been committed against the Kashmiri people will not go away if we bury our heads in the sand. At the end of the day, we are all British but we can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>Kuldeep Shekhawat, head of the UK branch of the Overseas Friends of the BJP, which supports India\u2019s governing party and aims to increase its popularity among British Indians, said: \u201cThis film does not serve any purpose.

      "bodyText": "A controversial film highlighting \u201cdisappearances\u201d in Kashmir that premieres in Britain this week has led to fears of heightened tension between the country\u2019s Indian and Pakistani communities. No Fathers in Kashmir tells the story of a British-Kashmiri teenage girl who travels to the Indian Himalayan state to search for her father, only to discover that he \u201cdisappeared\u201d and was then killed after being taken away by Indian soldiers for interrogation. The film is set against the backdrop of the continuing turmoil in Indian-administered Kashmir and vividly addresses the contentious issue of human rights violations that are alleged to have been committed by security forces as they battle to suppress a popular insurgency that has raged for the past 30 years. According to human rights campaigners, an estimated 8,000 people have \u201cdisappeared\u201d during this time. The film, partly funded by a group of British Kashmiris, opens in Bradford followed by screenings in London and other cities where there is a substantial South Asian population. Last year, Kashmir exploded into renewed turmoil after the Indian government revoked its special status and placed it in lockdown. Known as Article 370, the move stripped away the autonomy Kashmir had been granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. Another part of the state remained within Pakistan. Both countries claim it as their own. The move prompted anger in Britain and protests outside the Indian High Commission, which resulted in violence, vandalism and several arrests. Demonstrations were also held in other cities, including Birmingham and Manchester. Of the 1.1 million British Pakistanis, more than one million originate from the part of Kashmir governed by Pakistan. While there are no official figures for the number of Indian Kashmiris in Britain, the overall British Indian community numbers almost 1.4 million people, and support for India\u2019s position is strong among some sections of that community. Sabir Gull, a senior member of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, which was founded in Birmingham in 1977 and campaigns for the state\u2019s independence, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want this film to create more problems but there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that it definitely could \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be shown. \u201cKashmir is a sensitive matter for both British Indian and Pakistani communities. Drawing attention to human rights violations through film or any other medium is giving the oppressed a voice. Disappearances and the other crimes that have been committed against the Kashmiri people will not go away if we bury our heads in the sand. At the end of the day, we are all British but we can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s going on.\u201d Kuldeep Shekhawat, head of the UK branch of the Overseas Friends of the BJP, which supports India\u2019s governing party and aims to increase its popularity among British Indians, said: \u201cThis film does not serve any purpose. It will just inflame hostility and tension. Things were difficult enough last year between the two communities but have calmed down a lot since then. If Kashmir is an issue then it is between India and Pakistan. We are all British here, so why should we be getting so obsessed with Kashmir? \u201cThis film will not help community relations. India is a democracy and has an effective legal system, so if there are any human rights violations they are addressed through these channels.\u201d No Fathers in Kashmir was released in India last year following a year-long battle with the country\u2019s board of censors, which insisted that certain parts be cut and that the film also contain a number of disclaimers. After adhering to the demands, director Ashvin Kumar then had to hire lawyers to challenge the film\u2019s initial adult certification, which would have prevented it from being shown on Indian television. British screenings show the unedited version of the film. Kumar said: \u201cDisappearances and other human rights violations are wilfully being ignored by Indian society and the media. There\u2019s a denial in the country and it\u2019s sad that this also seems to be the case among sections of the Indian diaspora in Britain. \u201cIndian armed forces behave with total impunity in Kashmir. The consequences of the disappearances are devastating for families and there\u2019s total apathy towards their plight, which has been continuing for the past 30 years.\u201d He added: \u201cMy film is trying to make things better through compassion and humanity.

It seemed a long time since Eddie Murphy had made a good film, after all. But this is a terrifically warm and funny comedy, written by the writers of <em>Ed Wood</em> and telling a very similar (true) story: how a cult comedian of the mid-70s gathered a bunch of friends together to make a terrible blaxploitation comedy-thriller that somehow became a success against the odds. It also, along the way, manages to throw light on the origins of rap.</p> <h2>2.

Maybe because her instrument, the Hammond organ, is considered kitsch and unfashionable by some. But in the hands of a master (mistress in this case) it can be viscerally exciting. This short album consists of four duets with the drummer Marcel Gustke, but it sounds like a trio, because once you\u2019ve grown used to the precision and energy of Dennerlein\u2019s soloing, you have to remember she\u2019s also playing all the elaborate bass parts with her feet.

      "bodyText": "Born in Birmingham in 1961, Jonathan Coe studied at Cambridge and received a PhD in English literature from Warwick University, where he taught poetry. He published his first novel in 1987, gaining prominence with the 1994 Thatcher-era satire What a Carve Up!. He has won a number of awards including the 2005 Samuel Johnson prize, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2012. Coe\u2019s Middle England (2018), hailed as the \u201cfirst great Brexit novel\u201d, won the Costa novel award this month. 1. Film Dolemite Is My Name (dir Craig Brewer, 2019) Amid the deluge of DVDs that arrive through the post in December if you\u2019re a Bafta voter, I slotted this one into the machine not expecting very much. It seemed a long time since Eddie Murphy had made a good film, after all. But this is a terrifically warm and funny comedy, written by the writers of Ed Wood and telling a very similar (true) story: how a cult comedian of the mid-70s gathered a bunch of friends together to make a terrible blaxploitation comedy-thriller that somehow became a success against the odds. It also, along the way, manages to throw light on the origins of rap. 2. Music Barbara Dennerlein: Studio Konzert for Headphones Why isn\u2019t Barbara Dennerlein one of the most famous musicians in the world? Maybe because her instrument, the Hammond organ, is considered kitsch and unfashionable by some. But in the hands of a master (mistress in this case) it can be viscerally exciting. This short album consists of four duets with the drummer Marcel Gustke, but it sounds like a trio, because once you\u2019ve grown used to the precision and energy of Dennerlein\u2019s soloing, you have to remember she\u2019s also playing all the elaborate bass parts with her feet. A genius. 3. Bookshop D\u00e9j\u00e0 Lu (Cascais, Portugal) This beautiful charity bookshop is part of the Cidadela art district, a complex of buildings housed in a 17th-century fortress in the chic resort town of Cascais, a few miles up the coast from Lisbon. Here you find the presidential palace, a restaurant, some boutique shops, galleries and studios and a five-star hotel \u2013 where I was lucky enough to be housed for two months last year as writer-in-residence, funded by the Dom Luis Foundation. Finding a central role for culture in a commercial space like this seems a quintessentially European project. I wonder if there will be many equivalents in Brexit Britain. 4. Radio Puckoon (Radio 4) Available on BBC Sounds for a few more days, Ian Billings\u2019s adaptation of the Spike Milligan novel jolted me back to my teenage years, when I thought this was the greatest and funniest book ever written. The dialogues between hero Dan Milligan and his author, Spike, were the first examples of meta-fiction I\u2019d ever encountered. In this version, Ed Byrne makes the perfect Dan and his tone of squeaky indignation on glimpsing his own white, pipe-cleaner legs, turning to the author and demanding: \u201cDid you write these legs?\u201d always cracks me up. 5. Place Munich After making a few trips here as research for my new novel, this is rapidly becoming one of my favourite European cities. It\u2019s not brimful of look-at-me tourist attractions but I love its quiet, slightly formal elegance. The Eisbachwelle, an artificial surfing spot at one of the entrances to the Englischer Garten, is perhaps its most surprising feature, but my favourite building (nat\u00fcrlich) is the gracious 18th-century Literaturhaus in Salvatorplatz, another example of a city placing culture at the very centre of its daily civic life. 6. TV Call My Agent! (Netflix) Tired of \u201cdark\u201d comedy, the comedy of excruciating awkwardness and embarrassment? Tired of \u201cmust-see\u201d Netflix series that always seem to start with the discovery of a mutilated female body? Call My Agent! (Dix Pour Cent to give it the original French title) is the antidote to all of that. Perhaps best described as a comic soap opera, it\u2019s centred on the work of a Parisian film agency and doesn\u2019t just get you involved in the lives of its flawed, lovable staff but also treats you to brilliant, self-parodying cameos from the likes of Isabelle Adjani, B\u00e9atrice Dalle and Juliette Binoche.

But we certainly grew into the game and in the second half created some really good opportunities. On another day we could have come away with the three points, but I\u2019m still pleased with the efforts and endeavours of the players. We could have won it, we could have lost it. We know the margins are small. But as long as we go into games with a positive intent, and give a committed performance, I know we\u2019ve got the ability and the tools in the box to get enough results. But we have to do it week in, week out. People may look at this as a bit of a setback, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2317848f08e97ed2125ca9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T14:41:58.332Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jose is not particularly happy.</strong> \u201cI know it was a couple of millimetres, but the goal-line technology doesn\u2019t make mistakes like the VAR makes, so it was not a goal. The Tottenham performance - separate from the referee and VAR decisions, because I prefer not to comment - was good. We started very very well. Immediately we had a situation after a couple of minutes. They put long balls in the box and one or two crosses and set plays, it is impossible to be always dominant against them. In the second half it was more 50-50, but we tried with the ammunition we have. We tried to bring energy and more depth from midfield with Gedson, and more quality with Eriksen, and we were two millimetres from winning the match. There are various decisions that I leave for the pundits and the specialists, I prefer not to speak. I think we deserve to win this match, to lose would be too much of a punishment for the boys.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e23160b8f0879d539efa8f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T14:34:23.779Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Despite the penalty miss, that\u2019s a decent point for Watford against a side who rarely give them anything. </strong>They\u2019re up to 16th, for a couple of hours at least, on 23 points, two clear of the dropzone. Spurs may not be so chuffed: they\u2019re eight points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, in seventh place. That gap could become 11 if the Blues win at Newcastle this evening. Jose Mourinho hasn\u2019t delivered much of a honeymoon bounce, something that goes a fair way to explaining the grim look on his grid as he walked off.

Still, that\u2019s better from Watford, who have finally shown something in attack.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e22fe2b8f08e97ed2125be0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T12:46:46.352Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>16 min: </strong>Watford have barely ventured into Tottenham\u2019s final third.

Additionally, they\u2019re in by far the better form right now. Spurs have only won one of their last five Premier League games, losing three; Watford by contrast are on a success bender under new boss Nigel Pearson, having picked up 13 points from the last 15 on offer.</p> <p><strong>Spurs did have a confidence-boosting win in the cup over Middlesbrough during the week. </strong>And on another day they could have turned their home loss against leaders Liverpool into a draw or even a precious victory. So you can make a case for both sides going into this match with hope ... and another argument for them kicking off in trepidation. But this is why we play the actual matches rather than just yakking on about them. Can Watford continue their steady climb out of bother? Or will Spurs reignite their top-four hopes with a much-needed win? We\u2019ll find out as we eat our lunch. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>12.30pm GMT.</p> </div>   </div>",

Nigel Pearson\u2019s reaction. \u201cWe had to work hard to get into it, they started well. But we certainly grew into the game and in the second half created some really good opportunities. On another day we could have come away with the three points, but I\u2019m still pleased with the efforts and endeavours of the players. We could have won it, we could have lost it. We know the margins are small. But as long as we go into games with a positive intent, and give a committed performance, I know we\u2019ve got the ability and the tools in the box to get enough results. But we have to do it week in, week out. People may look at this as a bit of a setback, but I don\u2019t.\u201d Jose is not particularly happy. \u201cI know it was a couple of millimetres, but the goal-line technology doesn\u2019t make mistakes like the VAR makes, so it was not a goal. The Tottenham performance - separate from the referee and VAR decisions, because I prefer not to comment - was good. We started very very well. Immediately we had a situation after a couple of minutes. They put long balls in the box and one or two crosses and set plays, it is impossible to be always dominant against them. In the second half it was more 50-50, but we tried with the ammunition we have. We tried to bring energy and more depth from midfield with Gedson, and more quality with Eriksen, and we were two millimetres from winning the match. There are various decisions that I leave for the pundits and the specialists, I prefer not to speak. I think we deserve to win this match, to lose would be too much of a punishment for the boys.\u201d Despite the penalty miss, that\u2019s a decent point for Watford against a side who rarely give them anything. They\u2019re up to 16th, for a couple of hours at least, on 23 points, two clear of the dropzone. Spurs may not be so chuffed: they\u2019re eight points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, in seventh place. That gap could become 11 if the Blues win at Newcastle this evening. Jose Mourinho hasn\u2019t delivered much of a honeymoon bounce, something that goes a fair way to explaining the grim look on his grid as he walked off. Nigel Pearson by contrast was both happy and clappy. Troy Deeney talks to BT Sport: \u201cYeah, I missed, the simple as that. I\u2019m not going to apologise for it, I\u2019ve scored in other games and won the game, so it\u2019s one of them. I\u2019ll take the next one. I feel sorry for the boys, because this guy [Capoue, to his left] was fantastic. I should have won it for the boys. We are disappointed with a point against Spurs. We\u2019re confident, but we\u2019re not getting above our station, we know where we are. It\u2019s onto the next one [at Aston Villa] on Tuesday.\u201d Paulo Gazzaniga denied Troy Deeney. Ignacio Pussetto denied Erik Lamela. And that was that. 90 min +2: 99.99999999999% of the ball was in the goal. Only the thickness of the pattern remained on the white line. You can\u2019t come any closer to scoring. 90 min +1: Son works his way down the left and rolls a pass inside. Eriksen leaves it for Aurier, whose shot is blocked. But Aurier picks up possession again, and crosses low. Confusion in the six-yard box. Lamela hooks goalwards. The ball breaks off Mariappa\u2019s back, wrong-footing Foster. The ball\u2019s rolling into the bottom left. But Pussetto hooks off the line! 90 min: There will be four added minutes. 89 min: Lamela takes another ambitious punt at goal. The result is the same. 88 min: Aurier fizzes a low cross into the box from the right. Lamela nearly latches onto it, hoping to poke home from six yards, but Foster parries well. Watford clear their lines, then replace Sarr, who has pulled up holding his hamstring. Enter another debutant: Ignacio Pussetto. 86 min: Lamela races down the left and tries the spectacular from a tight angle. Nope. Down the other end, Capoue has a batter from 25 yards. It\u2019s on target but deflected clear. Gazzaniga probably had it covered. 85 min: On the touchline, Mourinho tries to find some common ground with the fourth official. A full and frank exchange of views. Not sure what riles him so. It could be something, it could be nothing. I\u2019ve got nothing else for you. 83 min: A little bit of space for the box-fresh Fernandes, who escapes down the left and scuffs a shot-cum-cross into the middle. Cathcart hacks clear. 82 min: Moves of more than two passes at a premium right now. In lieu of action, here\u2019s entertainment journalist Hubert O\u2019Hearn: \u201cIf you take the first two letters of Christian Eriksen\u2019s first and last name it spells Cher. I mention this obscurity because the Spur and the singer have had the same number of farewell appearances. I\u2019ll get my coat.\u201d 80 min: Both sides make a change. Watford replace Chalobah with Pereyra, while Spurs send on their new signing Gedson Fernandes. He takes Lo Celso\u2019s place. His first touch, an attempted cross from the right, is deflected out for a throw. 78 min: Deulofeu, out on the left, sails a ball towards Sarr on the other flank. Sarr hoicks an ambitious effort over the bar from 20 yards. 76 min: It\u2019s not been a classic, though both teams have had their chances. Can somebody break the deadlock? Please? 74 min: Eriksen comes on for Alli, who has a right cob on, flinging some kit into the dugout with great force as he sits down. Eriksen\u2019s first act is to take a corner on the left. His delivery is easy pickings for Foster. Meanwhile the Watford faithful pay their respects to the much-missed Graham Taylor with the warmest round of applause you could ever hear. Everyone in the ground paying their respect. 72 min: Watford haven\u2019t let the penalty miss deflate them. They\u2019re pinning Spurs back in their box. Spurs can\u2019t get out. Deulofeu, Sarr and Doucoure probe this way and that. No way through. 70 min: GAZZANIGA SAVES! Deeney batters towards the bottom left. The Spurs keeper guesses correctly, and that\u2019s a fine save! Spurs escape from that little sequence with just a booking for Vertonghen. 69 min: PENALTY TO WATFORD! This has warmed them up! Deulofeu latches onto a loose ball, just to the right of the D. Vertonghen slides in, his arm stuck up in the air. Deulofeu\u2019s shot hits it. A no-brainer for Michael Oliver, who points to the spot. VAR will check, of course, but it\u2019ll be given. 68 min: A pulsating atmosphere at Vicarage Road, despite the slightly dull fare being served up. Plenty of stomping, clapping and chanting. Anything to keep warm on a chilly day. 66 min: Sarr busies himself down the right and nearly gets the better of Tanganga. Not quite, not this time, but he\u2019s been asking quite a few questions down this flank since the restart. 64 min: Then Spurs suddenly burst forward, Lamela taking a whack from the edge of the box. The shot is deflected out for a corner, off Dawson\u2019s shoulder. Maybe it brushed the top of his arm, but his arm was in a natural position by his side. Before the corner can be taken, VAR sticks its neb in again, checking for a possible penalty. For goodness sake. No penalty. The resulting corner wasn\u2019t worth waiting for. 63 min: After a hectic few minutes, Spurs calm things down by stroking it around the back for a while. 61 min: Son breaks down the inside right and looks to send a worldie into the top right. It\u2019s not far away, but it\u2019s also in the stand behind. Not sure Foster was getting that had it been fired right at the postage stamp. 59 min: Wahey! It all kicks off, suddenly, out of nothing. Winks and Doucoure tussle, then clash, the pair shoving each other in the intense style. Vertonghen gets involved in the melee and is shoved over for his trouble. He holds his mouth. Has someone taken a dig? Not really. VAR checks for a red, but it\u2019s just a yellow for the initial troublemakers Winks and Doucoure. 57 min: Deeney once again bothers Alderweireld. This time the defender concedes a free kick out on the left. Again the set piece is no good, and Spurs go up the other end, Son nearly breaking clear down the left. Good work by Mariappa and Chalobah puts a stop to his gallop. 55 min: Deeney powers his way down the inside left, through Alderweireld and Aurier, both Spurs men defending hopelessly. Deeney gets a chance to shoot, and aims for the bottom right. The ball takes a deflection off Alderweireld and out for a corner. The set piece comes to nothing, but what dreadful dithering by Tottenham there, Alderweireld and Aurier spinning like teenagers full of Special Brew. They didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, and Deeney wasn\u2019t in the mood to let them off. No wonder Spurs are having trouble keeping clean sheets. 53 min: Son glides down the right and whips the cross of the day to the far post. Alli makes a perfectly timed run into the area, but sends a less-than-perfect header miles over the bar from close range. Both teams will wonder how they haven\u2019t scored in this second half. Both teams should have. 52 min: Sarr waltzes past Tanganga as though the young man wasn\u2019t there. He earns a corner, Chalobah wastes it by hoofing it over everyone in the box. 50 min: Another decent chance for Watford. Capoue swings one in from the right. Deeney heads down for Sarr, who slices a weak effort wide right from six yards. Much better from the hosts since the restart. 49 min: Another stat: Spurs haven\u2019t won a match in the league this season when they\u2019ve been level at half-time. 47 min: What a chance to open the scoring. For those hoping for a second-half goalfest, a worry: Spurs haven\u2019t scored in the league since Harry Kane\u2019s injury. On the other hand, in his last 26 league games, since the summer of 2018, Mourinho and his teams have kept just three clean sheets. So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. We\u2019re off again! Spurs get the ball rolling. Within 90 seconds of the restart, Sarr makes good down the right and finds Doucoure on the edge of the six-yard box. Somehow, with the goal at his mercy, Doucoure scuffs a shot into the side netting. To be fair, Gazzaniga had made himself large. Half-time entertainment. Liverpool v Manchester United isn\u2019t the only super showdown tomorrow. Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack on Chelsea\u2019s must-win trip to Arsenal in the WSL. It\u2019ll be better in the second half. It has to be. 45 min +1: In the first of two added minutes, there\u2019s a bit of space for Sarr down the right. The ball drops towards Chalobah. Aurier flicks a header clear just in time. 44 min: So having said that, the game goes totally flat. Half-time, please! 42 min: Chalobah, to the right of the D, dinks a diagonal ball into the box. Deeney guides a header towards the top left, but Gazzaniga is all over it. The game is finally opening up. A shame the half-time whistle is coming soon. 40 min: Spurs nearly score a spectacular goal. Vertonghen, in the centre circle, creams a glorious long pass towards Son, cutting in from the left. Son meets the dropping ball with a screaming volley, sending the ball over the crossbar from the edge of the box. That would have instantly become Tottenham\u2019s second greatest goal at Vicarage Road. 38 min: Spurs break quickly upfield. Alli slips a pass down the inside-right channel for Moura, who strides into the box and tries to slip a shot under Foster. But the keeper makes himself big, and blocks brilliantly, the ball pinging away from danger. The clearest chance of the game so far. 37 min: A throw for Watford on the right. Mariappa flings it long. Deeney flicks it on. Lo Celso hacks the dropping ball clear. 35 min: This is a booking, though. Capoue slides in cynically on Lo Celso, who was threatening to break. He\u2019d probably not have made that tackle had he been censured for the challenge on Tanganga earlier, but here we are. 34 min: Aurier clips Deulofeu as the Watford man scampers down the left. The free kick is a waste of everyone\u2019s time. Aurier wants to watch himself, that\u2019s another slightly rash tackle. But again he escapes a booking. 32 min: A first spell of serious pressure from Watford. Capoue crosses from the right. Deeney nearly flicks home. Deulofeu sees a shot from a tight angle on the left deflected into the side netting. Capoue flings in another cross, and Gazzaniga is forced to claw out from under the bar. That\u2019s got the crowd going, on matters that have nothing to do with video refereeing this time. 30 min: We\u2019re off again at last. Son and Alli combine down the inside left, the former sending a shot towards the bottom left that\u2019s easily claimed by Foster. 29 min: We\u2019ll play on? Scrub that. Referee Michael Oliver has to stop play because the batteries on his walkie-talkie and earpiece combo have run out, and he\u2019s forced to get a new set. While we wait, the crowd burst into a chorus of the popular English folk standard Fuck VAR. Modern football in a nutshell, right there. 27 min: Capoue sticks out a boot to contest a 50-50 with Tanganga. He wins the ball, but also catches the Spurs defender on his knee with the follow-through. Spurs aren\u2019t happy, but VAR isn\u2019t interested. We\u2019ll play on. 26 min: Son and Alli nearly open Watford up down the left with a cute one-two, but Mariappa is wise to their game and intercepts just in time. 24 min: Another punt down the Watford right. Sarr brings it down, with Alderweireld and Vertonghen both looking a little concerned on the edge of their box. Sarr threatens to spin away again, but he\u2019s flagged for bringing the ball down with his arm. Spurs don\u2019t look particularly happy under the long ball. 22 min: Aurier sweeps into the box from the right, latching onto a Lo Celso pass, and harmlessly prods wide of goal. A decent chance made to look more difficult than it was. Aurier is getting a bit of joy down this flank. 20 min: A long ball down the Watford right. Tanganga misjudges a header, allowing Sarr to spin off. Tanganga drags him down, and that\u2019s an obvious booking and a free kick, just to the right of the box. Danger for Spurs here. Watford load the box. But with options in the middle, Chalobah tries to whip a cute one into the top right, and blooters it wildly into the stand. The dugout fills with steam, freshly pumped from the ears of Nigel Pearson, who also uses words such as eff and cee with much passion. That\u2019ll be mentioned in the half-time team-talk, you can be sure of it. 18 min: Doucoure robs Winks on the left and romps down the wing. He pulls back for Sarr, who is in acres on the penalty spot. But the young striker doesn\u2019t want to hit the ball with his left peg, so takes a touch to shift it onto his other foot and hoicks it over the bar, having made a good chance a damn sight more difficult. Still, that\u2019s better from Watford, who have finally shown something in attack. 16 min: Watford have barely ventured into Tottenham\u2019s final third. It\u2019s the away fans making the most noise at the moment. 15 min: A lovely sweeping Spurs move, as Lo Celso, Moura and Son exchange crisp passes at high speed down the middle. It\u2019s not quite enough to open Watford up, but very pleasing on the eye nonetheless. 13 min: Aurier works space to cross down the right. But instead of crossing he starts lolloping around, turns tail, then loses control of the ball and launches into a wild tackle on Cathcart. Free kick, and he\u2019s slightly fortunate to escape a booking, because he introduced a stud or two into that lunge. He\u2019s never boring, you have to give him that. 11 min: Son crosses long from the left. Aurier, from the other flank, sends it back into the box. Cathcart does extremely well to eyebrow away from danger with Moura lurking. Then Tanganga is afforded space for a shot, which he whistles towards the bottom left. Foster gathers. Watford need to wake up, because they\u2019re asking for trouble with these passive tactics. 9 min: Watford seem happy to sit back at the moment, seeing what Spurs have got. They\u2019re holding their shape well enough, but the away side are on top at the minute. 7 min: Lo Celso feeds Aurier down the right, and the wing-back wins the first corner of the game. Lamela takes, and Foster punches miles clear with purpose. But Spurs come straight back at Watford, Lamela taking a speculative look from 25 yards. He flies right to left before dragging a low shot wide right of the target. Spurs look lively. 5 min: Watford haven\u2019t seen much of the ball yet, though they\u2019re flying into a few tackles in a very businesslike manner. Nigel Pearson will be happy enough with that. 3 min: Son whips a shot towards the bottom left from 20 yards. Foster gathers. On the touchline, some breaking news: Jose has a face on. He\u2019s not happy, wondering why VAR didn\u2019t take a proper look at the Cathcart handball and award his men a penalty. 2 min: Spurs enjoy some early possession, and stroke it around nicely. Son threatens to break clear down the left, not once but twice. The ball breaks into the Watford box and bounces off Cathcart\u2019s arm, Moura flicking on. But the players were too close together, so no penalty. Deulofeu races off up the other end as Spurs appeal, and lashes a long-distance effort wide right. Let\u2019s hope the game continues in this manner. And we\u2019re off! Watford get the ball rolling, then launch it long. Then lose it, and concede a free kick in the centre circle. A fun-packed first 12 seconds. Here come the teams! The theme from Z Cars blasts from the speakers. Tributes are being paid to legendary Watford manager Graham Taylor, one of the nicest men in the entire history of football having passed away three years ago. The home heroes in yellow and black, Spurs sporting first-choice lilywhite. Nice to see the visitors haven\u2019t defaulted needlessly into their keeping-the-marketing-manager-happy away colours, like so many clubs do these days. Off in a minute! If Nigel Pearson gave a pre-match interview, your hapless MBM correspondent must have missed it. I\u2019ve failed you, dear reader. O can you ever forgive me? If it makes up for it at all, I can report that he looked very chipper as he watched his charges warming up, laughing heartily with his players in a manner that\u2019d make Jurgen Klopp look like Alex Ferguson in hairdryer mode. A happy ship at the moment, Watford. On the other hand, here\u2019s Mike T: \u201cSeems to me Spurs fans are divided. Some are gleeful at watching football in a spaceship shopping mall applauding Mr Levy\u2019s zero net spend. And the rest, livid that we don\u2019t win anything. Either way can anyone say they are excited at this starting 11 compared to a few years ago?\u201d Jose Mourinho, slightly flat, not exactly exuding sunshine this morning, speaks to BT Sport. \u201cIf I focus on the Leicester, Liverpool and Middlesbrough matches, I have to be happy with what the boys did. So let\u2019s hope that we can follow that direction, because we were intense, we played well, we were organised. Defensively we didn\u2019t have big problems, we created a lot of chances, we played very nice quality football. We probably didn\u2019t score enough goals for what we did, but let\u2019s see if we can follow. We don\u2019t have the striking power, the number-nine target we used to play with, so we have to try to play in a different way.\u201d Watford are in if-it-ain\u2019t-broke mode. No changes to the side that trounced Bournemouth 3-0 at their own gaff. Four changes for Spurs, though, from the XI named against Boro midweek. Eric Dier, Ryan Sessegnon, Davison Sanchez and Inter\u2019s Christian Eriksen drop to the bench; Serge Aurier, Toby Alderweireld, Dele Alli and Son Heung-min step up. Watford: Foster, Mariappa, Dawson, Cathcart, Masina, Chalobah, Capoue, Sarr, Doucoure, Deulofeu, Deeney. Subs: Pussetto, Gomes, Gray, Quina, Holebas, Kabasele, Pereyra. Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Tanganga, Winks, Alli, Lamela, Lo Celso, Son, Lucas Moura. Subs: Sanchez, Vorm, Dier, Sessegnon, Eriksen, Skipp, Fernandes. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Watford have only beaten Tottenham Hotspur twice in the last 32 years. And one of those victories was a futile one-goal win after a 6-3 first-leg larruping in the League Cup. Oh Watford! But all is not lost. The other win came in this fixture last season, Troy Deeney and Craig Cathcart scoring the goals in a 2-1 win. And there\u2019s more good news for the Hornets at this, the more recent end of our historical sample. Watford also outplayed Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium back in October. They felt a little hard done by to come away with only a 1-1 draw, having created plenty of chances only to be pegged back late in the day by Dele Alli. Additionally, they\u2019re in by far the better form right now. Spurs have only won one of their last five Premier League games, losing three; Watford by contrast are on a success bender under new boss Nigel Pearson, having picked up 13 points from the last 15 on offer. Spurs did have a confidence-boosting win in the cup over Middlesbrough during the week. And on another day they could have turned their home loss against leaders Liverpool into a draw or even a precious victory. So you can make a case for both sides going into this match with hope ... and another argument for them kicking off in trepidation. But this is why we play the actual matches rather than just yakking on about them. Can Watford continue their steady climb out of bother? Or will Spurs reignite their top-four hopes with a much-needed win? We\u2019ll find out as we eat our lunch. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

Despite being runaway favourites for the automatic promotion spots and sitting snugly in first and second, neither Leeds nor West Brom have won a league game <em>this decade</em>! In fact, the only victory they\u2019ve managed between them in the last month was Leeds\u2019 5-4 win at Birmingham \u2013 a glorious occasion, but hardly the stuff of hard-nosed champions. </p> <p><strong>And yet here we are</strong>, with Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s boys heading down to the capital with top spot in their sights. A win would take them there \u2013 at least until their rivals play on Monday night \u2013 although leaving Loftus Road with three points might be rather more easily said than done for a side who, just as they started to look dead-certs for promotion, have hit that fabled winter wobble \u2013 the one their manager seems to carry with him wherever he goes.</p> <p><strong>Standing in their way this afternoon</strong> are Mark Warburton\u2019s magnificently freewheeling QPR side, who are by no means out of the promotion chase themselves \u2013 and encouragingly for us, have scored more goals than any team bar the one at the very top, and conceded more goals than team bar the one at the very bottom. They also have the twinkle-toed Eberechi Eze, who if he isn\u2019t the division\u2019s best player is almost certainly the best to watch. And you thought Leeds were the Championship\u2019s most exciting side. This should be good \u2013 strap in!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T11:34:11.271Z\">at 11.34am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

A late push for promotion? I hope so. We\u2019ll have a report up shortly \u2013 in the meantime, thanks for reading! And after a bit of time-wasting from the hosts, we\u2019re all done. Leeds players swarm towards the referee, no doubt complaining that the winning goal should never have stood \u2013 and they\u2019d be right. But QPR deserved the win here: they shackled the visitors well and attacked with real abandon. The contrast between the tame Bamford and the electric pair of Eze and Osati-Samuel was especially striking. QPR should be setting their sights firmly on the playoffs. Leeds, on the other hand, need a jolt of life. 93 mins: A final half-chance for Leeds as Alioski meets a Hernandez cross at the back post and heads wide. He looks dejected \u2013 but he was offside regardless. 91 mins: And that should be that. After a bit of a kerfuffle sparked by the sending-off, QPR get play going again with a one-man advantage. Eze jinks forwards and works some space on the edge of the box, but slashes high and wide. Phillips loses control midway inside the QPR half and as the ball skitters away from him he lunges in unforgivably on Geoff Cameron. Wildly out of control, two-footed, knee height. A disgraceful tackle. He knows it, and mopes off sheepishly with no arguments. 84 mins: Leeds continue to turn the screw, QPR camped in their own penalty box now. But Bielsa\u2019s men don\u2019t really look like creating a chance. Unless they manage to, this will be three defeats in a row, and one win in eight. Stevens is sent on for Klich. 81 mins: QPR mount a rare attack, Osayi-Samuel electing to pass this time and picking out the overlapping Kane, whose low cross looks for Kane, who does well to get on the end of it but is under too much pressure to muster a decent shot. That\u2019s his last involvement \u2013 on comes Pugh. 79 mins: Hernandez takes it, curling the ball low around the ball and leaving Kelly rooted to the spot \u2026 but it clips the outside of the post and goes wide. Agonising. 78 mins: A heavy touch by Wallace sees him dispossessed by Costa, who is brought down by the left-back on the very edge of the box \u2013 free-kick. It\u2019s the exact same spot of turf which the goal came from. 75 mins: Klich, appearing on the right wing, whips in a magnificent cross and Bamford hurls himself at the ball, but just can\u2019t make contact. He\u2019s been unconvincing today \u2026 is he really the striker to lead a promotion charge? 72 mins: Leeds resume their attacking and work a good opening on the left only for Alioski to slip at the crucial moment. Then Eze gathers possession and shows Hernandez just enough of the ball to tempt him into a tackle before whisking it away again, earning himself a free-kick and his team some respite. Double change for QPR: Scowen and Clarke for Amos and Chair. 68 mins: Osayi-Samuel, fast becoming a lone attacker for QPR, is again hauled down, this time by Cooper. The free-kick comes to nothing but he picks up the ball moments later and drifts between two befuddled defenders before sidestepping beyond another inside the box. He\u2019s crowded out before he can get a shot away, but that was magical skill. 66 mins: A half-chance for Harrison, who finds the ball coming his way after a scuffed volley from Klich but can\u2019t react quickly enough to divert the ball towards goal. QPR cling on. 64 mins: Another good save from Kelly, holding well after Phillips blams the ball at him from distance. The striker gathers his nerves, steps up \u2026 and pokes a rather pitiful penalty low to Kelly\u2019s left. Kelly guesses right \u2013 well, left \u2013 and pushes the ball wide. Good save. Poor penalty. Redemption for Kelly. Bamford peels away from his marker and is picked out by Hernandez, rounds Kelly is taken out by the onrushing keeper. Clear pen. 58 mins: End to end stuff now. QPR attacking promisingly through wells and Amos until Phillips dispossesses, feeds Hernandez on the counter, and he looks for Costa. But the pass is rushed and Costa is forced too wide. 54 mins: Osayi-Samuel offers Leeds a gentle reminder of the threat they\u2019re facing, latching on to a long clearance and spinning on a solo run towards goal. Alioski matches him stride for stride and manages to put the ball out. From the corner, Oseyi-Samuel gathers the ball again and beats two defenders inside the Leeds box before Alioski intervenes and slashes wildly at the ball, which goes behind. Somehow the referee gives a goal kick. Jack Clarke is preparing to come on for QPR. 51 mins: Cameron\u2019s loose pass is pounced on by Costa, who rampages into the box and lays off to Ayling on the overlap, whose chipped cross is met at the back post by Harrison \u2013 but the header flashes just wide. That\u2019s the closest Leeds have come. QPR might need to ride out the storm here. 49 mins: Leeds break again, Alioski feeding the overlapping Harrison down the left and Kelly smothering midfielder\u2019s the drilled cross. The visitors have upped the urgency. 48 mins: Good start from Leeds, who works their way really nicely from back to front, with Bamford engineer a sight of goal and Klich eventually seeing a couple of low crosses from the right cut out. Corner. Cooper heads over. 45 mins: We\u2019re back under way, with Alioski slotting in where Dallas was and giving us the jarring sight of a No10 playing left-back. Half-time change for Leeds: Alioski comes on for Dallas. Great minds. That was a fairly great half of football \u2013 both teams really going for it, and no shortage of attackers willing to take risks and attempt the audacious. QPR have looked like scoring every time they\u2019ve gone forward, while Leeds have looked nice and classy but notably short of incision. Time for Ezgjan Alioski? The referee\u2019s whistles is met with deafening boos from the away fans, who can feel rightly aggrieved that the game\u2019s only goal was allowed to stand. That said, QPR have looked the most dangerous side, with Leeds seeing plenty of the ball but creating very little. The two best players on the pitch have been Eze and Osayi-Samuel, who are causing Bielsa\u2019s defence all manner of problems. I\u2019d be surprised if either are playing in the Championship next season. 45 mins: More purposeful play from Leeds, who are moving the ball around well now but can\u2019t find the final killer ball. Eventually Harrison wins a fre-kick in the corner after receiving the ball from Klich and zooming past Kane. Kelly does well to gather Harrison\u2019s low whipped delivery. 41 mins: Eze, a class above everyone else on the pitch, releases Amos with a gorgeously languid outside-of-the-foot pass, and the midfielder charges through the middle and makes it to the edge of the Leeds box before being stopped in his path by White. A minute later, Osayi-Samuel picks the ball up on the right and wrestles his way past Dallas, whose rugby tackle earns him a booking \u2013 just what he doesn\u2019t need. 38 mins: A bit more needle, Chair hauling down Phillips in midfield and the Leeds player kicking out in frustration. Both men receive a stern talking-to and clash again \u2013 legally \u2013 moments later. then Costa find space on the edge of the box but his shot is deflected wide. 34 mins: Again QPR\u2019s wingers cause problems, first Osayi-Samuel gets down the right but is well shackled by Dallas, but then Eze picks up the ball and lures Ayling into a rash foul. He floats in the free-kick from the left, which finds an unmarked Wells who can only side-foot badly wide from five yards out. Then, somehow, the resulting goalkick sets Bamford clean through \u2013 and Kelly scampers out into no-man\u2019s land! But the Leeds striker lashes an early strike high and wide when the situation called for calm. Oh dear. \u201cHow awesome is it to watch football without VAR?\u201d writes JR from Illinois. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in the past when things were simple and wonderful. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that VAR would have ruled out that QPR goal and I happen to root for the Baggies.\u201d Quite right. 30 mins: It comes to nothing, and QPR counter brilliantly, Eze to Chair, whose raking ball picks out Osayi-Samuel. His trickery gets him into the box and he squares to Chair on the D, but his low effort is rushed and trickles wide. 28 mins: After a shaky start, Leeds have settled into the game. Costa dances in off the flank and looks for Bamford, who can\u2019t escape his marker. From the resulting corner, Costa picks the ball up again and wins a free-kick on the left. 26 mins: Bamford gets his first proper sight of goal, collecting the ball from Ayling and drilling an effort from an acute angle, beaten away by Kelly. 24 mins: The first sign of needle, as Hernandez and Amos contest a loose ball and get involved in some heated but just-about-above-board midfield scrapping, the Leeds player eventually tackling his opponent with needless force. QPR lead! Eze\u2019s driven free-kick doesn\u2019t get past the wall but Wells gathers the loose ball and taps in from close range. But he controlled it with his hand! Unwittingly, but unequivocally. Leeds are furious. The goals stands. One-nil. 19 mins: From the resulting corner, Osayi-Samuel picks up the half-cleared ball on the halfway line and storms majestically forward, right at the heart of Leeds\u2019 flailing defence, eventually winning a foul right on the edge of the box. He\u2019s been superb so far. 18 mins: Costa draws a foul on the right. Hernandez whips in a glorious cross, but again no Leeds players can meet it. White\u2019s looping clearance forces a save from his own keeper. 16 mins: Ayling scoots up the right flank and is found by Costa. He drills the ball low and hard across goal but no attacker can get a touch and the ball is cleared. 14 mins: Osayi-Samuel drives in from the right against and feeds Well\u2019s, whose first-time layoff is curled goalwards by Amos. Casilla tips wide. 12 mins: Eze carries the ball down the left and zips it into the feet of Wells, who lays off to Osayi-Samuel. He skips into the box but mis-hits his shot. Positive stuff from QPR so far. 10 mins: Dallas steams forward, plays a lovely one-two with Harrison and tries to pick out Bamford in the box, but his pass is loose. 8 mins: QPR hem leeds into their own half, with Chair, Eze and Osayi-Samuel taking turns to run at a Leeds defence that eventually clears. On the counter, Bamford unleashes an audacious chip from almost the halfway line. It sails over Kelly but drifts a few feet wide. 5 mins: QRP are clearly under instruction to send the ball early towards Osayi-Samuel and isolate him against Dallas, Leeds\u2019 stand-in left-back. down the other end, Leeds mount an attack that ends with a volley scuffed into the floor by Harrison. 3 mins: And now Eze, on the other wing, ghosts past Ayling with a drop of the shoulder but can\u2019t quite find a hooped shirt from the byline. Three minutes in and QPR\u2019s danger men look up for it. 2 mins: Osayi-Samuel stretches his legs on the right wing, chasing a lovely long pass from Hall and drawing a hideously rash tackle from Cooper, who misses the ball completely. White sweeps up. The teams are out, and it\u2019s a glorious afternoon in west London. Handshakes are exchanged and formations adopted \u2013 and we\u2019re off. Leeds get going with a bit of keep-ball, before Costa\u2019s driving run is curtailed as he reaches the QPR box. The hardest-worked defenders today, though, might just be Leeds\u2019 two full-backs, who\u2019ll be up against the combined trickery of Bright Osayi-Samuel and Eberechi Eze, two outrageously talented dribblers with no shortage of final product and who can switch flanks at will. You\u2019d imagine a busy afternoon awaits for Luke Ayling and Stuart Dallas. Speaking of that defence, 21-year-old former Liverpool youth-teamer Conor Masterson is making his league debut for QPR today at the heart of it. He can\u2019t do any worse than what\u2019s come before him, right\u2026? Die-hard QPR fan Aditya emails from Mumbai to get us in the mood: \u201cLove to see the way we\u2019re playing this season. We\u2019ve got the best front three in the league (okay, second best to Brentford) and a shocking defence \u2013 every game is a rollercoaster. Looking forward to seeing how we square up against a stuttering Leeds.\u201d Just the one change for Leeds, then, and a forced one at that \u2013 Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez coming in for the injured Barry Douglas. Bielsa is clearly of the mind that no tinkering is needed despite the ominous downturn in results. As for QPR, they make three changes with the most notable being the omission of Jordan Hugill who misses out with what the club describe as a \u201cknock\u201d. But the real story here might just be on the hosts\u2019 bench, where there\u2019s a spot for the teenage attacker Jack Clarke who joined this week on loan from Tottenham. Clarke joined Spurs in the summer from \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Leeds, and was promptly loaned back to them this season, only to be recalled by Spurs in December because he wasn\u2019t being given a game. Got that? If not, here\u2019s the short version: Clarke has a point to prove. QPR: Kelly, Kane, Hall, Cameron, Masterson, Wallace, Amos, Osayi-Samuel, Chair, Eze, Wells. Subs: Barnes, Pugh, Scowen, Ball, Manning, Leistner, Clarke. Leeds United: Casilla, Ayling, White, Cooper, Dallas, Phillips, Klich, Harrison, Costa, Hernandez, Bamford. Subs: Meslier, Casey, Alioski, Struijk, McCalmont, Shackleton, Stevens. Funny league, the Championship. Despite being runaway favourites for the automatic promotion spots and sitting snugly in first and second, neither Leeds nor West Brom have won a league game this decade! In fact, the only victory they\u2019ve managed between them in the last month was Leeds\u2019 5-4 win at Birmingham \u2013 a glorious occasion, but hardly the stuff of hard-nosed champions. And yet here we are, with Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s boys heading down to the capital with top spot in their sights. A win would take them there \u2013 at least until their rivals play on Monday night \u2013 although leaving Loftus Road with three points might be rather more easily said than done for a side who, just as they started to look dead-certs for promotion, have hit that fabled winter wobble \u2013 the one their manager seems to carry with him wherever he goes. Standing in their way this afternoon are Mark Warburton\u2019s magnificently freewheeling QPR side, who are by no means out of the promotion chase themselves \u2013 and encouragingly for us, have scored more goals than any team bar the one at the very top, and conceded more goals than team bar the one at the very bottom. They also have the twinkle-toed Eberechi Eze, who if he isn\u2019t the division\u2019s best player is almost certainly the best to watch. And you thought Leeds were the Championship\u2019s most exciting side. This should be good \u2013 strap in!",

If you were hoping to part with $75 in order to get your hands on a candle with \u201cThis Smells Like My Vagina\u201d emblazoned on it then 1) get help, 2) don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure Paltrow will be bringing out some more vagina-themed merchandise soon.</p> <p>Love her or hate her, you\u2019ve got to admit that Paltrow is a goddamn genius; the woman has her perfectly moisturized fingers on the zeitgeist like nobody else. She has turned Goop, her lifestyle brand, into a $250m business via a perfectly honed formula of aspiration and irritation. She doesn\u2019t care if we laugh at her <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/news/a39740/gwyneth-paltrow-guide-to-life/\">$956 toilet paper</a> or $66 jade vagina eggs; she doesn\u2019t care if we write angry articles about how she\u2019s peddling dangerous pseudoscience. She knows that all publicity is good publicity; as she has proudly stated: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html\">I can monetize those eyeballs</a>.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just eyeballs that the wellness entrepreneur has successfully monetized \u2013 it\u2019s vaginas. There\u2019s an amazing bit in Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u2019s 2018 interview with Paltrow, where the Goop goddess talks to Harvard Business School students about some of the contentious advice on her site \u2013 for example, the idea that vagina jade eggs \u201cdo everything from fix your hormone levels to help with bladder control\u201d. This content isn\u2019t clickbait, Paltrow tells the class; she\u2019s way too classy for that \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural firestorm when it\u2019s about a woman\u2019s vagina.\u201d Paltrow reportedly then cupped her hands around her mouth and yodeled \u201cVAGINA! VAGINA! VAGINA!\u201d</p> <p>Paltrow isn\u2019t the only one snatching a profit from vagina-themed merchandise. The vagina-industrial complex is booming. 2017 saw a run on <a href=\"https://www.sofeminine.co.uk/fashion-accessories/glitter-rainbow-vagina-necklaces-it-accessory-instagram-s2108415.html\">vagina necklaces</a>. In 2018 models <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/dbc7a1bd-979b-4422-8996-31179bd4b643\">wearing vagina wigs</a> (merkins) strutted down the catwalk at New York Fashion Week. In 2019, the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/15/vagina-museum-camden-london-muff-busters-world-first\">first vagina museum</a> opened in London. Basically, if you put \u201cvagina\u201d in front of a random noun and Google it, the product probably exists. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/health-fitness/vagina-lipstick-484077\">vagina lipstick</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a26750913/vaginal-moisturizer/\">vagina moisturizer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/apr/22/artist-eggs-vagina-paintings-performance-art-milo-moire\">vagina egg art</a>. And, of course, there are now vagina candles.</p> <p>So why are vaginas suddenly everywhere? Well, as Dr Jen Gunter, a California gynecologist who has built a name for herself by debunking Paltrow\u2019s bad advice \u2013 and authored a book called the Vagina Bible \u2013 noted in a recent interview \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/08/27/754728446/vagina-bible-tackles-health-and-politics-in-a-guide-to-female-physiology\">there\u2019s a lot of money in vaginal shame</a>\u201d. Women have been conditioned to think their bodies are \u201cdirty\u201d or abnormal since the beginning of time; the rise of \u201cwellness\u2019 has seen a boom in products, like vaginal wipes, designed to \u201cfix\u201d problems that don\u2019t exist. \u201cI have noticed a huge increase in what I can only describe as women being \u2018vaginally hyperaware\u2019,\u201d Gunter told NPR last year.</p> <p>There may be money in shame, but there\u2019s also a lot of cash in vaginal celebration. Reproductive rights have been top of mind in the Trump era; vaginas, like the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/pussyhat-project-washington-march-trnd/index.html\">pink pussyhats</a> at the Women\u2019s March, have become a symbol of \u201cresistance\u201d. And then, of course, there\u2019s the fact that a certain type of corporate feminism has become very fashionable. The amazing thing about Paltrow is that she\u2019s capitalized on both vaginal shame and celebration. She\u2019s built a completely symbiotic vagina economy.</p> <h2>Women hold more jobs than men for first time in nearly a decade</h2> <p>Women in the US held <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/01/10/795293539/women-now-outnumber-men-on-u-s-payrolls\">50.04% of jobs last month</a>, according to new labor department data. This is only the second time in history that women have held more jobs than men; the first time was during the 2007-2009 recession, which was also nicknamed the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/october-2009/the-mancession-of-20082009-its-big-but-its-not-great\">Mancession</a>\u201d because layoffs hit men first. Unfortunately, while women might now outnumber men in the job market we are still <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/women-now-have-more-jobs-than-men-but-thats-not-necessarily-sign-of-progress-2020-01-13\">getting paid a hell of a lot less</a>.</p> <h2>Karlie Kloss, Ivanka\u2019s sister-in-law, is going to vote Democrat in 2020</h2> <p>Kloss is married to Jared Kushner\u2019s brother but <a href=\"https://time.com/5767076/karlie-kloss-vote-democrat-2020/\">says she won\u2019t vote for Trump</a>. Perhaps she can have a word or two with Ivanka and persuade her to defect.</p> <h2>Hong Kong Express Airways made a passenger take a pregnancy test</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51141523\">The airline has apologised</a> for asking 25-year-old Midori Nishida to take a pregnancy before flying from Hong Kong to to the island of Saipan, a US territory in the Pacific. Staff were apparently worried that Nishida was going to the island to give birth for immigration reasons. Nishida was not pregnant but she was, understandably, pretty upset at having to pee on a stick before being allowed to board.</p> <h2>Anon was a woman \u2013 and she still is</h2> <p>This chilling longread, <a href=\"https://longreads.com/2020/01/15/whatever-happened-to-______/\">Whatever Happened To ____?</a> , is well worth your time. It\u2019s an anonymous piece by a woman whose husband, a failed writer, was so jealous of her success that he became violent. \u201cSo what I mean when I say that it\u2019s different being a woman writer, and particularly a mother who is also a writer, is that I don\u2019t think male authors are physically assaulted by their spouses for gaining a modicum of success,\u201d she writes. How many women\u2019s names don\u2019t we know because their voices and careers were silenced by an insecure spouse?</p> <h2>The week in pet-riarchy</h2> <p>Spotify has released a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/jan/16/dog-tired-will-the-new-podcast-for-pooches-soothe-my-surly-whippet\">podcast for dogs</a> to soothe them when they are home alone. I tried one episode (\u201cPup Fiction\u201d) out on my dog, Rascal. Hard to tell if he enjoyed it really. Don\u2019t want to Bragg, but I think he might be more of an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads\">In Our Time</a> sort of pup.</p>",

Gwyneth Paltrow: queen of the vagina-industrial complex Dreadful news everyone: the infamous Gwyneth Paltrow vagina candle is now sold out. If you were hoping to part with $75 in order to get your hands on a candle with \u201cThis Smells Like My Vagina\u201d emblazoned on it then 1) get help, 2) don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure Paltrow will be bringing out some more vagina-themed merchandise soon. Love her or hate her, you\u2019ve got to admit that Paltrow is a goddamn genius; the woman has her perfectly moisturized fingers on the zeitgeist like nobody else. She has turned Goop, her lifestyle brand, into a $250m business via a perfectly honed formula of aspiration and irritation. She doesn\u2019t care if we laugh at her $956 toilet paper or $66 jade vagina eggs; she doesn\u2019t care if we write angry articles about how she\u2019s peddling dangerous pseudoscience. She knows that all publicity is good publicity; as she has proudly stated: \u201cI can monetize those eyeballs.\u201d And it\u2019s not just eyeballs that the wellness entrepreneur has successfully monetized \u2013 it\u2019s vaginas. There\u2019s an amazing bit in Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u2019s 2018 interview with Paltrow, where the Goop goddess talks to Harvard Business School students about some of the contentious advice on her site \u2013 for example, the idea that vagina jade eggs \u201cdo everything from fix your hormone levels to help with bladder control\u201d. This content isn\u2019t clickbait, Paltrow tells the class; she\u2019s way too classy for that \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural firestorm when it\u2019s about a woman\u2019s vagina.\u201d Paltrow reportedly then cupped her hands around her mouth and yodeled \u201cVAGINA! VAGINA! VAGINA!\u201d Paltrow isn\u2019t the only one snatching a profit from vagina-themed merchandise. The vagina-industrial complex is booming. 2017 saw a run on vagina necklaces. In 2018 models wearing vagina wigs (merkins) strutted down the catwalk at New York Fashion Week. In 2019, the world\u2019s first vagina museum opened in London. Basically, if you put \u201cvagina\u201d in front of a random noun and Google it, the product probably exists. There\u2019s vagina lipstick and vagina moisturizer and vagina egg art. And, of course, there are now vagina candles. So why are vaginas suddenly everywhere? Well, as Dr Jen Gunter, a California gynecologist who has built a name for herself by debunking Paltrow\u2019s bad advice \u2013 and authored a book called the Vagina Bible \u2013 noted in a recent interview \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of money in vaginal shame\u201d. Women have been conditioned to think their bodies are \u201cdirty\u201d or abnormal since the beginning of time; the rise of \u201cwellness\u2019 has seen a boom in products, like vaginal wipes, designed to \u201cfix\u201d problems that don\u2019t exist. \u201cI have noticed a huge increase in what I can only describe as women being \u2018vaginally hyperaware\u2019,\u201d Gunter told NPR last year. There may be money in shame, but there\u2019s also a lot of cash in vaginal celebration. Reproductive rights have been top of mind in the Trump era; vaginas, like the pink pussyhats at the Women\u2019s March, have become a symbol of \u201cresistance\u201d. And then, of course, there\u2019s the fact that a certain type of corporate feminism has become very fashionable. The amazing thing about Paltrow is that she\u2019s capitalized on both vaginal shame and celebration. She\u2019s built a completely symbiotic vagina economy. Women hold more jobs than men for first time in nearly a decade Women in the US held 50.04% of jobs last month, according to new labor department data. This is only the second time in history that women have held more jobs than men; the first time was during the 2007-2009 recession, which was also nicknamed the \u201cMancession\u201d because layoffs hit men first. Unfortunately, while women might now outnumber men in the job market we are still getting paid a hell of a lot less. Karlie Kloss, Ivanka\u2019s sister-in-law, is going to vote Democrat in 2020 Kloss is married to Jared Kushner\u2019s brother but says she won\u2019t vote for Trump. Perhaps she can have a word or two with Ivanka and persuade her to defect. Hong Kong Express Airways made a passenger take a pregnancy test The airline has apologised for asking 25-year-old Midori Nishida to take a pregnancy before flying from Hong Kong to to the island of Saipan, a US territory in the Pacific. Staff were apparently worried that Nishida was going to the island to give birth for immigration reasons. Nishida was not pregnant but she was, understandably, pretty upset at having to pee on a stick before being allowed to board. Anon was a woman \u2013 and she still is This chilling longread, Whatever Happened To ____? , is well worth your time. It\u2019s an anonymous piece by a woman whose husband, a failed writer, was so jealous of her success that he became violent. \u201cSo what I mean when I say that it\u2019s different being a woman writer, and particularly a mother who is also a writer, is that I don\u2019t think male authors are physically assaulted by their spouses for gaining a modicum of success,\u201d she writes. How many women\u2019s names don\u2019t we know because their voices and careers were silenced by an insecure spouse? The week in pet-riarchy Spotify has released a podcast for dogs to soothe them when they are home alone. I tried one episode (\u201cPup Fiction\u201d) out on my dog, Rascal. Hard to tell if he enjoyed it really. Don\u2019t want to Bragg, but I think he might be more of an In Our Time sort of pup.",

Necessarily it remains a work-in-progress, a companion album to <em>Swimming</em> licked into releasability by producer/composer Jon Brion with the blessing of Miller\u2019s family. Having worked widely across genres and film, from Kanye West\u2019s lane-swerving 2005 album <em>Late Registration</em> to 2017\u2019s soundtrack for <em>Lady Bird</em>, Brion also co-produced significant chunks of <em>Swimming</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The songs reflect on Miller\u2019s wavering mental state; some even hint at untimely death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Swimming</em> and <em>Circles</em> were intended as a two-part project: \u201cswimming in circles\u201d. The themes \u2013 of moving in water, and futility \u2013 are intact; by contrast, <em>Circles</em> lacks the busy guest list that set <em>Swimming</em> apart. There was just no time for all that. Significant personnel include Wendy Melvoin from Prince\u2019s Revolution on guitar or bass on a couple of tracks. Miller and Brion play almost everything else.</p> <p>If <em>Swimming</em> felt contemplative, <em>Circles</em> feels even more like a singer-songwriter album than a hip-hop joint \u2013 a tendency most likely amplified by Brion\u2019s treatments. Strangest of all is how much significant chunks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AF_CJhpTzQ\" title=\"\">sound like Beck</a> on his most recent, very sad, album <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/24/beck-hyperspace-review\" title=\"\">Hyperspace</a></em>, or 2002\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/20/popandrock.artsfeatures2\" title=\"\">Sea Change</a></em>.</p> <p>Genres play off against one another. That\u2019s on Me is in waltz-time, a miniature of baroque Laurel Canyon pop. The musical mood is light, but the lyrics weigh heavy, going around in \u2013 well \u2013 circles: \u201cThat\u2019s on me, I know, that\u2019s on me, it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Other tracks transmit Miller\u2019s love for the <a href=\"https://www.qthemusic.com/articles/the-albums-that-changed-mac-millers-life\" title=\"\">solo John Lennon</a>.

      "bodyText": "Mac Miller\u2019s narrative arc was genuinely surprising. A capable but derivative white rapper from Pittsburgh with neck tattoos, his early works about partying did not seem likely to trouble the zeitgeist in any lasting way. The zeitgeist knew otherwise, however, and from 2011 to his untimely death by accidental overdose in September 2018, Miller built ambitiously on those bro-hop beginnings. Musically and thematically, he grew up in public. The Divine Feminine (2016) \u2013 the album that reflected Miller\u2019s burgeoning relationship with Ariana Grande \u2013 revealed both softness and unexpected musicality. On Swimming, the album he released in the wake of their breakup, shortly before his death, Miller \u2013 a multi-instrumentalist \u2013 wrote a horn part on a track called Ladders, and contemplated his own fissile brain chemistry with hard-won perspective. By this point, he counted the cream of the Los Angeles jazz and funk underground \u2013 Thundercat, Flying Lotus \u2013 as collaborators and friends, and was accepted as a fellow talent by some of the most verbally dexterous rappers in the game. Circles is a desperately sad coda to this lotus-like blossoming. Necessarily it remains a work-in-progress, a companion album to Swimming licked into releasability by producer/composer Jon Brion with the blessing of Miller\u2019s family. Having worked widely across genres and film, from Kanye West\u2019s lane-swerving 2005 album Late Registration to 2017\u2019s soundtrack for Lady Bird, Brion also co-produced significant chunks of Swimming. Swimming and Circles were intended as a two-part project: \u201cswimming in circles\u201d. The themes \u2013 of moving in water, and futility \u2013 are intact; by contrast, Circles lacks the busy guest list that set Swimming apart. There was just no time for all that. Significant personnel include Wendy Melvoin from Prince\u2019s Revolution on guitar or bass on a couple of tracks. Miller and Brion play almost everything else. If Swimming felt contemplative, Circles feels even more like a singer-songwriter album than a hip-hop joint \u2013 a tendency most likely amplified by Brion\u2019s treatments. Strangest of all is how much significant chunks sound like Beck on his most recent, very sad, album Hyperspace, or 2002\u2019s Sea Change. Genres play off against one another. That\u2019s on Me is in waltz-time, a miniature of baroque Laurel Canyon pop. The musical mood is light, but the lyrics weigh heavy, going around in \u2013 well \u2013 circles: \u201cThat\u2019s on me, I know, that\u2019s on me, it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Other tracks transmit Miller\u2019s love for the solo John Lennon. Surprisingly, on Everybody, Miller covers Arthur Lee\u2019s Everybody\u2019s Gotta Live, an existential ballad from 1972 sung here as bluesman mumblecore, an approach Miller echoes on the title track. At the other end of the musical spectrum, the excellent Blue World interpolates a section of the Four Freshmen\u2019s It\u2019s a Blue World (incidentally, a formative influence for Brian Wilson\u2019s exploration of harmonies). The barbershop intro paves the way for a looser hip-hop track, one with a spectacular bit of production: a Doppler-effect stutter ends up functioning as ersatz backing vocals. Although Miller\u2019s death was not suicide \u2013 three men have been charged with supplying adulterated drugs \u2013 many of the songs on Circles continue the bleak reckonings voiced on Swimming. They reflect on Miller\u2019s wavering mental state; some even hint at untimely death, suggestions that have littered his work previously. Good News, released earlier this month, set the tone. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot more for me waitin\u2019 on the other side,\u201d Miller sings, \u201cI\u2019m always wonderin\u2019 if it feel like summer.\u201d It\u2019s not all bleak. Anyone expecting an end-to-end downer will thrill at many of the funkier interludes on Circles. Complicated\u2019s synth-funk suggests the Internet, or former collaborator Anderson .Paak; the languid anomie, however, is all Miller\u2019s. Occasionally, a more playful 26-year-old surfaces. \u201cI spent my life living with a lot of regrets,\u201d Miller drawls wryly on Hands, another strong track. \u201cYou throw me off my high horse, probably fall to my death.\u201d There are more zingers too. \u201cI move carelessly, that\u2019s why I\u2019m always trippin\u2019/I guess it\u2019s like electrolytes, you help me go the distance,\u201d Miller rhymes on Hand Me Downs, a key track, about craving family.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not easy to celebrate female sexuality and vaginas on public transport, but Linder, the British artist known for her uncompromising photomontages, managed it at Southwark Underground, a station that sees 16.7 million people pass through its barriers each year. The 85m-long billboard she installed there last November \u2013 a luscious and cinematic sequence of roses, lips, female faces, food and Roman votaries that emerged from research into local figures and places and the archive of London Transport \u2013 is called <a href=\"https://art.tfl.gov.uk/projects/the-bower-of-bliss/\" title=\"\">The Bower of Bliss</a>. And that, as it happens, is a quaint old phrase for vagina. \u201cIt suddenly came back to me when I was filming at <a href=\"https://www.chatsworth.org/\" title=\"\">Chatsworth</a> last year,\u201d she says of the term she had first discovered years before in an issue of <em><a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/ozlondon/\" title=\"\">Oz</a></em><a href=\"https://ro.uow.edu.au/ozlondon/\" title=\"\"> magazine</a> edited by Germaine Greer. The work is a reminder that women don\u2019t just need safe spaces but joyful ones, too.</p> <p>Sex and pornography can loom large in the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/22/linder-nottingham-contemporary-house-of-fame-vaginal-ectoplasm\" title=\"\">Linder</a>. Among her best known are those where super-tanned 70s Playboy nudes are embellished with explosions of flowers; and naked women in coquettish poses have an electric heater, or a clock, or a Victoria sponge for a head. Linder, who changed the spelling of her first name as punk exploded in mid-70s Manchester (\u201cIt felt more European\u201d), has been busy. She spent much of 2018 as artist-in-residence at Chatsworth House, digging through the history of that stately Derbyshire pile to create a film, an exhibition and even a fragrance. \u201cIt\u2019s such a treasure house. There are parcels in the attic that have never been opened,\u201d she says, though a more 20th-century discovery was Debo, Duchess of Devonshire\u2019s adoration of Elvis. She also had an exhibition of her finely scalpelled montages at <a href=\"https://www.nottinghamcontemporary.org/whats-on/the-house-of-fame-convened-by-linder/\" title=\"\">Nottingham Contemporary</a> and created a film and a flag for <a href=\"https://womenslibrary.org.uk/event/linders-flag-and-film/\" title=\"\">Glasgow Women\u2019s Library</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"431e77e385e55500afb753f72bdddd62141be513\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/431e77e385e55500afb753f72bdddd62141be513/0_0_1072_1045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Original artwork for the Buzzcocks single  Orgasm Addict, 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"975\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Original artwork for the Buzzcocks single Orgasm Addict, 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we meet, it is at <a href=\"https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Kettle\u2019s Yard</a> in Cambridge, where a major retrospective of her work will open in February. After that, she is off to Liverpool to create something for <a href=\"https://www.biennial.com/\" title=\"\">the Biennial</a>, which kicks off in July. It seems that in her 65th year, the world is finally ready for her unflinching, upfront feminism.</p> <p>Linder likes to describe herself as a pop baby \u2013 \u201cI was born in Liverpool in 1954\u201d \u2013 but she is better known for her association with punk. Arriving in Manchester in 1976, she chose to study graphic design at the polytechnic \u201cbecause it felt connected to the real world\u201d, though she took the opportunity to make masks out of lingerie, too. She was soon sharing a flat with Buzzcocks singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/12/magazine-howard-devoto\" title=\"\">Howard Devoto</a>, and in 1977 she put herself on the map when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2017/oct/20/buzzcocks-orgasm-addict-sleeve-revisted-punk\" title=\"\">her artwork</a> was used for the sleeve of the band\u2019s first single, Orgasm Addict. The image, of a muscular naked woman with an iron for a head, was both an homage to the pop-art sensibility of Richard Hamilton\u2019s 1960s collages and a strident feminist scream against the domestic trap. \u201cI grew up in a working-class family in a tiny mining village,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were no guidelines for how I should behave, and I found them in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/26/germaine-greer-female-eunuch-feminists-influence\" title=\"\">The Female Eunuch</a> and other texts of second-wave feminism. By the time I got to Manchester, I was ready to go, ready to make my mark.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6085407cdd9b01771bdc2beb8aed6507bb87b656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6085407cdd9b01771bdc2beb8aed6507bb87b656/0_0_2362_3362/703.jpg\" alt=\"What I Do To Please You I Do, 1981\u20132008. \" width=\"703\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What I Do To Please You I Do, 1981\u20132008.<strong> </strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Stuart Shave/Modern Art, Dependance, Andrehn Schiptjenko, Blum &amp; Poe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She did, as an artist and a performer. While her imagery, which continually raised questions around gender identity and the power of the male gaze, mirrored the low-tech frankness of punk itself, her own image was defined by sharp cheekbones, quiffed hair and bondage trousers. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the hostile stares I got the first time I wore them,\u201d she says. \u201cManchester was quite a violent place then. We loved Quentin Crisp and his advice to just look straight ahead.\u201d Fronting her own band, <a href=\"https://www.ltmrecordings.com/ludus.html\">Ludus</a>, at the Ha\u00e7ienda in 1982, she came on stage in a dress made of chicken flesh, and \u2013 to further subvert expectations \u2013 pulled it up to reveal a huge black dildo. In a city, and on a local music scene, where women were relatively invisible, Linder says now that she felt \u201clike a female astronaut, being sent out into cultural space\u201d.</p> <p>She also became known as Morrissey\u2019s muse and went on to photograph him extensively in the early 90s as he toured the US. \u201cWe shared the same taste, liked the same books,\u201d she says. \u201cWe shared a house for a brief period in Whalley Range \u2013 it was a red-light district then.\u201d With <a href=\"https://www.morrisseycentral.com/messagesfrommorrissey/i-ve-been-dreaming-of-a-time-when-the-english-are-sick-to-death-of-labour-and-tories\">his counterintuitive views on the far-right For Britain party</a>, Morrissey is a touchy subject these days, but Linder is loyal. \u201cWe\u2019ve always disagreed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy disagreement, the sort that comes with unconditional love.\u201d</p> <p>In the mid-80s, Linder stopped performing. \u201cThe underground was over,\u201d she says. \u201cWham! and Bananarama came along and that was strange if you were in the north of England. We had the miners\u2019 strike.\u201d London had never called to her. But Brussels did, in the form of <a href=\"https://lesdisquesducrepuscule.com/\" title=\"\">Les Disques d</a><a href=\"https://lesdisquesducrepuscule.com/\" title=\"\">u Cr\u00e9puscule</a>, an avant-garde music label that invited her to the Belgian capital. She lived above a nightclub called Interference, and people such as Billy Mackenzie and the Lounge Lizards came and went. \u201cFrom Whalley Range to the rue de la T\u00eate d\u2019Or and all that civic gilding in the Grand Place,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d In 1990, Linder had a child and went to live on the north-west coast. \u201cI carried on making work, hidden away in a cocoon-like place in the north,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to sit out various periods in culture if you\u2019re like me. The YBAs, for example, they were so much for irony, and that wasn\u2019t a game I wanted to take part in. But I\u2019ve always had the sense that someday acknowledgment would happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27e994c6044254ed0f0e3a0926c14494bb2b1f17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27e994c6044254ed0f0e3a0926c14494bb2b1f17/0_0_4032_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bower of Bliss, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"736\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bower of Bliss, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second time I speak to Linder, she is in her archive space, which occupies the top floor of a former textile mill in Lancaster. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10-minute walk from where the <a href=\"http://www.pendlewitches.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pendle Witches</a> were hung in the early 17th century,\u201d she says cheerfully. \u201cThey were punished for their unacceptable glamour.\u201d (In that period, glamour meant casting of spells, rather than diamonds.) She is keen on witches and mediums, women who defy the social stereotypes and demonstrate the more mystical depths of female psyche. A recent obsession is <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ithell-colquhoun-931\" title=\"\">Ithell C</a><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ithell-colquhoun-931\" title=\"\">olquhoun</a>, a British female surrealist artist and occultist \u2013 you can see the influence of her work in the Southwark billboard. \u201cShe had a mantic vision of the universe \u2026\u201d says Linder. \u201cMantic being to do with divination and prophecy and a little madness. It\u2019s not Enid Blyton.\u201d</p> <p>In the archive, established thanks to a generous grant from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, she is surrounded by an astonishing 40 years\u2019 worth of material and is busy categorising every item. \u201cI mean, a fan letter from the 1980s \u2013 what is that as an object?\u201d She says it is something she has to do \u201cin case I slip under a bus\u201d. She thinks about her funeral a lot, planning the music. \u201cIt\u2019s due for an update,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, she is working on the Kettle\u2019s Yard show with a young curator called Amy Tobin, whose own interests are 70s and 80s feminist art practice as well as the complexities of archivism. \u201cI think she knows more about my work than I do,\u201d says Linder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"67e3520736e75d5638b54190dc8db7567659d097\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e3520736e75d5638b54190dc8db7567659d097/0_0_2284_3281/696.jpg\" alt=\"He the Protector With Virtue Does Be, 2017.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He the Protector With Virtue Does Be, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Glowacki Photography/Linder Sterling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as frequently being the subject of her own work, she has organised a series of huge productions that are as montage-like as the flat artwork she makes in her kitchen. One, <a href=\"https://chisenhale.org.uk/programmes/interim/linder/\" title=\"\">The Darktown Cakewalk</a>, staged in Glasgow and London in 2010, lasted 13 hours. It included Lindy hop and beauty queens, witch trials, scenes of prejudice and gold lam\u00e9 suits. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/25/richard-nicoll-obituary\">Richard Nicoll</a>, the fashion designer who died in 2016, provided the costumes. She has since worked with menswear designer Christopher Shannon on a production that took place on the steps of the ICA in 2016 and combined <a href=\"https://tillergirls.com/\">Tiller Girls</a> with Northern Soul. More recently, <a href=\"http://louisegraylondon.com/\" title=\"\">Louise Gray</a> designed the outfits worn in the film she made for the Glasgow Women\u2019s Library, another part of the Bower of Bliss project, which shows Mary Queen of Scots exercising in the bower at Chatsworth. \u201cShe creates layers and layers of meaning by drawing together all of her historical, political, female and sometimes very funny notions for her works,\u201d says Gray. \u201cI worked on the ICA piece, too. She was \u2018live collaging\u2019 artists, dancers and singers on the stairs outside the ICA. I dressed a 30-strong LGBTQI choir from Hackney, who performed in the rain.\u201d</p> <p>Kettle\u2019s Yard was once the home of Jim and Helen Ede, who moved there in the mid-50s and filled it with their collection of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/lucie-rie-modernist-potter-emmanuel-cooper\">Lucie Rie</a> bowls, Alfred Wallis seascapes and sculptures by Brancusi and Gaudier-Brzeska. \u201cIt feels like the last gasp of modernism,\u201d says Linder of the house that has been left as they lived in it. \u201cAnd it really feels like the Jim Ede show. We have had many conversations about why Helen is so not present here.\u201d Indeed, her room, where she would pass the afternoons as Jim entertained Cambridge students, is the only one with no conservation status. Alongside the retrospective of her own work, Linder is creating work for Helen. She is making products for the \u201cHouse of Helen\u201d brand that will be available in the Kettle\u2019s Yard shop. \u201cPerhaps it suited her to hide away,\u201d says Linder. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in the idea of the invisible woman \u2013 that also has a kind of power.\u201d</p> <p>For Linder, on the other hand, invisibility is definitely no longer an option. \u201cI think she\u2019s the most relevant artist of our times,\u201d says Gray \u2013 though she might not like that accolade. She might just want to be an artist.\u201d</p> <p><em>Linderism is at Kettle\u2019s Yard from 15 February to 26 April (<a href=\"https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/events/linderism/\" title=\"\">kettlesyard.co.uk</a>)</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not easy to celebrate female sexuality and vaginas on public transport, but Linder, the British artist known for her uncompromising photomontages, managed it at Southwark Underground, a station that sees 16.7 million people pass through its barriers each year. The 85m-long billboard she installed there last November \u2013 a luscious and cinematic sequence of roses, lips, female faces, food and Roman votaries that emerged from research into local figures and places and the archive of London Transport \u2013 is called The Bower of Bliss. And that, as it happens, is a quaint old phrase for vagina. \u201cIt suddenly came back to me when I was filming at Chatsworth last year,\u201d she says of the term she had first discovered years before in an issue of Oz magazine edited by Germaine Greer. The work is a reminder that women don\u2019t just need safe spaces but joyful ones, too. Sex and pornography can loom large in the work of Linder. Among her best known are those where super-tanned 70s Playboy nudes are embellished with explosions of flowers; and naked women in coquettish poses have an electric heater, or a clock, or a Victoria sponge for a head. Linder, who changed the spelling of her first name as punk exploded in mid-70s Manchester (\u201cIt felt more European\u201d), has been busy. She spent much of 2018 as artist-in-residence at Chatsworth House, digging through the history of that stately Derbyshire pile to create a film, an exhibition and even a fragrance. \u201cIt\u2019s such a treasure house. There are parcels in the attic that have never been opened,\u201d she says, though a more 20th-century discovery was Debo, Duchess of Devonshire\u2019s adoration of Elvis. She also had an exhibition of her finely scalpelled montages at Nottingham Contemporary and created a film and a flag for Glasgow Women\u2019s Library. When we meet, it is at Kettle\u2019s Yard in Cambridge, where a major retrospective of her work will open in February. After that, she is off to Liverpool to create something for the Biennial, which kicks off in July. It seems that in her 65th year, the world is finally ready for her unflinching, upfront feminism. Linder likes to describe herself as a pop baby \u2013 \u201cI was born in Liverpool in 1954\u201d \u2013 but she is better known for her association with punk. Arriving in Manchester in 1976, she chose to study graphic design at the polytechnic \u201cbecause it felt connected to the real world\u201d, though she took the opportunity to make masks out of lingerie, too. She was soon sharing a flat with Buzzcocks singer Howard Devoto, and in 1977 she put herself on the map when her artwork was used for the sleeve of the band\u2019s first single, Orgasm Addict. The image, of a muscular naked woman with an iron for a head, was both an homage to the pop-art sensibility of Richard Hamilton\u2019s 1960s collages and a strident feminist scream against the domestic trap. \u201cI grew up in a working-class family in a tiny mining village,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were no guidelines for how I should behave, and I found them in The Female Eunuch and other texts of second-wave feminism. By the time I got to Manchester, I was ready to go, ready to make my mark.\u201d She did, as an artist and a performer. While her imagery, which continually raised questions around gender identity and the power of the male gaze, mirrored the low-tech frankness of punk itself, her own image was defined by sharp cheekbones, quiffed hair and bondage trousers. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the hostile stares I got the first time I wore them,\u201d she says. \u201cManchester was quite a violent place then. We loved Quentin Crisp and his advice to just look straight ahead.\u201d Fronting her own band, Ludus, at the Ha\u00e7ienda in 1982, she came on stage in a dress made of chicken flesh, and \u2013 to further subvert expectations \u2013 pulled it up to reveal a huge black dildo. In a city, and on a local music scene, where women were relatively invisible, Linder says now that she felt \u201clike a female astronaut, being sent out into cultural space\u201d. She also became known as Morrissey\u2019s muse and went on to photograph him extensively in the early 90s as he toured the US. \u201cWe shared the same taste, liked the same books,\u201d she says. \u201cWe shared a house for a brief period in Whalley Range \u2013 it was a red-light district then.\u201d With his counterintuitive views on the far-right For Britain party, Morrissey is a touchy subject these days, but Linder is loyal. \u201cWe\u2019ve always disagreed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a healthy disagreement, the sort that comes with unconditional love.\u201d In the mid-80s, Linder stopped performing. \u201cThe underground was over,\u201d she says. \u201cWham! and Bananarama came along and that was strange if you were in the north of England. We had the miners\u2019 strike.\u201d London had never called to her. But Brussels did, in the form of Les Disques du Cr\u00e9puscule, an avant-garde music label that invited her to the Belgian capital. She lived above a nightclub called Interference, and people such as Billy Mackenzie and the Lounge Lizards came and went. \u201cFrom Whalley Range to the rue de la T\u00eate d\u2019Or and all that civic gilding in the Grand Place,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d In 1990, Linder had a child and went to live on the north-west coast. \u201cI carried on making work, hidden away in a cocoon-like place in the north,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to sit out various periods in culture if you\u2019re like me. The YBAs, for example, they were so much for irony, and that wasn\u2019t a game I wanted to take part in. But I\u2019ve always had the sense that someday acknowledgment would happen.\u201d The second time I speak to Linder, she is in her archive space, which occupies the top floor of a former textile mill in Lancaster. \u201cIt\u2019s a 10-minute walk from where the Pendle Witches were hung in the early 17th century,\u201d she says cheerfully. \u201cThey were punished for their unacceptable glamour.\u201d (In that period, glamour meant casting of spells, rather than diamonds.) She is keen on witches and mediums, women who defy the social stereotypes and demonstrate the more mystical depths of female psyche. A recent obsession is Ithell Colquhoun, a British female surrealist artist and occultist \u2013 you can see the influence of her work in the Southwark billboard. \u201cShe had a mantic vision of the universe \u2026\u201d says Linder. \u201cMantic being to do with divination and prophecy and a little madness. It\u2019s not Enid Blyton.\u201d In the archive, established thanks to a generous grant from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, she is surrounded by an astonishing 40 years\u2019 worth of material and is busy categorising every item. \u201cI mean, a fan letter from the 1980s \u2013 what is that as an object?\u201d She says it is something she has to do \u201cin case I slip under a bus\u201d. She thinks about her funeral a lot, planning the music. \u201cIt\u2019s due for an update,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, she is working on the Kettle\u2019s Yard show with a young curator called Amy Tobin, whose own interests are 70s and 80s feminist art practice as well as the complexities of archivism. \u201cI think she knows more about my work than I do,\u201d says Linder. As well as frequently being the subject of her own work, she has organised a series of huge productions that are as montage-like as the flat artwork she makes in her kitchen. One, The Darktown Cakewalk, staged in Glasgow and London in 2010, lasted 13 hours. It included Lindy hop and beauty queens, witch trials, scenes of prejudice and gold lam\u00e9 suits. Richard Nicoll, the fashion designer who died in 2016, provided the costumes. She has since worked with menswear designer Christopher Shannon on a production that took place on the steps of the ICA in 2016 and combined Tiller Girls with Northern Soul. More recently, Louise Gray designed the outfits worn in the film she made for the Glasgow Women\u2019s Library, another part of the Bower of Bliss project, which shows Mary Queen of Scots exercising in the bower at Chatsworth. \u201cShe creates layers and layers of meaning by drawing together all of her historical, political, female and sometimes very funny notions for her works,\u201d says Gray. \u201cI worked on the ICA piece, too. She was \u2018live collaging\u2019 artists, dancers and singers on the stairs outside the ICA. I dressed a 30-strong LGBTQI choir from Hackney, who performed in the rain.\u201d Kettle\u2019s Yard was once the home of Jim and Helen Ede, who moved there in the mid-50s and filled it with their collection of Lucie Rie bowls, Alfred Wallis seascapes and sculptures by Brancusi and Gaudier-Brzeska. \u201cIt feels like the last gasp of modernism,\u201d says Linder of the house that has been left as they lived in it. \u201cAnd it really feels like the Jim Ede show.

      "body": "<p>I approached the mindful pilates and yoga weekend in the West Sussex countryside with a fair degree of trepidation. I wasn\u2019t even mindful of the difference between pilates and yoga, and then there was the dread of being locked into something I could not do and would have to endure rather than enjoy.</p> <p>In preparation, my reading on the 90-minute train journey down from London to Arundel was <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/yoga-for-the-inflexible-male/yoga-matt/9781984856944\" title=\"\">Yoga for the Inflexible Male</a>, by Roy Parvin (AKA Yoga Matt), with its call to \u201cbring me your stiff, your deeply embarrassed, your previously yoga-phobic\u201d. And its promise that if you work through the poses, \u201cyou\u2019ll soon discover yoga isn\u2019t so different from weight training, except your body\u2019s the weight and you\u2019re working more on balance, not bulking up\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"925f24e7304b741bc17ba4d992e1edd5e77b788a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/925f24e7304b741bc17ba4d992e1edd5e77b788a/0_0_1794_2700/664.jpg\" alt=\"Pilates\u2019 Return to Life Through Contrology Cover\" width=\"664\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As for pilates, I skimmed through Joseph Pilates\u2019 1945 book, Return to Life through Contrology, in which the fitness system\u2019s founder debunks the myth that you are only as old as you feel: \u201cIf your spine is inflexibly stiff at 30, you are old; if it is completely flexible at 60, you are young.\u201d</p> <p>I am far closer to 60 than 30, and as flexible as a wizened oak. But pilates offers hope through its original programme of 34 mat exercises that concentrate on core strengthening with simultaneous spinal and limb stretching that is \u201cdesigned to give you suppleness, natural grace and skill that will be unmistakably reflected in the way you walk, in the way you play, and in the way you work.\u201d</p> <p>I clearly had my work cut out.</p> <p>However, when I arrived at Brooklands Barn \u2013 a beautifully restored 19th-century compound up a quiet country lane \u2013 I began to breathe a little easier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c3cb726071f303bcdc148b36a30175267566ae0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c3cb726071f303bcdc148b36a30175267566ae0/540_0_4075_2446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brooklands Barn exterior\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victorian Brooklands Barn makes a peaceful setting</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Pohlmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was met by Julie Bruton and Bex Mclean, two physiotherapists who worked together for five years in the Swiss Alps, treating the sprains and strains of skiers, before setting up <a href=\"https://themindfulphysios.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Mindful Physios</a>, to offer weekend pilates and yoga retreats. They were warm and friendly and quickly allayed my fears, reassuring me that the course was suitable for all comers. From the kitchen came a waft of wellbeing as chef <a href=\"http://www.missingredient.co.uk\">Katrina Whittaker</a> baked banana and almond slices, and got a pumpkin and black-eyed bean curry on the go.</p> <p>Julie and Bex explained that the idea of the detox pilates and yoga retreat is to give your body and mind the space and time to recuperate away from all the interruptions of the daily grind. That\u2019s the mindful part. The detox bit \u2013 no alcohol or meat \u2013 was a no brainer after the onslaught of Christmas. But the thing that appealed to me most was the physio-led aspect of the course. I readily admit to falling into the old-school camp that Yoga Matt describes as the \u201cpreviously yoga-phobic\u201d, and was reassured that I was in the hands of trained therapists who could tailor an exercise programme around any ailments and guide me through it safely.</p> <p>To that end, participants are asked to complete a health questionnaire ahead of arrival. Then, before you start the weekend\u2019s course, they conduct a physical assessment to identify any problems.</p> <p>I cycle regularly, and I spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, so my lower back often feels stiff and in need of a stretch. Julie diagnosed tight quad muscles and recommended posterior pelvic tilts and hip flexor stretches. The hip flexor stretches sounded familiar. But the pelvic tilts, where I had to \u201cthink about lengthening my tailbone and drawing my pubic bone up to my belly button\u201d, initially struck me as gynaecological.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ef34aeea50af71dd597cbdbbb1ea6df54c32e9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ef34aeea50af71dd597cbdbbb1ea6df54c32e9a/0_102_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Pilates invented the techniques in the 1940s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Pilates invented the techniques in the 1940s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IC Rapoport/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So I went for a swim in the pool in one of the adjoining barns and a sweat in the barrel sauna in the courtyard, before practising my pelvic tilts in privacy. \u201cBring me your deeply embarrassed\u201d indeed.</p> <p>What was striking was how quickly our group of 13 fell into the rhythm of the weekend and visibly appeared to slow down and relax. On arrival, we were like hummingbirds, keen to dip into the pool, check out the sauna, riffle the bookshelves, walk in the gardens \u2013 anything to divert our attention and keep ourselves occupied. But as time drew on, we stopped looking beyond what was in front of us. As Joseph Pilates stated in Return to Life, \u201cThe acquirement and enjoyment of physical well-being, mental calm and spiritual peace are priceless.\u201d</p> <p>What was also priceless was how much you can cram in when you don\u2019t have to worry about chores. The day started with a morning mobility session of stretches before breakfast, then a walk in the Downs or by the river before an hour\u2019s pilates class. After lunch, there was an hour\u2019s yoga, followed by a talk on mindful breathing or a healthy eating workshop. Then came dinner, and a meditation and relaxation session before bed.</p> <p>So much for mental calm. As for physical wellbeing, I enjoyed the pilates. The daily opening exercise sounded simple. Rolling out our spines, vertebra by vertebra, we hinged at the hip and reached down towards the floor. We were told to bend our knees as much as needed and to come down only as far as our ankles or shins if necessary. I managed to grasp my lower shins with my knees bent. A quick inventory of the group showed that the majority of my classmates could touch the mat with ease without the need to bend their knees. But a glance beyond my left arm revealed that the only other man in our group was similarly blocked and unsupple. We smiled at each other in recognition that we were more lumber than limber. And that was OK \u2013 at no point in any of the exercises were we forced into painful contortions. The guiding mantra was to keep the pelvis in a neutral position, engage the core, elongate the spine and do only what was comfortable.</p> <p>Yoga was an entirely different beast. Though my trunk may be stiff, my tree pose lacks poise and attempting to balance on one leg had me wobbling like a sappling in a storm. Windshield wipers I could do, chair pose I found comfortable, and I enjoyed being downward like a dog. But the warrior II pose was a stretch too far, and maintaining horizontal arms felt like torture. Again, we were encouraged to resist going into the red and pushing into pain. Positive reinforcement and some help with alignment were always close at hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7cd541adac3d90e1342462d1dc5d29463bcf7b8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cd541adac3d90e1342462d1dc5d29463bcf7b8b/0_241_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veggie breakfast at the Brooklands Barn retreat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veggie breakfast at the Brooklands Barn retreat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cProper diet and sufficient sleep must supplement exercise in our quest for physical fitness,\u201d Pilates said. If we were exerting ourselves on the mats, Katrina was putting in a huge shift in the kitchen, cooking up some of the most inventive and delicious vegetarian dishes: cauliflower, pomegranate and pistachio salad, roasted fennel and lentils, beetroot and pearl barley risotto, poached pears with yoghurt and stem ginger, chocolate and avocado mousse.</p> <p>Sleeping was never an issue, especially after second helpings of dinner, followed by a relaxation and meditation session. One valuable lesson I learned in calming the mind and not being led down a warren of random and unwanted thoughts, was the \u201cnoting technique\u201d, whereby you notice a thought but instead of following it, simply let it go on the out breath.</p> <p>In our first meditation session, we\u2019d been asked to write down our goal for the weekend. I wrote: \u201cI am flexible.\u201d And while I may not be as supple as I would ideally like, I do feel I came away from the weekend more flexible than when I arrived, both physically and mentally.</p> <p>This was confirmed on our last morning, which saw us on all fours, raising one leg like a dog having a pee. Our final mediation session ended with the affirmation: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be as I am in this moment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The next <a href=\"https://themindfulphysios.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mindful Physios retreats</a> are </em><em>in Forres, Scotland, 17-19 April, and in the Cotswolds, 24-26 July.

I wasn\u2019t even mindful of the difference between pilates and yoga, and then there was the dread of being locked into something I could not do and would have to endure rather than enjoy. In preparation, my reading on the 90-minute train journey down from London to Arundel was Yoga for the Inflexible Male, by Roy Parvin (AKA Yoga Matt), with its call to \u201cbring me your stiff, your deeply embarrassed, your previously yoga-phobic\u201d. And its promise that if you work through the poses, \u201cyou\u2019ll soon discover yoga isn\u2019t so different from weight training, except your body\u2019s the weight and you\u2019re working more on balance, not bulking up\u201d. As for pilates, I skimmed through Joseph Pilates\u2019 1945 book, Return to Life through Contrology, in which the fitness system\u2019s founder debunks the myth that you are only as old as you feel: \u201cIf your spine is inflexibly stiff at 30, you are old; if it is completely flexible at 60, you are young.\u201d I am far closer to 60 than 30, and as flexible as a wizened oak. But pilates offers hope through its original programme of 34 mat exercises that concentrate on core strengthening with simultaneous spinal and limb stretching that is \u201cdesigned to give you suppleness, natural grace and skill that will be unmistakably reflected in the way you walk, in the way you play, and in the way you work.\u201d I clearly had my work cut out. However, when I arrived at Brooklands Barn \u2013 a beautifully restored 19th-century compound up a quiet country lane \u2013 I began to breathe a little easier. I was met by Julie Bruton and Bex Mclean, two physiotherapists who worked together for five years in the Swiss Alps, treating the sprains and strains of skiers, before setting up the Mindful Physios, to offer weekend pilates and yoga retreats. They were warm and friendly and quickly allayed my fears, reassuring me that the course was suitable for all comers. From the kitchen came a waft of wellbeing as chef Katrina Whittaker baked banana and almond slices, and got a pumpkin and black-eyed bean curry on the go. Julie and Bex explained that the idea of the detox pilates and yoga retreat is to give your body and mind the space and time to recuperate away from all the interruptions of the daily grind. That\u2019s the mindful part. The detox bit \u2013 no alcohol or meat \u2013 was a no brainer after the onslaught of Christmas. But the thing that appealed to me most was the physio-led aspect of the course. I readily admit to falling into the old-school camp that Yoga Matt describes as the \u201cpreviously yoga-phobic\u201d, and was reassured that I was in the hands of trained therapists who could tailor an exercise programme around any ailments and guide me through it safely. To that end, participants are asked to complete a health questionnaire ahead of arrival. Then, before you start the weekend\u2019s course, they conduct a physical assessment to identify any problems. I cycle regularly, and I spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, so my lower back often feels stiff and in need of a stretch. Julie diagnosed tight quad muscles and recommended posterior pelvic tilts and hip flexor stretches. The hip flexor stretches sounded familiar. But the pelvic tilts, where I had to \u201cthink about lengthening my tailbone and drawing my pubic bone up to my belly button\u201d, initially struck me as gynaecological. So I went for a swim in the pool in one of the adjoining barns and a sweat in the barrel sauna in the courtyard, before practising my pelvic tilts in privacy. \u201cBring me your deeply embarrassed\u201d indeed. What was striking was how quickly our group of 13 fell into the rhythm of the weekend and visibly appeared to slow down and relax. On arrival, we were like hummingbirds, keen to dip into the pool, check out the sauna, riffle the bookshelves, walk in the gardens \u2013 anything to divert our attention and keep ourselves occupied. But as time drew on, we stopped looking beyond what was in front of us. As Joseph Pilates stated in Return to Life, \u201cThe acquirement and enjoyment of physical well-being, mental calm and spiritual peace are priceless.\u201d What was also priceless was how much you can cram in when you don\u2019t have to worry about chores. The day started with a morning mobility session of stretches before breakfast, then a walk in the Downs or by the river before an hour\u2019s pilates class. After lunch, there was an hour\u2019s yoga, followed by a talk on mindful breathing or a healthy eating workshop. Then came dinner, and a meditation and relaxation session before bed. So much for mental calm. As for physical wellbeing, I enjoyed the pilates. The daily opening exercise sounded simple. Rolling out our spines, vertebra by vertebra, we hinged at the hip and reached down towards the floor. We were told to bend our knees as much as needed and to come down only as far as our ankles or shins if necessary. I managed to grasp my lower shins with my knees bent. A quick inventory of the group showed that the majority of my classmates could touch the mat with ease without the need to bend their knees. But a glance beyond my left arm revealed that the only other man in our group was similarly blocked and unsupple. We smiled at each other in recognition that we were more lumber than limber. And that was OK \u2013 at no point in any of the exercises were we forced into painful contortions. The guiding mantra was to keep the pelvis in a neutral position, engage the core, elongate the spine and do only what was comfortable. Yoga was an entirely different beast. Though my trunk may be stiff, my tree pose lacks poise and attempting to balance on one leg had me wobbling like a sappling in a storm. Windshield wipers I could do, chair pose I found comfortable, and I enjoyed being downward like a dog. But the warrior II pose was a stretch too far, and maintaining horizontal arms felt like torture. Again, we were encouraged to resist going into the red and pushing into pain. Positive reinforcement and some help with alignment were always close at hand. \u201cProper diet and sufficient sleep must supplement exercise in our quest for physical fitness,\u201d Pilates said. If we were exerting ourselves on the mats, Katrina was putting in a huge shift in the kitchen, cooking up some of the most inventive and delicious vegetarian dishes: cauliflower, pomegranate and pistachio salad, roasted fennel and lentils, beetroot and pearl barley risotto, poached pears with yoghurt and stem ginger, chocolate and avocado mousse. Sleeping was never an issue, especially after second helpings of dinner, followed by a relaxation and meditation session. One valuable lesson I learned in calming the mind and not being led down a warren of random and unwanted thoughts, was the \u201cnoting technique\u201d, whereby you notice a thought but instead of following it, simply let it go on the out breath. In our first meditation session, we\u2019d been asked to write down our goal for the weekend. I wrote: \u201cI am flexible.\u201d And while I may not be as supple as I would ideally like, I do feel I came away from the weekend more flexible than when I arrived, both physically and mentally. This was confirmed on our last morning, which saw us on all fours, raising one leg like a dog having a pee. Our final mediation session ended with the affirmation: \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be as I am in this moment.\u201d \u2022 The next Mindful Physios retreats are in Forres, Scotland, 17-19 April, and in the Cotswolds, 24-26 July. Prices start from \u00a3599pp in a shared en suite room or \u00a3699pp in a private room, including all classes and two nights\u2019 full board.

Like Stalin, he has made many enemies and caused untold misery along the way.</p> <p>Russia under Putin\u2019s grim tutelage has grown notorious for cronyism and corruption on a vast scale, repression of domestic opponents and free speech, and military aggression and disruption abroad.</p> <p>Again like Stalin, retirement is not a safe option for the ruthless ex-KGB spy who normalised assassination as a modern-day tool of state policy. To yield power would be to invite retribution, legal or physical.</p> <p>Yet it appears Putin does not want to emulate out-and-out dictators in other countries by making himself president-for-life \u2013 the path chosen by China\u2019s Xi Jinping. He values a veneer of democratic legitimacy.</p> <p>So under proposals unveiled last week, Putin could assume a newly powerful post of prime minister in 2024 when his presidential term ends. Or he could become chair of the State Council, a body he created. Both jobs can be held indefinitely.</p> <p>Putin also has options to be speaker of the Duma (parliament) or leader of its main party, United Russia, thereby exercising power behind the scenes in the manner of Jaroslaw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of Poland\u2019s Law and Justice party.</p> <p>Whatever he chooses to do, the powers of any presidential successor will be clipped, there will be new term limits, and the ability of hostile oligarchs and emigre Russians \u2013 7% of the population \u2013 to challenge him will be curbed.</p> <p>The accompanying, enforced resignation of the entire government, including the prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, is Putin\u2019s attempt to reset his administration before Duma elections next year. Analysts say he feared Medvedev\u2019s unpopularity \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/15/dmitry-medvedev-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-robin-to-putins-batman\" title=\"\"> he has been accused of corruption</a> \u2013 was beginning to rub off on him.</p> <p>His appointment as prime minister of a non-politician, Mikhail Mishustin, an old ice hockey chum and pliable tax chief, is meanwhile seen as a clumsy way of denying a platform to potential rivals.</p> <p>Although these changes are dressed up as desirable constitutional reforms, they clearly serve one common purpose: establishing Putinism in perpetuity. By showing he has no intention of retiring, Putin hopes to nip a possible succession battle in the bud.</p> <p>All this may be good for Putin, but it is thoroughly bad for Russia. In any free and fair election, his criminal legacy of economic incompetence, abuse of power and shameless venality would be sure to sink him without trace. But free and fair elections now look ever more remote, especially following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/29/russia-protesters-demand-end-to-political-crackdown\" title=\"\">brutal suppression of pro-democracy protesters</a> in Moscow last summer.</p> <p>On the contrary, Putin grows ever more intolerant of any form of actual or suspected opposition, whether it be in the form of civil society organisations, the media, or courageous, much persecuted activists such as Alexi Navalny.</p> <p>Thanks to Putin\u2019s mismanagement and neglect, <a href=\"https://www.russiamatters.org/analysis/russias-national-projects-economic-reboot-or-mucky-bog\" title=\"\">Russia\u2019s economy is in terrible shape</a>, over-reliant on energy exports, lacking foreign investment and suffering chronic capital flight. That\u2019s because businesses cannot rely on the rule of law to safeguard their dealings or prevent attempts at extortion, kickbacks and bribery.</p> <p>Putin\u2019s supposedly transformative national spending projects worth an eye-watering $390bn have largely failed to materialise. His promises of economic modernisation and raised living standards must be set against a consecutive five-year fall in real wages and cuts to state pensions.</p> <p>At the same time, it is crystal clear Putin fears the sort of political liberalisation that might facilitate greater economic competitiveness and international investment. On the contrary, his latest proposals seek to further limit foreign influence.</p> <p>The continuing drag on Russia\u2019s development caused by western sanctions, imposed after the illegal annexation of Crimea, symbolises the broader, negative aspects of perpetual Putinism.</p> <p>Putin not only refuses to get out of Crimea but actively fuels the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. And this conflict is but a smaller version of the murderous mayhem wrought by Russian forces in Syria since 2016, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/16/syrian-airstrikes-in-idlib-leave-dead-despite-ceasefire\" title=\"\">killing and mass displacement continue in Idlib</a>.</p> <p>Putin is in cahoots with Turkey\u2019s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and his campaign against pro-western Kurds in north-east Syria. More recently, he has inserted Russian mercenaries into the war in Libya, backing rebels against the UN-recognised government in Tripoli.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s baleful influence under Putin extends further, to covert influence-peddling in the Balkans and eastern Europe, attempts to divide the EU, cyber attacks on the Baltic republics, and disinformation campaigns to subvert democratic processes in Britain and the US.</p> <p>Russian vetoes have reduced the UN security council to irrelevance on key issues. Putin\u2019s poison meanwhile seeps through other western institutions, bamboozling Donald Trump, weakening the Nato alliance and the G7 (from which he has been banished), and undermining European democracy with his glib talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/27/putin-skripal-attack-should-not-affect-uk-russia-relations\" title=\"\">\u201cobsolete\u201d western liberalism</a>.</p> <p>And speaking of poison, who doubts that Putin and his henchmen were behind the unpunished attempt to assassinate Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury and last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/murdered-chechen-separatist-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-had-killed-on-russian-soil-says-putin\" title=\"\">murder of a Chechen separatist in Berlin</a>?</p> <p>Vladimir Putin is a man of many faces: macho patriot, rightwing populist, cynical manipulator, and ruthless global warlord. All are inimical to the best interests of the Russian people.

Putin\u2019s is the face of the enemy. Henceforth he must be recognised as such.</p>",

Yet it appears Putin does not want to emulate out-and-out dictators in other countries by making himself president-for-life \u2013 the path chosen by China\u2019s Xi Jinping. He values a veneer of democratic legitimacy. So under proposals unveiled last week, Putin could assume a newly powerful post of prime minister in 2024 when his presidential term ends. Or he could become chair of the State Council, a body he created. Both jobs can be held indefinitely. Putin also has options to be speaker of the Duma (parliament) or leader of its main party, United Russia, thereby exercising power behind the scenes in the manner of Jaroslaw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of Poland\u2019s Law and Justice party. Whatever he chooses to do, the powers of any presidential successor will be clipped, there will be new term limits, and the ability of hostile oligarchs and emigre Russians \u2013 7% of the population \u2013 to challenge him will be curbed. The accompanying, enforced resignation of the entire government, including the prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev, is Putin\u2019s attempt to reset his administration before Duma elections next year. Analysts say he feared Medvedev\u2019s unpopularity \u2013 he has been accused of corruption \u2013 was beginning to rub off on him. His appointment as prime minister of a non-politician, Mikhail Mishustin, an old ice hockey chum and pliable tax chief, is meanwhile seen as a clumsy way of denying a platform to potential rivals. Although these changes are dressed up as desirable constitutional reforms, they clearly serve one common purpose: establishing Putinism in perpetuity. By showing he has no intention of retiring, Putin hopes to nip a possible succession battle in the bud. All this may be good for Putin, but it is thoroughly bad for Russia. In any free and fair election, his criminal legacy of economic incompetence, abuse of power and shameless venality would be sure to sink him without trace. But free and fair elections now look ever more remote, especially following the brutal suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Moscow last summer. On the contrary, Putin grows ever more intolerant of any form of actual or suspected opposition, whether it be in the form of civil society organisations, the media, or courageous, much persecuted activists such as Alexi Navalny. Thanks to Putin\u2019s mismanagement and neglect, Russia\u2019s economy is in terrible shape, over-reliant on energy exports, lacking foreign investment and suffering chronic capital flight. That\u2019s because businesses cannot rely on the rule of law to safeguard their dealings or prevent attempts at extortion, kickbacks and bribery. Putin\u2019s supposedly transformative national spending projects worth an eye-watering $390bn have largely failed to materialise. His promises of economic modernisation and raised living standards must be set against a consecutive five-year fall in real wages and cuts to state pensions. At the same time, it is crystal clear Putin fears the sort of political liberalisation that might facilitate greater economic competitiveness and international investment. On the contrary, his latest proposals seek to further limit foreign influence. The continuing drag on Russia\u2019s development caused by western sanctions, imposed after the illegal annexation of Crimea, symbolises the broader, negative aspects of perpetual Putinism. Putin not only refuses to get out of Crimea but actively fuels the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. And this conflict is but a smaller version of the murderous mayhem wrought by Russian forces in Syria since 2016, where killing and mass displacement continue in Idlib. Putin is in cahoots with Turkey\u2019s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and his campaign against pro-western Kurds in north-east Syria. More recently, he has inserted Russian mercenaries into the war in Libya, backing rebels against the UN-recognised government in Tripoli. Russia\u2019s baleful influence under Putin extends further, to covert influence-peddling in the Balkans and eastern Europe, attempts to divide the EU, cyber attacks on the Baltic republics, and disinformation campaigns to subvert democratic processes in Britain and the US. Russian vetoes have reduced the UN security council to irrelevance on key issues. Putin\u2019s poison meanwhile seeps through other western institutions, bamboozling Donald Trump, weakening the Nato alliance and the G7 (from which he has been banished), and undermining European democracy with his glib talk about \u201cobsolete\u201d western liberalism. And speaking of poison, who doubts that Putin and his henchmen were behind the unpunished attempt to assassinate Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury and last year\u2019s murder of a Chechen separatist in Berlin? Vladimir Putin is a man of many faces: macho patriot, rightwing populist, cynical manipulator, and ruthless global warlord. All are inimical to the best interests of the Russian people. All are fundamentally hostile to western the principles of freedom and democracy. The prospect of Putin prolonging and strengthening his nihilistic reign is a terrible one. Putin\u2019s is the face of the enemy. Henceforth he must be recognised as such.",

There is often more information in the newsroom than on the ground, and we relied a lot on firefighters, the fire and traffic apps and radio broadcasts. I also received text updates on wind and weather changes from my dad, who can read charts better than I can.</p> <p>We would find crews, conduct interviews, take photos and get advice about where we could see firefighting efforts without getting in the way or getting too reckless. Then we\u2019d park the car for half an hour, file to Guardian Australia\u2019s live blog or the news desk, and do it all again somewhere else.</p> <p>In Kurrajong Heights, photographer Jessica Hromas and I met a strike team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/21/waiting-for-a-megafire-the-battle-against-australia-biggest-blaze-gospers-mountain\">waiting for a fire to come up from the gorge and into the suburbs</a>.

The scale of the disaster, the fear and anger and sense of powerlessness on the ground is palpable, and it\u2019s the moments that are hard to write about in the usual news style that I will remember the longest:</p> <ul> <li><p>The sound of thunder in Nowra rolling overhead from dirty brown clouds, knowing it was one of three storms generated by a nearby fire.</p></li> <li><p>The feeling of guilt having firefighters check on our welfare and make sure we weren\u2019t hungry.</p></li> <li><p>The steely bravery on the face of a 12-year-old kid who wasn\u2019t evacuated before the roads closed and was now helping their mum put out spot fires in the backyard.</p></li> <li><p>The overwhelming desire to hug interview subjects, either because they\u2019d just gone through something horrific or they\u2019d just done something extraordinarily selfless, and because this isn\u2019t just a news story, this is home.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Graham Readfearn, environment reporter</h2> <p>There has been a lot of anger and politics swirling around Australia\u2019s bushfires, as well as a lot of facts \u2013 some relevant, some not, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/12/disinformation-and-lies-are-spreading-faster-than-australias-bushfires\">some fake</a>.</p> <p>As an environment reporter, one of my main roles during the bushfire crisis has been to get into that swirling mess and come out with something that gives people a clear picture of what\u2019s going on.</p> <p>So while some of my colleagues have been delivering blistering and heart-wrenching narratives from the fire grounds, I\u2019ve been knee deep in academic papers about bushfires, and conversations about the Forest Fire Danger Index and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature\">Indian Ocean </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/2019-australia-hottest-year-record-temperature-15c-above-average-temperature\">dipole</a>.</p> <p>I have been talking to ecologists to work out what the environmental impact of these fires will be \u2013 the answer is unfolding, but the experts say they\u2019ll be amazed if we don\u2019t see species becoming extinct.</p> <p>We\u2019d had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/28/bushfire-season-australia-warned-to-prepare-early-amid-grim-outlook\">warnings this bushfire season was going to be bad</a> \u2013 rainfall had been at record low levels in many areas, and temperatures at record highs.</p> <p>As the fires took hold in NSW and continued in Queensland, a blame game emerged. These fires had little to do with the climate crisis, some were saying, but were down to \u201cgreenies\u201d and their \u201cpolicies\u201d to stop hazard-reduction burning in forests and national parks.</p> <p>Australia has plenty of academic expertise on bushfires because it\u2019s part of our lived experience. One of the first people I spoke to, Prof Ross Bradstock, gave an almighty sigh when I called him up to ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/12/is-there-really-a-green-conspiracy-to-stop-bushfire-hazard-reduction\">if this really was all the fault of the Greens</a>.</p> <p>This was \u201cconspiracy stuff\u201d, he said, an accusation that almost always came up after major bushfires. I later took a further look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/05/explainer-how-effective-is-bushfire-hazard-reduction-on-australias-fires\">hazard-reduction techniques and their limitations</a>.</p> <p>I tried never to leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/explainer-what-are-the-underlying-causes-of-australias-shocking-bushfire-season\">the climate question</a> unanswered.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spoken to I don\u2019t know how many experts in their field over the last few months. I\u2019ve disturbed conservationists and scientists on their holidays. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/kangaroo-island-bushfires-grave-fears-for-unique-wildlife-after-estimated-25000-koalas-killed\">One ecologist on Kangaroo Island</a> was telling me what was going on while she and her children evacuated her house from the threat of a fire.

The key vehicle for delivering the news on the bushfires has been our daily live blog.

In other towns, such as Mallacoota and Malua Bay, we have been able to reconstruct the terrifying events there through the accounts of residents both in print and audio. The crisis came at what is usually the quietest news time of the year, when many staff are on leave. Many gave up their summer breaks to work long hours on our coverage. Some were themselves caught up in the fires while on holiday, able to report on a harrowing experience only when communications were restored. Reporting events on this scale has been challenging enough, but putting them in the context both of Australian domestic politics and the wider question of climate change has put even greater demands on our reporters and opinion writers. From the start we have been at pains to keep the climate crisis at the forefront of our coverage, by explaining the science and holding the government to account for its response. Calla Walhquist, reporter The photographer Chris Hopkins and I drove from Melbourne to Bairnsdale, Victoria on Monday 30 December, the day after emergency services took the unprecedented step of advising everybody in the far-east wedge of the state to get out. Under a bridge on the eastern side of Bairnsdale, next to a sign that said \u201cno camping\u201d, we found evacuees such as 77-year-old Marilyn Withers, whose face was red from the 43C heat.

It feels inevitable now that if you live in Australia some part of your life will burn down. It\u2019s just a matter of when. Helen Davidson, reporter My first fire callout this season was to the well-heeled Sydney suburb of Turramurra in November, where no property was lost, houses were doused in the delightfully coloured pink fire retardant and some departing firefighters handed us ice creams on their way out. My most recent was to the area around Nowra, south of Sydney, and the NSW southern highlands in January, where houses were lost and fires created their own lightning storms. In between, I went to the Mount Gospers fire twice and the Green Wattle Creek fire as it hit Balmoral again and again over consecutive days. Reporting on the fires requires a lot of driving, instinct and guesswork. There is often more information in the newsroom than on the ground, and we relied a lot on firefighters, the fire and traffic apps and radio broadcasts. I also received text updates on wind and weather changes from my dad, who can read charts better than I can.

A firefighter told us where to park our car \u2013 facing out and with doors unlocked \u2013 and said he\u2019d give us a radio so he could tell us when to escape. Again and again I saw the short-lived relief in people\u2019s faces as a wind change saved their home, before they realised it meant someone else would likely lose theirs. From a personal point of view, it has been heartbreaking. The scale of the disaster, the fear and anger and sense of powerlessness on the ground is palpable, and it\u2019s the moments that are hard to write about in the usual news style that I will remember the longest: The sound of thunder in Nowra rolling overhead from dirty brown clouds, knowing it was one of three storms generated by a nearby fire. The feeling of guilt having firefighters check on our welfare and make sure we weren\u2019t hungry. The steely bravery on the face of a 12-year-old kid who wasn\u2019t evacuated before the roads closed and was now helping their mum put out spot fires in the backyard. The overwhelming desire to hug interview subjects, either because they\u2019d just gone through something horrific or they\u2019d just done something extraordinarily selfless, and because this isn\u2019t just a news story, this is home. Graham Readfearn, environment reporter There has been a lot of anger and politics swirling around Australia\u2019s bushfires, as well as a lot of facts \u2013 some relevant, some not, and some fake. As an environment reporter, one of my main roles during the bushfire crisis has been to get into that swirling mess and come out with something that gives people a clear picture of what\u2019s going on. So while some of my colleagues have been delivering blistering and heart-wrenching narratives from the fire grounds, I\u2019ve been knee deep in academic papers about bushfires, and conversations about the Forest Fire Danger Index and the Indian Ocean dipole. I have been talking to ecologists to work out what the environmental impact of these fires will be \u2013 the answer is unfolding, but the experts say they\u2019ll be amazed if we don\u2019t see species becoming extinct. We\u2019d had warnings this bushfire season was going to be bad \u2013 rainfall had been at record low levels in many areas, and temperatures at record highs. As the fires took hold in NSW and continued in Queensland, a blame game emerged. These fires had little to do with the climate crisis, some were saying, but were down to \u201cgreenies\u201d and their \u201cpolicies\u201d to stop hazard-reduction burning in forests and national parks. Australia has plenty of academic expertise on bushfires because it\u2019s part of our lived experience. One of the first people I spoke to, Prof Ross Bradstock, gave an almighty sigh when I called him up to ask if this really was all the fault of the Greens. This was \u201cconspiracy stuff\u201d, he said, an accusation that almost always came up after major bushfires. I later took a further look at hazard-reduction techniques and their limitations. I tried never to leave the climate question unanswered. I\u2019ve spoken to I don\u2019t know how many experts in their field over the last few months. I\u2019ve disturbed conservationists and scientists on their holidays. One ecologist on Kangaroo Island was telling me what was going on while she and her children evacuated her house from the threat of a fire. The climate crisis comes up in every conversation.",

According to the classification system, more than half of Islamists convicted of offences were in the highest three risk bands, demonstrating the most serious risk, compared to a third of far-right offenders. The six-band risk categorisation system is designed to help social media firms target their action at offenders while avoiding a \u201cban or no-ban\u201d approach, which critics argue is too crude. Jeremy Wright, the former culture secretary who co-authored last year\u2019s \u201conline harms\u201d White Paper, said: \u201cA consistent, cross-platform framework of \u2018online extremist harm\u2019 as put forward in this report can be used to assess and flag patterns of behaviour, focusing on both violent and non-violent [harmful] extremism. \u201cTechnology companies can consider tailored approaches based on similarities of those individuals falling within specific harm categories. Of course, there is space for such a framework to evolve with time and in response to certain offline events, such as terrorist attacks.\u201d Malik endorsed a new independent regulator on online extremism to help technology companies monitor the most harmful offenders. Wright added: \u201cThis would assist with ensuring that a framework is implemented consistently across platforms, including lesser-known \u2018alt-tech\u2019 platforms where content and banned individuals and groups may migrate.\u201d A Facebook spokesperson said: \u201cOur work with groups like the Henry Jackson Society is critical to helping the industry understand and make progress on these important issues. It is through collaborations like these and with governments, academics, and others companies, through the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, that we improve our collective ability to prevent terrorists and violent extremists from exploiting digital platforms.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 January 2020 to include a comment from Facebook.",

      "bodyText": "Teacher Lynne Fox received a prestigious Pearson national headteacher of the year award last summer. Judges praised her as a \u201ctour de force\u201d who had transformed her comprehensive, Bramhall high school, overcoming significant challenges such as funding cuts and staff redundancies to secure \u201cthe very best educational experience for students\u201d. The school, they said, was \u201ca vibrant environment where enthusiasm and creativity are encouraged\u201d, leading to \u201coutstanding\u201d results. A few weeks later, Fox found herself leaving a meeting with Ofsted inspectors in tears. \u201cIt was the only time in my professional career as a leader that I\u2019ve ever felt that bad. That low.\u201d The watchdog told her Bramhall high \u2013 currently the second-highest performing school in Stockport, despite suffering budget cuts of \u00a3400,000 over the past three years \u2013 did not provide a \u201cgood quality education\u201d and \u201crequires improvement\u201d. Fox, 58, who has calmly weathered 12 Ofsted inspections in her 17 years as a headteacher, was shaken to the core. \u201cFor three years running, when GCSEs have got more difficult nationally, our results have bucked the trend: we have gone up and up in our outcomes. It just doesn\u2019t correlate. It\u2019s so unjust.\u201d A month later, Ofsted then sent her a different, more factual report summarising the school\u2019s performance.

      "body": "<p>The telephone sat in the dormitory hallway, and when it rang it might have been for any of the residents \u2013 young women in their teens and early 20s, all students at the University of Chicago. Calls came from family and friends and boyfriends, from colleagues and classmates and clubs. But sometimes the voice at the end of the line would ask for \u201cJane\u201d.</p> <p>This was 1965, and in Chicago the social justice movement was gathering pace \u2013 a new era that encompassed civil rights, student rights, women\u2019s rights and resistance to the war in Vietnam. Among those involved was Heather Booth, a 19-year-old social sciences student from New York. Booth had spent the summer of 1964 in Mississippi, volunteering as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/18/usa.jonathansteele\" title=\"\">Freedom Summer</a> project, an attempt to register as many African American voters as possible. It was an experience that had galvanised her and taught some valuable lessons: \u201cOne is that if you organise, even in what seem like the most hopeless circumstances, you can change the world,\u201d she says. \u201cNumber two: sometimes you have to stand up to illegitimate authority.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Chicago, her reputation as an underground organiser now well-rooted, she was approached by a friend with a quite different problem: his sister was pregnant, not ready to have a child and nearly suicidal. She wanted an abortion, which was then illegal across the US. Booth was startled. \u201cI hadn\u2019t ever thought of the issue before,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut I said I\u2019d try to find a doctor for her.\u201d</p> <p>Booth approached the medical committee for the civil rights movement and identified Dr TRM Howard as potentially sympathetic. A former civil rights leader from Mississippi, he had relocated to Chicago after his name appeared on a Ku Klux Klan death list. They talked over the phone. \u201cI found out the terms and made an arrangement, and didn\u2019t really think much more about it,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut then word must have spread, and a little while later someone else called, and then a little while later someone else. And I realised there was a far greater need than I had appreciated.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 200 Republicans are saying they want the Supreme Court to revisit and potentially overturn Roe\u00a0v Wade</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For three years, Booth ran a one-woman illegal abortion service \u2013 first from her university dormitory, and then from her Chicago apartment. Keen to keep the process as anonymous as possible, she told prospective callers to ask for Jane, choosing the moniker simply because \u201cit was a very common name, nondescript\u201d, she says. \u201cAnd then the name stuck.\u201d</p> <p>Pregnancy in the 1960s brought a number of limitations and complications for women\u2019s lives. \u201cAt the time that Jane started, you still could be fired from some jobs if you were pregnant,\u201d Booth explains. \u201cThere were jobs that wouldn\u2019t hire you if you had children. There certainly were families that would throw out their kids if they were pregnant and not married.\u201d Many resorted to extreme measures, paying for backstreet abortions, or attempting to perform the procedure themselves \u201cusing coat hangers or lye [sodium hydroxide] or throwing themselves off a building or \u2018falling\u2019 downstairs\u201d, Booth says. \u201cBecause they couldn\u2019t imagine going on, even if it meant risking their life.\u201d</p> <p>As her service grew, Booth\u2019s ambition was for something different. \u201cI decided that we needed to create a system,\u201d she says. \u201cA women\u2019s culture, reflecting what the women needed, and said that they wanted.\u201d She came to an agreement with Dr Howard, negotiating his fee from $500 for a single procedure to two or three abortions for the same price. She also introduced a counselling element, talking to the women beforehand about what they might expect, and afterwards to see how their experience had been. Booth herself had received no sex education, and had no experience of pregnancy or abortion; in the late 60s, women across America were increasingly coming to know and understand their own bodies.</p> <p>If she was concerned about the illegality of what she was doing, or by the rapidly growing number of women, Booth tried not to let it be a deterrent. \u201cLife at that moment was filled with so many engagements and movement activities, and so many unexpected things. It was as if democracy and society was becoming more alive in many different arenas. I probably was also somewhat scared and frightened. But in so much of what I\u2019ve ever done in my life, I was sort of scared and frightened \u2013 at the start at least. And I think it\u2019s true for many people, especially young women, who wonder, \u2018Will I know enough? Will I be good enough? Can I do just what\u2019s needed?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66b590a5c1fa799605826beab637c5dcc3559840\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b590a5c1fa799605826beab637c5dcc3559840/0_980_4912_4393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If you organise, you can change the world,\u2019 says Heather Booth, who established the \u2018Jane\u2019 underground abortion service.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"894\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If you organise, you can change the world,\u2019 says Heather Booth, who established the \u2018Jane\u2019 underground abortion service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jared Soares/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 1968, the need had grown unmanageable. By then working, studying, newly married and expecting her first child, Booth elected to transfer \u201cJane\u201d to a group of volunteers she knew from her political work. She coached them in her counselling methods before handing over her contacts.</p> <p>Jane changed substantially from this point. Howard was no longer involved, replaced by another practitioner named Mike, and the clientele had begun to shift, too. As abortion became legal in Colorado, New York and Hawaii, the wealthier, white college students who had been the mainstay of Booth\u2019s service began to travel for their procedures. In Chicago, Jane increasingly catered to poorer, predominantly African American communities on the west and south sides of the city.</p> <p>\u201cWord of us spread throughout the city,\u201d recalls Laura Kaplan, who joined the group at this time, and later authored <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/89719/the-story-of-jane-by-laura-kaplan/\" title=\"\">The Story </a><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/89719/the-story-of-jane-by-laura-kaplan/\" title=\"\">Of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service</a>. \u201cBecause once we took over, we lowered the price to $100, or what you could afford, and we never turned anybody away.\u201d The group kept no records, no paper trail of names or numbers, but Kaplan estimates that over the course of four years, Jane performed 11,000 procedures, averaging payment of around $40 to $50 per abortion.</p> <p>The organisation became more efficient: with a large network of volunteers, they were able to set up a hotline, putting up posters in dorm rooms and phone booths that read \u201cPregnant? Don\u2019t want to be? Call Jane\u201d and the phone number 643-3844. They procured an answering machine \u201cthe size of a suitcase, reel-to-reel\u201d and set it up in the home of a volunteer. They established a \u201cfront house\u201d, which served as a reception for clients who would then be driven to a different apartment for the abortion.</p> <p>What happened next seems radical now, but for the women of Jane it felt more like an evolution. \u201cOver time, several things happened and coincided,\u201d Booth explains. \u201cNumber one: so many women were coming through, Mike couldn\u2019t really handle it all himself. Number two: the women were watching the procedures being done, and they saw how it could be done. Number three: Mike was willing to teach them how to assist or even do the procedures. And four: Mike told the women that he wasn\u2019t actually a doctor.\u201d Mike, it transpired, had simply learned how to perform abortions from a doctor who worked for the Mob. By 1971, the doctor model had been abandoned and the women of Jane had begun to perform the abortions themselves. It was cheaper and allowed the experience to be more woman-focused. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being in Jane changed my life completely. We were like a feminist Wakanda, separate from the real world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in early May 1972, the sister-in-law of a woman who had come to Jane for an abortion reported the group to the local police, and they were duly raided. Officers followed the driver taking women from the front house to an apartment in a high rise in the Chicago neighbourhood of South Shore. \u201cAnd they got off the elevator, homicide squad guys, giant men in trench coats and shiny shoes,\u201d Kaplan says, \u201clooking for \u2018the man and the money\u2019. And there was no man, and there was not much money, either.\u201d</p> <p>The group scrambled to bail out the seven members who were arrested, and to cater to the 300 women still waiting for abortions. They contacted clinics in New York and Washington, which agreed to perform the procedures for free, with Jane covering the women\u2019s transport.</p> <p>The following January, with the ruling of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade\" title=\"\">Roe v Wade</a> and the legalisation of abortion across the US, the charges against the women of Jane were quietly dropped. \u201cIt was about three months later that we decided to disband,\u201d recalls Kaplan. \u201cQuite frankly, we were burned out and we were lucky \u2013 we hadn\u2019t killed anybody, so let\u2019s get out while the going is good.\u201d</p> <p>Kaplan is 69 now and still politically active. At her home in upstate New York, where vegetables push through the winter ground and her dog, Gilda, snores by the fire, she talks about her current causes \u2013 immigration and the local library among them. It was her involvement with Jane that set her on this path. \u201cIt changed my life completely,\u201d she says. \u201cI had always seen myself as a political person, but the thing about being in Jane, for all of us, is that we really learned we were competent people. We created the world we wanted to live in. And it was separate from the real world. We were like a feminist Wakanda.\u201d</p> <p>Booth, too, has pursued <a href=\"http://heatherbooththefilm.com/\" title=\"\">a life of political organising</a>. At 74, she has had a career encompassing the role of strategic adviser on a national campaign for immigration reform, the campaign to pass Barack Obama\u2019s first budget, and director of the <a href=\"http://naacpnationalvoterfund.org/\" title=\"\">NAACP National Voter Fund</a>, which in 2000 helped increase African American voter turnout by more than a million. Today, she is fighting to lower prescription drug prices, going up against the big pharmaceutical companies.

That morning, they held a fundraising event at the home of a local supporter \u2013 discussing their work in reproductive healthcare over coffee and baked goods. The event was busier than they had expected \u2013 35 people in all, though in recent times they have noticed a steady increase in supporter numbers. \u201cUnfortunately, it does sometimes take horrible things happening in our political climate,\u201d says Amanda Beatriz Williams, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cPeople say, \u2018What can we do?\u2019 And luckily we have a lot of answers.\u201d</p> <p>The Lilith Fund is the oldest abortion fund in Texas, serving the state\u2019s central and southern regions. Founded in 2001 by a group of Austin-based activists, it was initially funded by a series of garage sales that raised $10,000 to open a hotline. Now it is funded through a combination of grants and donations, and was able to assist 26% of the 6,050 women who called the hotline in 2018. Women call only once their abortion appointment has been made; and it is often the clinic that encourages a woman to call once they know the cost.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Protesters harass women going to the clinic, throwing out statements like, \u2018You won\u2019t be able to parent later in life\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey leave a voicemail,\u201d explains Shae Ward, the hotline coordinator. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re able to fund them, we\u2019ll call them back that same day.\u201d The daily budget is $2,500. The average caller is 13-14 weeks pregnant. A second trimester abortion costs $800-1,200. \u201cAnd so I have to determine who we can fund, and who unfortunately we\u2019re not able to.\u201d They weigh up factors such as domestic violence or homelessness, alongside gestation and appointment date. \u201cIf your procedure is the next day, we\u2019re gonna try and get you in,\u201d Ward says. </p> <p>The fund operates a voucher system, redeemable at the clinic, but they have become accustomed to that fact that only a fraction will redeem the vouchers. \u201cIt\u2019s for a number of reasons,\u201d explains Williams. \u201dWe can only afford to cover partial costs \u2013 so they\u2019re often left to come up with the rest. And some are able to, and some aren\u2019t. Or they couldn\u2019t get to the clinic, or whatever barriers they couldn\u2019t overcome.\u201d</p> <p>It is a heavy responsibility. There is the pressure of deciding women\u2019s fates, the need to fundraise, and the constant heel-nip of new anti-abortion legislation. In some east Texas cities, they tell me, the fund has been called a \u201ccriminal organisation\u201d. The volunteers rely heavily on one another for emotional support.</p> <p>But they remain hopeful. All are under 40, and see reason for optimism in the younger generation\u2019s support for reproductive rights. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve noticed a lot in this past decade is people sharing their abortion stories,\u201d says Williams. She has come to see storytelling as a fierce strategy in the fight; the more women share their personal experiences of termination, the more she feels people will connect on a human level.</p> <p>Williams herself had an abortion at 19, and it was part of what motivated her to work in reproductive healthcare, though it took nearly seven years of working in the movement before she felt confident enough to share her experience. \u201cI actually shared my story for the first time publicly on the steps of the Supreme Court during one of the big rallies in 2016,\u201d she says, recalling the successful campaign to overturn House Bill 2. \u201cThere is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdeCZqGgGlQ\" title=\"\">a You</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdeCZqGgGlQ\" title=\"\">Tube of it</a>. I was full of tears. It was hard for me, but what really changed my life was the outpouring of support I got.\u201d</p> <p>She keeps a photo on her desk from that day, which shows her on the courtroom steps, wiping away her tears. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a bunch of people behind me, and\u2026 \u201d her voice catches, \u201cit\u2019s just the literal image of people behind me that\u2019s everything. And of course the Supreme Court is behind me, too. And we won.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The City Hall stands in downtown McAllen, a community of some 142,000 at the point where Texas butts up against the Mexican border. On a hot midweek afternoon the street is quiet; cars slide by slowly, and sunlight blinks off shop windows displaying tuxedos and fancy dresses and party paraphernalia. Until 1993, the same spot was occupied by the city hospital, where in 1977 a young woman named <a href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/rosie-jimenez-abortion-medicaid/\" title=\"\">Rosie Jimenez</a> died following complications from a backstreet abortion \u2013 the first woman to die after the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/elizabeth-warren-biden-abortion-video-response-clip-msnbc-town-hall\" title=\"\">Hyde </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/elizabeth-warren-biden-abortion-video-response-clip-msnbc-town-hall\" title=\"\">amendment</a>, which barred the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. Today, McAllen is home to the only remaining abortion clinic in the Rio Grande Valley \u2013 a low, unassuming building almost opposite City Hall. A few mornings each week, protesters stand outside its doors, waving banners and shouting at the medical staff and women arriving for their appointments. \u201cThey harass women going there, throwing out statements like, \u2018Abortion gives breast cancer,\u2019\u201d says Iris Reyes, community organiser for the local branch of the <a href=\"https://latinainstitute.org/en/texas\" title=\"\">National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health</a>. \u201cOr, \u2018Your womb will become used to you having an abortion so you won\u2019t be able to parent later in life.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The Latina Institute plays a crucial role here, turning up in schools and homes and community centres to discuss smear tests, mammograms and abortions, lobbying to improve the lives of women in the valley. The average annual household income here is about $40,000, though some work for just $2 an hour, and many, particularly female domestic workers, fall victim to wage theft. It is strongly religious, mainly Spanish-speaking, and many of the residents do not have US citizenship papers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb199400a7c28208e893dc34ceafb3bbd1f75616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb199400a7c28208e893dc34ceafb3bbd1f75616/421_375_3012_1807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iris Reyes, an organiser with Texas\u2019s National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iris Reyes, an organiser with Texas\u2019s National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Veronica G Cardenas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of this creates a unique set of barriers to women who find themselves pregnant in difficult circumstances. A clinic abortion costs about $500. While documented women might be able to head over the border for the cheaper option of buying abortion pills in Mexico, this is not a risk the undocumented can take. Beyond McAllen, the nearest clinic is in San Antonio, four hours\u2019 drive and an immigration checkpoint away. Little wonder that some women seek abortion pills available under the counter at some of the region\u2019s flea markets, unregulated and unmanaged. The clinic is only licensed to perform abortions <a href=\"https://www.wholewomanshealth.com/clinic/mcallen/\" title=\"\">up to 16 weeks</a>, which is too late for some. There is no public transport and many women cannot easily get to a pharmacy to buy a pregnancy test. \u201cBy the time [some] women go to the abortion clinic, they\u2019re often past 20 weeks,\u201d explains Samantha Herrera, who works as a freelance translator in the RGV area. For undocumented women, there are other deterrents: immigration force vans often park up outside the clinic, and a new law requires women to show ID before they can access abortion</p> <p>There is another, more sinister obstacle nearby, too. Just a block from the abortion clinic stands the <a href=\"https://mcallenpregnancycenter.org/\" title=\"\">McAllen Pregnancy Center</a> \u2013 a similar low-level, anonymous building. Herrera tells me it is in fact a \u201cfalse clinic\u201d staffed by anti-abortion campaigners, who will from time to time walk up the street to the real clinic wearing \u201cwhite coats as if they were doctors, showing up in scrubs, pretending to be medical people. But they\u2019re just regular volunteers with no medical background.\u201d Their purpose is to convince women to go to the McAllen Pregnancy Center. \u201cThey will say things like, \u2018This isn\u2019t where you made your appointment, it\u2019s over here, we\u2019ll walk you over\u2026\u2019\u201d Inside they will perform a false ultrasound \u201cthat shows they are more advanced in their pregnancy\u201d and therefore unable to have an abortion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can\u2019t continue to live with our arms folded. We mobilise. We educate ourselves. We fight for our lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is one of a number of <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2006/10/misinformed-consent-medical-accuracy-state-developed-abortion-counseling-materials#box1\" title=\"\">Crisis Pregnancy Centers</a> across the US \u2013 buildings that mimic medical clinics, and are designed to attract women seeking low-cost abortions. Their funding comes in part from the millions of federal dollars directed into abstinence-only sex-education programmes. In July 2017, President Trump halted funding for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/09/teenage-pregnancy-in-us-an-all-time-low-trump-sex-ed-changes\" title=\"\">Teen Pregnancy Prevention </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/09/teenage-pregnancy-in-us-an-all-time-low-trump-sex-ed-changes\" title=\"\">programme</a>, and <a href=\"https://rewire.news/article/2017/09/07/trump-gives-away-millions-anti-choice-fake-clinics/\" title=\"\">allocated $3m to CPCs</a>. </p> <p>CPCs are not illegal, though their status is complicated, and many argue that they are unethical. As they are not medical practices and do not charge for services, they are not subject to regulation. Legal action taken against CPCs has largely focused on false advertising practices.</p> <p>For the staff and volunteers at the Latina Institute, meanwhile, the work is relentless: the previous day they provided training at a community centre; this evening they will hold a meeting in Alamo; they have a presence at every rally, on religious radio stations, on television, and often head to Austin to lobby the state government. \u201cOur organisation is not only pro-choice,\u201d says associate director Lucy Ceballos F\u00e9lix, \u201cwe\u2019re pro-women.\u201d Their aim is to increase the number of clinics in Texas, but more urgently simply to keep this one open. \u201cIf the clinic closes here, there is no access,\u201d says Herrera. \u201cWomen cannot go south to Mexico and they can\u2019t go north. And then there\u2019s nothing left but home remedies, and they end up in hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Around the table, the three women look exasperated. On her laptop, Ceballos F\u00e9lix scrolls through a list of proposed Texas legislation that would further impede abortion access, reading out the names of the bills and explaining each one in increasingly rapid Spanish. She pauses and exhales. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about this,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to live just with our arms folded. We mobilise. We educate ourselves. We fight for our rights.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Last year, Heather Booth headed from her home in Washington to Georgia to tell, once again, the story of Jane. It was a disheartening moment, to consider that more than 50 years after she began her underground abortion service in Chicago, America might once again be returning to a more repressive time. Many fights are having to be refought. \u201cThere are more than 200 members of Senate and Congress, Republicans, who\u2019ve just signed a statement saying they want the Supreme Court to revisit and potentially overturn Roe v Wade,\u201d she says. That means vigilance and action from everyone, in and outside the government, who wants to defend it.</p> <p>Booth talks about the restrictions to abortion access, and the cuts to funding for Planned Parenthood \u2013 brought about because the organisation continues to provide information about abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s limiting reproductive health in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd pregnancy-related deaths increase when reproductive health is restricted.\u201d Increasingly she is asked to give talks, to lend her support to campaigning groups, to stand up, speak up once again. \u201cIt is a very intense, almost knife-edge moment,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many things are at stake.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Laura Barton presents the Archive on 4 documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000djx2\" title=\"\">Call Jane At 643 3844</a> on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday 18 January at 8pm.</p> <p>If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 January 2020.

      "bodyText": "The telephone sat in the dormitory hallway, and when it rang it might have been for any of the residents \u2013 young women in their teens and early 20s, all students at the University of Chicago. Calls came from family and friends and boyfriends, from colleagues and classmates and clubs. But sometimes the voice at the end of the line would ask for \u201cJane\u201d. This was 1965, and in Chicago the social justice movement was gathering pace \u2013 a new era that encompassed civil rights, student rights, women\u2019s rights and resistance to the war in Vietnam. Among those involved was Heather Booth, a 19-year-old social sciences student from New York. Booth had spent the summer of 1964 in Mississippi, volunteering as part of the Freedom Summer project, an attempt to register as many African American voters as possible. It was an experience that had galvanised her and taught some valuable lessons: \u201cOne is that if you organise, even in what seem like the most hopeless circumstances, you can change the world,\u201d she says. \u201cNumber two: sometimes you have to stand up to illegitimate authority.\u201d Back in Chicago, her reputation as an underground organiser now well-rooted, she was approached by a friend with a quite different problem: his sister was pregnant, not ready to have a child and nearly suicidal. She wanted an abortion, which was then illegal across the US. Booth was startled. \u201cI hadn\u2019t ever thought of the issue before,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut I said I\u2019d try to find a doctor for her.\u201d Booth approached the medical committee for the civil rights movement and identified Dr TRM Howard as potentially sympathetic. A former civil rights leader from Mississippi, he had relocated to Chicago after his name appeared on a Ku Klux Klan death list. They talked over the phone. \u201cI found out the terms and made an arrangement, and didn\u2019t really think much more about it,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut then word must have spread, and a little while later someone else called, and then a little while later someone else. And I realised there was a far greater need than I had appreciated.\u201d For three years, Booth ran a one-woman illegal abortion service \u2013 first from her university dormitory, and then from her Chicago apartment. Keen to keep the process as anonymous as possible, she told prospective callers to ask for Jane, choosing the moniker simply because \u201cit was a very common name, nondescript\u201d, she says. \u201cAnd then the name stuck.\u201d Pregnancy in the 1960s brought a number of limitations and complications for women\u2019s lives. \u201cAt the time that Jane started, you still could be fired from some jobs if you were pregnant,\u201d Booth explains. \u201cThere were jobs that wouldn\u2019t hire you if you had children. There certainly were families that would throw out their kids if they were pregnant and not married.\u201d Many resorted to extreme measures, paying for backstreet abortions, or attempting to perform the procedure themselves \u201cusing coat hangers or lye [sodium hydroxide] or throwing themselves off a building or \u2018falling\u2019 downstairs\u201d, Booth says. \u201cBecause they couldn\u2019t imagine going on, even if it meant risking their life.\u201d As her service grew, Booth\u2019s ambition was for something different. \u201cI decided that we needed to create a system,\u201d she says. \u201cA women\u2019s culture, reflecting what the women needed, and said that they wanted.\u201d She came to an agreement with Dr Howard, negotiating his fee from $500 for a single procedure to two or three abortions for the same price. She also introduced a counselling element, talking to the women beforehand about what they might expect, and afterwards to see how their experience had been. Booth herself had received no sex education, and had no experience of pregnancy or abortion; in the late 60s, women across America were increasingly coming to know and understand their own bodies. If she was concerned about the illegality of what she was doing, or by the rapidly growing number of women, Booth tried not to let it be a deterrent. \u201cLife at that moment was filled with so many engagements and movement activities, and so many unexpected things. It was as if democracy and society was becoming more alive in many different arenas. I probably was also somewhat scared and frightened. But in so much of what I\u2019ve ever done in my life, I was sort of scared and frightened \u2013 at the start at least. And I think it\u2019s true for many people, especially young women, who wonder, \u2018Will I know enough? Will I be good enough? Can I do just what\u2019s needed?\u2019\u201d By 1968, the need had grown unmanageable. By then working, studying, newly married and expecting her first child, Booth elected to transfer \u201cJane\u201d to a group of volunteers she knew from her political work. She coached them in her counselling methods before handing over her contacts. Jane changed substantially from this point. Howard was no longer involved, replaced by another practitioner named Mike, and the clientele had begun to shift, too. As abortion became legal in Colorado, New York and Hawaii, the wealthier, white college students who had been the mainstay of Booth\u2019s service began to travel for their procedures. In Chicago, Jane increasingly catered to poorer, predominantly African American communities on the west and south sides of the city. \u201cWord of us spread throughout the city,\u201d recalls Laura Kaplan, who joined the group at this time, and later authored The Story Of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service. \u201cBecause once we took over, we lowered the price to $100, or what you could afford, and we never turned anybody away.\u201d The group kept no records, no paper trail of names or numbers, but Kaplan estimates that over the course of four years, Jane performed 11,000 procedures, averaging payment of around $40 to $50 per abortion. The organisation became more efficient: with a large network of volunteers, they were able to set up a hotline, putting up posters in dorm rooms and phone booths that read \u201cPregnant? Don\u2019t want to be? Call Jane\u201d and the phone number 643-3844. They procured an answering machine \u201cthe size of a suitcase, reel-to-reel\u201d and set it up in the home of a volunteer. They established a \u201cfront house\u201d, which served as a reception for clients who would then be driven to a different apartment for the abortion. What happened next seems radical now, but for the women of Jane it felt more like an evolution. \u201cOver time, several things happened and coincided,\u201d Booth explains. \u201cNumber one: so many women were coming through, Mike couldn\u2019t really handle it all himself. Number two: the women were watching the procedures being done, and they saw how it could be done. Number three: Mike was willing to teach them how to assist or even do the procedures. And four: Mike told the women that he wasn\u2019t actually a doctor.\u201d Mike, it transpired, had simply learned how to perform abortions from a doctor who worked for the Mob. By 1971, the doctor model had been abandoned and the women of Jane had begun to perform the abortions themselves. It was cheaper and allowed the experience to be more woman-focused. But in early May 1972, the sister-in-law of a woman who had come to Jane for an abortion reported the group to the local police, and they were duly raided. Officers followed the driver taking women from the front house to an apartment in a high rise in the Chicago neighbourhood of South Shore. \u201cAnd they got off the elevator, homicide squad guys, giant men in trench coats and shiny shoes,\u201d Kaplan says, \u201clooking for \u2018the man and the money\u2019. And there was no man, and there was not much money, either.\u201d The group scrambled to bail out the seven members who were arrested, and to cater to the 300 women still waiting for abortions. They contacted clinics in New York and Washington, which agreed to perform the procedures for free, with Jane covering the women\u2019s transport. The following January, with the ruling of Roe v Wade and the legalisation of abortion across the US, the charges against the women of Jane were quietly dropped. \u201cIt was about three months later that we decided to disband,\u201d recalls Kaplan. \u201cQuite frankly, we were burned out and we were lucky \u2013 we hadn\u2019t killed anybody, so let\u2019s get out while the going is good.\u201d Kaplan is 69 now and still politically active. At her home in upstate New York, where vegetables push through the winter ground and her dog, Gilda, snores by the fire, she talks about her current causes \u2013 immigration and the local library among them. It was her involvement with Jane that set her on this path. \u201cIt changed my life completely,\u201d she says. \u201cI had always seen myself as a political person, but the thing about being in Jane, for all of us, is that we really learned we were competent people. We created the world we wanted to live in. And it was separate from the real world. We were like a feminist Wakanda.\u201d Booth, too, has pursued a life of political organising. At 74, she has had a career encompassing the role of strategic adviser on a national campaign for immigration reform, the campaign to pass Barack Obama\u2019s first budget, and director of the NAACP National Voter Fund, which in 2000 helped increase African American voter turnout by more than a million. Today, she is fighting to lower prescription drug prices, going up against the big pharmaceutical companies. Her role in every instance, she says, has been \u201csupporting others who were in the leadership, helping them find their voice, their confidence, to stand up, speak up\u201d. Now, with a presidential election just months away and the recent erosions of US abortion law, women who are fighting battles that Booth hoped had been won in the 60s are asking for her help again. *** In 2019, seven US states took action to effectively ban abortion, and others severely reduced access. In Alabama, where 93% of counties have no abortion clinics, the governor signed a law that meant practitioners could face life imprisonment. Six US states have only one abortion clinic, and 27 cities and much of the country\u2019s rural areas qualify as \u201cabortion deserts\u201d where women would need to travel more than 100 miles to reach a clinic. Texas is one of these deserts. Across west Texas and the Panhandle, home to over a million people, the nearest clinic is now 250 miles away. In 2013, the state introduced House Bill 2, resulting in the closure of more than half of its abortion clinics \u2013 before the key provisions were struck down by the Supreme Court three years later. Today the state \u2013 the second largest by both geography and population \u2013 has just 22 abortion clinics for 29 million people. Find yourself unable or unwilling to continue with a pregnancy in Texas today and your options are limited. Even if you can find a way to make a 500\u2011mile round trip and take time off work or school , a 2017 law bans private insurance companies from covering the cost of an abortion. State law also requires that before a termination a woman must undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, then 24 hours must elapse before her procedure. Both should be performed by the same physician. Anti-abortion campaigners maintain that this brings it into line with regulations governing other surgeries. Initiatives such as Plan C, which helps women buy medication online safely for a self-managed termination, bring their own risks (infection, an incomplete abortion). And that option is unavailable to the many women who do not possess a credit card, or who cannot securely receive a parcel through the mail. A 2015 study found that some 100,000 women in the state had, in a variety of ways, at one time tried to induce an abortion. On a warm Sunday afternoon in San Antonio, five of the members of the Lilith Fund gather around a table outside a branch of Starbucks. That morning, they held a fundraising event at the home of a local supporter \u2013 discussing their work in reproductive healthcare over coffee and baked goods. The event was busier than they had expected \u2013 35 people in all, though in recent times they have noticed a steady increase in supporter numbers. \u201cUnfortunately, it does sometimes take horrible things happening in our political climate,\u201d says Amanda Beatriz Williams, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cPeople say, \u2018What can we do?\u2019 And luckily we have a lot of answers.\u201d The Lilith Fund is the oldest abortion fund in Texas, serving the state\u2019s central and southern regions. Founded in 2001 by a group of Austin-based activists, it was initially funded by a series of garage sales that raised $10,000 to open a hotline. Now it is funded through a combination of grants and donations, and was able to assist 26% of the 6,050 women who called the hotline in 2018. Women call only once their abortion appointment has been made; and it is often the clinic that encourages a woman to call once they know the cost. \u201cThey leave a voicemail,\u201d explains Shae Ward, the hotline coordinator. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re able to fund them, we\u2019ll call them back that same day.\u201d The daily budget is $2,500. The average caller is 13-14 weeks pregnant. A second trimester abortion costs $800-1,200. \u201cAnd so I have to determine who we can fund, and who unfortunately we\u2019re not able to.\u201d They weigh up factors such as domestic violence or homelessness, alongside gestation and appointment date. \u201cIf your procedure is the next day, we\u2019re gonna try and get you in,\u201d Ward says. The fund operates a voucher system, redeemable at the clinic, but they have become accustomed to that fact that only a fraction will redeem the vouchers. \u201cIt\u2019s for a number of reasons,\u201d explains Williams. \u201dWe can only afford to cover partial costs \u2013 so they\u2019re often left to come up with the rest. And some are able to, and some aren\u2019t. Or they couldn\u2019t get to the clinic, or whatever barriers they couldn\u2019t overcome.\u201d It is a heavy responsibility. There is the pressure of deciding women\u2019s fates, the need to fundraise, and the constant heel-nip of new anti-abortion legislation. In some east Texas cities, they tell me, the fund has been called a \u201ccriminal organisation\u201d. The volunteers rely heavily on one another for emotional support. But they remain hopeful. All are under 40, and see reason for optimism in the younger generation\u2019s support for reproductive rights. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve noticed a lot in this past decade is people sharing their abortion stories,\u201d says Williams. She has come to see storytelling as a fierce strategy in the fight; the more women share their personal experiences of termination, the more she feels people will connect on a human level. Williams herself had an abortion at 19, and it was part of what motivated her to work in reproductive healthcare, though it took nearly seven years of working in the movement before she felt confident enough to share her experience. \u201cI actually shared my story for the first time publicly on the steps of the Supreme Court during one of the big rallies in 2016,\u201d she says, recalling the successful campaign to overturn House Bill 2. \u201cThere is a YouTube of it. I was full of tears. It was hard for me, but what really changed my life was the outpouring of support I got.\u201d She keeps a photo on her desk from that day, which shows her on the courtroom steps, wiping away her tears. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a bunch of people behind me, and\u2026 \u201d her voice catches, \u201cit\u2019s just the literal image of people behind me that\u2019s everything. And of course the Supreme Court is behind me, too. And we won.\u201d *** The City Hall stands in downtown McAllen, a community of some 142,000 at the point where Texas butts up against the Mexican border. On a hot midweek afternoon the street is quiet; cars slide by slowly, and sunlight blinks off shop windows displaying tuxedos and fancy dresses and party paraphernalia. Until 1993, the same spot was occupied by the city hospital, where in 1977 a young woman named Rosie Jimenez died following complications from a backstreet abortion \u2013 the first woman to die after the introduction of the Hyde amendment, which barred the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. Today, McAllen is home to the only remaining abortion clinic in the Rio Grande Valley \u2013 a low, unassuming building almost opposite City Hall. A few mornings each week, protesters stand outside its doors, waving banners and shouting at the medical staff and women arriving for their appointments. \u201cThey harass women going there, throwing out statements like, \u2018Abortion gives breast cancer,\u2019\u201d says Iris Reyes, community organiser for the local branch of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. \u201cOr, \u2018Your womb will become used to you having an abortion so you won\u2019t be able to parent later in life.\u2019\u201d The Latina Institute plays a crucial role here, turning up in schools and homes and community centres to discuss smear tests, mammograms and abortions, lobbying to improve the lives of women in the valley. The average annual household income here is about $40,000, though some work for just $2 an hour, and many, particularly female domestic workers, fall victim to wage theft. It is strongly religious, mainly Spanish-speaking, and many of the residents do not have US citizenship papers. All of this creates a unique set of barriers to women who find themselves pregnant in difficult circumstances. A clinic abortion costs about $500. While documented women might be able to head over the border for the cheaper option of buying abortion pills in Mexico, this is not a risk the undocumented can take. Beyond McAllen, the nearest clinic is in San Antonio, four hours\u2019 drive and an immigration checkpoint away. Little wonder that some women seek abortion pills available under the counter at some of the region\u2019s flea markets, unregulated and unmanaged. The clinic is only licensed to perform abortions up to 16 weeks, which is too late for some. There is no public transport and many women cannot easily get to a pharmacy to buy a pregnancy test. \u201cBy the time [some] women go to the abortion clinic, they\u2019re often past 20 weeks,\u201d explains Samantha Herrera, who works as a freelance translator in the RGV area. For undocumented women, there are other deterrents: immigration force vans often park up outside the clinic, and a new law requires women to show ID before they can access abortion There is another, more sinister obstacle nearby, too. Just a block from the abortion clinic stands the McAllen Pregnancy Center \u2013 a similar low-level, anonymous building. Herrera tells me it is in fact a \u201cfalse clinic\u201d staffed by anti-abortion campaigners, who will from time to time walk up the street to the real clinic wearing \u201cwhite coats as if they were doctors, showing up in scrubs, pretending to be medical people. But they\u2019re just regular volunteers with no medical background.\u201d Their purpose is to convince women to go to the McAllen Pregnancy Center. \u201cThey will say things like, \u2018This isn\u2019t where you made your appointment, it\u2019s over here, we\u2019ll walk you over\u2026\u2019\u201d Inside they will perform a false ultrasound \u201cthat shows they are more advanced in their pregnancy\u201d and therefore unable to have an abortion. This is one of a number of Crisis Pregnancy Centers across the US \u2013 buildings that mimic medical clinics, and are designed to attract women seeking low-cost abortions. Their funding comes in part from the millions of federal dollars directed into abstinence-only sex-education programmes. In July 2017, President Trump halted funding for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention programme, and allocated $3m to CPCs. CPCs are not illegal, though their status is complicated, and many argue that they are unethical. As they are not medical practices and do not charge for services, they are not subject to regulation. Legal action taken against CPCs has largely focused on false advertising practices. For the staff and volunteers at the Latina Institute, meanwhile, the work is relentless: the previous day they provided training at a community centre; this evening they will hold a meeting in Alamo; they have a presence at every rally, on religious radio stations, on television, and often head to Austin to lobby the state government. \u201cOur organisation is not only pro-choice,\u201d says associate director Lucy Ceballos F\u00e9lix, \u201cwe\u2019re pro-women.\u201d Their aim is to increase the number of clinics in Texas, but more urgently simply to keep this one open. \u201cIf the clinic closes here, there is no access,\u201d says Herrera. \u201cWomen cannot go south to Mexico and they can\u2019t go north. And then there\u2019s nothing left but home remedies, and they end up in hospital.\u201d Around the table, the three women look exasperated. On her laptop, Ceballos F\u00e9lix scrolls through a list of proposed Texas legislation that would further impede abortion access, reading out the names of the bills and explaining each one in increasingly rapid Spanish. She pauses and exhales. \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about this,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to live just with our arms folded. We mobilise. We educate ourselves. We fight for our rights.\u201d *** Last year, Heather Booth headed from her home in Washington to Georgia to tell, once again, the story of Jane. It was a disheartening moment, to consider that more than 50 years after she began her underground abortion service in Chicago, America might once again be returning to a more repressive time. Many fights are having to be refought. \u201cThere are more than 200 members of Senate and Congress, Republicans, who\u2019ve just signed a statement saying they want the Supreme Court to revisit and potentially overturn Roe v Wade,\u201d she says. That means vigilance and action from everyone, in and outside the government, who wants to defend it. Booth talks about the restrictions to abortion access, and the cuts to funding for Planned Parenthood \u2013 brought about because the organisation continues to provide information about abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s limiting reproductive health in the US,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd pregnancy-related deaths increase when reproductive health is restricted.\u201d Increasingly she is asked to give talks, to lend her support to campaigning groups, to stand up, speak up once again. \u201cIt is a very intense, almost knife-edge moment,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many things are at stake.\u201d \u2022 Laura Barton presents the Archive on 4 documentary Call Jane At 643 3844 on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday 18 January at 8pm.

Rather than replacing council houses to stymie rent growth, New Labour used housing benefit to effectively subsidise a new class of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen-watching aspirational landlords.

By redistributing income rather than wealth, Blairism left the country primed for a \u201cmakers v takers\u201d, \u201cstrivers v skivers\u201d attack. All those owners were suddenly asking: why am I paying for all this? Through right to buy and the easy availability of finance capital, Thatcher\u2019s Conservatives created a new layer of homeowning, aspirational middle-class Britons who at least felt richer, even if they were just overmortgaged against a housing bubble. Rather than replacing council houses to stymie rent growth, New Labour used housing benefit to effectively subsidise a new class of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen-watching aspirational landlords. Housing was provided, people were getting filthy rich, taxes were paying for it, and everything was great until it wasn\u2019t. Whom to blame now that Brown\u2019s vaunted end of boom-and-bust had itself come to an end? Reliably enough, both parties turned to the scapegoat of Those People \u2013 the benefits claimants, the foreign-looking, that suspiciously affluent next door neighbour you don\u2019t like. Once the country was no longer thinking in terms of \u201centrepreneurial aspiration\u201d but back to \u201ckeeping hold of what I\u2019ve got\u201d, the Tories were fighting on their home turf. Paying for public services turned neatly into unsustainable, wasteful spending. As the mafia knows, the best way to cover up a crime is to make sure everyone is complicit. If I go down, you go down. How to challenge finance capital\u2019s death-grip on the economy when doing so would knock the house prices that make your voters feel good? Ultimately, even Corbyn fought and lost on that battleground of \u201chow will you pay for all this free stuff?\u201d You cannot rely purely on the material explanation, though, to explain the ferocity with which the centre-left rejects this plain reading of history. There is an element of ideological self-preservation here, even as they deny the existence of an ideology and appeal simply to common sense. If Blair had a choice, if we all had a choice, then there is some hard explaining to do. The younger generation, clustered in cities, paying unsustainable rents while they seek precarious gig- economy work, are asking difficult questions of those who brought us here. Smashed as Corbynism is, its abortive groundswell happened for a reason. As climate catastrophe takes its toll, as Deliveroo riders cycle past rough sleepers knowing it could easily be them on the cardboard, they are asking if it really had to be this way. Was there, in all honesty, no alternative to this? It is this question that so exercises the defenders of Blair\u2019s legacy. There had to have been no choice, so nobody can be to blame for having made it. The alternative is simply unthinkable. \u2022 Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy",

It was started by Jalal Kamani, a member of the billionaire retail dynasty behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/boohoo-marks-spencer-christmas-sales\">Boohoo, the online retail group now more valuable than Marks &amp; Spencer.</a></p> <p>The rags to riches success story (his father Abdullah moved to the north-west in the 1960s to escape war-torn Kenya and founded the textile business that eventually became Boohoo) has thrown the close-knit family into the public eye.</p> <p>Jalal quit his role as Boohoo\u2019s trading director back in 2015, the year after the company\u2019s successful float<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/07/boohoo-sale-company-shares\"> on the stock exchange</a>, and launched I Saw It First two years later. The move pits him directly against the original family firm where his younger brother Mahmud Kamani sits in the driving seat as executive chairman, supported by sons Umar and Samir, who run the PrettyLittleThing and BoohooMan brands, respectively.</p> <p>So can lightning strike twice? The Boohoo group has grown rapidly, with sales set to exceed \u00a31bn for the first time in the current financial year. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb suggests that if the businessman was allowed to leave and do a startup it was because he \u201cwasn\u2019t seen as a threat\u201d.</p> <p>On LinkedIn, Jalal, who is 60 next month, describes himself as the brains behind Boohoo\u2019s successful \u201ctest and repeat\u201d model, which involves making small quantities of a wide array of styles then ramping up production of the top sellers. Presumably thanks to a network of contacts built up over more than 30 years in the fashion industry, the clothes on I Saw It First are keenly priced, with dresses and tops selling for as little as \u00a34 in the sale.</p> <p>The green foil crop tops and PVC swimsuits being paraded by the pool in Cape Town might not seem the answer to the wardrobe dilemmas faced in the UK during a rainy January. But the show provides a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jun/06/love-at-first-swipe-would-you-shop-the-love-island-look-live\">direct hotline to the shoppers</a> that I Saw It First is trying to reach, leading to huge spikes in traffic on its website while the show is airing. The retailer first sponsored the show last summer and said the deal produced a 67% increase in month-on-month sales. Contestants don\u2019t have to wear the clothes provided but if they do, products can sell out immediately.</p> <p>On its website, I Saw It First claims a \u201crapid rise\u201d from small Manchester brand to become \u201cone of the leading forces in the UK\u2019s fast-fashion landscape\u201d. There is little financial information available to back this up yet, but the startup now employs about 100 people and has expanded its range to 5,500 lines, with the recent addition of menswear. The brand is now \u201crecognisable and relatable\u201d, it says, thanks to these high profile tie-ups, which have included Ibiza nightclubs as well as \u201ccollabs\u201d with social media influencers.</p> <p>GlobalData retail analyst Emily Salter says the young fast fashion market is becoming increasingly crowded as established sites such as Asos, Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing battle new names such as <a href=\"https://www.shein.co.uk/?url_from=ukbingbrandshein_shein03_20170908\">Shein</a> and In The Style for supremacy. The cut-throat environment has not been without casualties, with sales at one-time star Missguided falling sharply last year after it cut spending on marketing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite growing criticism of fast fashion from industry bodies and campaigners such as Extinction Rebellion, the model is still thriving.

      "bodyText": "Love Island is back on the telly with millions of viewers tuning in for a daily fix of romance, winter sun \u2013 and fast fashion. The hit dating reality show offers a golden opportunity for brands to get noticed and this year\u2019s fame-hungry wannabes include I Saw It First, the fast-growing Manchester fashion firm going after the teenage and twentysomething audience with cheap, sexy clothes. While not yet a household name, I Saw It First is one to watch because of its family ties. It was started by Jalal Kamani, a member of the billionaire retail dynasty behind Boohoo, the online retail group now more valuable than Marks &amp; Spencer. The rags to riches success story (his father Abdullah moved to the north-west in the 1960s to escape war-torn Kenya and founded the textile business that eventually became Boohoo) has thrown the close-knit family into the public eye. Jalal quit his role as Boohoo\u2019s trading director back in 2015, the year after the company\u2019s successful float on the stock exchange, and launched I Saw It First two years later. The move pits him directly against the original family firm where his younger brother Mahmud Kamani sits in the driving seat as executive chairman, supported by sons Umar and Samir, who run the PrettyLittleThing and BoohooMan brands, respectively. So can lightning strike twice? The Boohoo group has grown rapidly, with sales set to exceed \u00a31bn for the first time in the current financial year. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb suggests that if the businessman was allowed to leave and do a startup it was because he \u201cwasn\u2019t seen as a threat\u201d. On LinkedIn, Jalal, who is 60 next month, describes himself as the brains behind Boohoo\u2019s successful \u201ctest and repeat\u201d model, which involves making small quantities of a wide array of styles then ramping up production of the top sellers. Presumably thanks to a network of contacts built up over more than 30 years in the fashion industry, the clothes on I Saw It First are keenly priced, with dresses and tops selling for as little as \u00a34 in the sale. The green foil crop tops and PVC swimsuits being paraded by the pool in Cape Town might not seem the answer to the wardrobe dilemmas faced in the UK during a rainy January. But the show provides a direct hotline to the shoppers that I Saw It First is trying to reach, leading to huge spikes in traffic on its website while the show is airing. The retailer first sponsored the show last summer and said the deal produced a 67% increase in month-on-month sales. Contestants don\u2019t have to wear the clothes provided but if they do, products can sell out immediately. On its website, I Saw It First claims a \u201crapid rise\u201d from small Manchester brand to become \u201cone of the leading forces in the UK\u2019s fast-fashion landscape\u201d. There is little financial information available to back this up yet, but the startup now employs about 100 people and has expanded its range to 5,500 lines, with the recent addition of menswear. The brand is now \u201crecognisable and relatable\u201d, it says, thanks to these high profile tie-ups, which have included Ibiza nightclubs as well as \u201ccollabs\u201d with social media influencers. GlobalData retail analyst Emily Salter says the young fast fashion market is becoming increasingly crowded as established sites such as Asos, Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing battle new names such as Shein and In The Style for supremacy. The cut-throat environment has not been without casualties, with sales at one-time star Missguided falling sharply last year after it cut spending on marketing. Despite growing criticism of fast fashion from industry bodies and campaigners such as Extinction Rebellion, the model is still thriving. I Saw It First is clear about its pitch, promising that \u201ctrend-led customer can always finds something new to be obsessed with\u201d. \u201cYoung shoppers especially still want to keep up with trends and desire newness, and because retailers such as I Saw It First and Boohoo sell clothes at such low prices that will often go out of fashion quickly, it makes it easy for shoppers to purchase frequently,\u201d continues Salter. However, she says, if these shoppers do start to shun less-sustainable retailers these online brands will find themselves in the firing line.",

The IFAB\u2019s excellently intelligible and unambiguous handball interpretation strikes again soon after the hour mark. Nikolai Topor-Stanley, of Ernie Merrick zimmer frame fame, leaps to contest a header against Harrison Delbridge and the ball pings off the latter\u2019s head into Topor-Stanley\u2019s outstretched arm. Play is soon called back for a VAR review and the pressure is on Kate Jacewicz in her A-League debut to make the call on whether the incident constitutes a penalty. There\u2019s no question the centre-back has made himself unnaturally bigger but how he could possibly have anticipated that contact from such close range is is beyond me. Also, how one is supposed to jump without raising one\u2019s arms presents another conundrum, and a 34-year-old at that. If you have scoured IFAB\u2019s rule book you\u2019ll know this point matters not, for a player can be penalised for an unintentional handball. And thus, Jacewicz\u2019s hands are tied by FIFA and she points to the spot, from which Jamie Maclaren converts for his 13th goal of the season. It\u2019s a long way back for the Jets, and a shame given Topor-Stanley\u2019s gutsy, grunty marshalling from the back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOXFOOTBALL/status/1218472955543375874\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The VAR brings us back to this moment, and it&#39;s not good for Newcastle. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MCYvNEW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MCYvNEW</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ALeague?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ALeague</a><br><br>\ud83d\udcfa Watch LIVE on Fox Sports 505<br><br>\ud83d\udcdd FOLLOW LIVE: <a href=\"https://t.co/AQPFqKLqlH\">https://t.co/AQPFqKLqlH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/JQGghmGNv0\">pic.twitter.com/JQGghmGNv0</a></p>&mdash; FOX Sports Football (@FOXFOOTBALL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FOXFOOTBALL/status/1218472955543375874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 18, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T10:30:18.665Z\">at 10.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e22d4e78f08a6950eb44437\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-18T10:04:11.458Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Big Bash: Sydney Sixers 6-65 v Sydney Thunder:</strong></p> <p>The Sixers have not had much to say for themselves but at the very least they\u2019ve clambered over that 57-run mark to avoid breaking the record for the lowest BBL total.

      "bodyText": "Game over. The umpires have called it a night at Spotless Stadium due to the rain that has fallen intermittently throughout the evening. The Thunder win by four runs after bowling out the second-placed Sixers for less than 80 runs in 16 overs. And, sitting in sixth spot, they\u2019ll hope it breathes life into their season. They were far superior here, though, and the inclement weather provided more resistance than the Sixers\u2019 top order, which lurched from calamity to catastrophe and will be tough viewing come Monday. That\u2019s all from me. Join us again tomorrow, when the Hobart Hurricanes kick off the Sunday sport action against the Brisbane Strikers. Big Bash 6th over: Sydney Thunder 2-28 (Callum Ferguson 8, Sams 5) v Sydney Sixers 76 (15.5/16) And the covers are back on again. Big Bash 4th over: Sydney Thunder 2-21 v Sydney Sixers76 (15.5/16) The Thunder need 77 from 16 overs and, after that innings, their only enemy is probably going to be the weather. Or Silk, whose catch sends Alex Hales walking for a duck and 1-1 (also Jackson Bird\u2019s statistics). Now Usman Khawaja is caught off the outside edge to first slip Hughes. Bowled by Curran. Bizarrely, almost absurdly, the Sixers could still be in this. The Jets\u2019 winless run is now at seven. It has to be said their second half had more impetus but that will mean little to caretaker Craig Deans. Rock bottom is a lonely place to be. City, conversely, cut back the deficit on leaders Sydney FC to eight points. Dowie strikes again thanks to a smart team move, her brace sandwiching a second-half Rosie Sutton tap-in, and Victory make it three consecutive wins for a place in the top four. A-League 76th minute: Melbourne City 2-0 Newcastle Controversy! The IFAB\u2019s excellently intelligible and unambiguous handball interpretation strikes again soon after the hour mark. Nikolai Topor-Stanley, of Ernie Merrick zimmer frame fame, leaps to contest a header against Harrison Delbridge and the ball pings off the latter\u2019s head into Topor-Stanley\u2019s outstretched arm. Play is soon called back for a VAR review and the pressure is on Kate Jacewicz in her A-League debut to make the call on whether the incident constitutes a penalty. There\u2019s no question the centre-back has made himself unnaturally bigger but how he could possibly have anticipated that contact from such close range is is beyond me. Also, how one is supposed to jump without raising one\u2019s arms presents another conundrum, and a 34-year-old at that. If you have scoured IFAB\u2019s rule book you\u2019ll know this point matters not, for a player can be penalised for an unintentional handball. And thus, Jacewicz\u2019s hands are tied by FIFA and she points to the spot, from which Jamie Maclaren converts for his 13th goal of the season. It\u2019s a long way back for the Jets, and a shame given Topor-Stanley\u2019s gutsy, grunty marshalling from the back. Big Bash: Sydney Sixers 6-65 v Sydney Thunder: The Sixers have not had much to say for themselves but at the very least they\u2019ve clambered over that 57-run mark to avoid breaking the record for the lowest BBL total. A moustached Ben Dwarshuis, who is attempting his strongest impression of Freddie Mercury, swings. It\u2019s not clean, but it\u2019ll do the trick for a boundary to reach 6-58. Then Justin Avendano hits one for six. The Sixers have, however, set another unenviable record with the lowest score at the fall of the fifth wicket in the competition\u2019s history, following Silk\u2019s dismissal on 15 runs. Big Bash 6th over: Sydney Sixers 5-16 (Justin Avendano 0, Curran 0) v Sydney Thunder: The covers (down to 16 overs now) are off and the dismembering is back under way as James Vince is caught at mid-on. It\u2019s Justin Avendano\u2019s turn to head to the gallows - sorry, crease - and finally Jordan Silk smacks a boundary - the Sixers\u2019 first of the evening one full hour after the scheduled start time. If you thought that was a positive omen, think again. Minutes later Silk is caught (Khawaja) and bowled (Sams). That\u2019s now three Thunder bowlers who have a wicket off the first ball of their spell tonight in Sandhu, Doggett and Sams. More importantly, though, is the lowest BBL score of 57 under threat? One might assume the Sixers, now onto their allrounders, might go down swinging and shanking. W-League: Adelaide United 0-1 Melbourne Victory The visitors have the early ascendancy via Natasha Dowie. Adelaide have been responsible for some promising attacking passages but the final ball has been lacking for the hosts. Can\u2019t say the same about Dowie ... A-League: Melbourne City 1-0 Newcastle We have a GOAL from Craig Noone. Jamie Maclaren sweeps up the field on the counter following a Jets corner and crossed for Noone who, having missed a chance minutes earlier, didn\u2019t need asking twice. That\u2019s a peach from the Englishman, who now has his first back-to-back A-League goals following last week\u2019s effort against Brisbane. Big Bash: Sydney Sixers 3-6 (James Vince 2, Jordan Silk 0) v Sydney Thunder: What were we saying about Henriques? The Sixers must have thought the cavalry was coming to right their incredibly wobbly ship but Morris has something to say about that with a steep delivery that has the skipper caught behind. That goes down just in time for another rain delay, much to the frustrations of the crown at Spotless Stadium. The umbrellas aren\u2019t exactly up - it\u2019s light drizzle at most, but officials are playing it very safe. It appears we could be reducing the match to 18 overs. W-League: Adelaide United are under way against Melbourne Victory at Marden Sports Complex, and Natasha Dowie and Laura Brock (nee Alleway) are already having a crack at the Reds\u2019 goal. A-League: Melbourne City are about to kick off against Newcastle Jets at AAMI Park and will hope they can follow the example set by their W-League counterparts, who dismantled the Jets 2-0 and have now cracked 500 minutes without conceding a goal. Remember Kate Jacewicz is about to make history as the first female to referee an A-League match. Big Bash: 2nd over: Sydney Sixers 2-1 v Sydney Thunder Josh Philippe is gone as well and this is a nightmare start for the Sixers. It\u2019s a plum LBW from Gurinder Sandhu on his first ball. The men in magenta need a big performance from Moises Henriques, who is now in with James Vince. Or will be after the rain delay. And here\u2019s that fancy footwork from Morris ... Cheerio Scott and evening all. Well, the Stars are still enjoying the view from the top of the BBL ladder after claiming an eighth win on the hop. They had some help from Nic Maddinson, who took three wickets defending a paltry score of 6-141. The poor Scorchers did their bit too, wilting under the pressure to finish 9-131. Stars captain Glenn Maxwell was the, ahem, star of the show, taking risks in the field and a very nice catch. As we speak, Sydney Thunder have won the bat flip and elected to bowl. And bloody hell, Daniel Hughes has just been run out for a duck four minutes in after Chris Morris kicked the ball into the stumps. And that is all from me. Emma Kemp will take over from here. And there\u2019s plenty on. Over to you, Emma. The world No 1 has broken her WTA duck on home soil. Barty holds her serve to love as Yastremska hits long. The Australian was pushed in the second set but the title is hers. Onwards and upwards to the Australian Open. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: Ash Barty 6-2, 7-5 Dayana Yastremska Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 6-5 Dayana Yastremska That may well have been Yastremska\u2019s chance. Barty, like the great player she is, senses an opportunity and breaks her opponent\u2019s serve. She\u2019s now serving for the match. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 5-5 Dayana Yastremska Barty avoids the perilous dropped serve at 4-5 to restore parity to the game score. That might\u2019ve been Yastremska\u2019s chance. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 4-5 Dayana Yastremska Barty earns a break point but a sizzling ace down the line takes the game back to deuce. And Yastremska holds her nerve, forcing a backhand error from Barty to take the game. A break here, and the second set is hers. A-League: GOAL! Brisbane Roar 1-0 Wellington (Wenzel-Halls, 69\u2019) The deadlock is finally broken at Suncorp. Keep this up, and you might say the Roar are officially in form. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 4-4 Dayana Yastremska The Ukranian pushes Barty all the way but can\u2019t capitalise on two break points, hitting long both times, as Barty holds serve. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 3-4 Dayana Yastremska Games go to serve again and, dare I say it, Barty finally has a game on her hands. Big Bash: 13th over: Perth Scorchers 83-3 (Bancroft 29, Patterson 7) v Melbourne Stars 141-6 Marsh departs to a run-out, and though it isn\u2019t panic stations it\u2019s unlikely the Scorchers will get home here with overs and overs to spare. Bancroft is playing a nice, controlled innings. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 2-3 Dayana Yastremska That is much more like it from Yastremska, who finally breaks Barty\u2019s serve and has now won three games on the bounce. The Ukranian is definitely growing in confidence, moving more fluidly around the court and actually trying to take the game to Barty. A break each, this set is now effectively going to serve. W-League: GOAL: Melbourne City 2-0 Newcastle (van Egmond, 50\u2019) City finally get their (richly deserved) second goal, van Egmond beating the keeper to the left to double the lead. Stott\u2019s hard work set it all up. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 2-1 Dayana Yastremska Games to to serve after the opening game of the second set, but Barty remains in the box seat after breaking Yastremska. The Ukranian does look to be relaxing a little, hitting a couple of winners, but she has it all to do. Big Bash: 9th over: Perth Scorchers 62-2 (Bancroft 17, Marsh 11) v Melbourne Stars 141-6 I haven\u2019t really been watching, but I presume Livingstone is on his way. Sorry, I couldn\u2019t resist. This MCG pitch perhaps isn\u2019t quite the paradise it seemed, and the Scorchers are hardly careering towards the victory target, but only two down they are keeping the required run-rate in check. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 2nd set: Ash Barty 6-2, 1-0 Dayana Yastremska Another laboured service game from the Ukranian teen, with Barty claiming the game on her fifth break point. The Australian is playing fluent, controlled tennis. By contrast, Yastremska looks rushed and, at the same time, hesitant. Errors galore. Barty\u2019s in her head. W-League: HT: Melbourne City 1-0 Newcastle A-League: HT: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Wellington Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 1st set: Ash Barty 6-2 Dayana Yastremska That was rather easy, now wasn\u2019t it?! Barty strolls through her service game to take the first set against an opponent who is battling away but looking outclassed. The world No 1 is now one set away from her maiden WTA title in Australia. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 1st set: Ash Barty 5-2 Dayana Yastremska Barty continues to trouble Yastremska\u2019s serve, taking this game to deuce five times before before breaking on the second break point to underline her dominance and superiority. The Australian will now serve for the first set. Big Bash: 3rd over: Perth Scorchers 17-1 (Livingstone 3, Bancroft 1) v Melbourne Stars 141-6 An early strike for the Stars, with Inglis playing on to Worrall for 12. They\u2019ll take that, knowing their chances of victory likely hinge on their ability to dismiss 10 Scorchers batsmen. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 1st set: Ash Barty 3-2 Dayana Yastremska Barty holds her serve, easily, and has Yastremska in difficuly at 30-40 before a ripping backhand winner from the Ukranian forces deuce. An ace and an error from Barty hands Yastremska the game, but the world No 1 still holds sway with that break in the third game. Big Bash: 1st over: Perth Scorchers 7-0 (Inglis 4, Livingstone 3) v Melbourne Stars 141-6 A solid, unspectacular start from the Scorchers. Keep being solid and unspectacular, and they\u2019ll win this game. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 1st set: Ash Barty 2-1 Dayana Yastremska An early break for Barty, who works her opponent around the court, applying pressure, which ultimately leads to Yastremska hitting long on the final point of the game. The Ukranian failed to win a point off her own serve. Adelaide International: Women\u2019s singles final: 1st set: Ash Barty 1-1 Dayana Yastremska A bloodless opening service game to the Ukranian and Barty follows suit as the first set follows serve in the early exchanges. A-League: 22 mins: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Wellington No goals yet at Suncorp but a few chances and a couple of yellow cards, with Sotirio and Steinmann going into the ref\u2019s book. W-League: GOAL! Melbourne City 1-0 Newcastle (Mijatovic, 7\u2019) The ladder, the formbook, and sanity in general says this will be a stroll for City. And exactly what they wanted, an early goal, is theirs with Mijatovic latching onto a Simon cross and curling it into the top-right corner. Big Bash: 20 overs: Melbourne Stars 141-6 (Cartwright 58, Hinchliffe 1) v Perth Scorchers In truth, the Stars innings never seemed to get going so plaudits to Cartwright for keeping the whole thing from bursting at the seams. Nobody ever knows, of course, how good a total is until the reply is issued, but the impression is that this is shy of the mark. The Scorchers wouldn\u2019t need to bat out of their skins to take the points. Big Bash: 18th over: Melbourne Stars 121-4 (Cartwright 52, Larkin 16) v Perth Scorchers Cartwright, going at a run a ball, brings up his half-century and the Stars are doing their best to get to what they hope is a par score. But even if they go at 10 an over from here, here\u2019s what Mark Waugh thinks of their probable total: I\u2019ve got the feeling it\u2019s way unders. Tennis: The men\u2019s doubles final at the Adelaide International is now a thing of the past. Gonzalez &amp; Martin were too good for Dodig &amp; Polasek, winning in straight sets to clear the path for the singles deciders. First up is Australia\u2019s Ash Barty, the world No 1, against Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska. Players aren\u2019t on the court yet, but they will be soon. A-League: The action is coming thick and fast. We\u2019re moments away from the start of the Brisbane Roar v Wellington game at Suncorp. Here\u2019s the teams: W-League: Just a few minutes away from the start of the Melbourne City v Newcastle game at AAMI Park. Here\u2019s the teams: Big Bash: 14th over: Melbourne Stars 83-4 (Cartwright 30, Larkin 2) v Perth Scorchers Well, they were going along nicely for the first time this dig, but the Stars are now back in trouble after Maxwell got himself in all sorts, improvising a scoop that doesn\u2019t get off the ground. The result? An easy catch for the keeper. When they work, these shots look wonderful. When they don\u2019t, not so much. Big Bash: 12th over: Melbourne Stars 68-3 (Cartwright 30, Maxwell 14) v Perth Scorchers The Stars, finally, start to get a wriggle on, with Maxwell doing as Maxwell does - clearing the long-on rope despite not getting anywhere near all of it - and Cartwright, who\u2019s been there long enough and whose eye is in, grabbing a few boundaries for himself. It was coming, of course, but more of the same will be needed if they\u2019re to post a competitive total. Big Bash: 8th over: Melbourne Stars 34-3 (Cartwright 12, Maxwell 0) v Perth Scorchers Marsh drops Cartwright off Fawad Ahmed\u2019s first delivery - and looks to have hurt his right hand in the process - before the spinner traps Maddinson in front, right back in the crease, and has his appeal for leg before upheld. Three down for not very many, the Stars look in some strife. Tennis: For those of you who are waiting for Ash Barty to hit the court in Adelaide, her decider against Dayana Yastremska will take place after the men\u2019s doubles final. The first set in that match has just come to a close, with Gonzalez &amp; Martin claiming a 14-12 tiebreaker against Dodig &amp; Polasek. So we\u2019re a little while away yet. Meanwhile ... Big Bash: 5th over: Melbourne Stars 27-2 (Cartwright 9, Maddinson 0) v Perth Scorchers And that good beginning by the Scorchers gets just a little bit better with Coulter-Nile attempting to up the run-rate but succeeding only in picking out Bancroft in the deep. That\u2019s two strikes for Kelly and plenty to think about now for the table toppers. Big Bash: 4th over: Melbourne Stars 23-1 (Cartwright 7, Coulter-Nile 5) v Perth Scorchers The Stars steady after that early, and untimely, loss of Stoinis, but the Scorchers will be happy with this start after losing the flip on what looks a good deck. What\u2019s that sound you hear, and hear all match, at the Big Bash? It might be deafening, it might be pervasive, for some it might be annoying, but it\u2019s all about one word: entertainment. And plenty of thought goes into it. Check out this great yarn by Jonathan Howcroft about the importance cricket places on putting on a \u201cdamn good show\u201d. Big Bash: 2nd over: Melbourne Stars 10-1 (Cartwright 1, Coulter-Nile 1) v Perth Scorchers A relatively tame beginning to this match. Well, tame until, in the space of two balls, Stoinis hoicks Kelly over the deep square rope - just clearing the fielder - for six before finishing his brief stay in the middle courtesy of a catch at extra cover. Oddly, the initial call was not out but the man upstairs, with the benefit of time and replays, deemed no bump ball. And the BBL\u2019s leading scorer is on his way for six. Tennis: The Hobart International final has already been run and won. And, as AAP reports below, a young woman with plenty of upside is the event\u2019s new champion. Rising star Elena Rybakina has taken out the Hobart International with a 7-6 (9-7) 6-3 win over China\u2019s Zhang Shaui. Playing in her second WTA final from two tournament this year, the world No 30 and third seed had too much power from the back of the court. It is the second career title for Rybakina - a 20-year-old from Kazakhstan who surged up the rankings from No 191 to 37 last year. Big Bash: Melbourne Stars have won the coin flop - or is it a bat toss? - and will bat first at the \u2018G. Stars: Marcus Stoinis, Hilton Cartwright, Nic Maddinson, Glenn Maxwell (c), Seb Gotch (w), Nick Larkin, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Clint Hinchliffe, Daniel Worrall, Lance Morris, Sandeep Lamichhane. Scorchers: Liam Livingstone, Josh Inglis (w), Cameron Bancroft, Mitch Marsh (c), Kurtis Patterson, Cameron Green, Tim David, Chris Jordan, Jhye Richardson, Matthew Kelly, Fawad Ahmed What a Saturday we have in store, sports fans. Top of the bill, undoubtedly, is the Adelaide International, and Ashleigh Barty\u2019s quest to claim her first WTA title on home soil. Standing in her way from 4.30pm (AEDT) is big-hitting Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska, ranked 24 and more than capable of an upset. In the men\u2019s final this evening, Russian Andrey Rublev meets South African Lloyd Harris. The countdown to the Australian Open is very much on. In the Big Bash League, the top-of-the-table Stars host the dangerous Scorchers - what is it with the letter \u2018S\u2019 this season? These two, along with the Sixers and the Strikers, presently occupy the top four spots on the table. Yes, yes, small things, small minds etc etc - before the Sydney derby may or may not take place, given the weather. Rain! Thanks be to the mighty Lord. In the A-League, Brisbane host Wellington before Melbourne City take on Newcastle. In the W-League, City and the Jets also lock horns before Adelaide United will again chase their first win of the season at home to Melbourne Victory.

It was a concern of his when the club\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/05/saracens-docked-35-points-and-5m-fine-for-salary-cap-breach\" title=\"\">35-point deduction for breaching the Premiership\u2019s salary cap regulations</a> was activated two months ago but he now faces something equally unsettling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/17/saracens-salary-cap-premiership-relegation\">Saracens to accept second 35-point deduction and effective relegation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Saracens will almost certainly be relegated after accepting they will not be able to finish the season within the salary cap, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/17/saracens-salary-cap-premiership-relegation\" title=\"\">prompting another 35-point deduction</a> that will leave them marooned at the bottom and on course to finish with fewer points than the team immediately above them, Leicester, already have.</p> <p>The club have nine players who were part of England\u2019s World Cup squad, while Ben Earl\u2019s performances this season have made him a contender in the back row. Though the dilemma of whether to play in the Six Nations or help their club has been removed, they will all have decisions to make about their futures: spend a season in the Championship or look for another club, whether on loan or permanently, to enhance their international careers and put themselves in contention for the Lions tour to South Africa next year.</p> <p>Jones\u2019s captain last year, Owen Farrell, is one of them. He told the meeting of players at Saracens on Friday morning that he intended to stay put and invited them all to join him but it is a decision that will be left to only some of them, with the Premiership and European Cup champions needing to trim their wage bill while appreciating that the club\u2019s predicament had nothing to do with the squad.

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones names his England squad for the Six Nations on Monday and at least he does not have to fret about some of his Saracens contingent being torn between playing for their country and helping their club avoid relegation. It was a concern of his when the club\u2019s 35-point deduction for breaching the Premiership\u2019s salary cap regulations was activated two months ago but he now faces something equally unsettling. Saracens will almost certainly be relegated after accepting they will not be able to finish the season within the salary cap, prompting another 35-point deduction that will leave them marooned at the bottom and on course to finish with fewer points than the team immediately above them, Leicester, already have. The club have nine players who were part of England\u2019s World Cup squad, while Ben Earl\u2019s performances this season have made him a contender in the back row. Though the dilemma of whether to play in the Six Nations or help their club has been removed, they will all have decisions to make about their futures: spend a season in the Championship or look for another club, whether on loan or permanently, to enhance their international careers and put themselves in contention for the Lions tour to South Africa next year. Jones\u2019s captain last year, Owen Farrell, is one of them. He told the meeting of players at Saracens on Friday morning that he intended to stay put and invited them all to join him but it is a decision that will be left to only some of them, with the Premiership and European Cup champions needing to trim their wage bill while appreciating that the club\u2019s predicament had nothing to do with the squad. Their income will drop appreciably in the Championship, with the parachute payment not covering 25% of their inflated wage bill, and, were they to top the second tier, promotion would be confirmed only if they demonstrated within 30 days of doing so that they would not exceed the salary cap for the 2021-22 season. Jones will not want players to be distracted by their club futures at a time when sides look to settle their squads for the following season needing them to focus on a different cap, but the core of his side is based on Saracens: Farrell, Maro Itoje, the Vunipola brothers and Jamie George. Elliot Daly has become a mainstay and Ben Spencer is an option at scrum-half, with the two World Cup No 9s, Ben Youngs and Will Heinz, in their thirties. That leaves George Kruis, who has been linked with a move to Japan, and the national side\u2019s third-choice hooker, Jack Singleton.

      "bodyText": "From gold-patterned wallpaper and velvet upholstery to peacock feather fabric, there is barely a corner of Leith Clark\u2019s glamorous Victorian house that isn\u2019t filled with rich, dramatic shades. The hallway is papered in dark floral blooms, inspired by the cracked canvases of Dutch masters; the dining room has bold gold-and-black wallpaper and shimmering brass cupboards, giving the room the feel of a jewellery box; and the master bedroom has a decadent De Gournay decorative wallpaper. A pale grey living space \u2013 the most \u201ccalming\u201d room \u2013 is the closest this house comes to neutral. Canadian-born Clark, a fashion stylist, and her partner James Hatt, a production designer who did a lot of the carpentry in the house, moved in five years ago; they have a daughter, Astrid, four. A style director-at-large on Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK, Clark founded the fashion magazines Lula and Violet Book; private clients include actors Keira Knightley, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Zoe Kazan. She and Hatt stripped out the interiors, and reconfigured the layout, reducing five bedrooms to four: a former dining room on the lower ground floor was converted into a study, and they moved the dining room to the ground floor, next to the living room. The couple laid parquet flooring throughout and added a kitchen extension, with pale green Shaker cabinets. Liberty London\u2019s tropical leaf wallpaper, the most modest paper in the house, lines one wall. Black painted stairs sweep up the house, with a blush pink runner, and family portraits (including one of Astrid wearing a vintage Dior coat) form a gallery along one wall. In the dining room, Queen Anne Ebony paper from riflepaperco.com (now out of stock) provides a dramatic backdrop to gilt-framed oil paintings, black skirting boards and picture rails. Old-fashioned flourishes include a turntable and a drinks trolley. The brass-fronted cupboards are designed by Hatt, as are the built-in wardrobes upstairs. The living room is painted mid-grey, which contrasts with a pair of velvet green sofas, and an armchair upholstered in purple velvet. A jukebox stands in one corner, and art books and pictures sit either side of a Victorian fireplace. In the master bedroom, a panel of De Gournay\u2019s romantic Chinoiserie Portobello wallpaper lines the wall opposite the bed and the back of the door. \u201cI became obsessed with it when I worked on a Chanel ad,\u201d Clark says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite things in the house.\u201d Another wall is painted dark grey, and a \u201cfloating\u201d bookcase sits by the bed, housing a column of books. Off the master bedroom is a dressing room with floor-to-ceiling wardrobes, the doors upholstered in iridescent vintage Liberty Hera peacock feather fabric, which Clark found at Kempton market (held at Kempton Park racecourse, in Surrey). A shoe cupboard with a glazed door displays the footwear as if in a gallery. Antique french doors from a salvage yard open on to a bathroom, painted dusky pink and with a mirror-tiled wall. Clark is inspired by nature. \u201cI feel very at home among it,\u201d she says. \u201cI live near woods, where I walk all the time, and a nature reserve, which is filled with overgrown vegetation and moss.\u201d From feathers to birds, flowers to foliage, she has brought the drama and beauty of nature inside and made it sing.",

Then he goes to Spain and meets the bullfighters (you get the picture), as well as the border guards for the 11km wall that divides the Spanish coast from Morocco (etc).</p> <p>The same message recurs throughout Euroland, from country to country and weird tradition to weird tradition: there is a boost in populism on the continent because most far-right parties offer something that could feasibly be described as \u201caggressive status quo\u201d and they win a lot of votes based on that, and that they happen to tack on virulent anti-immigration rhetoric in with it is neither here nor there to most voters.</p> <p>If Balls made this discovery, say \u2013 and I\u2019m spitballing \u2013 when he was part of a Labour party that could have done something about it, rather than now when he\u2019s the man who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czqtjk_iGFU\">came sixth on Strictly</a> once, maybe the whole endeavour would feel less redundant.

The same message recurs throughout Euroland, from country to country and weird tradition to weird tradition: there is a boost in populism on the continent because most far-right parties offer something that could feasibly be described as \u201caggressive status quo\u201d and they win a lot of votes based on that, and that they happen to tack on virulent anti-immigration rhetoric in with it is neither here nor there to most voters. If Balls made this discovery, say \u2013 and I\u2019m spitballing \u2013 when he was part of a Labour party that could have done something about it, rather than now when he\u2019s the man who came sixth on Strictly once, maybe the whole endeavour would feel less redundant. I\u2019m not saying Labour should have come out absolutely swinging in favour of that cheese-rolling tournament they have in Gloucester every year, or gone to the debates with the message \u201cMake Lewes Bonfire Night Great Again Or At Least Keep It Exactly As Great As It Is\u201d. But I am saying that, based on evidence gleaned from watching Ed Balls jumping into the sea with some cheerful Dutch lads who love fish and have some incredibly iffy ideas about the role Muslims play in society, it probably would have won them a lot of votes.",

Among the 70 treatments, the focus is on rheumatology, urology and dry-eye syndrome (common in our screen-led world), and each therapy is a no-nonsense bargain. A 15-minute paraffin session is \u00a33.50 and eye rinsing with thermal aerosols \u00a33; but a peat enema is an eye-watering \u00a312.

Treatments use ozokeritotherapy (intense heat wraps) and soothing organic mud, and extend to the endearingly titled \u201cmagnetic stimulation of pelvic organs\u201d and \u201clife without gout\u201d.

The 15 thermal springs, named after deities including Diana and Neptune, were equally beloved of the Hapsburgs, who added splendid rococo lodges. Soviet health-seekers also adored the sulphur-rich waters, and added the giant concrete blocks that today house much of the resort accommodation. The <strong>Grand Hotel Minerva</strong> offers an affordably classy blowout.

Even modern resorts like Chale Graal offer ancient treatments such as speleotherapy (sitting in a salt cave to extract moisture from lungs) and hirudotherapy (leeches to you and me).

The Banjisht resort still majors in fangotherapy (where thermal mud pulls out toxins as it dries). There\u2019s also electrotherapy to cure muscle spasms and increase circulation. Nowadays a beauty and wellness department assists with 21st-century treatments including waxing, detox baths, fruit facials and teen facials (to treat blackheads and whiteheads). Nice.

Spa Dudince, in the south close to the Hungarian border, offers the best of all three. Its thermal springs, which mirror the famed life-enhancing properties of Vichy in France, are partnered by 70 procedures ranging from underwater massages to peat baths. Outside, a water park offers an Iceland-style mix of mineral bathing, jet pools and slides, alongside giant chess, volleyball and summertime animation for kids.

      "bodyText": "Cieplice, Poland For 800 years the waters around Cieplice have treated the cream of central European society as well as US ambassador (later president) John Quincy Adams. Such folk demanded frescoed dining salons, broad parks and splendid swimming pools, all of which remain. Cieplice has low-mineralized, fluoride-silicon thermal springs (up to 90C). Among the 70 treatments, the focus is on rheumatology, urology and dry-eye syndrome (common in our screen-led world), and each therapy is a no-nonsense bargain. A 15-minute paraffin session is \u00a33.50 and eye rinsing with thermal aerosols \u00a33; but a peat enema is an eye-watering \u00a312. Recover at the Ceiplice Aquapark (\u00a37), with outdoor jacuzzis, lazy rapids and waterslide. \u2022 From \u00a3266pp for a week in a double room including three treatments a day, full-board, uzdrowisko-cieplice.pl Karlova Stud\u00e1nka, Czech Republic The Hapsburgs filled this Alpine valley with hunting lodges, log cabins and saunas. The spa resort at Karlova Stud\u00e1nka, near the Polish border, occupies the entire village. Treatments include peat wraps (\u00a311) and magnet therapy (\u00a310), designed to boost blood circulation, plus additive and pearl baths, whirlpool hydromassage and reflexology. The surrounding Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountains are a sylvan wilderness. Two cycle routes (ebikes available) and a long-distance hiking trail run to the B\u00edl\u00e1 Opava waterfalls. \u2022 \u00a3125pp including private spa, sparkling wines, massage treatments and two nights\u2019 half-board accommodation with three -course dinner,, horskelazne.cz Sanitorium Ozerny, Belarus Some Belarussian sanatoriums feel like they\u2019re back in the USSR, but Ozerny, on the shores of Lake Beloe near the Lithuanian border, isn\u2019t like that: it even has an indoor aquapark and a summer pedalo fleet. Treatments use ozokeritotherapy (intense heat wraps) and soothing organic mud, and extend to the endearingly titled \u201cmagnetic stimulation of pelvic organs\u201d and \u201clife without gout\u201d. Visa-free travel makes it easy for EU spa tourists to visit this spot 20 miles from handsome Grodno city, and couple of hours on the train from Bia\u0142ystok in Poland. \u2022 From around \u00a350 a day for the basic programme, extra massage \u00a37; honey or cranberry wrap around \u00a315, ozerny.by Baile Herculane, Romania The Romans put the life-giving waters of Baile Herculane on the map. The 15 thermal springs, named after deities including Diana and Neptune, were equally beloved of the Hapsburgs, who added splendid rococo lodges. Soviet health-seekers also adored the sulphur-rich waters, and added the giant concrete blocks that today house much of the resort accommodation. The Grand Hotel Minerva offers an affordably classy blowout. Inflammatory, spinal and neurological conditions can be soothed by ozone therapy, magnet therapy and herbal plant baths, as well as complimentary access to thermal pools and saunas for all package guests. \u2022 \u00a3258pp for a five-night (Sunday to Friday) half-board package, including four daily therapeutic procedures such as massages, mud packs and thermal wraps, hotelminerva.ro Truskavets, Ukraine The benefits of Truskavets, near Lviv, were first prescribed by a Polish doctor in 1578. Empires from Austro-Hungarian to Soviet later basked in waters rich in sodium, sulphur and more. Truskavets is one of the few spas that encourage visitors to actually drink the stuff. Even modern resorts like Chale Graal offer ancient treatments such as speleotherapy (sitting in a salt cave to extract moisture from lungs) and hirudotherapy (leeches to you and me). Modern treatments like computer-aided spinal traction, to slowly unlock the vertebrae, are also offered. \u2022 \u00a3161pp for seven-day package including consultations, mineral baths and colonic hydrotherapy session, chalegraal.com B\u00fckf\u00fcrd\u0151, Hungary Hungary is Europe\u2019s hot spring champion. Life, love and leisure revolve around its 1,300 thermal spas, and visitors can choose to soak in the glitzy (Budapest\u2019s Gell\u00e9rt baths) or the rural (H\u00e9viz, a massive thermal lake) or opt for sulphurous, salty or carbonic waters. B\u00fckf\u00fcrd\u0151, near the Austrian border, was discovered in 1957 when oil prospectors unleashed a 70-metre geyser of potassium- and calcium-rich waters instead. The resort is large and family-friendly, with some 30 pools, plus lots of saunas (Finnish rock, herbal cabin) and slides, plus mobile homes and a campsite. A 25-minute goat milk mud bath costs \u20ac22, an hour\u2019s wellness massage \u20ac41. The resort is particularly strong on osteoporosis regeneration. \u2022 \u20ac155pp for a seven-night package, including 10 traditional treatments and unlimited spa access (but not accommodation), plus \u20ac74 for seven-day entry ticket, bukfurdo.hu Banjisht, North Macedonia From an aquifer high on the Albanian-Macedonia border, 39C water bubbles up alive with minerals. People have sought healing here for centuries, and in the 1970s scientists designated it one of Europe\u2019s most healing spas. The Banjisht resort still majors in fangotherapy (where thermal mud pulls out toxins as it dries). There\u2019s also electrotherapy to cure muscle spasms and increase circulation. Nowadays a beauty and wellness department assists with 21st-century treatments including waxing, detox baths, fruit facials and teen facials (to treat blackheads and whiteheads). Nice. The rambling resort hotel is ringed with trees that thrive in a sun-blessed microclimate. \u2022 \u00a3122pp for four-night package, including several daily treatments and all meals, bdcapa.com Spa Dudince, Slovakia Slovakia hosts 21 thermal resorts. These range from rococo classics (such as Bardejov) to medical spas (Brusno) and family-friendly aquaparks for snow and sunshine frolics (Thermal Corvinus). Spa Dudince, in the south close to the Hungarian border, offers the best of all three. Its thermal springs, which mirror the famed life-enhancing properties of Vichy in France, are partnered by 70 procedures ranging from underwater massages to peat baths. Outside, a water park offers an Iceland-style mix of mineral bathing, jet pools and slides, alongside giant chess, volleyball and summertime animation for kids. The resort also offers bike hire for jaunts into the surrounding Stredoslovensk\u00e1 wine region. \u2022 A Medical Silver stay costs \u20ac52 a night (four-night minimum) half-board with two treatments and use of the pool, kupeledudince.sk Istarske Toplice, Croatia Istarske Toplice is the ne plus ultra of Croatian thermal spas, just outside the truffle\u2019n\u2019booze capital of Motovun. These waters have been soothing rheumatic joints since Roman times. Istarske Toplice is big on hot water bathing, inhalation and 40C curative mud \u2013 helpful for lung and skin complaints.

      "body": "<p>Author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/25/jacqueline-woodson-national-book-awards-invisible\" title=\"\">Jacqueline Woodson</a> lives in a quintessential Brooklyn brownstone with her partner, two children, a cat and two huge, friendly dogs. A similar house is at the centre of her new novel, <em>Red at the Bone</em>, representing the struggle of a multigenerational black family to honour its past and stand firm against change.</p> <p>The novel opens in 2001, as 16-year-old Melody descends the stairs in a debutante\u2019s traditional white dress. An orchestra is playing the Prince song she\u2019s insisted on, against her mother\u2019s wishes, while white passersby stop and gawk through the windows. Her coming-of-age party is a declaration of family pride, class status, and an effort to repair a broken link with the past, when Melody\u2019s mother, Iris, skipped her own ceremony after becoming pregnant at 15. The novel explores this rift and its consequences over time, shifting between the perspectives of different family members and offering unusual narrative freedom for Woodson, who writes primarily for younger readers. \u201cWith adults, you can play around with time,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI have a much larger canvas.\u201d</p> <p><em>Red at the Bone </em>is Woodson\u2019s second novel for adults, following 2016\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/19/another-brooklyn-jacqueline-woodson-review\" title=\"\">Another Brooklyn</a></em> as well as her widely praised 2014 memoir-in-poems, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/24/lemony-snicket-author-110000-apology-racist-remarks\" title=\"\">Brown Girl Dreaming</a></em>, which won the prestigious National Book Award for young people\u2019s literature. That genre-tweaking bestseller brought to life Woodson\u2019s early childhood, moving from her birthplace of Ohio in 1963, to South Carolina later in the 1960s amid the fierce battles of the civil rights movement, to Brooklyn, where the author has spent most of her life since.</p> <p><em>Brown Girl Dreaming</em> expanded Woodson\u2019s audience. She had already written more than 30 books for young readers, winning numerous awards including, in 2018, the Astrid Lindgren memorial prize, which she\u2019s using to fund an arts organisation supporting early-career writers of colour. Since the publication of her first book in 1990, Woodson has been tireless in arguing the need to diversify the predominantly white publishing industry and for children\u2019s literature to better reflect the lives and identities of its readers. Balancing writing with advocacy, she has recently served as the US young people\u2019s poet laureate and the national ambassador for young people\u2019s literature, and counts Judy Blume and the Obamas among her many fans. She is clearly not a writer who feels hemmed in by genre \u2013 her next projects include a novel for readers aged eight to 12, several articles, a screenplay adaptation of <em>Red at the Bone</em>, a television project and a book of non-fiction. She doesn\u2019t choose the format ahead of time. Instead, she says, \u201cthe story dictates\u201d who the audience will be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I\u2019m writing something poetic and the voice feels young, it\u2019s going to be a picture book</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI know when I\u2019m writing something poetic and the voice feels young, it\u2019s going to be a picture book,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf there\u2019s an immediacy to it, I know it\u2019s probably going to be for middle graders. If there\u2019s a spareness to it, I know it\u2019s probably young adult or adult, because there\u2019s a lot more that older people can infer.\u201d</p> <p>All of her books place black children and teenagers at the centre of their own stories, and even in her adult fiction she writes young characters with deep respect and sensitivity. It\u2019s common to describe a children\u2019s author who produces a book for adults as having \u201cdeveloped\u201d or matured in some way, but Woodson believes it\u2019s much harder for adult authors to write well for children than the other way round.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of adults want to forget that period, or have forgotten it, so when they come back to writing for children, it becomes didactic,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t remember that as a young reader, you didn\u2019t want to read to learn, you wanted to read to escape.\u201d</p> <p>Those dismissive attitudes to children\u2019s literature are connected, Woodson believes, to the many ways that young people are overlooked and misjudged by society at large. Teenage boys, especially boys of colour, may be the most misjudged of all, which is one reason why, in <em>Red at the Bone</em>, which explores Iris\u2019s pregnancy, Woodson chose to slant her narrative toward the perspective of Aubrey, the sensitive, overwhelmed young father. Raised in poverty by a single mother, and moving often between shabby apartments, Aubrey is in awe of Iris\u2019s confidence. But it\u2019s not until he sees inside her home, with its \u201cupright piano beneath framed portraits of ancient family members\u201d that he becomes conscious of the class divide between them.</p> <p>\u201cI really wanted to write against that stereotype of the macho guy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much of what becomes toxic in masculinity is that young men aren\u2019t allowed to talk about the fear of their first sexual encounter, or the pain of it, or so often the reluctance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92ac1067b9e764c122624fe59a33e9b2ce2689f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92ac1067b9e764c122624fe59a33e9b2ce2689f1/0_218_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I feel like I could write about Brooklyn for the next 50 years, and I\u2019ll write a different story every time.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I feel like I could write about Brooklyn for the next 50 years, and I\u2019ll write a different story every time.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kathy Willens/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the mother of a pre-teenage son, she was particularly keen to represent those unspoken emotions honestly. But her interest in Aubrey\u2019s point of view doesn\u2019t overshadow her empathy for Iris, the young mother who finds the responsibility of family suffocating and escapes to college, where she is free to rediscover and reinvent herself.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to make her a villain, because I think that\u2019s my instinct in thinking about what kind of mom would want to leave her child,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when you really start excavating it, you see that all kinds of mothers do \u2013 regardless of economic class, regardless of race. Someone who gets pregnant at 15, who\u2019s not even out of childhood herself, of course it makes sense that she changed her mind.\u201d Just as with Aubrey, Woodson\u2019s interest in writing Iris\u2019s story lay in subverting expectations and avoiding easy judgments.</p> <p>Another constant in her fiction for all ages is her fascination with the diverse and ever-changing New York borough that she has called home since the 70s. Like Aubrey, Woodson grew up in Bushwick, a mostly black and Latino neighbourhood at the time, which has since gentrified visibly: \u201cThe block I grew up on is now predominantly white.\u201d</p> <p>The dedication in her novel <em>Another Brooklyn</em> is: \u201cFor Bushwick (1970\u20131990) In Memory\u201d, marking the loss of people and culture that occurs when the hipsters and the money move in. Woodson recalls her own struggles to rent an apartment as an adult in the 90s, repeatedly being told that somewhere was no longer available. \u201cLandlords were saying: \u2018Don\u2019t rent to black folks, don\u2019t rent to queer folks, don\u2019t rent to single moms.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Yet Brooklyn\u2019s density and variety are what make it easy to bring characters, like Iris and Aubrey, together across a class divide and to investigate what unites and separates them. \u201cI think the thing that\u2019s so interesting about Brooklyn is that you can walk 10 blocks and be in a very different neighbourhood ethnically, in terms of economic class, even in terms of architecture,\u201d Woodson says. \u201cI feel like I could write about Brooklyn for the next 50 years, and I\u2019ll write a different story every time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think the further we get away from 9/11, the more it becomes this theoretical thing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The story of Iris and Aubrey\u2019s reluctantly intertwined families shows how class is connected to the larger history of race in the US, and the exclusions and reversals that have historically undermined black prosperity. Following the civil war and the abolition of slavery, many African Americans who managed to join the middle class struggled to hold on to their wealth or pass it down to future generations \u2013 especially in the face of rising discrimination and violence in the early 20th century. These legacies of loss, Woodson suggests, affect what\u2019s possible for their descendants. Aubrey\u2019s mother is a hardworking, educated woman who nonetheless remains trapped in poverty, while Iris\u2019s family is more financially secure, yet haunted by the destruction of its property in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/02/duncancampbell\" title=\"\">Tulsa</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/02/duncancampbell\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/02/duncancampbell\" title=\"\">riots of 1921</a>. Over the course of 24 hours, a wealthy black neighbourhood was attacked, looted and set alight by a white mob, a wholesale spree of destruction that claimed between 100 and 300 lives, and whose perpetrators faced no consequences of any kind.</p> <p>Woodson thinks it a \u201ctravesty\u201d that the history and impact of the Tulsa massacre are not more widely taught in American schools. She didn\u2019t learn about it herself until she was in her 20s, \u201cand then I was mad\u201d, she says. \u201cHow could it not be written down? When I have questions, they usually become novels.\u201d Accordingly, the violence becomes a powerful origin story for Iris\u2019s family, and especially for her mother Sabe, who insists on repeating the story to her daughter and granddaughter as a way of teaching them to protect what\u2019s theirs. <em>Red at the Bone</em>\u2019s dedication is a fragment of poetry, \u201cfor the ancestors, a long long line / of you, bending and twisting / bending and twisting.\u201d It describes the contortions necessary for survival, but also the length and strength of a family story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f5981b022fa952aba7ecab9d645c07d8c61906b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f5981b022fa952aba7ecab9d645c07d8c61906b/0_139_2760_1656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A New York City firefighter calls for more rescue workers in the rubble of the World Trade Center, September 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A New York City firefighter calls for more rescue workers in the rubble of the World Trade Center, September 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Preston Keres/US Navy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other major historical event that shapes the novel is 9/11, one that has also been vulnerable to distortion and myth-making. It\u2019s important for Woodson that the memory of the attacks includes the victims who were not white-collar workers or emergency responders but \u201cthe janitors, the secretaries, the people working in the kitchens\u201d who often came from communities of colour, and whose losses tend to be overlooked. \u201cI think the further we get away from 9/11, the more it becomes this theoretical thing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe remember the planes hitting the buildings, but do we remember the photos everywhere you went: \u2018Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my husband? Have you seen my child?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Woodson herself was on a book tour in Pennsylvania, and five months pregnant, when the attack happened. She recalls talking to her partner, a junior doctor, who was helping in one of the hospitals. \u201cI asked her: \u2018Is it crazy there?\u2019 And she said: \u2018No, there are no bodies.\u2019 And there was that moment where it just hit me.\u201d As Sabe realises in the novel, such visceral memories are hard to hold on to and hard to pass down through the generations. Woodson thinks the attacks are still \u201cobscure\u201d to her children as a historical event. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s graduating high school and she knows what it was, she knows that we know people who died, she knows that there was a war directly afterwards,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son knows that once there were buildings there, but he\u2019s always only known the Freedom Tower.

      "bodyText": "Author Jacqueline Woodson lives in a quintessential Brooklyn brownstone with her partner, two children, a cat and two huge, friendly dogs. A similar house is at the centre of her new novel, Red at the Bone, representing the struggle of a multigenerational black family to honour its past and stand firm against change. The novel opens in 2001, as 16-year-old Melody descends the stairs in a debutante\u2019s traditional white dress. An orchestra is playing the Prince song she\u2019s insisted on, against her mother\u2019s wishes, while white passersby stop and gawk through the windows. Her coming-of-age party is a declaration of family pride, class status, and an effort to repair a broken link with the past, when Melody\u2019s mother, Iris, skipped her own ceremony after becoming pregnant at 15. The novel explores this rift and its consequences over time, shifting between the perspectives of different family members and offering unusual narrative freedom for Woodson, who writes primarily for younger readers. \u201cWith adults, you can play around with time,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI have a much larger canvas.\u201d Red at the Bone is Woodson\u2019s second novel for adults, following 2016\u2019s Another Brooklyn as well as her widely praised 2014 memoir-in-poems, Brown Girl Dreaming, which won the prestigious National Book Award for young people\u2019s literature. That genre-tweaking bestseller brought to life Woodson\u2019s early childhood, moving from her birthplace of Ohio in 1963, to South Carolina later in the 1960s amid the fierce battles of the civil rights movement, to Brooklyn, where the author has spent most of her life since. Brown Girl Dreaming expanded Woodson\u2019s audience. She had already written more than 30 books for young readers, winning numerous awards including, in 2018, the Astrid Lindgren memorial prize, which she\u2019s using to fund an arts organisation supporting early-career writers of colour. Since the publication of her first book in 1990, Woodson has been tireless in arguing the need to diversify the predominantly white publishing industry and for children\u2019s literature to better reflect the lives and identities of its readers. Balancing writing with advocacy, she has recently served as the US young people\u2019s poet laureate and the national ambassador for young people\u2019s literature, and counts Judy Blume and the Obamas among her many fans. She is clearly not a writer who feels hemmed in by genre \u2013 her next projects include a novel for readers aged eight to 12, several articles, a screenplay adaptation of Red at the Bone, a television project and a book of non-fiction. She doesn\u2019t choose the format ahead of time. Instead, she says, \u201cthe story dictates\u201d who the audience will be. \u201cI know when I\u2019m writing something poetic and the voice feels young, it\u2019s going to be a picture book,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf there\u2019s an immediacy to it, I know it\u2019s probably going to be for middle graders. If there\u2019s a spareness to it, I know it\u2019s probably young adult or adult, because there\u2019s a lot more that older people can infer.\u201d All of her books place black children and teenagers at the centre of their own stories, and even in her adult fiction she writes young characters with deep respect and sensitivity. It\u2019s common to describe a children\u2019s author who produces a book for adults as having \u201cdeveloped\u201d or matured in some way, but Woodson believes it\u2019s much harder for adult authors to write well for children than the other way round. \u201cA lot of adults want to forget that period, or have forgotten it, so when they come back to writing for children, it becomes didactic,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t remember that as a young reader, you didn\u2019t want to read to learn, you wanted to read to escape.\u201d Those dismissive attitudes to children\u2019s literature are connected, Woodson believes, to the many ways that young people are overlooked and misjudged by society at large. Teenage boys, especially boys of colour, may be the most misjudged of all, which is one reason why, in Red at the Bone, which explores Iris\u2019s pregnancy, Woodson chose to slant her narrative toward the perspective of Aubrey, the sensitive, overwhelmed young father. Raised in poverty by a single mother, and moving often between shabby apartments, Aubrey is in awe of Iris\u2019s confidence. But it\u2019s not until he sees inside her home, with its \u201cupright piano beneath framed portraits of ancient family members\u201d that he becomes conscious of the class divide between them. \u201cI really wanted to write against that stereotype of the macho guy,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much of what becomes toxic in masculinity is that young men aren\u2019t allowed to talk about the fear of their first sexual encounter, or the pain of it, or so often the reluctance.\u201d As the mother of a pre-teenage son, she was particularly keen to represent those unspoken emotions honestly. But her interest in Aubrey\u2019s point of view doesn\u2019t overshadow her empathy for Iris, the young mother who finds the responsibility of family suffocating and escapes to college, where she is free to rediscover and reinvent herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make her a villain, because I think that\u2019s my instinct in thinking about what kind of mom would want to leave her child,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when you really start excavating it, you see that all kinds of mothers do \u2013 regardless of economic class, regardless of race. Someone who gets pregnant at 15, who\u2019s not even out of childhood herself, of course it makes sense that she changed her mind.\u201d Just as with Aubrey, Woodson\u2019s interest in writing Iris\u2019s story lay in subverting expectations and avoiding easy judgments. Another constant in her fiction for all ages is her fascination with the diverse and ever-changing New York borough that she has called home since the 70s. Like Aubrey, Woodson grew up in Bushwick, a mostly black and Latino neighbourhood at the time, which has since gentrified visibly: \u201cThe block I grew up on is now predominantly white.\u201d The dedication in her novel Another Brooklyn is: \u201cFor Bushwick (1970\u20131990) In Memory\u201d, marking the loss of people and culture that occurs when the hipsters and the money move in. Woodson recalls her own struggles to rent an apartment as an adult in the 90s, repeatedly being told that somewhere was no longer available. \u201cLandlords were saying: \u2018Don\u2019t rent to black folks, don\u2019t rent to queer folks, don\u2019t rent to single moms.\u2019\u201d Yet Brooklyn\u2019s density and variety are what make it easy to bring characters, like Iris and Aubrey, together across a class divide and to investigate what unites and separates them. \u201cI think the thing that\u2019s so interesting about Brooklyn is that you can walk 10 blocks and be in a very different neighbourhood ethnically, in terms of economic class, even in terms of architecture,\u201d Woodson says. \u201cI feel like I could write about Brooklyn for the next 50 years, and I\u2019ll write a different story every time.\u201d The story of Iris and Aubrey\u2019s reluctantly intertwined families shows how class is connected to the larger history of race in the US, and the exclusions and reversals that have historically undermined black prosperity. Following the civil war and the abolition of slavery, many African Americans who managed to join the middle class struggled to hold on to their wealth or pass it down to future generations \u2013 especially in the face of rising discrimination and violence in the early 20th century. These legacies of loss, Woodson suggests, affect what\u2019s possible for their descendants. Aubrey\u2019s mother is a hardworking, educated woman who nonetheless remains trapped in poverty, while Iris\u2019s family is more financially secure, yet haunted by the destruction of its property in the Tulsa riots of 1921. Over the course of 24 hours, a wealthy black neighbourhood was attacked, looted and set alight by a white mob, a wholesale spree of destruction that claimed between 100 and 300 lives, and whose perpetrators faced no consequences of any kind. Woodson thinks it a \u201ctravesty\u201d that the history and impact of the Tulsa massacre are not more widely taught in American schools. She didn\u2019t learn about it herself until she was in her 20s, \u201cand then I was mad\u201d, she says. \u201cHow could it not be written down? When I have questions, they usually become novels.\u201d Accordingly, the violence becomes a powerful origin story for Iris\u2019s family, and especially for her mother Sabe, who insists on repeating the story to her daughter and granddaughter as a way of teaching them to protect what\u2019s theirs. Red at the Bone\u2019s dedication is a fragment of poetry, \u201cfor the ancestors, a long long line / of you, bending and twisting / bending and twisting.\u201d It describes the contortions necessary for survival, but also the length and strength of a family story. The other major historical event that shapes the novel is 9/11, one that has also been vulnerable to distortion and myth-making. It\u2019s important for Woodson that the memory of the attacks includes the victims who were not white-collar workers or emergency responders but \u201cthe janitors, the secretaries, the people working in the kitchens\u201d who often came from communities of colour, and whose losses tend to be overlooked. \u201cI think the further we get away from 9/11, the more it becomes this theoretical thing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe remember the planes hitting the buildings, but do we remember the photos everywhere you went: \u2018Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my husband? Have you seen my child?\u2019\u201d Woodson herself was on a book tour in Pennsylvania, and five months pregnant, when the attack happened. She recalls talking to her partner, a junior doctor, who was helping in one of the hospitals. \u201cI asked her: \u2018Is it crazy there?\u2019 And she said: \u2018No, there are no bodies.\u2019 And there was that moment where it just hit me.\u201d As Sabe realises in the novel, such visceral memories are hard to hold on to and hard to pass down through the generations. Woodson thinks the attacks are still \u201cobscure\u201d to her children as a historical event. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s graduating high school and she knows what it was, she knows that we know people who died, she knows that there was a war directly afterwards,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son knows that once there were buildings there, but he\u2019s always only known the Freedom Tower. He doesn\u2019t know the gap that existed.\u201d She is fascinated by the unpredictable ways in which what we call our \u201cprivate\u201d lives become part of a wider shared history, noting the rise in pregnancies that occurred after 9/11 \u201cbecause people were panicked, and they clung to each other\u201d. And the patterns of the past repeat. Her daughter was one of many children in Manhattan and Brooklyn affected by asthma in the fallout from 9/11. For Woodson, this recalled the prevalence of lead poisoning from paint in the 60s, which affected her younger brother. \u201cAnd then, we look at Michigan and what\u2019s happening with the water, and the kids are getting poisoned again.\u201d For a different writer, that repetition might be a source of despair. But over her years of writing for children, Woodson has learned that even if a happy ending isn\u2019t required, there still has to be some hope in the story. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to know that whatever moment we\u2019re in, we\u2019re not in it for the first time,\u201d she says. \u201cKnowing that something like this has happened before, and that we survived it, is really important for me as a writer.\u201d \u2022 Red at the Bone is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson on 23 January (\u00a314.99).",

      "body": "<p>Happenstance is responsible for the fact that all three pieces reviewed this week are made and, mostly, presented by women of diverse backgrounds \u2013 an indication, perhaps, that our theatre ecology is coming closer to reflecting contemporary complexities. The similarities, though, end there: all three are very different in form and subject.</p> <p>Charlene James\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/cuttin-it\" title=\"\">Cuttin\u2019 It</a></strong> is about female genital mutilation (FGM). An NHS website describes this as \u201ca procedure where the female genitals are deliberately cut, injured or changed, but there\u2019s no medical reason for this to be done. It\u2019s also known as female circumcision or cutting.\u201d Originally produced in 2016, the play well deserves the awards it has since won. A simple dramatic construction presents the issue clearly and raises consciousness about the practice via a vivid, emotional situation. It\u2019s a shame, however, that James\u2019s close focus on personal experiences excludes presentation of wider pressures that make it so hard to tackle FGM in the UK.</p> <p>Muna and Iqra both attend the same inner-city secondary school. We learn about their lives mainly through monologues, offering spirited summings-up of people and places, and opening windows on to their individual worlds. The spoken text is neatly projected on to Amanda Mascarenhas\u2019s evocative set, dominated by a grey concrete staircase against a backdrop outlining a featureless collection of high-rise flats.</p> <p>Muna\u2019s family left Somalia when she was small; she has no experience of the war in which Iqra\u2019s family were all killed. Iqra has only been in the UK for a few months and is finding it difficult to settle in \u2013 the school has allocated her a counsellor, but only, she feels, because the staff don\u2019t want her \u201cscreaming for my dead family\u201d during an Ofsted inspection. Muna shies away from contact with Iqra because she feels guilty about having escaped the war.</p> <p>However, after a small incident on a bus brings the two 15-year-olds together, Muna impulsively blurts out to Iqra her secret fear: that her sister will be cut on her seventh birthday, just as she herself was. Muna, who hasn\u2019t dared to speak of this with any of her many British friends, feels that Iqra is the only one who will understand. Iqra does, indeed, understand. However, she certainly does not share Muna\u2019s view that \u201cwhat they doin\u2019 \u2013 it ain\u2019t right\u201d. For Iqra, cutting is \u201cwhat we do \u2013 because we always have\u201d.</p> <p>The girls\u2019 divergent backgrounds and attitudes set them on course for a terrible collision. Nickie Miles-Wilden\u2019s direction is finely paced, and both performers are consistently engaging. Asha Hassan\u2019s extrovert, gabby Muna, masks pain behind a brash exterior. Hermon Berhane\u2019s Iqra (delivering her lines with a mix of speech and sign language) reveals a steely strength behind her diffident demeanour. James skilfully plays the two situations off one another, deploying dramatic irony to ratchet up the tension for the audience and lead us to a shocking, highly charged conclusion.</p> <p>The play\u2019s melodramatic simplicity makes it a useful introduction to the subject but a less than satisfying adult drama. I imagine that, if Muna\u2019s school had hosted a play such as this one, she might have felt able to share some of her fears with her friends or GP. However, James\u2019s narrow focus leaves in the shadows factors that facilitate FGM in the UK. Here, anyone who fails to protect a child from FGM can face prosecution. If Muna had spoken out, others, including her mother, might have fallen foul of the law. In this sense, issues around FGM are not just tied to cultural practices but also linked to the way our laws are framed. The production programme speaks of wanting to bring about changes: speaking about the issue is one step; challenging the mechanisms that make it possible is another.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bunkertheatre.com/whats-on/the-girl-with-glitter-in-her-eye/book-now\" title=\"\">The Girl With Glitter in Her Eye</a></strong> is the latest work by the <a href=\"https://www.opiacollective.co.uk/\" title=\"\">OPIA Collective</a>, a recently formed group of young artists aiming to create multidisciplinary work that reflects female/LGBTQ+ experiences.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s top health official says there is \u201cno current need\u201d to enhance existing airport screening measures to target an unknown Sars-like virus that has infected nearly 50 people in China and killed two since it was reported on New Year\u2019s Eve. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said authorities in Australia were \u201cwatching developments very closely\u201d but had not issued a travel warning. \u201cThere is no current need for any travel advisory in Australia, which is consistent with recommendations from the World Health Organisation,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday evening. The outbreak of the previously unknown coronavirus has been linked to a fish market at Wuhan, the capital of China\u2019s central Hubei province. The Wuhan South China Seafood City market, which also sells chickens, bats, marmots and other animals, has been closed since 1 January. Laboratory tests performed in China found the virus was not Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Most of the cases were detected within days of the market being closed but Chinese authorities reported that four new patients had been diagnosed with viral pneumonia on Thursday. Three major airports in the United States have announced they will screen passengers arriving from Wuhan and screening has also been increased in airports in Thailand, which has reported two cases of the mystery virus, as well as airports in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines. A case has also been detected in Japan. One of the cases in Thailand was detected by the thermal surveillance equipment at Bangkok airport. Murphy said the four new cases reported this week were \u201cof concern\u201d. \u201cWhilst there is no clear evidence of human to human transmission, the identification of recent cases several days after the closure of the fish market, initially identified as the likely source, raises this as a possibility,\u201d he said. \u201cImportantly, however, there have been no cases of infection in the several hundred healthcare workers who have been exposed to the patients in China.\u201d Murphy said Australia already had mechanisms in place to screen for unwell travellers, including laws requiring that airlines report passengers who are showing signs of an infectious disease, such as fever, sweats, or chills. Planes that report unwell passengers are met on arrival and assessed by biosecurity officers. The Australian Medical Association said it was also monitoring the situation. \u201cThe AMA is in regular contact with the chief medical officer and we will obviously seek further briefings should the current level of advice change,\u201d the AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone, said. Doctors in Australia have been advised to ask anyone presenting with pneumonia-type symptoms if they have recently travelled to Wuhan. Alerts issued by the New South Wales and Victorian health departments urged doctors to \u201cconsider novel coronavirus infection in patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and travel to Wuhan City, China in the 14 days before illness onset\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Chatting with husband-and-wife writing duo Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V Gordon, it\u2019s impossible to not address the elephant in the room: the recent photos revealing Nanjiani\u2019s chiseled new physique for his upcoming role in Marvel\u2019s superhero tentpole The Eternals, and his overnight transformation into an unlikely internet heartthrob. As dyed-in-the-wool comedy nerds, the pair have both got quips ready and waiting. Gordon is first out of the blocks. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about? I haven\u2019t noticed any difference. No, I\u2019m kidding, the difference is that it\u2019s hard for him to type on the individual keys of his computer now because of his massive, muscular hands.\u201d Then Nanjiani chimes in, right on cue. \u201cI will say, what has changed is that I\u2019m the subject of mockery much more now than I was before, all of it coming from people who claim to be my loved ones.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of playful rapport to be expected from spouses who got their start making each other laugh. He\u2019s an actor and standup comedian, who made his name as a sardonic programmer on HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley; she\u2019s the former producer of his long-running live show The Meltdown, and even more formerly a practising therapist. They\u2019re both writers and podcasters, but the true vocation threading all of their work together is storytelling. That may be a word Hollywood types throw around a lot, but Gordon and Nanjiani\u2019s output shows an adeptness for moulding the details of real life into something entertaining and truthful.

A classic story of boy-meets-girl, racial-tensions-complicate-attraction-between-boy-and-girl, girl-slips-into-coma and boy-bonds-with-parents-of-girl, the film expanded the possibilities of the romcom and brought the couple an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.

In one, an undocumented Mexican teen finds discipline and purpose in an urban squash league; in another, an Indian schoolkid busies himself while waiting for his deported parents\u2019 return by working his way to the national spelling bee. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to spin tales of a noble immigrant struggle,\u201d Gordon says by phone from the home she and Nanjiani share in LA. \u201cWe wanted viewers to come away feeling a lightness and loveliness, even if many of the episodes are dealing with serious things.

This is when the couple were accused of wanting to have their \u201ccake and eat it too\u201d.</p> \n<p>A number of articles quoted sources claiming that Meghan was a \u201cboastful\u201d, \u201cself-obsessed\u201d celebrity who craved media attention, an accusation which intensified when she guest-edited an edition of British Vogue in September last year.</p> \n<p>A number of the pieces associate Meghan and her family with drugs and violence. These include articles that make claims about her nephew\u2019s involvement with drugs, as well as claims that guests were given \u201cparty bags\u201d of cannabis at Meghan\u2019s first wedding. Past coverage of her family has associated Meghan\u2019s birthplace, and mother\u2019s home town, with gang violence.</p> \n<p>Other intense periods of negative press coverage included articles about the couple\u2019s use of private jets and the duchess\u2019s relationship with her father. The media returned to this topic time and again over the period covered by the analysis. Articles about her relationship with her father accounted for almost one third of the negative articles about the duchess.</p> \n<p> <em>Additional reporting: Niamh McIntyre, Caelainn Barr and Paul Torpey</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020.

      "bodyText": "The Duchess of Sussex gets more than twice as many negative headlines as positive ones, according to Guardian analysis of articles published between May 2018 and mid-January 2020. The analysis \u2013 which appears to support Meghan\u2019s argument that she has faced highly critical treatment in the British press \u2013 found that of the 843 articles in 14 print newspapers since mid-May 2018, 43% were negative. Just 20% of the articles were positive, with the remaining 36% remaining neutral. Findings hinted that claims she receives significantly more critical treatment than the Duchess of Cambridge were correct. An equivalent search for headlines in which the Duchess of Cambridge was mentioned resulted in a fraction of the results but found that of just 144 headlines over the same time period, 45% of those about Kate were positive in tone, 47% neutral and just 8% negative. The findings come as the couple plan their exit from the \u201csenior\u201d ranks of British royalty. Claims that their period of transition is soon to begin, backed by reports on Friday that staff at their Frogmore Cottage home were being reallocated. The statistical disparity in how the press treat the two duchesses echoes a Buzzfeed article which showed major differences in sentiment towards the two women on equivalent topics, ranging from their love for avocados to their tendency to put their hands on their bumps during pregnancy. It corroborates research by digital consumer intelligence company Brandwatch, which found that of 29,000 tabloid and broadsheet items online about the Duchess of Sussex in 2019, 21,000 were negative \u2013 or 72%. Meanwhile, just 4,300 of 14,000 items referring to the Duchess of Cambridge were negative \u2013 31%. A month-by-month breakdown shows that Meghan did receive more positive press than negative in May 2018 \u2013 the month she married Prince Harry \u2013 and in the month following. However, her honeymoon period in terms of press coverage was short lived: by July of the same year the proportion of articles that painted her in a negative light outstripped the positive. Negative spikes occurred on several occasions, particularly around the couple\u2019s desire for privacy, especially their decision to keep details about their child\u2019s birth and baptism private. This is when the couple were accused of wanting to have their \u201ccake and eat it too\u201d. A number of articles quoted sources claiming that Meghan was a \u201cboastful\u201d, \u201cself-obsessed\u201d celebrity who craved media attention, an accusation which intensified when she guest-edited an edition of British Vogue in September last year. A number of the pieces associate Meghan and her family with drugs and violence. These include articles that make claims about her nephew\u2019s involvement with drugs, as well as claims that guests were given \u201cparty bags\u201d of cannabis at Meghan\u2019s first wedding. Past coverage of her family has associated Meghan\u2019s birthplace, and mother\u2019s home town, with gang violence. Other intense periods of negative press coverage included articles about the couple\u2019s use of private jets and the duchess\u2019s relationship with her father. The media returned to this topic time and again over the period covered by the analysis. Articles about her relationship with her father accounted for almost one third of the negative articles about the duchess. Additional reporting: Niamh McIntyre, Caelainn Barr and Paul Torpey \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020. An earlier version mistakenly referred to January 2019, rather than January 2020, in the first paragraph.",

      "body": "<p>In a flat in north-east London, Abi is cradling her best friend\u2019s baby. At 15 weeks old, the little boy is smiling up at her, testing out his first sounds. His mother, Rachel, prepares his bottle while Abi rocks him, showing all the love she would to any of her friends\u2019 children. The only difference is that Abi gave birth to him.</p> <p>Abi and Rachel, both 35, met on their first day at university in Birmingham in 2003 and rarely left one another\u2019s side. At 16, Rachel had been diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.mrkh.org.uk/mrkh.html\" title=\"\">MRKH</a>, a congenital condition meaning her uterus was undeveloped. Although she produced eggs, she would never be able to carry children, something she kept to herself. \u201cI\u2019d tell people I didn\u2019t want kids but deep down I was insanely jealous,\u201d says Rachel, who works as an events producer in London. \u201cI wanted them so badly but assumed I\u2019d never have my own, so I learned to live with it.\u201d </p> <p>After meeting her boyfriend, Sam, at a warehouse party on the eve of 2014, she avoided the \u201cfamily\u201d chat for two years before confiding in him. \u201cWe continued our relationship knowing kids may or may not happen,\u201d she says.</p> <p>A weekend stay at Abi\u2019s home, in November 2017, bringing together five friends, their partners and kids, presented an opportunity to open up to them, too. Abi, a mother to three boys, remembers: \u201cMy partner, Rich, was cooking a curry, the kids were asleep and we were sitting around the kitchen table. Everyone spilled something personal. When Rachel told us about her condition, I knew, in my gut, that I would help her to have a child.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel and Sam had explored IVF, surrogacy and adoption, but had dismissed using agencies, which can be vastly oversubscribed, with waits of up to two years to find a match. \u201cIt felt too impersonal; too life-changing somehow,\u201d she says. Her younger sister had yet to start her own family; had she already had children, Rachel might have asked her to be a surrogate. </p> <p>Abi and Rich, meanwhile, \u201cspent Christmas contemplating what being a surrogate would mean for everyone. We had been so lucky, yet one of the people I love most hadn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate this phrase but it was a no-brainer.\u201d</p> <p>She called Rachel in the new year and told her to sit down before offering to carry her baby. Rachel remembers: \u201cShe said it would be like \u2018babysitting\u2019 our embryo and that term stuck. She\u2019d made up her mind, and that blew me away. I hadn\u2019t told my friends expecting one of them to be the answer. When Abi offered, it felt, for the first time, as if having a child was a very real possibility.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>In the UK, the number of children born by surrogate is up to 10 times higher than it was a decade ago, <a href=\"https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/surrogacy/\" title=\"\">according to the Law Commission</a>, which recently consulted on modernising the process to better support parents, surrogate and child. While US states such as California have commercialised the arrangement, with surrogates earning well in excess of $50,000 (\u00a338,300), it is illegal to pay someone for acting as a surrogate in the UK, meaning the process relies on the altruism of strangers recruited through an agency, or loved ones. It is not routinely available on the NHS, and the private medical costs are typically up to \u00a316,000. \u201cKnown\u201d surrogacy \u2013 between friends or relatives \u2013 is still rare: at <a href=\"https://www.carefertility.com/\" title=\"\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.carefertility.com/\" title=\"\">are</a>, the UK\u2019s largest private fertility group, they accounted for 10% of more than 100 surrogacy cycles at their clinics last year. </p> <p>Surrogacy is a delicate arrangement with high stakes. Pregnancy and childbirth can be gruelling, and present health risks, while the unknown territory of handing over a baby you have carried \u2013 or parenting the child you have not \u2013 presents added fears over bonding or changes of heart, albeit rare.</p> <p>When there is an existing friendship at the arrangement\u2019s heart, the stakes can feel higher still, for both the surrogate carrying a longed-for child and parents asking such as sacrifice of someone they care for, typically with a family themselves to consider. (Medics and lawyers advise against surrogacy until women have completed their own families, citing concerns about reproductive health and fears that it would be harder for them to give up the baby.) Not surprisingly, the friendships that underpin these arrangements are life-changing.</p> <p>Abi, Rachel and Sam embarked on medical appointments at a London fertility clinic. The friends were invited for counselling and asked to consider everything from how they would feel if Abi backed out, to how she would feel if she gave birth to a girl, after three sons. They set up a WhatsApp group. \u201cWe left Rich off that,\u201d Abi says. \u201cI\u2019ll talk about body parts and womb washing till the cows come home but he saw his role as keeping things normal \u2013 remaining practical and pragmatic in a hyper-emotional situation.\u201d They told their families, including Abi\u2019s boys \u2013 four, three and nine months at the time. \u201cWe always talked about \u2018Rachel and Sam\u2019s baby\u2019. We said, \u2018Rachel\u2019s womb doesn\u2019t work but Mummy\u2019s does, so we\u2019re going to look after a baby for them.\u2019\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In hindsight, living miles apart was good. If we were round the corner I\u2019d have been posting steak through her letterbox</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After initially being refused any NHS fertility treatment that would lead to surrogacy, Rachel successfully lobbied her local commissioning group for a single round of IVF, in May 2018, allowing her eggs to be extracted for fertilisation by Sam\u2019s sperm, creating a viable embryo. It would later be placed in Abi\u2019s uterus at a private clinic, using money Rachel\u2019s parents had saved for her wedding. \u201cSurrogacy is still seen as something you do if you\u2019ve got money rather than through biological need,\u201d Rachel says.</p> <p>Abi was given oestrogen and progesterone, and the embryo was transferred, via catheter, in a simple, minutes-long procedure, on 2 October. \u201cFrom that moment, it was out of my control,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cI felt like I was holding my breath.\u201d </p> <p>When Abi took a pregnancy test, at 7am on a Saturday morning nearly a fortnight later, Rachel and Sam were in bed, on the end of the phone. \u201cWhen she sent through a picture of the positive test, we were in total shock; it was extremely emotional. We didn\u2019t know how to get on with our day other than staring at that picture.\u201d They remained in daily contact and Rachel travelled the 150 miles to Abi\u2019s home for midwife appointments and scans, as well as attending antenatal classes, along with Rich. \u201cIn hindsight, the distance was a good thing,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cIf we were round the corner, I\u2019d have been posting steak through her letterbox.\u201d</p> <p>They had to consider how to announce the pregnancy. Rachel would say: \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a baby, but I\u2019m not pregnant. My friend is carrying our baby.\u201d Abi, who works in public engagement at the BBC, recalls: \u201cEveryone\u2019s mouths dropped at work. My mum asked, \u2018Why you?\u2019 But they all thought it was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>When it came to maternity leave, Abi was entitled to a year, but took six weeks, while Rachel was entitled to a year\u2019s adoption leave. Outdated surrogacy laws require that Abi\u2019s name is on the birth certificate alongside Sam\u2019s; had Abi and Rich been married, he would have been named as the father. They also recognise Abi as the mother until Rachel obtains the court order granting her legal parental status. Seven months on, she is still waiting. \u201cThe fact that on paper he\u2019s still not my son is upsetting,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I can\u2019t dwell on it. It\u2019s a process, so we treat it that way.\u201d</p> <p>Many surrogacy pairings put an agreement in place. Although not legally binding \u2013 it is illegal for solicitors to negotiate one \u2013 it helps mitigate against concerns over all aspects of the pregnancy, from supplements to who first holds the baby. Rachel and Abi decided against it. \u201cIf Abi had changed her mind on anything, we all would have,\u201d Rachel says.</p> <p>Surrogates can receive reasonable expenses, such as extra food, travel, childcare or housekeeping costs, and Rachel and Sam gave Abi a cash card. \u201cIt\u2019s the trickiest part because no expenses can repay her,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cShe was militant about not asking for too much, but I wanted her to have a meal on us because she had our son with her.\u201d </p> <p>The baby was born on 8 June 2019. Rachel and Sam drove Abi to the hospital and witnessed the birth. \u201cI could hardly believe it was real,\u201d says Rachel, who fainted as he was delivered into her arms. The couple spent the first two nights after his birth in hospital, down the corridor from Abi.</p> <p>\u201cRich was working late and arrived to find us all in the room together and the baby just minutes old,\u201d Abi says. \u201cHe stayed for the placenta delivery, had some tea and toast and went home to be there for our boys in the morning. I don\u2019t think the scale of what we\u2019ve done will hit us for a long time. I\u2019m relieved at how normal it feels when I see the baby. Rachel was so generous with her trust in me.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel adds: \u201cAbi put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for me, to make us a family. She gave up a huge part of her life during those months to change ours for ever. I couldn\u2019t handle what I was putting her through at times but she\u2019d always say: \u2018You\u2019re not putting me through this, I\u2019ve chosen to do it.\u2019 If I ever asked why, she would say: \u2018Well, I can\u2019t think why not.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>As fertility medicine has advanced and different family units evolved, surrogacy has emerged as a more familiar route to parenthood, but demand far outweighs the number of women willing or able to volunteer, and the British legal system is playing catchup. London-based family lawyer Joanna Kay, who has advised on surrogacy for more than a decade, says: \u201cThe landscape of what a family looks like has changed beyond recognition, but the laws are from the mid-80s. Without a court order, intended parents can\u2019t make decisions about their child\u2019s medical care or education; there can be problems with passports and inheritance. I don\u2019t think anyone would argue against the need for reform. </p> <p>\u201cIn most cases, everyone knows what they\u2019re signing up for and is happy to honour their agreement. On rare occasions things go wrong and the courts are asked to intervene. There have been a handful of cases where the surrogate didn\u2019t want to hand over the baby or the intended parent didn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p> <p>Other relationships between parents and surrogates have been deep and enduring. Kim Cotton, who became Britain\u2019s first surrogate in 1985, went on to help her friend Linda, who was unable to carry children because of complications associated with a miscarriage; Cotton gave birth to twins in 1991. \u201cThe family moved to New Zealand when the twins were teenagers but I still track their lives, mostly through Facebook now,\u201d says Cotton, who is 63, and the founder of the Cots surrogacy agency. \u201cChristmases and birthdays are still special and the twins and I always send messages to mark them. My friendship with Linda remains the kind where you are for ever aware of that person and can pick up with them anytime, even if you don\u2019t speak often.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Yet even longed-for pregnancies don\u2019t always run smoothly. After Laura was made infertile five years ago, at 28, by treatment for stage two cervical cancer, her best friend Kerrie represented her only hope of becoming a biological mother. Last year, Kerrie offered to carry Laura\u2019s fertilised eggs, frozen before she began intensive chemo and radiotherapy five years ago.</p> <p>They had been friends since childhood and shared everything, Laura says, over a cup of tea at Kerrie\u2019s home in Lancashire. \u201cRelationships, breakups, marriages, my illness; she cries with me and laughs with me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In 2014, Laura, a nursery manager, and her now-husband Grant were about to start IVF for problems unconnected to her own fertility when a routine smear test detected cancerous cells. \u201cThey talked about a hysterectomy,\u201d she remembers. \u201cKnowing my illness would take away my chance of having children was what broke me, not the cancer.\u201d By this point in the story, both women are in tears. \u201cAs we left the hospital, I told Grant to leave me,\u201d Laura adds. He didn\u2019t. And while a hysterectomy was ruled out, Laura spent Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve undergoing treatment, with Kerrie by her side. She had delayed it by one month, so her eggs could be extracted and later used to try for a child via surrogate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5387b599f10a7e574dc745fe2ac4e8262d21491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5387b599f10a7e574dc745fe2ac4e8262d21491/1318_543_4166_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Friends Laura (BlondeHair) and Kerrie (DarkHair); Kerrie offered to be a surrogate mother for Kerrie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She gave me my only chance of being a biological mum,\u2019 says Laura (left) of Kerrie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaw &amp; Shaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In April 2015, a scan revealed the tumour had gone. When Grant and Laura married in Cyprus in 2016, Kerrie was a bridesmaid. \u201cWhen I was ill, a few friends had offered to be a surrogate,\u201d Laura says. \u201cAnd when we finally came round to thinking about it, two years ago, it was Grant who said: \u2018It has to be Kerrie.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Kerrie, 33 and a hairdresser, had a similar conversation with her husband, Danny. \u201cAt the clinic, he told us he knew when Laura became ill that I would do it one day. I\u2019d had two good pregnancies and it would only be nine months of my life to improve hers for ever. I focused on seeing them with a child.\u201d</p> <p>Although it was NHS-funded IVF that had led to the discovery of Laura\u2019s cancer, when surrogacy became her only option, the funding was withdrawn. \u201cI didn\u2019t let it go without a fight,\u201d she says. \u201cUltimately they were taking it away because I had cancer. The NHS saved my life; to then dictate that life isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p> <p>In the end Laura\u2019s family paid for her treatment. \u201cThey would have helped me with a house deposit but I said, no, give me a baby, please.\u201d The surrogacy was delayed when Kerrie unexpectedly became pregnant with her third child in 2018, but in October 2019 Laura\u2019s eggs were thawed. Eight had been fertilised \u2013 but only one looked viable for transfer and pregnancy. It was placed in Kerrie\u2019s womb on 7 October. The women held hands as they sat on the clinic\u2019s bed. \u201cWhen they told us there was only one chance, I couldn\u2019t look at Laura,\u201d Kerrie says. \u201cShe can read my thoughts. I wanted to stay positive for her but the pressure was huge.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d been carrying her most treasured possession. We were numb. We drove home in silence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 23 October, two clear lines showed on the pregnancy stick, but Kerrie tested and retested, with Laura by her side, to be sure. Both women were ecstatic. However, on 1 November Kerrie started bleeding. A miscarriage, at five weeks, was confirmed two days later at hospital.</p> <p>\u201cIt hit me like a ton of bricks,\u201d Kerrie says. \u201cI\u2019d been carrying her most treasured possession. We were numb. We drove home in silence. My priority was being strong for her but I was broken. We went from speaking all day, every day, to nothing for 48 hours. I\u2019d type a message asking, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 then delete it. When we eventually sat down together, we cried our hearts out. I felt responsible but I knew I\u2019d done everything I could.\u201d</p> <p>Laura is still coming to terms with her grief. \u201cI was uncontrollable, heartbroken. We each had our own grieving to do; it wasn\u2019t that we didn\u2019t want to speak, we just didn\u2019t have the words and didn\u2019t want to add to each other\u2019s pain.\u201d</p> <p>Kerrie has offered to be a surrogate again, with a donor egg, but Laura says she couldn\u2019t put her friend through it. She has also thought about adoption but needs time to heal before giving it serious consideration.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody realises how difficult the process is,\u201d she says. \u201cKerrie gave me my only chance of being a biological mum. I didn\u2019t know I could love her any more than I already did.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Despite the spike in surrogacies over the past decade \u2013 and a rise in profile following the examples of celebrities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/16/kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-announce-birth-of-third-child\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian</a>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/28/elton-john-david-furnish-son\" title=\"\"> Elton John</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2009/apr/29/sarah-jessica-parker-surrogate-matthew-broderick\" title=\"\">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/30/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black-son-robert-ray\" title=\"\">Tom Daley</a> \u2013 just 302 (0.4%) of <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/media/2894/fertility-treatment-2017-trends-and-figures-may-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">75,425 fertility treatment cycles</a> recorded by UK watchdog the Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Authority (HFEA) in 2017 were surrogacies. But it has become a viable route for gay men who want to start a family. At Care, two-thirds of surrogacies in 2018/19 were for men in same-sex relationships, an option aided by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/oct/19/egg-sperm-donors-more-compensation\" title=\"\">HFEA\u2019s 2011 decision to offer \u00a3750 compensation to egg donors</a>, triggering more women to help others on their parenthood journeys. This, says consultant gynaecologist David Polson, \u201copened up the options for same-sex couples to seek out a surrogate and become parents\u201d. Advances in freezing fertilised eggs have also made it more likely that a thawed embryo will be suitable for transfer to another woman\u2019s womb.</p> <p>In Kent, Kevin, 45, a chief marketing officer, and Spencer, 30, a solicitor, are getting their six-month-old son ready for bed when the other half of \u201cSawyer\u2019s birthing squad\u201d (the name they gave their pregnancy WhatsApp group) arrives: surrogate Leanne, 36, and her sister Rachael, 33, Sawyer\u2019s egg donor. \u201cThere\u2019s not many teams like us out there,\u201d says Leanne, grabbing a bedtime cuddle.</p> <p>Spencer and Kevin have been together 10 years and married in 2015. \u201cI told Kevin on our first date that I needed to be a dad,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cThe biological connection was important to us.

(Medics typically discourage having the same woman perform both functions, to offset concerns around the possibility of bonding too strongly with the baby.) Spencer and Rachael, a credit controller, had become friends two years earlier after meeting on an IVF forum on Facebook. Rachael, then pregnant with her third child, was exploring egg donation, and Spencer wanted to know more about surrogacy. They lived nearby and began meeting up, forming a close friendship that involved weekends together, takeaways, dinners and days out. Spencer and Kevin became unofficial uncles to Rachael\u2019s youngest son and joined in family celebrations, which is how they grew close to Leanne, a mental health support worker who had three sons of her own.</p> <p>Leanne remembers: \u201cKevin and Spencer were lovely, and I\u2019d seen how close they all were and how badly the boys wanted to be parents. When Rachael told me their surrogate had let them down, I instinctively offered.\u201d</p> <p>The group drew up a 12-page \u201cintention agreement\u201d, detailing expenses, medical tests, pregnancy supplements and protection \u2013 including life and critical illness insurance \u2013 for Leanne\u2019s children in the event that anything went wrong. Kevin and Spencer spent \u00a325,000: \u00a36,000 for the cost of Rachael\u2019s egg donation; \u00a36,500 on medical appointments, screening tests (for all four), medication and scans; \u00a32,500 to transfer their embryo to Leanne\u2019s womb; and \u00a310,000 on surrogate expenses. On pregnancy test day, they sat around Leanne\u2019s kitchen table together, dipping the stick in a cup she\u2019d wee\u2019d in.</p> <p>\u201cThis was the next best thing to carrying the baby ourselves,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cWe were so involved. Friendship-first gave us trust and openness.\u201d The expectant dads attended scans, sent hampers each trimester \u2013 the first contained ginger biscuits and tea for morning sickness \u2013 and downloaded an app that allowed them to read bedtime stories for Leanne to play to her belly. When her waters broke three months early, at 28 weeks, the responsibility weighed heavily for all. Leanne says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let anything go wrong. Decisions about what happened next were theirs to make. I felt guilty.\u201d The men felt responsible, too. \u201cLeanne has three children; she had to go home perfect at the end of this,\u201d Spencer says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some nurses called Leanne \u2018Mum\u2019 which none of us wanted. It felt antiquated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Leanne was monitored as an outpatient until labour started a month later. When Sawyer arrived, at 2.36am on 6 April, eight weeks premature and weighing 5lb, all four were in the room, Rachael as birthing partner. Sawyer spent 16 days in neonatal intensive care. His fathers stayed by his side but the now familiar outdated legalities meant Leanne had to return for his discharge.</p> <p>Even once they have left hospital, it is common for surrogates to be contacted by health professionals seeking consent for newborn checks, despite parents being present. Kevin remembers: \u201cBefore the birth, our consultant emailed ahead to enforce our right to be there. Some nurses called Leanne \u2018Mum\u2019 which none of us wanted. It felt antiquated. I think it\u2019s sexuality and gender more than surrogacy. It took us being by his side for 16 days to prove ourselves, and it shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p> <p>After the birth, Leanne was flooded with emotion: \u201cYour body doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re a surrogate; he was premature and my natural instinct was to know he was all right. I talked a lot with Rachael to be sure what I was feeling was OK. The openness and honesty between me and the boys was vital. Once home, I was back to being Leanne again.\u201d</p> <p>She expressed and froze milk for Sawyer for two weeks before returning to work. Going home from hospital, Kevin and Spencer stopped at her house, \u201cto give her boys the first cuddle,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cThey\u2019d been through a lot, too.\u201d</p> <p>When the friends share their story with others, it is the egg donation that tends to generate the most interest, Kevin says, but for Rachael it represented nothing more than a tiny piece of DNA. \u201cIt\u2019s that black and white for me,\u201d she says. \u201cMy own children are the ones I\u2019ve created with my husband. The way Kevin and Spencer look at Sawyer is the exact reason I wanted to do this.\u201d</p> <p>They see each other often and last month shared a Christmas outing and an early New Year\u2019s Eve celebration before Sawyer\u2019s bedtime. \u201cI want our son to know who the two most incredible women on the planet are,\u201d Kevin says. \u201cThey\u2019ll for ever have that bond with him. The more love he has, the better.\u201d</p> <p>Back in north-east London, Rachel and Abi echo the sentiment. As the baby goes down for his nap, the friends leaf through a photo book of their pregnancy, created for their children. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for my son to know how many people brought him into the world,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest act of kindness imaginable; I can never thank her enough.\u201d</p> <p>Abi smiles. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need to thank me,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it just feels entirely normal. We were going to be friends for the rest of our lives anyway; it\u2019s just cemented our bond.\u201d</p> <p> \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a flat in north-east London, Abi is cradling her best friend\u2019s baby. At 15 weeks old, the little boy is smiling up at her, testing out his first sounds. His mother, Rachel, prepares his bottle while Abi rocks him, showing all the love she would to any of her friends\u2019 children. The only difference is that Abi gave birth to him. Abi and Rachel, both 35, met on their first day at university in Birmingham in 2003 and rarely left one another\u2019s side. At 16, Rachel had been diagnosed with MRKH, a congenital condition meaning her uterus was undeveloped. Although she produced eggs, she would never be able to carry children, something she kept to herself. \u201cI\u2019d tell people I didn\u2019t want kids but deep down I was insanely jealous,\u201d says Rachel, who works as an events producer in London. \u201cI wanted them so badly but assumed I\u2019d never have my own, so I learned to live with it.\u201d After meeting her boyfriend, Sam, at a warehouse party on the eve of 2014, she avoided the \u201cfamily\u201d chat for two years before confiding in him. \u201cWe continued our relationship knowing kids may or may not happen,\u201d she says. A weekend stay at Abi\u2019s home, in November 2017, bringing together five friends, their partners and kids, presented an opportunity to open up to them, too. Abi, a mother to three boys, remembers: \u201cMy partner, Rich, was cooking a curry, the kids were asleep and we were sitting around the kitchen table. Everyone spilled something personal. When Rachel told us about her condition, I knew, in my gut, that I would help her to have a child.\u201d Rachel and Sam had explored IVF, surrogacy and adoption, but had dismissed using agencies, which can be vastly oversubscribed, with waits of up to two years to find a match. \u201cIt felt too impersonal; too life-changing somehow,\u201d she says. Her younger sister had yet to start her own family; had she already had children, Rachel might have asked her to be a surrogate. Abi and Rich, meanwhile, \u201cspent Christmas contemplating what being a surrogate would mean for everyone. We had been so lucky, yet one of the people I love most hadn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate this phrase but it was a no-brainer.\u201d She called Rachel in the new year and told her to sit down before offering to carry her baby. Rachel remembers: \u201cShe said it would be like \u2018babysitting\u2019 our embryo and that term stuck. She\u2019d made up her mind, and that blew me away. I hadn\u2019t told my friends expecting one of them to be the answer. When Abi offered, it felt, for the first time, as if having a child was a very real possibility.\u201d *** In the UK, the number of children born by surrogate is up to 10 times higher than it was a decade ago, according to the Law Commission, which recently consulted on modernising the process to better support parents, surrogate and child. While US states such as California have commercialised the arrangement, with surrogates earning well in excess of $50,000 (\u00a338,300), it is illegal to pay someone for acting as a surrogate in the UK, meaning the process relies on the altruism of strangers recruited through an agency, or loved ones. It is not routinely available on the NHS, and the private medical costs are typically up to \u00a316,000. \u201cKnown\u201d surrogacy \u2013 between friends or relatives \u2013 is still rare: at Care, the UK\u2019s largest private fertility group, they accounted for 10% of more than 100 surrogacy cycles at their clinics last year. Surrogacy is a delicate arrangement with high stakes. Pregnancy and childbirth can be gruelling, and present health risks, while the unknown territory of handing over a baby you have carried \u2013 or parenting the child you have not \u2013 presents added fears over bonding or changes of heart, albeit rare. When there is an existing friendship at the arrangement\u2019s heart, the stakes can feel higher still, for both the surrogate carrying a longed-for child and parents asking such as sacrifice of someone they care for, typically with a family themselves to consider. (Medics and lawyers advise against surrogacy until women have completed their own families, citing concerns about reproductive health and fears that it would be harder for them to give up the baby.) Not surprisingly, the friendships that underpin these arrangements are life-changing. Abi, Rachel and Sam embarked on medical appointments at a London fertility clinic. The friends were invited for counselling and asked to consider everything from how they would feel if Abi backed out, to how she would feel if she gave birth to a girl, after three sons. They set up a WhatsApp group. \u201cWe left Rich off that,\u201d Abi says. \u201cI\u2019ll talk about body parts and womb washing till the cows come home but he saw his role as keeping things normal \u2013 remaining practical and pragmatic in a hyper-emotional situation.\u201d They told their families, including Abi\u2019s boys \u2013 four, three and nine months at the time. \u201cWe always talked about \u2018Rachel and Sam\u2019s baby\u2019. We said, \u2018Rachel\u2019s womb doesn\u2019t work but Mummy\u2019s does, so we\u2019re going to look after a baby for them.\u2019\u201d After initially being refused any NHS fertility treatment that would lead to surrogacy, Rachel successfully lobbied her local commissioning group for a single round of IVF, in May 2018, allowing her eggs to be extracted for fertilisation by Sam\u2019s sperm, creating a viable embryo. It would later be placed in Abi\u2019s uterus at a private clinic, using money Rachel\u2019s parents had saved for her wedding. \u201cSurrogacy is still seen as something you do if you\u2019ve got money rather than through biological need,\u201d Rachel says. Abi was given oestrogen and progesterone, and the embryo was transferred, via catheter, in a simple, minutes-long procedure, on 2 October. \u201cFrom that moment, it was out of my control,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cI felt like I was holding my breath.\u201d When Abi took a pregnancy test, at 7am on a Saturday morning nearly a fortnight later, Rachel and Sam were in bed, on the end of the phone. \u201cWhen she sent through a picture of the positive test, we were in total shock; it was extremely emotional. We didn\u2019t know how to get on with our day other than staring at that picture.\u201d They remained in daily contact and Rachel travelled the 150 miles to Abi\u2019s home for midwife appointments and scans, as well as attending antenatal classes, along with Rich. \u201cIn hindsight, the distance was a good thing,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cIf we were round the corner, I\u2019d have been posting steak through her letterbox.\u201d They had to consider how to announce the pregnancy. Rachel would say: \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a baby, but I\u2019m not pregnant. My friend is carrying our baby.\u201d Abi, who works in public engagement at the BBC, recalls: \u201cEveryone\u2019s mouths dropped at work. My mum asked, \u2018Why you?\u2019 But they all thought it was amazing.\u201d When it came to maternity leave, Abi was entitled to a year, but took six weeks, while Rachel was entitled to a year\u2019s adoption leave. Outdated surrogacy laws require that Abi\u2019s name is on the birth certificate alongside Sam\u2019s; had Abi and Rich been married, he would have been named as the father. They also recognise Abi as the mother until Rachel obtains the court order granting her legal parental status. Seven months on, she is still waiting. \u201cThe fact that on paper he\u2019s still not my son is upsetting,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I can\u2019t dwell on it. It\u2019s a process, so we treat it that way.\u201d Many surrogacy pairings put an agreement in place. Although not legally binding \u2013 it is illegal for solicitors to negotiate one \u2013 it helps mitigate against concerns over all aspects of the pregnancy, from supplements to who first holds the baby. Rachel and Abi decided against it. \u201cIf Abi had changed her mind on anything, we all would have,\u201d Rachel says. Surrogates can receive reasonable expenses, such as extra food, travel, childcare or housekeeping costs, and Rachel and Sam gave Abi a cash card. \u201cIt\u2019s the trickiest part because no expenses can repay her,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cShe was militant about not asking for too much, but I wanted her to have a meal on us because she had our son with her.\u201d The baby was born on 8 June 2019. Rachel and Sam drove Abi to the hospital and witnessed the birth. \u201cI could hardly believe it was real,\u201d says Rachel, who fainted as he was delivered into her arms. The couple spent the first two nights after his birth in hospital, down the corridor from Abi. \u201cRich was working late and arrived to find us all in the room together and the baby just minutes old,\u201d Abi says. \u201cHe stayed for the placenta delivery, had some tea and toast and went home to be there for our boys in the morning. I don\u2019t think the scale of what we\u2019ve done will hit us for a long time. I\u2019m relieved at how normal it feels when I see the baby. Rachel was so generous with her trust in me.\u201d Rachel adds: \u201cAbi put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for me, to make us a family. She gave up a huge part of her life during those months to change ours for ever. I couldn\u2019t handle what I was putting her through at times but she\u2019d always say: \u2018You\u2019re not putting me through this, I\u2019ve chosen to do it.\u2019 If I ever asked why, she would say: \u2018Well, I can\u2019t think why not.\u2019\u201d *** As fertility medicine has advanced and different family units evolved, surrogacy has emerged as a more familiar route to parenthood, but demand far outweighs the number of women willing or able to volunteer, and the British legal system is playing catchup. London-based family lawyer Joanna Kay, who has advised on surrogacy for more than a decade, says: \u201cThe landscape of what a family looks like has changed beyond recognition, but the laws are from the mid-80s. Without a court order, intended parents can\u2019t make decisions about their child\u2019s medical care or education; there can be problems with passports and inheritance. I don\u2019t think anyone would argue against the need for reform. \u201cIn most cases, everyone knows what they\u2019re signing up for and is happy to honour their agreement. On rare occasions things go wrong and the courts are asked to intervene. There have been a handful of cases where the surrogate didn\u2019t want to hand over the baby or the intended parent didn\u2019t want it.\u201d Other relationships between parents and surrogates have been deep and enduring. Kim Cotton, who became Britain\u2019s first surrogate in 1985, went on to help her friend Linda, who was unable to carry children because of complications associated with a miscarriage; Cotton gave birth to twins in 1991. \u201cThe family moved to New Zealand when the twins were teenagers but I still track their lives, mostly through Facebook now,\u201d says Cotton, who is 63, and the founder of the Cots surrogacy agency. \u201cChristmases and birthdays are still special and the twins and I always send messages to mark them. My friendship with Linda remains the kind where you are for ever aware of that person and can pick up with them anytime, even if you don\u2019t speak often.\u201d *** Yet even longed-for pregnancies don\u2019t always run smoothly. After Laura was made infertile five years ago, at 28, by treatment for stage two cervical cancer, her best friend Kerrie represented her only hope of becoming a biological mother. Last year, Kerrie offered to carry Laura\u2019s fertilised eggs, frozen before she began intensive chemo and radiotherapy five years ago. They had been friends since childhood and shared everything, Laura says, over a cup of tea at Kerrie\u2019s home in Lancashire. \u201cRelationships, breakups, marriages, my illness; she cries with me and laughs with me,\u201d she says. In 2014, Laura, a nursery manager, and her now-husband Grant were about to start IVF for problems unconnected to her own fertility when a routine smear test detected cancerous cells. \u201cThey talked about a hysterectomy,\u201d she remembers. \u201cKnowing my illness would take away my chance of having children was what broke me, not the cancer.\u201d By this point in the story, both women are in tears. \u201cAs we left the hospital, I told Grant to leave me,\u201d Laura adds. He didn\u2019t. And while a hysterectomy was ruled out, Laura spent Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve undergoing treatment, with Kerrie by her side. She had delayed it by one month, so her eggs could be extracted and later used to try for a child via surrogate. In April 2015, a scan revealed the tumour had gone. When Grant and Laura married in Cyprus in 2016, Kerrie was a bridesmaid. \u201cWhen I was ill, a few friends had offered to be a surrogate,\u201d Laura says. \u201cAnd when we finally came round to thinking about it, two years ago, it was Grant who said: \u2018It has to be Kerrie.\u2019\u201d Kerrie, 33 and a hairdresser, had a similar conversation with her husband, Danny. \u201cAt the clinic, he told us he knew when Laura became ill that I would do it one day. I\u2019d had two good pregnancies and it would only be nine months of my life to improve hers for ever. I focused on seeing them with a child.\u201d Although it was NHS-funded IVF that had led to the discovery of Laura\u2019s cancer, when surrogacy became her only option, the funding was withdrawn. \u201cI didn\u2019t let it go without a fight,\u201d she says. \u201cUltimately they were taking it away because I had cancer. The NHS saved my life; to then dictate that life isn\u2019t fair.\u201d In the end Laura\u2019s family paid for her treatment. \u201cThey would have helped me with a house deposit but I said, no, give me a baby, please.\u201d The surrogacy was delayed when Kerrie unexpectedly became pregnant with her third child in 2018, but in October 2019 Laura\u2019s eggs were thawed. Eight had been fertilised \u2013 but only one looked viable for transfer and pregnancy. It was placed in Kerrie\u2019s womb on 7 October. The women held hands as they sat on the clinic\u2019s bed. \u201cWhen they told us there was only one chance, I couldn\u2019t look at Laura,\u201d Kerrie says. \u201cShe can read my thoughts. I wanted to stay positive for her but the pressure was huge.\u201d On 23 October, two clear lines showed on the pregnancy stick, but Kerrie tested and retested, with Laura by her side, to be sure. Both women were ecstatic. However, on 1 November Kerrie started bleeding. A miscarriage, at five weeks, was confirmed two days later at hospital. \u201cIt hit me like a ton of bricks,\u201d Kerrie says. \u201cI\u2019d been carrying her most treasured possession. We were numb. We drove home in silence. My priority was being strong for her but I was broken. We went from speaking all day, every day, to nothing for 48 hours. I\u2019d type a message asking, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 then delete it. When we eventually sat down together, we cried our hearts out. I felt responsible but I knew I\u2019d done everything I could.\u201d Laura is still coming to terms with her grief. \u201cI was uncontrollable, heartbroken. We each had our own grieving to do; it wasn\u2019t that we didn\u2019t want to speak, we just didn\u2019t have the words and didn\u2019t want to add to each other\u2019s pain.\u201d Kerrie has offered to be a surrogate again, with a donor egg, but Laura says she couldn\u2019t put her friend through it. She has also thought about adoption but needs time to heal before giving it serious consideration. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody realises how difficult the process is,\u201d she says. \u201cKerrie gave me my only chance of being a biological mum. I didn\u2019t know I could love her any more than I already did.\u201d *** Despite the spike in surrogacies over the past decade \u2013 and a rise in profile following the examples of celebrities Kim Kardashian, Elton John, Sarah Jessica Parker and Tom Daley \u2013 just 302 (0.4%) of 75,425 fertility treatment cycles recorded by UK watchdog the Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Authority (HFEA) in 2017 were surrogacies. But it has become a viable route for gay men who want to start a family. At Care, two-thirds of surrogacies in 2018/19 were for men in same-sex relationships, an option aided by the HFEA\u2019s 2011 decision to offer \u00a3750 compensation to egg donors, triggering more women to help others on their parenthood journeys. This, says consultant gynaecologist David Polson, \u201copened up the options for same-sex couples to seek out a surrogate and become parents\u201d. Advances in freezing fertilised eggs have also made it more likely that a thawed embryo will be suitable for transfer to another woman\u2019s womb. In Kent, Kevin, 45, a chief marketing officer, and Spencer, 30, a solicitor, are getting their six-month-old son ready for bed when the other half of \u201cSawyer\u2019s birthing squad\u201d (the name they gave their pregnancy WhatsApp group) arrives: surrogate Leanne, 36, and her sister Rachael, 33, Sawyer\u2019s egg donor. \u201cThere\u2019s not many teams like us out there,\u201d says Leanne, grabbing a bedtime cuddle. Spencer and Kevin have been together 10 years and married in 2015. \u201cI told Kevin on our first date that I needed to be a dad,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cThe biological connection was important to us. We wanted to be involved from the start.\u201d They explored agencies but the networking aspect turned them off. \u201cIt was like speed dating. There were more couples than surrogates. It felt hard to be your true self.\u201d They spoke to relatives and asked close friends but none provided an obvious solution. So, despite reservations, they turned to an agency and invested five months getting to know a potential surrogate, only to be let down by an early morning text weeks before treatment was due to start. The one thing they did have was an egg donor. (Medics typically discourage having the same woman perform both functions, to offset concerns around the possibility of bonding too strongly with the baby.) Spencer and Rachael, a credit controller, had become friends two years earlier after meeting on an IVF forum on Facebook. Rachael, then pregnant with her third child, was exploring egg donation, and Spencer wanted to know more about surrogacy. They lived nearby and began meeting up, forming a close friendship that involved weekends together, takeaways, dinners and days out. Spencer and Kevin became unofficial uncles to Rachael\u2019s youngest son and joined in family celebrations, which is how they grew close to Leanne, a mental health support worker who had three sons of her own. Leanne remembers: \u201cKevin and Spencer were lovely, and I\u2019d seen how close they all were and how badly the boys wanted to be parents. When Rachael told me their surrogate had let them down, I instinctively offered.\u201d The group drew up a 12-page \u201cintention agreement\u201d, detailing expenses, medical tests, pregnancy supplements and protection \u2013 including life and critical illness insurance \u2013 for Leanne\u2019s children in the event that anything went wrong. Kevin and Spencer spent \u00a325,000: \u00a36,000 for the cost of Rachael\u2019s egg donation; \u00a36,500 on medical appointments, screening tests (for all four), medication and scans; \u00a32,500 to transfer their embryo to Leanne\u2019s womb; and \u00a310,000 on surrogate expenses. On pregnancy test day, they sat around Leanne\u2019s kitchen table together, dipping the stick in a cup she\u2019d wee\u2019d in. \u201cThis was the next best thing to carrying the baby ourselves,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cWe were so involved. Friendship-first gave us trust and openness.\u201d The expectant dads attended scans, sent hampers each trimester \u2013 the first contained ginger biscuits and tea for morning sickness \u2013 and downloaded an app that allowed them to read bedtime stories for Leanne to play to her belly. When her waters broke three months early, at 28 weeks, the responsibility weighed heavily for all. Leanne says, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let anything go wrong. Decisions about what happened next were theirs to make. I felt guilty.\u201d The men felt responsible, too. \u201cLeanne has three children; she had to go home perfect at the end of this,\u201d Spencer says. Leanne was monitored as an outpatient until labour started a month later. When Sawyer arrived, at 2.36am on 6 April, eight weeks premature and weighing 5lb, all four were in the room, Rachael as birthing partner. Sawyer spent 16 days in neonatal intensive care. His fathers stayed by his side but the now familiar outdated legalities meant Leanne had to return for his discharge. Even once they have left hospital, it is common for surrogates to be contacted by health professionals seeking consent for newborn checks, despite parents being present. Kevin remembers: \u201cBefore the birth, our consultant emailed ahead to enforce our right to be there. Some nurses called Leanne \u2018Mum\u2019 which none of us wanted. It felt antiquated. I think it\u2019s sexuality and gender more than surrogacy. It took us being by his side for 16 days to prove ourselves, and it shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d After the birth, Leanne was flooded with emotion: \u201cYour body doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re a surrogate; he was premature and my natural instinct was to know he was all right. I talked a lot with Rachael to be sure what I was feeling was OK. The openness and honesty between me and the boys was vital. Once home, I was back to being Leanne again.\u201d She expressed and froze milk for Sawyer for two weeks before returning to work. Going home from hospital, Kevin and Spencer stopped at her house, \u201cto give her boys the first cuddle,\u201d Spencer says. \u201cThey\u2019d been through a lot, too.\u201d When the friends share their story with others, it is the egg donation that tends to generate the most interest, Kevin says, but for Rachael it represented nothing more than a tiny piece of DNA. \u201cIt\u2019s that black and white for me,\u201d she says. \u201cMy own children are the ones I\u2019ve created with my husband. The way Kevin and Spencer look at Sawyer is the exact reason I wanted to do this.\u201d They see each other often and last month shared a Christmas outing and an early New Year\u2019s Eve celebration before Sawyer\u2019s bedtime. \u201cI want our son to know who the two most incredible women on the planet are,\u201d Kevin says. \u201cThey\u2019ll for ever have that bond with him. The more love he has, the better.\u201d Back in north-east London, Rachel and Abi echo the sentiment. As the baby goes down for his nap, the friends leaf through a photo book of their pregnancy, created for their children. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for my son to know how many people brought him into the world,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest act of kindness imaginable; I can never thank her enough.\u201d Abi smiles. \u201cBut you don\u2019t need to thank me,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it just feels entirely normal. We were going to be friends for the rest of our lives anyway; it\u2019s just cemented our bond.\u201d \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Like the body itself, these forces are not closed systems with hard outer boundaries. The atoms that compose us derive from the fusion of hydrogen and helium in the big bang, and many come from far regions of the universe.

Like other parts of the body, it is always being moulded by the world. Oliver quotes Susan Greenfield\u2019s view that identity is an activity, not a state. New paths constantly form in huge numbers. Some paths fall into disuse, or the neurons reabsorb them. Oliver uses the image of a well-trodden road compared to an overgrown track. Selfhood holds its shape only through use.

For each of us, I presume, our consciousness feels like a centre, a fixed point from which we see things, however aware we are of the problems with this view. To Oliver, initially, this stubbornness resembles that of the flat-earthers who refused to accept the Copernican revolution. Yet he comes to see that the individualistic concept of self is a more ambiguous case. Qualifying adjectives start to appear more frequently. The independent, atomised, unchanging, coherent, autonomous self is the problem. We do not have to reject all forms of individuality.</p> <p>That individualistic idea of self has had great advantages, both evolutionary and moral; care for the self is a primal motive for ingenuity in finding food, shelter and reproductive success. But Oliver calls it a white lie, an adaptive delusion. In small precarious communities, the need for sharing and mutual protection will have been a strong counterbalancing force, making excessive selfishness costly. Perhaps it is only in the context of ecological crisis and global consumerist capitalism that the adaptive delusion has become maladaptive, and the moral balance is tipping. And it is not reassuring to recall those societies in which masses of people have been willing to die for a collective identity such as nation, religion or a political cause. Essential to Oliver\u2019s argument here is the moral difference between a collective identity that defines itself against others, and the ecosystem, which has no outsiders. Accepting the science is only the beginning. Moral weighing and reweighing must never stop.</p> <p>At the end, I was curious. What will we fear and desire in this future? How differently will we fall in love? Will we be more reconciled to mortality? What will our favourite stories be like? These will be fascinating questions if the shift begins in earnest. This timely, challenging book tells us why it just might.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Self Delusion is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a320).

And it is not reassuring to recall those societies in which masses of people have been willing to die for a collective identity such as nation, religion or a political cause. Essential to Oliver\u2019s argument here is the moral difference between a collective identity that defines itself against others, and the ecosystem, which has no outsiders. Accepting the science is only the beginning. Moral weighing and reweighing must never stop. At the end, I was curious. What will we fear and desire in this future? How differently will we fall in love? Will we be more reconciled to mortality? What will our favourite stories be like? These will be fascinating questions if the shift begins in earnest. This timely, challenging book tells us why it just might. \u2022 The Self Delusion is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a320). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

That\u2019s not true any more.\u201d </p> <p>According to more than 100 years of records preceding California\u2019s 2012-16 drought, sequoia trees either died by falling over or suffering near total crown scorch in wildfires, never while standing upright. But since the historically hot and dry drought, researchers have recorded trees dying \u201cfrom the top down\u201d with the notable presence of bark beetles in their crown. </p> <p>Although the number of trees that have died is a small proportion of the approximately 6,000 sequoias in the park, Dr Nathan Stephenson, the US Geological Survey forest ecologist who conducted the research, said he expected more to succumb to beetle attacks if, as expected, droughts become more severe and frequent in the future due to the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect a threshold to be passed, at least in my lifetime, when there\u2019s suddenly gigantic outbreaks taking out whole groves of giant sequoias. I suspect it will be [beetles continuing to hit] the most stressed sequoias but they will be doing more sequoias, because there will be more stressed sequoias.\u201d</p> <p>Stephenson said while there were no beetle attacks marked in park records, he suspected it might have happened before \u201cdeep in history\u201d, but more needed to be done to understand what the insects were doing to the trees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6c6a3c9a5ba3083cba218a534fc5a21c6bd4095\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6c6a3c9a5ba3083cba218a534fc5a21c6bd4095/0_0_2000_1532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phloeosinus punctatus, the beetle responsible for the death of the trees, is just 3-4mm long.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Phloeosinus punctatus</em><em>, </em>the beetle responsible for the death of the trees, is just 3-4mm long.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Oregon Department of Agriculture</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Climate crisis contingency plans for giant sequoia tree deaths and high severity wildfires made for the 2050s are being enacted now, the National Park Service said. Ecologists are considering taking measures such as planting seedlings at higher elevations outside the areas sequoia trees usually grow and increasing prescribed burns to thin the forest as much as possible.</p> <p>Fire is vital to ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada mountains, clearing the forest floor and allowing new seedlings to establish themselves. The sequoia tree needs slow burning fire to reproduce, but decades of fire suppression has meant that burns have not taken place in some parts of the forest for over a century.</p> <p>As a result, the buildup of fuel in the forest means that when fires do take place, they are more intense than usual, killing sequoia trees in the process.</p> <p>\u201cFor the sequoias that died in fires, it\u2019s a combination of past management practices plus the hotter drought that ganged up to kill so many,\u201d Stephenson explained. \u201cSequoias have died in past fires when it hasn\u2019t been an extreme hot drought, but it was fewer. Again, it might be a warning shot across the bow that if it continues to warm as projected, you might get more severe, longer-lasting, hotter droughts and sequoias will be exposed to those kinds of wildfires.\u201d</p> <p>Tens of millions of trees have died across the US, ravaged by pests, wildfires and the effects of the climate crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/12/us-forests-pests-risk-climate-crisis-resource\">research in August found</a>.

The deaths have challenged age-old assumptions about the tree, which only grows on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada and is fabled for its near-indestructibility, attracting visitors from across the world. \u201cIt\u2019s unheard of. It\u2019s never happened before,\u201d said Dr Christy Brigham, chief of resource management and science for Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, who oversees the welfare of ecosystems in the parks. \u201cYou think giant sequoias don\u2019t die in fire, you think giant sequoias can\u2019t be killed by insects. That\u2019s not true any more.\u201d According to more than 100 years of records preceding California\u2019s 2012-16 drought, sequoia trees either died by falling over or suffering near total crown scorch in wildfires, never while standing upright. But since the historically hot and dry drought, researchers have recorded trees dying \u201cfrom the top down\u201d with the notable presence of bark beetles in their crown. Although the number of trees that have died is a small proportion of the approximately 6,000 sequoias in the park, Dr Nathan Stephenson, the US Geological Survey forest ecologist who conducted the research, said he expected more to succumb to beetle attacks if, as expected, droughts become more severe and frequent in the future due to the climate crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a threshold to be passed, at least in my lifetime, when there\u2019s suddenly gigantic outbreaks taking out whole groves of giant sequoias. I suspect it will be [beetles continuing to hit] the most stressed sequoias but they will be doing more sequoias, because there will be more stressed sequoias.\u201d Stephenson said while there were no beetle attacks marked in park records, he suspected it might have happened before \u201cdeep in history\u201d, but more needed to be done to understand what the insects were doing to the trees. Climate crisis contingency plans for giant sequoia tree deaths and high severity wildfires made for the 2050s are being enacted now, the National Park Service said. Ecologists are considering taking measures such as planting seedlings at higher elevations outside the areas sequoia trees usually grow and increasing prescribed burns to thin the forest as much as possible. Fire is vital to ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada mountains, clearing the forest floor and allowing new seedlings to establish themselves. The sequoia tree needs slow burning fire to reproduce, but decades of fire suppression has meant that burns have not taken place in some parts of the forest for over a century. As a result, the buildup of fuel in the forest means that when fires do take place, they are more intense than usual, killing sequoia trees in the process. \u201cFor the sequoias that died in fires, it\u2019s a combination of past management practices plus the hotter drought that ganged up to kill so many,\u201d Stephenson explained. \u201cSequoias have died in past fires when it hasn\u2019t been an extreme hot drought, but it was fewer. Again, it might be a warning shot across the bow that if it continues to warm as projected, you might get more severe, longer-lasting, hotter droughts and sequoias will be exposed to those kinds of wildfires.\u201d Tens of millions of trees have died across the US, ravaged by pests, wildfires and the effects of the climate crisis, research in August found. In February 2019, the US Forest Service announced 18m trees had died since 2017 in California, bringing the total to more than 147m for the years since the drought began in 2010.

It\u2019s been here longer than Europeans have been in this country and it\u2019s dead. And it shouldn\u2019t be dead. This is not how giant sequoias die.

Trees had died standing since 2014, but the fallen branches were the first indication of what might be going on. Other researchers took samples of live branches from the top of sequoias that were dying from the top down and incubated the branches for further research. </p> <p>\u201cHundreds of beetles came out of these pieces of branch. We went back the next spring and that part of the tree that had been sampled was now dead,\u201d he recalls, detailing how the giant sequoia faded to its death from the top down. Stephenson emphasises that there is still further research to do on how bark beetles are killing giant sequoias but he is clear on one thing.</p> <p>\u201cI think beyond reasonable doubt in the limited set of circumstances, which was the most severe drought on record and all the trees had had a recent fire at their base, you can weaken giant sequoias to the point that bark beetles can kill them.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"071453c68caf583bd95719aef405512b81a241b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071453c68caf583bd95719aef405512b81a241b4/0_0_3300_2200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christy Brigham locating a new group of dead sequoias.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christy Brigham locating a new group of dead sequoias.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mette Lampcov/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"5ec95adbe4e9cf3c712ed671f2d65d3609530f4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ec95adbe4e9cf3c712ed671f2d65d3609530f4d/0_0_3300_2200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fallen sequoia.

Standing quietly on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the Californian giants can survive almost anything \u2013 fire, disease, insect attack, cold years, hot years, drought \u2013 so the story goes. The largest living organisms on the planet can grow over 90 metres (300ft) tall. When they do die after 3,000 years or so, the oldest trees, known as monarchs, usually succumb to their own size and collapse. Their giant trunks will rest on the forest floor for another millennium. But the miraculous story of the near-indestructible giant trees that millions of Americans tell their children is no longer true. The giant trees are a huge tourist draw. They can grow to over 90 metres tall, and stand for 3,000 years or so, the oldest and largest often felled by their own weight For the first time in recorded history, tiny bark beetles emboldened by the climate crisis have started to kill giant sequoia trees, according to a joint National Park Service and US Geological Survey study set to be published later this year. Twenty-eight have gone since 2014. The combination of drought stress and fire damage appears to make the largest sequoias susceptible to deadly insect infestations that they would usually withstand. One of the 28 is the optimistically named Lazarus, which stands in the Giant Forest in Sequoia national park, surrounded by other sequoias and a handful of cedars and pines that died in California\u2019s great drought. Lazarus, a dead monarch sequoia, stands surrounded by a handful of cedars and pines that died in California\u2019s great drought When Dr Christy Brigham, who is responsible for the welfare of the ecosystems in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, saw Lazarus for the first time, all she could do was weep. \u201cThis is a tree that has lived through 2,000 years of fires, other droughts, wet years, dry years, hot years, cold years. It\u2019s been here longer than Europeans have been in this country and it\u2019s dead. And it shouldn\u2019t be dead. This is not how giant sequoias die. It\u2019s suppose to stand there for another 500 years with all its needles on it, this quirky, persistent, impressive, amazing thing, and then fall over. It\u2019s not supposed to have all of its needles fall off from the top to the bottom and then stand there like that. That\u2019s not how giant sequoias die,\u201d she says, standing next to the skeletal Lazarus as the occasional tourist wanders past. Dr Christy Brigham, who is responsible for the welfare of the ecosystems in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks Even as tens of millions of trees died around them in California\u2019s historic drought, reassuringly the vast majority of giant sequoias appeared to stand strong, as they had always done. But in 2017, Dr Nathan Stephenson, a forest ecologist with the US Geological Survey, noticed a dead branch showing signs of beetle damage had fallen from a giant sequoia. Trees had died standing since 2014, but the fallen branches were the first indication of what might be going on. Other researchers took samples of live branches from the top of sequoias that were dying from the top down and incubated the branches for further research. \u201cHundreds of beetles came out of these pieces of branch. We went back the next spring and that part of the tree that had been sampled was now dead,\u201d he recalls, detailing how the giant sequoia faded to its death from the top down. Stephenson emphasises that there is still further research to do on how bark beetles are killing giant sequoias but he is clear on one thing. \u201cI think beyond reasonable doubt in the limited set of circumstances, which was the most severe drought on record and all the trees had had a recent fire at their base, you can weaken giant sequoias to the point that bark beetles can kill them.\u201d Dr Christy Brigham locates a group of dead sequoias and observes a fallen monarch. Pieces of bark patterned with bark beetle galleries indicate that something is wrong with a nearby sequoia The post-mortem site of another monarch that died in this way stretches along the forest floor a short walk from Lazarus. The tree, unnamed, had been felled and cut into chunks to protect tourists passing on a nearby road. At what would have been the top, the bark exhibits the telltale cause of death: the elegant spirals and grooves of beetle galleries, formed where the insects are thought to have entered and slowly killed the weakened tree. It is hard not to reflect on what the dead giant sequoia had endured and what awaits other trees in California\u2019s groves. As CO2 levels continue to rise, wildfires grow in intensity and the climate crisis alters ecosystems in just a few years, what does the future hold for these giants of the forest? \u201cPredicting the future is a fool\u2019s errand. But I would expect a ramping up of what we\u2019ve already seen,\u201d Stephenson says. Stephenson does not expect the widespread mortality events seen in other trees on the west coast but as everyone the Guardian speaks to emphasises, nobody has seen this before. The Giant Forest, situated within Sequoia national park, is a mix of white fir, incense cedar, sugar pine, ponderosa pine and giant sequoia trees. The grey trees here are dead; in areas of the national park tree mortality of some species is 70% More than a century of fire suppression has hurt the health of these forests. Since the late 1880s, landscapes that are meant to burn regularly in California have not, causing a huge buildup of wood and dead trees on the forest floor. When the inevitable fires do come, they are increasingly not slow, smouldering blazes that clear the forest floor and invite new life to thrive. The fires are intense, more regular than they should be, incinerating monarch sequoias that should be able to survive. Those trees that have succumbed from the top down in the drought \u2013 flagging first, then turning deathly autumnal orange \u2013 now stand grey on the mountainside in their millions, including many at famous views in Yosemite. View over the Yosemite Valley as one of the first winter storms approaches, bringing much-needed moisture Yosemite national park, famous for its climbing, landscapes and wildlife, is struggling to deal with the wave of dead trees. They line roads, threatening to topple on cars, campsites, buildings. Dead trees are felled every day just to keep the forest safe, but there is only so much that can be done. The bark beetle thought to have killed the sequoias, Phloeosinus punctatus, is different to the pine and spruce beetles that have claimed hundreds of millions of trees in Siberia, Europe and North America. But scientists are concerned about the classification of Phloeosinus and want further study. Whatever new information emerges, Brigham is clear: \u201cI can see why people could be confused because we are standing in a bog looking at giant sequoias that we say were killed by drought. It also doesn\u2019t help that we\u2019ve been telling people for 100 years that drought, fire and insects don\u2019t kill giant sequoias. And now what I\u2019m telling you is that the combination of drought, fire and insects is killing giant sequoias.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

      "bodyText": "A surprise appearance from a supermodel, the threat of prison for a tweet and the intense search for an impartial jury has turned the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein into a spectacle in its early weeks and raised fears over the difficulty of picking an impartial jury. The New York supreme court called in 2,000 people as potential jurors for the case, which kicked off on 6 January. About 600 actually showed up to court, and the numbers have slowly been whittled down closer to the 12 jurors and six alternates the trial calls for. By Thursday afternoon, seven jurors had been confirmed. Opening arguments are set to take place 22 January. Crafting a jury for Weinstein\u2019s trial has not been easy. Members of a jury are supposed to come into the trial with no biases about Weinstein or the women being represented in the case. Each day during jury selection, more than a hundred potential jurors have streamed into the courtroom where the trial is taking place. There, many of them have gotten glimpses of the disgraced movie mogul in the flesh, who comes to court with his lawyers every day, the whir of his metal walker clashing with the silence that falls on the room upon his arrival. More than 100 women have come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, but the trial\u2019s focus is on two women: one who accused him of rape, and a second who charged a criminal sexual act. Weinstein has denied all allegations. In the early stages of the trial\u2019s jury selection, a third of the pool of 600 potential jurors were dismissed after telling Judge James Burke that they could not be impartial jurors on the case. More were dismissed later after divulging details, such as connections they have to Weinstein or his accusers. One potential juror said he lived across the street from the Tribeca Film Center, where the Tribeca film festival is held, and could not be impartial. \u201cOn several occasions I\u2019ve seen him on the phone screaming at someone,\u201d the potential juror told the judge. Supermodel Gigi Hadid was revealed to be a potential juror for the case on Monday. She said she had met Weinstein and knew Salma Hayek, who accused Weinstein of sexual harassment in 2018, but assured the judge that she could \u201ckeep an open mind on the facts\u201d. Though she took home a questionnaire, Hadid was promptly dismissed from the pool of potential jurors on Thursday. Members of the jury pool have been ordered not to discuss the case they were called for unless they are dismissed \u2013 an order that has proven hard to follow with the buzz around the case. A member of the jury pool was brought before the judge and told he could get 30 days jail time for tweeting a joke about whether he can leverage \u201cserving on the jury of a high-profile case\u201d to promote his book. The judge told the man to come back to court in March with a lawyer. Over the course of the trial, Weinstein\u2019s team has made multiple attempts to delay the trial and push for jury selection to happen in private, saying that potential jurors can influence each other as they are questioned by the lawyers and judge. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer Arthur Aidala filed a request asking an appeals court to move the trial out of New York City, citing Hadid\u2019s presence in court as something that \u201conly contributes to the carnival-like atmosphere\u201d and the high-profile nature of the case. Burke has largely been unsympathetic to their requests. \u201cThe reality is people chant and protest outside this courthouse more often than not,\u201d Burke said when a flash mob anti-rape protest could be heard from inside the courtroom. He has also reassured multiple pools of jurors that knowing about Weinstein and his case will not automatically disqualify them from being on the jury. \u201cHaving heard of Harvey Weinstein or even being familiar with the allegations made against him in the press or elsewhere are not by themselves disqualifying and does not mean that you\u2019re not permitted to sit as a juror in this case,\u201d he told a group of jurors after noting that he heard a gasp coming from the group when he announced the name of the case. Daniel Filler, an expert on sex crimes and dean of Drexel University\u2019s Kline School of Law in Pennsylvania, said that the judge in Weinstein\u2019s case has no choice but to afford flexibility to jurors who have heard of Weinstein\u2019s case. \u201cA judge has a tremendous amount of latitude in jury selection as long as the juror asserts that he or she can be fair,\u201d Filler said. \u201cThe law understands that you\u2019re going to have jurors who have opinions, who may have pre-existing knowledge [of the case].\u201d While the venue of the trial can be changed, like Weinstein\u2019s team is asking to do, Filler said that would not be much help to the headache of jury selection. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away to Westchester county or Hudson county and solve a problem,\u201d Filler said, citing the counties just north of New York City. \u201cThese cases are famous everywhere.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I can only blame myself for my parents\u2019 career as unwitting joke shop owners. As a child, I was preoccupied with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/monty-python\" title=\"\">Monty Python</a>, and longed for a rubber chicken. I had never seen one in real life, but had a sense that it would bring boundless comedic joy.</p> <p>At the time, my parents already ran a retail business, and their search for a chicken led them to Ray Peckett, the owner of the UK\u2019s largest joke and costume wholesalers, Smiffys. As family legend has it, Ray would only sell them one if they promised to open a joke shop. So they did. </p> <p>Three months later, painted a retina-scorching orange, and with an eight-foot, 3D comedy nose and glasses sign on Edinburgh\u2019s Victoria Street, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AhaHaHaShop\" title=\"\">Aha Ha Ha Jokes and Novelties</a> was doing a roaring trade. It is said to have become JK Rowling\u2019s inspiration for Zonko\u2019s joke shop in the Harry Potter series. As a teenager, I spent every weekend and school holiday working there. Manning the till under a mirror ball and a menagerie of inflatable animals, I encountered people from every walk of life. Whoopee cushions, fake turds and things that go bang have egalitarian appeal; even the most prudish lady will titter at a wind-up waddling willy. You are never too old for a blue-mouth sweet. I still remember selling two fake bottoms to a man whose breath was more nose-meltingly potent than any can of fart gas.</p> <p>There were a few notable customers, too. Once, Glen Campbell appeared in the doorway, resplendent in full <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kAU3B9Pi_U\" title=\"\">Rhinestone </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kAU3B9Pi_U\" title=\"\">Cowboy</a> get-up. Mum flogged him a twirling bow tie and a stick-on third eye. An Oscar-winning director bought the shop\u2019s entire stock of whoopee cushions, for reasons unknown.</p> <p>Today, the shop has barely changed; the fake handcuffs and glow-in-the-dark bone maracas still hang next to the \u201cgiant mistake\u201d novelty erasers. The most popular celebrity masks are no longer Margaret Thatcher and Mr Bean, but Donald Trump and superheroes. There\u2019s a fair amount of schoolboy wizard-related items, and a certain 1960s bucktooth gigolo is still popular.</p> <p>People always laugh when I tell them my parents own a joke shop, but it\u2019s a very serious business. The slow strangulation of the high street, the failing pound, Amazon and a generation of people who are happy to shop directly from their phones mean that the past few years have been difficult. After 26 years, my parents have decided to sell up and retire \u2013 but hope that the new owner continues to run it as a joke shop.</p> <p>How much do we still need them? In these distinctly unhumorous times, I set out to meet other joke shop owners determined to keep looking on the funny side.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong><strong>If someone buys Elvis glasses, I\u2019ll start talking like Elvis \u2013 I can\u2019t help it</strong><strong>\u2019</strong><strong>: Graham Williams, <a href=\"http://www.dinsdalesjokeshop.co.uk\" title=\"\">Dinsdale</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.dinsdalesjokeshop.co.uk\" title=\"\">s, Hull</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b13ffb26cf0059074af127bd246b4401aba8405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b13ffb26cf0059074af127bd246b4401aba8405/0_193_5607_3365/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graham Williams behind the counter at Dinsdales in Hull\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Williams at Dinsdales in Hull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coming into our shop is like going back in time. I display the stock in old boxes from the 1930s, 40s and 50s; we don\u2019t carry that stock any more, but people like to look at it and remember. People tell me about coming in when they were kids \u2013 it\u2019s just a lovely memory for them. When younger people come in, they ask, \u201cHow much is that?\u201d and then find it for \u00a32 cheaper on the internet. I have a little eBay shop, but I do think we\u2019ve been left behind a bit. I just can\u2019t compete online.</p> <p>I like to meet customers and give them a bit of silly patter. Anything I sell, I go into character. If someone buys Elvis glasses, I\u2019ll start talking like Elvis \u2013 I can\u2019t help it. My kids find it a bit embarrassing. When we used to go on holiday, my son and I would put in false teeth and wear them out to restaurants. My daughter would be mortified, but you have to have fun. There used to be an old chap who would come in and buy clown noses: he just always wore one, everywhere he went. Even his bus pass had a picture of him wearing one. Back in the day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2016/dec/05/tommy-cooper-fez-much-more-than-prop\" title=\"\">Tommy Cooper</a> used to come in: he never bought magic tricks, but he did buy props for his show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"da430e29563912bd6847c135e72757e11f9acb2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da430e29563912bd6847c135e72757e11f9acb2c/344_1682_3200_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Donald Trump keyring.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Donald Trump keyring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Making people laugh is good. Grandad Dinsdale opened this shop 90 years ago. I\u2019ve been running it for about 20 years, but I\u2019m not going to celebrate our 90th birthday; we\u2019ll just quietly plod on. I always thought it would go on for ever, because kids would always want to spend their pocket money in a joke shop, but the past five years have been very difficult. I keep hearing of other joke shops closing down. All the shops in Hull have gone from the main shopping area \u2013 we\u2019ve just lost M&amp;S and Boots. It can be demoralising on days when nobody comes in.</p> <p>Uncle George Dinsdale, who took over from Grandad, used to say that coming into the joke shop was like going to the doctor\u2019s. Laughter keeps you healthy. Uncle George is still involved. One day we were chatting on the phone and a man walked in and said, \u201cI bought a magic book off Mr Dinsdale in 1954, and he said if I wanted to bring it back he would give me a refund.\u201d The man said he paid ten shillings, so Uncle George said, \u201cI remember him, go in the till and give him 50p.\u201d </p> <p>Recently, a man came in who had grown up in Hull but moved to Canada. He was with his son and showed him all the magic tricks he used to buy. He was so happy that we were still here after all this time. I was thinking, \u201cCome on, spend a little bit of money.\u201d The magic tricks were \u00a32, but they left without buying anything at all.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>The bestsellers are horrible sweets and fake poos.

By 1977, they had opened a joke shop in the arcade, and next door they opened a bong shop. We moved both premises into one big shop nine years ago.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think the function of a joke shop has ever changed. People\u2019s sense of humour hasn\u2019t changed. The whoopee cushion was invented 100 years ago and it is still funny. What has changed is fancy dress costumes: young people want to look unique, and there\u2019s some things they just won\u2019t buy, like Native American costumes. There\u2019s been a few things that have been banned. We used to sell this thing you\u2019d poke in a cigarette and it would make the ash \u201csnow\u201d. It said \u201charmful by inhalation\u201d on the packet, and that got banned quite quickly. I sell a \u00a31.50 retractable knife and I wonder when that will die out \u2013 it\u2019s not a funny thing to pretend to plunge a knife into someone.</p> <p>I had cancer a few years ago and I had to let go of our general manager. So now my two adult nephews can do split shifts between the joke shop and the bong shop. I am going to keep the business going as long as possible \u2013 the joke shop can\u2019t close on my watch. My nephews are going to take it over, hopefully. I have a daughter, but she\u2019s only eight and I\u2019m not sure what a joke shop will be doing in 10 years\u2019 time.</p> <p>Margate has changed quite a lot recently: it\u2019s got pretty cool, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s affected our takings. Amazon and eBay are our biggest threat. I love it when people say they\u2019ve bought something from eBay and not realised it will take 16 weeks to ship from China.</p> <p>I always joke that a joke shop is a non-profit organisation. It ebbs and flows. We do have times that are really busy, like Halloween, book week, Easter and New Year\u2019s Eve. It can be stressful, but not as stressful as the seafood bar I used to run. The best bit is when a little kid comes in and spends an hour choosing something for 50p, and the worst days are when I don\u2019t take a bean.</p> <p>We specialise in everything. I have over 3,000 lines of stock. The bestsellers are horrible sweets and fake poos. Anything disgusting, kids love. We have a disgruntled 80s pop star who comes in regularly and buys stink bombs. I think he breaks them in places he doesn\u2019t like. One of my customers came in and said she had to stop buying stuff: she\u2019d given her dad such a fright that he\u2019d jumped up out of his chair and had a stroke. She\u2019d played every prank on him, but in the end it was an electric-shock pen that got him.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018N</strong><strong>othing surprises young people</strong><strong> \u2013 they\u2019ve seen it all on You</strong><strong>Tube\u2019: Adaline Langton, 43, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HouseOfJokesBlackpool/\" title=\"\">Drummers House of Jokes</a>, Blackpool</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eb865ce061bd5d4fd967a74db1c495498cca02f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eb865ce061bd5d4fd967a74db1c495498cca02f/0_1789_3539_3470/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adaline Langton at Drummers House of Jokes in Blackpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"981\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adaline Langton at Drummers House of Jokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I read something that said \u201calways know your target audience\u201d, but our audience is everyone of every age.

      "bodyText": "I can only blame myself for my parents\u2019 career as unwitting joke shop owners. As a child, I was preoccupied with Monty Python, and longed for a rubber chicken. I had never seen one in real life, but had a sense that it would bring boundless comedic joy. At the time, my parents already ran a retail business, and their search for a chicken led them to Ray Peckett, the owner of the UK\u2019s largest joke and costume wholesalers, Smiffys. As family legend has it, Ray would only sell them one if they promised to open a joke shop. So they did. Three months later, painted a retina-scorching orange, and with an eight-foot, 3D comedy nose and glasses sign on Edinburgh\u2019s Victoria Street, Aha Ha Ha Jokes and Novelties was doing a roaring trade. It is said to have become JK Rowling\u2019s inspiration for Zonko\u2019s joke shop in the Harry Potter series. As a teenager, I spent every weekend and school holiday working there. Manning the till under a mirror ball and a menagerie of inflatable animals, I encountered people from every walk of life. Whoopee cushions, fake turds and things that go bang have egalitarian appeal; even the most prudish lady will titter at a wind-up waddling willy. You are never too old for a blue-mouth sweet. I still remember selling two fake bottoms to a man whose breath was more nose-meltingly potent than any can of fart gas. There were a few notable customers, too. Once, Glen Campbell appeared in the doorway, resplendent in full Rhinestone Cowboy get-up. Mum flogged him a twirling bow tie and a stick-on third eye. An Oscar-winning director bought the shop\u2019s entire stock of whoopee cushions, for reasons unknown. Today, the shop has barely changed; the fake handcuffs and glow-in-the-dark bone maracas still hang next to the \u201cgiant mistake\u201d novelty erasers. The most popular celebrity masks are no longer Margaret Thatcher and Mr Bean, but Donald Trump and superheroes. There\u2019s a fair amount of schoolboy wizard-related items, and a certain 1960s bucktooth gigolo is still popular. People always laugh when I tell them my parents own a joke shop, but it\u2019s a very serious business. The slow strangulation of the high street, the failing pound, Amazon and a generation of people who are happy to shop directly from their phones mean that the past few years have been difficult. After 26 years, my parents have decided to sell up and retire \u2013 but hope that the new owner continues to run it as a joke shop. How much do we still need them? In these distinctly unhumorous times, I set out to meet other joke shop owners determined to keep looking on the funny side. \u2018If someone buys Elvis glasses, I\u2019ll start talking like Elvis \u2013 I can\u2019t help it\u2019: Graham Williams, Dinsdales, Hull Coming into our shop is like going back in time. I display the stock in old boxes from the 1930s, 40s and 50s; we don\u2019t carry that stock any more, but people like to look at it and remember. People tell me about coming in when they were kids \u2013 it\u2019s just a lovely memory for them. When younger people come in, they ask, \u201cHow much is that?\u201d and then find it for \u00a32 cheaper on the internet. I have a little eBay shop, but I do think we\u2019ve been left behind a bit. I just can\u2019t compete online. I like to meet customers and give them a bit of silly patter. Anything I sell, I go into character. If someone buys Elvis glasses, I\u2019ll start talking like Elvis \u2013 I can\u2019t help it. My kids find it a bit embarrassing. When we used to go on holiday, my son and I would put in false teeth and wear them out to restaurants. My daughter would be mortified, but you have to have fun. There used to be an old chap who would come in and buy clown noses: he just always wore one, everywhere he went. Even his bus pass had a picture of him wearing one. Back in the day, Tommy Cooper used to come in: he never bought magic tricks, but he did buy props for his show. Making people laugh is good. Grandad Dinsdale opened this shop 90 years ago. I\u2019ve been running it for about 20 years, but I\u2019m not going to celebrate our 90th birthday; we\u2019ll just quietly plod on. I always thought it would go on for ever, because kids would always want to spend their pocket money in a joke shop, but the past five years have been very difficult. I keep hearing of other joke shops closing down. All the shops in Hull have gone from the main shopping area \u2013 we\u2019ve just lost M&amp;S and Boots. It can be demoralising on days when nobody comes in. Uncle George Dinsdale, who took over from Grandad, used to say that coming into the joke shop was like going to the doctor\u2019s. Laughter keeps you healthy. Uncle George is still involved. One day we were chatting on the phone and a man walked in and said, \u201cI bought a magic book off Mr Dinsdale in 1954, and he said if I wanted to bring it back he would give me a refund.\u201d The man said he paid ten shillings, so Uncle George said, \u201cI remember him, go in the till and give him 50p.\u201d Recently, a man came in who had grown up in Hull but moved to Canada. He was with his son and showed him all the magic tricks he used to buy. He was so happy that we were still here after all this time. I was thinking, \u201cCome on, spend a little bit of money.\u201d The magic tricks were \u00a32, but they left without buying anything at all. \u2018The bestsellers are horrible sweets and fake poos. Anything disgusting, kids love\u2019: Thule Letts, 49, The Joke Shop, Margate Mum and Dad had a shell shop about 50 years ago, but they always sold Kiss Me Quick hats and little novelty items. By 1977, they had opened a joke shop in the arcade, and next door they opened a bong shop. We moved both premises into one big shop nine years ago. I don\u2019t think the function of a joke shop has ever changed. People\u2019s sense of humour hasn\u2019t changed. The whoopee cushion was invented 100 years ago and it is still funny. What has changed is fancy dress costumes: young people want to look unique, and there\u2019s some things they just won\u2019t buy, like Native American costumes. There\u2019s been a few things that have been banned. We used to sell this thing you\u2019d poke in a cigarette and it would make the ash \u201csnow\u201d. It said \u201charmful by inhalation\u201d on the packet, and that got banned quite quickly. I sell a \u00a31.50 retractable knife and I wonder when that will die out \u2013 it\u2019s not a funny thing to pretend to plunge a knife into someone. I had cancer a few years ago and I had to let go of our general manager. So now my two adult nephews can do split shifts between the joke shop and the bong shop. I am going to keep the business going as long as possible \u2013 the joke shop can\u2019t close on my watch. My nephews are going to take it over, hopefully. I have a daughter, but she\u2019s only eight and I\u2019m not sure what a joke shop will be doing in 10 years\u2019 time. Margate has changed quite a lot recently: it\u2019s got pretty cool, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s affected our takings. Amazon and eBay are our biggest threat. I love it when people say they\u2019ve bought something from eBay and not realised it will take 16 weeks to ship from China. I always joke that a joke shop is a non-profit organisation. It ebbs and flows. We do have times that are really busy, like Halloween, book week, Easter and New Year\u2019s Eve. It can be stressful, but not as stressful as the seafood bar I used to run. The best bit is when a little kid comes in and spends an hour choosing something for 50p, and the worst days are when I don\u2019t take a bean. We specialise in everything. I have over 3,000 lines of stock. The bestsellers are horrible sweets and fake poos. Anything disgusting, kids love. We have a disgruntled 80s pop star who comes in regularly and buys stink bombs. I think he breaks them in places he doesn\u2019t like. One of my customers came in and said she had to stop buying stuff: she\u2019d given her dad such a fright that he\u2019d jumped up out of his chair and had a stroke. She\u2019d played every prank on him, but in the end it was an electric-shock pen that got him. \u2018Nothing surprises young people \u2013 they\u2019ve seen it all on YouTube\u2019: Adaline Langton, 43, Drummers House of Jokes, Blackpool I read something that said \u201calways know your target audience\u201d, but our audience is everyone of every age. The only people we don\u2019t appeal to are probably young women \u2013 I don\u2019t think a clown horn is interesting to them. They buy costumes, but glamorous ones. We used to have a lot of little old ladies come in, then we had a lot of stag and hen dos. But they don\u2019t really come to Blackpool any more; it\u2019s a lot more family-oriented now. The town itself is in disarray. There\u2019s not another shop open on our street. We\u2019re not on the promenade, but people still make the effort to come in. We have Chucky painted on the back of the shop and a clown on the side, so a lot of people take photos, too. The council wants to regenerate this area, and they want to buy back our lease.

And I am not alone. A new poll for <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/foodanddrink/full-english-breakfast-ingredients-a4334891.html\" title=\"\">Ginger Research</a> found that almost 20% of 18- to 30-year-olds surveyed have never eaten a full breakfast.

Far worse, 42% of naysayers (and 100% of terrible snobs) said it \u201creminded them of men in vests hanging around in transport cafes\u201d. But this does chime with <a href=\"https://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Article/2018/02/09/The-Full-English-breakfast-is-under-threat-as-diners-switch-to-lighter-options\" title=\"\">wider (sales) reports</a> of a gradual generational shift <a href=\"https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2019/06/13/More-than-a-quarter-of-dinners-out-are-at-pubs\" title=\"\">away from the big brekkie</a>. At least until \u201cgreasy spoon\u201d becomes a hot, ironic aesthetic on Instagram.</p> <p>Of course there have been many exaggerated reports of the death of the full breakfast down through the years and I wouldn\u2019t want overegg talk of its decline now. In fact, according to abstract polls, the full breakfast continues to exert a firm grip on our collective imagination. In a 2017 YouGov survey <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2017/01/23/bacon-most-important-part-full-english-breakfast\" title=\"\">83% of English people</a> described themselves as fans.

And it remains popular even in hip venues that offer all those smashed avo and chia porridge options that so trigger certain internet-dwelling middle-aged men.</p> <p>Yet, in an increasingly multiracial and ecologically aware UK, where greater numbers are avoiding pork products for religious or green reasons, and at a time when \u201cwellness\u201d is a cultural juggernaut, the full breakfast is undoubtedly, at some level, on the back foot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14062af0cc0c6918976938ce5ef3c3390495690a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14062af0cc0c6918976938ce5ef3c3390495690a/0_255_5415_3250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue outside the Breakfast Club cafe in Soho, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018 In the last decade, Britain\u2019s breakfast-brunch scene has evolved into one of UK food\u2019s most exciting strands.\u2019 Customers queue outside the Breakfast Club cafe in Soho, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My diminishing interest has followed a similar pattern.

      "bodyText": "In the 1980s, there was only one meal that mattered to me: Sunday breakfast. A break from monotonous cereal or toast, my dad\u2019s full breakfast was the highlight of the food week. True, his signature dish (naturally, this was the only time he cooked), would not have flown at the Wolseley \u2013 or any self-respecting high street cafe, for that matter. He had taken this originally conspicuous symbol of Victorian prosperity and pared it back to an ultra-convenient, cut-price pleasure. Who needs bacon when you can fry luncheon meat with your eggs and serve that with hotdog sausages and tinned tomatoes enriched with semi-skimmed and Kwik Save No Frills cheddar? \u201cThat is not a full breakfast,\u201d you may cry, \u201cthat is child neglect.\u201d But to a man who grew up in postwar Salford (and me), it seemed like heaven. With extra fried bread. For years afterwards, the full breakfast continued to feel gloriously self-indulgent. In the era before wall-to-wall Wetherspoons and Egg McMuffins, when eating breakfast out was still a glamorous novelty, an uncle of mine who lived on a different timetable to most Salfordians used to take me to a Swinton pub that served breakfast on Sunday morning. Ordering the full breakfast was almost compulsory in this high-rolling world. Later, at hotels, the morning after a wedding, say, it was often a hangover-busting lifesaver. Or so it seemed. Yet today, I cannot remember the last time I ate one. And I am not alone. A new poll for Ginger Research found that almost 20% of 18- to 30-year-olds surveyed have never eaten a full breakfast. Their reasons may make you despair: 27% said they hate black pudding. Far worse, 42% of naysayers (and 100% of terrible snobs) said it \u201creminded them of men in vests hanging around in transport cafes\u201d. But this does chime with wider (sales) reports of a gradual generational shift away from the big brekkie. At least until \u201cgreasy spoon\u201d becomes a hot, ironic aesthetic on Instagram. Of course there have been many exaggerated reports of the death of the full breakfast down through the years and I wouldn\u2019t want overegg talk of its decline now. In fact, according to abstract polls, the full breakfast continues to exert a firm grip on our collective imagination. In a 2017 YouGov survey 83% of English people described themselves as fans. A recent study for the Grocer found the full breakfast was Britain\u2019s favourite cooked option and, anecdotally, cafe owners report that it is still a bestseller. And it remains popular even in hip venues that offer all those smashed avo and chia porridge options that so trigger certain internet-dwelling middle-aged men. Yet, in an increasingly multiracial and ecologically aware UK, where greater numbers are avoiding pork products for religious or green reasons, and at a time when \u201cwellness\u201d is a cultural juggernaut, the full breakfast is undoubtedly, at some level, on the back foot. My diminishing interest has followed a similar pattern. Justifiably or not, I treat the processed meat-cancer link with blithe \u201cwe\u2019re all dying, every day\u201d fatalism. We cannot eat our way to immortality. But, circa 1998, when I was topping 18 stone, I did decide the full-breakfast blowout was calories I could live without. I had begun to doubt its efficacy as a hangover cure, too. For all that restorative cysteine in the eggs, eating a mound of grease and carbs seemed increasingly (blood rushing to your stomach as you flop, lightheaded on the sofa) to be doing more harm than good. In 2020, as I try to minimise my meat consumption and shopping budget, it is hardly a meal I will go back to. Not least because it now seems a boring option. In the last decade, Britain\u2019s breakfast-brunch scene has evolved into one of UK food\u2019s most exciting strands; with breakfast as an event and time slot growing as lunch and dinner decline. Inspired by the laidback atmosphere, globetrotting menus and superlative coffee on offer in Antipodean cafes (key dates on the timeline: Flat White and Lantana opening in London in 2005 and 2008), the UK is now awash with venues offering something similar. From Belfast\u2019s General Merchants to Laynes in Leeds, Idle Hands in Manchester to Glasgow\u2019s William Cafe, you are never far someone doing zingy, flavour-packed things with shakshuka, French toast, huevos rotos and sweetcorn fritters. All of which put the rather one-note, savoury slog of the full breakfast in the shade. Note: you can get smashed avocado in Wetherspoons now. So Britain\u2019s breakfast horizons, particularly for the under-40s most likely to eat out, have widened enormously. Each new morning is full of possibility; even if at home we stick to cereal or eggs. Now one option among many, the full breakfast\u2019s appeal has been diluted. Do I care? Not a lot, as I order harissa fried eggs on sourdough with avocado, dukkah and labneh at Sheffield\u2019s Forge Bakehouse. Just don\u2019t tell my dad. \u2022 Tony Naylor is a Manchester-based journalist",

      "bodyText": "Jane Shepherdson was once named the most powerful woman in British fashion. As the boss of Topshop when it ruled the high street and delivered \u00a3100m in profit a year for Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia retail empire, she was the high priestess of fast fashion. But times have changed: Shepherdson now wants us to ditch the shopping bags and get our style fix by renting everything from dresses to sunglasses and shoes instead. Shepherdson, who revamped the Whistles fashion chain after leaving Topshop in 2006, is now chair of My Wardrobe HQ, a designer fashion rental and resale website, which next month opens a pop-up in London department store Liberty. The tie-up is part of an emerging trend for secondhand and rented clothing which is becoming not only acceptable but desirable. Liberty claims to be the first UK department store to host a peer-to-peer fashion rental pop-up, following a partnership between Nordstrum and Rent the Runway in the US. But the idea is in the same vein as Selfridges hosting pop-ups by fast-growing vintage vendors Depop and Vestiaire Collective and online designer store Farfetch testing Second Life, a handbag resale service. \u201cPeople are becoming more comfortable with wearing things other people have worn and not necessarily seeing it as second rate,\u201d says Shepherdson. Concerns about the environmental impact of fashion, which contributes more to climate change than the aviation and shipping industries combined, are expected to drive a boom in rentals. The UK market is expected to grow more than fivefold to \u00a32.3bn by 2029 from an estimated \u00a3400m last year, according to analysts GlobalData. Peer-to-peer lenders such as My Wardrobe HQ and Hurr, where those with an over-stuffed wardrobe rent out items to those on a budget, are expected to lead the way, outstripping traditional players such as Moss Bros or newer online platforms such as Girl Meets Dress or Hire Street. On My Wardrobe HQ at present, fashion lovers might choose a floral satin dress from The Vampire\u2019s Wife label for \u00a3110, a Gucci military coat for \u00a3295, a pair of Michael Kors biker boots for \u00a340 or a Herve Leger sequinned bodycon mini for \u00a3215. All rentals last a week and customers who fall in the love with their items can buy them outright. Shepherdson says she got into the idea of peer-to-peer rental after taking nearly a year off living out of Airbnb homes in the US after quitting Whistles in 2016. \u201cI came back at the moment when it was suddenly becoming more and more apparent about what a massive polluter fashion is. I thought I\u2019ve filled all my life with making fashion more compelling and there\u2019s some massive back-peddling required.\u201d \u201cI thought about peer-to-peer renting and why couldn\u2019t it be exactly like Airbnb, where people could attract each other and buy into someone\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cI\u2019m not a hypocrite. I want people to enjoy fashion. Rental is a totally guilt-free way to wear the most beautiful dress and it\u2019s not out of reach for people.\u201d A \u00a31,000 dress might rent for \u00a3100, which is not exactly cheap, but accessible to anyone who can afford a big night out with cocktails, dinner and a cab home, she says. Shepherdson began by trying to start her own site but then met Sacha Newall and Tina Lake, who founded My Wardrobe HQ in June 2018, combining their experience in online fashion, car sharing, online marketplaces and women\u2019s magazines: \u201cIt felt like a business that could scale.\u201d My Wardrobe HQ works by managing the whole rental process, including photography, delivery, cleaning and payment, for its clients. About half the items on offer come from individuals, half from brands. Shepherdson says she is now in discussions with brands about producing collections specifically for rental. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s obviously a change but it\u2019s just sharing a bit more, making sure you get away from that thing of buying something, wearing it once and moving on.\u201d She says the idea is particularly appropriate for luxury womenswear. Ski-wear, occasion wear, maternity clothing and childrenswear are other areas Shepherdson thinks are ripe for rental. While Shepherdson says it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll go back to leading a fashion chain unless it\u2019s one with strong sustainability credentials, she rues the troubles at Topshop and its fellow fast-fashion chains, particularly the loss of good jobs for young women. \u201cIt\u2019s sad but there is a certain inevitability to it. Everything has changed, the whole approach to shopping. If you look at the retailers having a difficult time, most are based on bricks and mortar shops. \u201cI still love going shopping but you have to create theatre, something worth coming in for, to get people off the sofa.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In an emotionally charged scene in the new movie Just Mercy, Jamie Foxx, cast as a death row prisoner named Walter McMillian, accosts the young lawyer who has taken up his case with an uncomfortable truth about being black in the deep south.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re into down here in Alabama,\u201d he warns. \u201cHere you\u2019re guilty from the moment you\u2019re born.\u201d</p> <p>That phrase could stand as a catchphrase for the ingrained racial injustice that Bryan Stevenson, the rookie lawyer played in the film by Michael B Jordan, has devoted his adult life to fighting.</p> <p>From his first meeting with McMillian in 1988 to his star billing today as a one of America\u2019s most incisive commentators on race and inequity \u2013 and now as a fully fledged Hollywood icon \u2013 Stevenson has never taken his eyes off the prize.</p> <p>His epic six-year struggle to prove McMillian an innocent man provides the narrative arc of Just Mercy. It is based on the 2014 memoir of the same name in which Stevenson, 60, relates how he came to find himself representing some of the most godforsaken prisoners in the country.</p> <p>He was 23 and a student at Harvard law school when his professor suggested he take an internship in Atlanta, Georgia, with a not-for-profit legal firm. The firm\u2019s director, a towering figure in death penalty jurisprudence named Stephen Bright, took Stevenson under his wing and taught him justice, southern-style.</p> <p>Lesson one, Bright told him, was: \u201cCapital punishment means, \u2018Them without the capital get the punishment\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"464da5636e5688d4d71ce093010b263cb62bfb3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464da5636e5688d4d71ce093010b263cb62bfb3f/13_163_5954_3571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael B Jordan as Bryan Stevenson and Jamie Foxx as Walter McMillian in Just Mercy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael B Jordan as Bryan Stevenson and Jamie Foxx as Walter McMillian in Just Mercy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bright remembers his new intern as a slightly lost soul in search of a purpose in life. Those existential doubts vaporised as soon as Bright dispatched Stevenson to Alabama to investigate its death row.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Bryan started looking into what was down there, ye gods! It was horrible!\u201d Bright told the Guardian. \u201cPeople were being sentenced to death in a perfunctory fashion represented by lawyers who had no idea what they were doing.\u201d</p> <p>Bright recalls his young charge returning from a prison visit in an excited state. \u201cThis man is innocent,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cI know he is innocent.\u201d</p> <p>The man in question was Walter McMillian who had been sentenced to death for the 1986 murder of an 18-year-old white woman. When Stevenson began looking into the case he was struck by a legion of inconsistencies and ironies.</p> <p>The main irony was that the murder happened in Monroeville, home town to Harper Lee, which just went to show how much Alabama had taken to heart the moral of To Kill A Mockingbird. Even before he got going on the case, the trial judge \u2013 aptly named Robert E Lee Key \u2013 tried to talk Stevenson out of it. \u201cWhy the hell would you want to represent someone like McMillian?\u201d the judge said.</p> <p>Undeterred, Stevenson began digging into the record and discovered that not only had McMillian been found guilty in a trial lasting all of two days, but the defendant had a rock-solid alibi with dozens of witnesses. The prosecution relied on a jailhouse snitch who was offered money and freedom to provide false testimony against him.</p> <p>Exposing the racial animus at the heart of the death penalty was not easy. There were bomb threats and many disappointments and legal setbacks along the way. But in 1993 McMillian was <a href=\"https://eji.org/cases/walter-mcmillian/\">exonerated</a> and walked free. As Stevenson writes in Just Mercy, \u201cthere is light within this darkness\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"40ad4c687e8b9261cb50d1b4b201cd1d068c1d13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40ad4c687e8b9261cb50d1b4b201cd1d068c1d13/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan Stevenson at the Prison Reform Trust office in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryan Stevenson at the Prison Reform Trust office in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At this point we must say goodbye to Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan. It\u2019s a measure of the exceptional nature of Stevenson that just where the movie ends \u2013 with the good guys winning their death row battle \u2013 his own story begins to get all the more interesting.</p> <p>Stevenson has gone on, post-McMillian, to create an entire operation dedicated to uncovering miscarriages of justice in the deep south. Back in the 1980s he had a poky office and a single assistant; today the organisation he founded, <a href=\"https://eji.org/\">Equal Justice Initiative</a>, employs 140 people, many of them whip-smart lawyers in his own mould.</p> <p>EJI has won reversals or release from prison for more than 135 wrongly convicted prisoners. Among them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/i-went-to-death-row-for-28-years-through-no-fault-of-my-own-\">Anthony Ray Hinton</a>, who like McMillian was proven innocent in his case after 28 years on death row.</p> <p>Having turned EJI into a justice powerhouse, Stevenson has switched his energies to what might well become the most significant aspect of his legacy. He is now emerging as a leading exponent of America\u2019s racial fault-line in which he has begun to join the dots between slavery, racial segregation, terror lynchings of African Americans, capital punishment and the scourge of modern mass incarceration.</p> <p>He has taken his hands-on experience of southern brutality \u2013 what he calls his \u201cproximity to injustice\u201d \u2013 and extracted from it a philosophy of the open wound that runs through American society and politics.

      "bodyText": "In an emotionally charged scene in the new movie Just Mercy, Jamie Foxx, cast as a death row prisoner named Walter McMillian, accosts the young lawyer who has taken up his case with an uncomfortable truth about being black in the deep south. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re into down here in Alabama,\u201d he warns. \u201cHere you\u2019re guilty from the moment you\u2019re born.\u201d That phrase could stand as a catchphrase for the ingrained racial injustice that Bryan Stevenson, the rookie lawyer played in the film by Michael B Jordan, has devoted his adult life to fighting. From his first meeting with McMillian in 1988 to his star billing today as a one of America\u2019s most incisive commentators on race and inequity \u2013 and now as a fully fledged Hollywood icon \u2013 Stevenson has never taken his eyes off the prize. His epic six-year struggle to prove McMillian an innocent man provides the narrative arc of Just Mercy. It is based on the 2014 memoir of the same name in which Stevenson, 60, relates how he came to find himself representing some of the most godforsaken prisoners in the country. He was 23 and a student at Harvard law school when his professor suggested he take an internship in Atlanta, Georgia, with a not-for-profit legal firm. The firm\u2019s director, a towering figure in death penalty jurisprudence named Stephen Bright, took Stevenson under his wing and taught him justice, southern-style. Lesson one, Bright told him, was: \u201cCapital punishment means, \u2018Them without the capital get the punishment\u2019.\u201d Bright remembers his new intern as a slightly lost soul in search of a purpose in life. Those existential doubts vaporised as soon as Bright dispatched Stevenson to Alabama to investigate its death row. \u201cWhen Bryan started looking into what was down there, ye gods! It was horrible!\u201d Bright told the Guardian. \u201cPeople were being sentenced to death in a perfunctory fashion represented by lawyers who had no idea what they were doing.\u201d Bright recalls his young charge returning from a prison visit in an excited state. \u201cThis man is innocent,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cI know he is innocent.\u201d The man in question was Walter McMillian who had been sentenced to death for the 1986 murder of an 18-year-old white woman. When Stevenson began looking into the case he was struck by a legion of inconsistencies and ironies. The main irony was that the murder happened in Monroeville, home town to Harper Lee, which just went to show how much Alabama had taken to heart the moral of To Kill A Mockingbird. Even before he got going on the case, the trial judge \u2013 aptly named Robert E Lee Key \u2013 tried to talk Stevenson out of it. \u201cWhy the hell would you want to represent someone like McMillian?\u201d the judge said. Undeterred, Stevenson began digging into the record and discovered that not only had McMillian been found guilty in a trial lasting all of two days, but the defendant had a rock-solid alibi with dozens of witnesses. The prosecution relied on a jailhouse snitch who was offered money and freedom to provide false testimony against him. Exposing the racial animus at the heart of the death penalty was not easy. There were bomb threats and many disappointments and legal setbacks along the way. But in 1993 McMillian was exonerated and walked free. As Stevenson writes in Just Mercy, \u201cthere is light within this darkness\u201d. At this point we must say goodbye to Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan. It\u2019s a measure of the exceptional nature of Stevenson that just where the movie ends \u2013 with the good guys winning their death row battle \u2013 his own story begins to get all the more interesting. Stevenson has gone on, post-McMillian, to create an entire operation dedicated to uncovering miscarriages of justice in the deep south. Back in the 1980s he had a poky office and a single assistant; today the organisation he founded, Equal Justice Initiative, employs 140 people, many of them whip-smart lawyers in his own mould. EJI has won reversals or release from prison for more than 135 wrongly convicted prisoners. Among them was Anthony Ray Hinton, who like McMillian was proven innocent in his case after 28 years on death row. Having turned EJI into a justice powerhouse, Stevenson has switched his energies to what might well become the most significant aspect of his legacy. He is now emerging as a leading exponent of America\u2019s racial fault-line in which he has begun to join the dots between slavery, racial segregation, terror lynchings of African Americans, capital punishment and the scourge of modern mass incarceration. He has taken his hands-on experience of southern brutality \u2013 what he calls his \u201cproximity to injustice\u201d \u2013 and extracted from it a philosophy of the open wound that runs through American society and politics. To do that he has drawn from his roots as the great-grandson of slaves in Virginia and his experiences growing up as a black child in a small, segregated town in rural Delaware. From regular attendance at his family\u2019s local black church he imbibed the preacher\u2019s art of engaging an audience. You can see it in action in his Ted talk which has been viewed more than 6m times and which earned him one of the longest standing ovations in Ted\u2019s history. Stevenson\u2019s mission to join the dots began when he started thinking about the nature of public memorialising in Montgomery, the capital of Alabama where he set up base in the 1980s. He counted 59 Confederate markers glorifying the slave-owning south, while there was nothing to memorialise the suffering that the slave trade induced. In 2013, after a long tussle with local authorities, he managed to have three markers to the domestic slave trade erected in downtown Montgomery. From there it was but a short hop to thinking about the racial composition of death row. Why were Walter McMillian and Anthony Ray Hinton both black? Why are 42% of death row inmates today African American, when black people form just 13% of the US population? The culmination of these meditations is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, Stevenson\u2019s most breathtaking and audacious achievement yet. Through it he holds up a mirror to America of a central element of its character, one that until now has been almost entirely obscured \u2013 its tragic history of lynchings of more than 4,000 African Americans. The memorial, cast in bronze, sits on top of the hill that rises above Montgomery. Physically, and symbolically, it looks down on the Alabama State Capitol where so many of the political decisions that upheld white supremacy were taken \u2013 and still are taken. Standing in the centre of the memorial the power of Stevenson\u2019s unfolding vision is almost overwhelming. From Montgomery\u2019s slave warehouse and the thousands of men and women who died hanging from a tree, to Walter McMillian who came so close to a latter-day judicial lynching, this is America\u2019s unfinished business, its truly strange and bitter fruit.",

      "body": "<p>The eponymous king in Maaza Mengiste\u2019s second novel does not feature until a good halfway through the narrative, and then in appropriately shadowy fashion. He is Minim, a \u201csoft-spoken man with the strange name that means Nothing\u201d, one of those who has answered the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie\u2019s call to arms provoked by the Italian invasion of the country in 1935. But Minim has an unexpectedly propitious quality; a close resemblance to Selassie, now in exile in Bath, that can be used to reinvigorate popular confidence that the European colonialists can be defeated. Dressed in a makeshift uniform and sitting on horseback with a red umbrella across his saddle, Minim has only to appear in the hills so recently dominated by Italian troops to strengthen his subjects. As he is instructed by the comrade who has helped to hatch the plan: \u201cTo be in the presence of our emperor is to stand before the sun. You must respect his power to give you life and burn you alive.\u201d</p> <p>A different novel might put this curious interlude at its heart; fiction as written by a popular historian such as, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/19/the-spy-and-the-traitor-by-ben-macintyre-review\" title=\"\">Ben Mcintyre</a>. But in Mengiste\u2019s story - which draws on her own family history, with a grandfather who fought against the Italians \u2013 shadows and echoes abound and multiply, ensuring that although its participants are faced with clear and present danger, they continue to be intimately bound to the generations and individuals that have gone before them.</p> <p>When the book begins, we imagine that its arena might be small, and confined. We are in a compound, in which tensions seethe between Hirut, an orphaned young woman who has recently joined the household as a sort of maid of all work, and her mistress, Aster. Hirut\u2019s arrival has been effected by Aster\u2019s husband, Kidane, an old friend of Hirut\u2019s parents; Aster is both suspicious of their past connection and grieving deeply for the child she and Kidane have lost. Initially, the reader\u2019s sympathies seem clearly directed: towards the vulnerable Hirut and protective Kidane, and away from the capricious and occasionally malicious Aster. Their battles, worked out in a series of claustrophobic rooms, including the minute bedroom that Hirut shares with a cook and the more luxurious quarters given to the elegant Aster, are painful and without prospect of resolution.</p> <p>But circumstances change, and rapidly. In Eritrea and Somalia, Italian commanders are mobilising their forces to reprise their attempts to control Ethiopia, first thwarted in the 1890s; now, under Mussolini\u2019s mythologising aegis, they are ready to try once again. For the Ethiopian men, such as Kidane, who gather their own forces to repel the invaders, that first conflict is still present in their minds, and its reprisal presents them with a chance to avenge their fathers\u2019 defeats.</p> <p>What, though, of the women? In a scene of extreme marital disharmony near the beginning of the book, Aster makes clear her refusal to wait at home for her husband\u2019s return. Subsequently she dons his tunic, jodhpurs and cape and sets off to war in blazingly described fashion, taking Hirut with her. The story that follows \u2013 predominantly one of the cat-and-mouse game between Italian and Ethiopian forces \u2013 is interspersed with fragments: descriptions of the documentary photographs taken by a young Venetian soldier, Ettore; brief glimpses of Selassie in Bath, as he contemplates the potential destruction of his rule and, by way of comfort, devotes himself to listening to the opera <em>Aida</em>; and the interjections of a Greek-style chorus. Alongside the story of Hirut, Aster and Kidane comes that of the Jewish Ettore, exiled from his family and only latterly learning of his father\u2019s own exile from his native Russia. As he waits for letters from his parents, he is confronted by the news that Jewish soldiers will be required to register their ethnicity, and begins to receive reports of growing antisemitism at home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was only later that Mengiste discovered that her great-grandmother had taken her father\u2019s gun and gone to war herself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is both a reasonably conventional narrative \u2013 there is plenty of action, detailed description and a focus spread between the principal characters \u2013 and a subtly unpredictable one. History and modernity are juxtaposed in the factual asymmetries of warfare (the Ethiopians must rely on outdated and often malfunctioning weapons and have no way of long-distance communication beyond running messengers). They are also set side by side in the modes of consciousness that all the characters experience. While their instincts for battle, whether attack or defence, seem rooted in the primal, they are constantly having to adjust and update their viewpoints. For the Italians, the building of a great Roman empire must be captured on film; for the Ethiopian resistance, gender lines must be blurred for a greater chance of success.</p> <p>In her afterword, Mengiste notes that recollections of the war tend to cohere around the heroism of the outnumbered Ethiopian soldiers, \u201cstoic and regal like my grandfather\u201d. It was only much later that she discovered that her great-grandmother had taken her father\u2019s gun and gone to war herself \u2013 one of the women whose stories \u201ceven today have remained no more than errant lines in faded documents\u201d. Her achievement in <em>The Shadow King</em> is to bring to life those women, and to depict them as dynamic entities, their capabilities, limitations and beliefs evolving under duress in as fully complex a way as those of their male counterparts.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Shadow King is published by Canongate (RRP \u00a316.99).

You must respect his power to give you life and burn you alive.\u201d A different novel might put this curious interlude at its heart; fiction as written by a popular historian such as, say, Ben Mcintyre. But in Mengiste\u2019s story - which draws on her own family history, with a grandfather who fought against the Italians \u2013 shadows and echoes abound and multiply, ensuring that although its participants are faced with clear and present danger, they continue to be intimately bound to the generations and individuals that have gone before them. When the book begins, we imagine that its arena might be small, and confined. We are in a compound, in which tensions seethe between Hirut, an orphaned young woman who has recently joined the household as a sort of maid of all work, and her mistress, Aster. Hirut\u2019s arrival has been effected by Aster\u2019s husband, Kidane, an old friend of Hirut\u2019s parents; Aster is both suspicious of their past connection and grieving deeply for the child she and Kidane have lost. Initially, the reader\u2019s sympathies seem clearly directed: towards the vulnerable Hirut and protective Kidane, and away from the capricious and occasionally malicious Aster. Their battles, worked out in a series of claustrophobic rooms, including the minute bedroom that Hirut shares with a cook and the more luxurious quarters given to the elegant Aster, are painful and without prospect of resolution. But circumstances change, and rapidly. In Eritrea and Somalia, Italian commanders are mobilising their forces to reprise their attempts to control Ethiopia, first thwarted in the 1890s; now, under Mussolini\u2019s mythologising aegis, they are ready to try once again. For the Ethiopian men, such as Kidane, who gather their own forces to repel the invaders, that first conflict is still present in their minds, and its reprisal presents them with a chance to avenge their fathers\u2019 defeats. What, though, of the women? In a scene of extreme marital disharmony near the beginning of the book, Aster makes clear her refusal to wait at home for her husband\u2019s return. Subsequently she dons his tunic, jodhpurs and cape and sets off to war in blazingly described fashion, taking Hirut with her. The story that follows \u2013 predominantly one of the cat-and-mouse game between Italian and Ethiopian forces \u2013 is interspersed with fragments: descriptions of the documentary photographs taken by a young Venetian soldier, Ettore; brief glimpses of Selassie in Bath, as he contemplates the potential destruction of his rule and, by way of comfort, devotes himself to listening to the opera Aida; and the interjections of a Greek-style chorus. Alongside the story of Hirut, Aster and Kidane comes that of the Jewish Ettore, exiled from his family and only latterly learning of his father\u2019s own exile from his native Russia. As he waits for letters from his parents, he is confronted by the news that Jewish soldiers will be required to register their ethnicity, and begins to receive reports of growing antisemitism at home. It is both a reasonably conventional narrative \u2013 there is plenty of action, detailed description and a focus spread between the principal characters \u2013 and a subtly unpredictable one. History and modernity are juxtaposed in the factual asymmetries of warfare (the Ethiopians must rely on outdated and often malfunctioning weapons and have no way of long-distance communication beyond running messengers). They are also set side by side in the modes of consciousness that all the characters experience. While their instincts for battle, whether attack or defence, seem rooted in the primal, they are constantly having to adjust and update their viewpoints. For the Italians, the building of a great Roman empire must be captured on film; for the Ethiopian resistance, gender lines must be blurred for a greater chance of success. In her afterword, Mengiste notes that recollections of the war tend to cohere around the heroism of the outnumbered Ethiopian soldiers, \u201cstoic and regal like my grandfather\u201d. It was only much later that she discovered that her great-grandmother had taken her father\u2019s gun and gone to war herself \u2013 one of the women whose stories \u201ceven today have remained no more than errant lines in faded documents\u201d. Her achievement in The Shadow King is to bring to life those women, and to depict them as dynamic entities, their capabilities, limitations and beliefs evolving under duress in as fully complex a way as those of their male counterparts. \u2022 The Shadow King is published by Canongate (RRP \u00a316.99).

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not just Generation Rent that struggles with insecure lets, unscrupulous landlords and bad accommodation. There are more than 400,000 people aged over 60 living in private rented accommodation, up more than 60% from 2007. Research predicts a third of over-60s could be renting privately by 2040, as rising divorce rates and sky-high property prices take their toll. For some older renters, the prospect can be depressing as it could mean poor-quality accommodation, insecure tenancy, isolation. But a new service is dedicated to matching older homeowners with lodgers of a similar age. Since opening for business last week, Silver Sharers has signed up more than 500 prospective landlords and renters, with six members close to signing tenancy agreements. Suzanne Noble, the site\u2019s founder, said: \u201cI\u2019m 58 and I share my flat with my lodger, Ameet, 52. Despite my initial reservations about living with someone my own age, I\u2019ve discovered I like our setup far more than I would have imagined. Ameet and I often share meals together, we have mutual interests and, when I just want to have a chat, he\u2019s available. \u201cThe situation worked out so well that when my 62-year-old partner wanted to move into London to be closer to where I live, I helped to find him a similar arrangement and he now shares with a couple in their sixties. Now I\u2019m helping others to do the same via my website.\u201d In Paddington, west London, more than 20 putative renters and lodgers recently braved the wind and rain to turn up to the first Silver Sharers event, meeting potential matches over a glass of wine and a chat. Noble said: \u201cThis looks like fun \u2013 as if it\u2019s a matchmaking, dating game \u2013 but it\u2019s actually a massive relief for a lot of the people here to realise that they\u2019re not the only person their age to have to rent a room. \u201cOlder people are rightly nervous of using the usual websites to find rooms because of the scams,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, most homeowners on those sites overwhelmingly specify that they only want to live with younger people because most of them are young themselves. \u201cThe feeling can be mutual. A lot of older people don\u2019t want to rent from younger people either because they want their home to be a quiet, sedate space.\u201d The benefits are obvious: the number and proportion of people aged 50+ living in the private rented sector has reached a record high but one third of older private renters have borrowed money or cut back on spending in the last 12 months to meet their payments. At the same time, more than two thirds of homeowners aged over 65 have at least two spare bedrooms, with many not only grateful for the financial help but the company of a like-minded lodger. There is also the question of dignity. Trudy, 68, said she finds having to rent a room a degrading experience. \u201cI\u2019m humiliated by the fact I have to rent at my age but it\u2019s the hand that life has dealt me,\u201d she said. \u201cI owned my own house when I was married but gone are the days when the sale of a family home meant a divorcing couple could buy two smaller properties,\u201d she said. \u201cMy ex-husband and I are both renters now.

I also felt there were more avenues to go down with circus; acting felt a lot more restrictive.</p> <p>In my first year of studying at Bristol circus school <a href=\"https://www.circomedia.com/\" title=\"\">Circomedia</a>, I co-founded Circus Uncertainty, an entertainment agency, as I quickly realised that\u2019s where a lot of the money goes. We provide performers for events such as corporate circuses and weddings. The company took in \u00a3350,000 last year but most of this went to the performers. Profits are reinvested in the business rather than taken out as a salary.</p> <p>Last year I earned \u00a372,000 from freelance circus performing, which involved international events and long residencies. The previous year I made \u00a355,000. Circus work can be up and down. But I\u2019d say I work 60 to 80 hours a week on average.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/11/i-quit-life-as-a-bbc-journalist-to-live-as-a-jade-carver-in-china\">\u2018I quit life as a BBC journalist to live\u00a0as a jade carver in China\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It feels weird to be earning that kind of money as I\u2019m from a working class background in Barnsley. And it doesn\u2019t feel like I earn that income. I certainly don\u2019t act like I have that kind of money. I invest every single penny I can back into my businesses \u2013 this year alone, I\u2019ve spent about \u00a315,000 on juggling equipment and another \u00a322,000 on an LED piano. I\u2019m also starting to teach performers how to be better with money. I ran the first course in October and turned over \u00a310,000. But we made no profit as the course was very costly to run and a lot was spent on online marketing.</p> <p>I believe in a minimalistic lifestyle. I don\u2019t believe in lavish things and having a lot of clutter.</p> <p>I rent a three-bedroom house in Bristol and I lease out another room to a fellow circus performer. Originally I had the biggest room, an en-suite costing \u00a3500 a month, but I spend so much time on the road I thought it wasn\u2019t worth it. Instead I\u2019m in the smallest room, which is tiny and costs me \u00a3250 a month.</p> <p>I\u2019ve just bought myself a BMW 535d M Sport. It\u2019s about 10 years old and cost just under \u00a36,000. I spend most of my time on the road so I thought I might as well treat myself to a car I love. It wasn\u2019t very expensive but my insurance alone is \u00a32,500 a year because of my age.</p> <p>I have a property up in Barnsley that I bought more than two years ago for my mum. She was struggling with bills and I thought if I bought a house then she could just pay me the mortgage, which is \u00a3375 a month.</p> <p>I spend a ridiculous amount on food every month. I can\u2019t remember the last time I cooked; I\u2019m never at home. I\u2019m always in hotels and all sorts of accommodation while I\u2019m performing at different venues across the country. I buy dinner out and order takeaways \u2013 I eat a lot of unhealthy food. When you\u2019re on your feet, it doesn\u2019t matter. I spend about \u00a3700-\u00a3800 a month on food. I don\u2019t have breakfast or lunch; instead I\u2019ll just have a really big meal after a show. Generally I\u2019ll have three or four pints of beer a day and spend \u00a3300 a month on booze.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/04/i-used-to-be-silly-with-money-but-with-hare-krishna-ive-learned-self-control\">'I used to be silly with money,  but with Hare Krishna I\u2019ve learned self-control'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have a few savings accounts including an Isa which I used to help buy the property. I\u2019m a long-term shareholder and like to invest in big companies such as Google, Apple and pharmaceutical businesses along with some cryptocurrencies. I\u2019ve also been buying shares in a lot of cannabis companies. I try to invest between \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a month.</p> <p>My aim is to buy a new property every five years \u2013 that\u2019s my general rule of thumb. I\u2019d like to buy in Bristol but the property market here is pretty ludicrous at the moment. I plan to buy on the outskirts of Bristol and then London, hopefully. This seems like a better retirement option than a pension at the minute.</p> <p>Money is something I became interested in when I was in my late teens. It think it stems from coming from a background where money was always at the back of our minds. I just want to be prepared and to help others. When I was younger I looked at the wealthy people in the world and wondered what they were doing differently. It made sense to start holding money in stocks and shares, work hard and take big risks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Name: Joshua Morris Age: 25 Income: \u00a355,000 to \u00a372,000 Occupation: Circus performer and entertainment agency director, Bristol I was initially drawn to a career in the circus after I discovered performers earn a lot more than actors. I also felt there were more avenues to go down with circus; acting felt a lot more restrictive. In my first year of studying at Bristol circus school Circomedia, I co-founded Circus Uncertainty, an entertainment agency, as I quickly realised that\u2019s where a lot of the money goes. We provide performers for events such as corporate circuses and weddings. The company took in \u00a3350,000 last year but most of this went to the performers. Profits are reinvested in the business rather than taken out as a salary. Last year I earned \u00a372,000 from freelance circus performing, which involved international events and long residencies. The previous year I made \u00a355,000. Circus work can be up and down. But I\u2019d say I work 60 to 80 hours a week on average. It feels weird to be earning that kind of money as I\u2019m from a working class background in Barnsley. And it doesn\u2019t feel like I earn that income. I certainly don\u2019t act like I have that kind of money. I invest every single penny I can back into my businesses \u2013 this year alone, I\u2019ve spent about \u00a315,000 on juggling equipment and another \u00a322,000 on an LED piano. I\u2019m also starting to teach performers how to be better with money. I ran the first course in October and turned over \u00a310,000. But we made no profit as the course was very costly to run and a lot was spent on online marketing. I believe in a minimalistic lifestyle. I don\u2019t believe in lavish things and having a lot of clutter. I rent a three-bedroom house in Bristol and I lease out another room to a fellow circus performer. Originally I had the biggest room, an en-suite costing \u00a3500 a month, but I spend so much time on the road I thought it wasn\u2019t worth it. Instead I\u2019m in the smallest room, which is tiny and costs me \u00a3250 a month. I\u2019ve just bought myself a BMW 535d M Sport. It\u2019s about 10 years old and cost just under \u00a36,000. I spend most of my time on the road so I thought I might as well treat myself to a car I love. It wasn\u2019t very expensive but my insurance alone is \u00a32,500 a year because of my age. I have a property up in Barnsley that I bought more than two years ago for my mum. She was struggling with bills and I thought if I bought a house then she could just pay me the mortgage, which is \u00a3375 a month. I spend a ridiculous amount on food every month. I can\u2019t remember the last time I cooked; I\u2019m never at home. I\u2019m always in hotels and all sorts of accommodation while I\u2019m performing at different venues across the country. I buy dinner out and order takeaways \u2013 I eat a lot of unhealthy food. When you\u2019re on your feet, it doesn\u2019t matter. I spend about \u00a3700-\u00a3800 a month on food. I don\u2019t have breakfast or lunch; instead I\u2019ll just have a really big meal after a show. Generally I\u2019ll have three or four pints of beer a day and spend \u00a3300 a month on booze. I have a few savings accounts including an Isa which I used to help buy the property. I\u2019m a long-term shareholder and like to invest in big companies such as Google, Apple and pharmaceutical businesses along with some cryptocurrencies. I\u2019ve also been buying shares in a lot of cannabis companies. I try to invest between \u00a3200 to \u00a31,000 a month. My aim is to buy a new property every five years \u2013 that\u2019s my general rule of thumb. I\u2019d like to buy in Bristol but the property market here is pretty ludicrous at the moment. I plan to buy on the outskirts of Bristol and then London, hopefully. This seems like a better retirement option than a pension at the minute. Money is something I became interested in when I was in my late teens. It think it stems from coming from a background where money was always at the back of our minds. I just want to be prepared and to help others. When I was younger I looked at the wealthy people in the world and wondered what they were doing differently. It made sense to start holding money in stocks and shares, work hard and take big risks.",

I have to be. To concentrate fully, to lock everything else out and to force myself not to feel the cold is the only way I can cope with the temperature. Friends ask me how this can be anything but torture, but my swim routine feels almost ceremonial. The fjord is tranquil, beautiful and reflects the majesty of the surrounding 1,500-metre mountains. I\u2019ve tried swimming in the ocean, but the waves ruin it for me. They are meant for summer; winter waves are loud, unpleasant and cold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85b88f175d65c316615e6e55c6b7bf876efd5318\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85b88f175d65c316615e6e55c6b7bf876efd5318/0_205_5032_3019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jannet Aksnes swimming in Aurlandsfjord\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jannet Aksnes swimming in Aurlandsfjord</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jannet Aksnes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I go swimming every Saturday, year-round, but the most memorable experiences always occur in the crisp months. Mastering the salty water at zero degrees gives me an overwhelming sense of happiness. Occasionally friends come along, and I have invited \u2013 or forced \u2013 my two daughters to join, too. They enjoy it in July and August, but refuse to swim the rest of the year. Kids these days \u2026</p> <p>A friend of mine makes sure I feel safe. She lives on the other side of the fjord, and tells me that she keeps an eye on me to make sure I\u2019m OK. Once she took a photo of me with a zoom lens to prove her guardian angel capabilities.</p> <p>Leaving my clothes on the beach in a particular order is important. After leaving the water, I need to get out of my bathing suit, dry myself with a big fluffy towel and get dressed as fast as humanly possible, which means I have ended up in some really strange non-matching outfits. But I don\u2019t care, as long as I\u2019m warm. <br><strong>Stay</strong> <a href=\"https://www.flamsbrygga.com/hotel\" title=\"\">Fl\u00e5msbrygga Hotel</a> (doubles from \u00a3115 B&amp;B) or rent a cabin at <a href=\"https://www.flaam-camping.no/\" title=\"\">Fl\u00e5m Camping &amp; Hostel</a> (two to four people from \u00a370).<br><strong>Interview by Gunnar Garfors</strong></p> <h2>Rural life in the Apennines, Italy</h2> <p><em><strong>Francesca Iarusso, 30, from Naples</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d6a6a09defd220b6e49d5ee2aef63be98b50d4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6a6a09defd220b6e49d5ee2aef63be98b50d4a/0_0_3237_1942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of Montesarchio, Campania, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apennine ace \u2026 Montesarchio, in Taburno Camposauro, Campania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>About 40 miles north-east of Naples is the lesser-known region of Taburno Camposauro, dramatic countryside on the edge of Apennines mountains, where I go to escape the chaos of life in Naples.</p> <p>My partner Domenico and I are architects, so we are glued to the city in the week, but every weekend we love to drive out here to breathe the clean air and enjoy simple country living.</p> <p>During the winter these mountains are capped with snow and the villages are largely deserted, but in summer, when all the university students return home to visit their families, they are brimming with life. Friends converge on the slopes for picnics, or to go swimming in the <a href=\"https://www.termeditelese.it/thermae/\" title=\"\">natural Telese thermal pools</a> to the north, or spend a day on the high ropes and climbing walls of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/parcoavventuracamposauro\" title=\"\">woodland adventure park</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"24358e4d3e9e1feb4294fa843dc89e2459b0a026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24358e4d3e9e1feb4294fa843dc89e2459b0a026/0_114_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francesca Iarusso, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francesca Iarusso, right</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every so often one of the villages has a harvest festival or celebrates their local saint. These are popular events that mix pagan and Christian traditions. My favourite is the <a href=\"https://www.eventiesagre.it/Eventi_Sagre/2921_Sagra+della+Castagna.html\" title=\"\">Sagra della Castagna</a> \u2013 the chestnut festival in Vitulano in November. Religious processions flow through the streets, folk musicians play the pipes and farmers bring their produce to town to be enjoyed in a huge collective feast.</p> <p>Food plays an important role in daily life here. The soil is particularly fertile, which means that vegetables can be grown without fertilisers and cattle are left to graze freely on the hillside. Olives, potatoes and beans grow especially well but the valley is most famous for its wine. This is where the ancient Romans grew their vines.</p> <p>Several years ago, Domenico decided to do up a place in the quiet village of Cautano, where we grew up, which has allowed us to lead a healthier lifestyle. If once the weekends were for partying, they are now for relaxing, eating good food and feeling the benefits of being outdoors. The cottage backs on to a rugged hill, which is lined with vines and planted with fruit trees. As soon as we arrive from Naples, Domenico heads out onto to the hillside to tend to his produce and enjoy the peace. Underneath the house is a small cantina where we store the vats of olive oil, wine and tomato passata, which we make yearly, carrying on the tradition of our parents and grandparents.</p> <p>It\u2019s the desire for a more wholesome way of life that keeps drawing us back. However, we have noticed we are not the only ones enjoying the countryside: the villages are slowly repopulating as city dwellers are rediscovering the joys and health benefits of country living.<br><strong>Stay </strong>Family-run <a href=\"https://www.agriturismi.it/it/campania/cautano/agriturismo_al_poggio_antico.html\" title=\"\">Poggio Antico </a>Agriturismo (doubles from \u20ac70).<br><strong>Interview by Sophia Seymour</strong></p> <h2>Running, Serra da Freita, Portugal</h2> <p><em><strong>Hugo Brito, 45, from Porto</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d80bada477d210ac4e55a1943286d928c5ab8359\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d80bada477d210ac4e55a1943286d928c5ab8359/0_12_7350_4409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mizarela Waterfall, one of the highest in Europe outside the Alps, Portugal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mizarela waterfall, one of the highest in Europe outside the Alps.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I need a break from the city, I get in my car (or, if I\u2019m feeling energetic, get on my bike) and head out to the Serra da Freita, a range of low hills about 40 miles south-east of Porto. Although it\u2019s close to the city, it\u2019s always empty. I don\u2019t know why, because it has some amazing bike trails and climbing routes. But my main thing is running: that\u2019s mostly what I go there to do.</p> <p>There are some small villages around the edge of the range, hamlets really \u2013 places like Aldeia da Pena, Felgueiras and Mizarela. To eat, Felgueiras has a small restaurant that\u2019s popular with locals. A speciality is beef from these hills, which tastes completely different because the cows are reared naturally on pastures rather than in feedlots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e88bfa1e09e77ffb9bb4a88b8a5e6c0d694687c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e88bfa1e09e77ffb9bb4a88b8a5e6c0d694687c/599_1260_2651_1590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugo Brito\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugo Brito</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Serra da Freita isn\u2019t a formal park as such. It\u2019s more like this strange area of forgotten wilderness, full of granite boulders and coarse vegetation and biting wind. Once you\u2019re on the top of it, there\u2019s a vast plateau and you can see for miles. It\u2019s beautiful but really quite barren, only the odd tree here and there. The fog often comes down, which adds to the magical atmosphere of the place.</p> <p>There are some signposted hikes, such as the 8.5 km long Passadi\u00e7os do Paiva, on a wooden walkway, but I like to follow my nose when I run there. I just head off and see where the trails take me. The further you get into the range, the emptier and more barren it becomes.</p> <p>There are abandoned hamlets dotted about the place, which I love \u2013 a reminder that the area was once more inhabited than it is now.</p> <p>I\u2019m quite a sociable person usually, but when I run I really enjoy being by myself. I even spent my birthday there once, running through the night in the dark. Being alone helps me connect with the surroundings and clear my head. But when I go climbing, I always go with a friend. It\u2019s safer that way. The best climbing is around the Cascata da Frecha da Mizarela. Outside the Alps, it\u2019s one of the highest waterfalls in Europe, at 75 metres. There are different routes up to the top, some easy and some for more advanced climbers. <br><strong>Stay</strong> <a href=\"https://hotelruraldafreita.pt/en/\" title=\"\">Hotel Rural da Freita</a> (doubles from \u20ac55 B&amp;B) in Mizarela, just above the waterfalls. <br><strong>Interview by Oliver Balch</strong></p> <h2>Outdoor meditation, Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, Hungary</h2> <p><em><strong>Zs\u00f3fia Fischer, 42, from Budapest</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e82353a6ebc7a7f0b12dfe8c45077eeec3a2f266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e82353a6ebc7a7f0b12dfe8c45077eeec3a2f266/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, in winter, Hungary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, in winter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first started going to Dobog\u00f3k\u0151 mountain when I was a child. About an hour\u2019s drive from Budapest, it is easy to get there, but back then we would take the H\u00c9V, the city\u2019s suburban railway, and then get on to one of the bright orange and yellow buses.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t return until a few years ago, and when I saw that it was as beautiful as it ever was, high up in the Visegr\u00e1d mountains and overlooking the Danube, I wondered why it had taken me so long to come back. Dobog\u00f3k\u0151 translates as \u201cthe stone of the beating heart\u201d, perhaps a reference to the fact that the 700-metre peak at the heart of the area \u2013 called Dobog\u00f3-k\u0151 \u2013 has been considered the \u201cheart chakra\u201d of the Earth since ancient times by followers of the shamanistic T\u00e1ltos faith.</p> <p>Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, near the village of Pilisszentkereszt, has a spiritual feel. The moment you arrive you sense great calm. Past the ornate entry gate there\u2019s an easy trail through the forest. There is so much positive energy here \u2013 it is perfect for an outdoor meditation session.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ccd8dd7f09dc27c11cfabc76474357b5067c418\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ccd8dd7f09dc27c11cfabc76474357b5067c418/269_416_4984_2990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zs\u00f3fia Fischer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zs\u00f3fia Fischer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some people come in the summer but for me it is magical in the winter, especially if there is snow clinging to the trees. The air is crisp and sobering and there is a cosy ambience in the restaurants, like Zsindelyes Vend\u00e9gh\u00e1z in Pilisszentkereszt. It serves traditional Hungarian food such as bean <em>guly\u00e1s</em> (paprika-spiced soup), but its real draw is the setting, an old wooden hut in the hilltop village where you can take off your wet winter boots and warm up by the fireplace with a tea. </p> <p>Another atmospheric place in the village is the restaurant Baro Eotvos Lorand Menedekhaz. Try <em>bogr\u00e1cs</em>, the Hungarian beef stew cooked over open flames in a cast-iron kettle.</p> <p>The last time I was in Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, I brought my three-year-old daughter and we took her through the snow on a sled. From the smile on her face I could tell that she loved the experience as much as I had all those years ago. <br><strong>Stay </strong>In<strong> </strong>Pilisszentkereszt,<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.dobogokojurta.hu/\" title=\"\">Dobog\u00f3k\u0151jurta</a> is a collection of yurts (from \u00a315 for two people).

So when the sauna reopens its gates, it\u2019s a bit like \u201cOK, now we\u2019re back on\u201d. It\u2019s so small that everyone sits very close together and you end up having these great conversations.</p> <p>The social aspect is one thing, but the reason why people go there is to swim. You sit in the sauna until you feel like you can\u2019t take it any more. And then it\u2019s just a short skip and a jump to the jetty, and into the lake.</p> <p>The temperature of the water can be anything between 4C and 9C in the winter.

I have fond memories of visiting with my parents when I was a child, and I still love the cool, clear air of the mountains.</p> <p>The stunning landscape was created by glacial erosion of the huge limestone massifs in the Cantabrian mountains, resulting in rocky peaks towering over steep valleys with forests of beech and oak. Some peaks are over 2,600 metres, but you\u2019re still relatively close to the sea and rainfall is high so there is a lot of different vegetation: you can go from green pastures to craggy rock formations in just a few hours. While you\u2019re walking you often see <em>rebecos</em> (the small mountain goat native to the area, also called Cantabrian chamois) bounding over the rocks near the trails, and vultures overhead. There are also brown bears and even a few wolves, but sightings are rare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"557814d03ebaa843c15bbe73bbf130dbfad7c2d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/557814d03ebaa843c15bbe73bbf130dbfad7c2d4/0_0_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Jos\u00e9 Cacho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Jos\u00e9 Cacho</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started hiking there with a group of friends when I was in my early twenties on the network of hiking trails called <a href=\"http://www.elanillodepicos.com/en\" title=\"\">El Anillo</a>.

Every summer holiday I would stay there, filling my days with hiking trips, mountaineering and rock climbing. The village is the gateway to one of the most beautiful national parks in France, the Mercantour, home to some of the highest summits of the southern Alps. Its highest point is the Cime du G\u00e9las at 3,143 metres, which has been my favourite place since I first climbed it at the age of 13, having told my parents I was spending the day at the pool because they wouldn\u2019t have allowed me to go on my own.

I started going to <a href=\"https://oiti.gr/en/home/\" title=\"\">Mount Oiti</a> with my father when I was younger, and now make the pilgrimage with my husband and son. Although it\u2019s one of Greece\u2019s largest national parks, it remains fairly off the radar \u2013 even to many Greeks.</p> <p>We usually stay in the village of Pavliani, about a 2\u00bd-hour drive north-west of Athens. The first thing I do when we arrive is go to a river and simply sit a while. There\u2019s something about the sound of water trickling down a mountain that really brings me peace of mind. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the chaotic beach scenes you get on the islands.</p> <p>The activities we like to do are quite simple: hike the trails, go mushroom picking or explore the mountain villages by car. Often we are the only visitors here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76173504f3c8bc95a4fc1ed1e548736c4ef1ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76173504f3c8bc95a4fc1ed1e548736c4ef1ff8/0_225_688_413/500.jpg\" alt=\"Villy Rodopoulou\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Villy Rodopoulou</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to mythology, Oiti was where Heracles (Hercules to Romans) came to die. After being poisoned, the Greek hero trekked to the top of the mountain and built himself a funeral pyre, intending to die by self-immolation. The story enraptured the ancient Greeks, who built a temple to him on the same spot in the third century BC, and which remained in use until the late Roman period.</p> <p>The ruins of the temple, which are reached by a challenging hike from Pavliani or an equally challenging drive up dirt roads, are breathtaking. Whenever I need to disconnect, I come here. It may sound a bit strange, but there\u2019s something about sitting by an ancient temple on a mountain, contemplating all that has happened on these lands, that really relaxes me. I feel a deep connection to my country\u2019s ancient history.

One of my favourite activities is to take an excursion through the forest on the back of a Kamaz.</p> <p>The island is home to just 63 people in the winter but is much busier in midsummer, when we build a huge bonfire and dance late into the night. It is traditional to make garlands for young girls out of wild flowers, which they then put under their pillows before bed. We also search the forest for glow-worms.

I cycle all over but my absolute favourite spot is the Bohemian Switzerland national park. The mountains here are very exotic, different from the rest of the Czech Republic on account of the spectacular sandstone towers. The scenery blows my mind every time \u2013 it was here that The Chronicles of Narnia was filmed. There are lots of cycle routes in the region, and it\u2019s one I took recently that I\u2019d recommend.</p> <p>Start at D\u011b\u010d\u00edn (regular trains go there from Prague) and cycle north towards H\u0159ensko \u2013 a rocky village with gorges offering impressive views over the River Labe (or Elbe in German). Nearby is Prav\u010dick\u00e1 br\u00e1na: the biggest sandstone arch in Europe. Although you can\u2019t cycle to it, it\u2019s definitely worth locking up your bike and walking the two miles to it on foot.</p> <p>Once you\u2019re back on the bikes, pedal west towards the village of Jet\u0159ichovice, where there are several great viewpoints. It\u2019s a good place to camp, or stay the night in the Bellevue Hotel (see below).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38f471dc715b821a00ca9971cd8d01795570c02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a38f471dc715b821a00ca9971cd8d01795570c02/0_379_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pavel \u0160imek\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pavel \u0160imek, left</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day, head through the tree-lined valley of Doubice, which boasts five different rock types, and finish your route in Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 L\u00edpa. It\u2019s a tree-filled town in the north-west of Czech Switzerland \u2013 the name translates as \u201cbeautiful linden\u201d, referring to the country\u2019s national tree.</p> <p>As any cyclist will tell you, one of the best things about cycling is the beer at the end of it! This route is perfect for that because in Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 L\u00edpa is one of the best small breweries in the country, Falken\u0161tejn. They have loads of good beers on tap, but I especially like their bottled APA, Svi\u017enej Emil (Speedy Emil). It\u2019s named after the Czech long-distance runner Emil Z\u00e1topek, who won three gold medals at the 1952 Olympics. It\u2019s lower in alcohol \u2013 which is definitely a plus when you have to get back on the bike!</p> <p>I love cycling because you can see way more than on foot, and you can pedal away from other people to find your own quiet, peaceful spot. This region is perfect for that.

My favourite area is De Wouden, in the east of the province, which is totally untainted by tourism. There are quiet bicycle lanes everywhere and while I listen to the meadow birds and the spinning of my wheels, I feel all tension falling away.</p> <p>De Wouden means \u201cthe woods\u201d, but you actually come across a lot of moorland and meadows in this region. It\u2019s a simple and charming landscape. It\u2019s also very flat, which makes cycling easy and allows you to gaze far into the distance. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"074b103eb1dd762db2eb4189ab975992cff51e34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/074b103eb1dd762db2eb4189ab975992cff51e34/0_0_380_380/380.jpg\" alt=\"Dick Noordhoek\" width=\"380\" height=\"380\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Noordhoek</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Frisian people have their own traditions and language, of which they are extremely proud. They have a reputation for being stubborn, but they are very friendly and know all about slow living. Often, when you ask for directions, they start a lengthy conversation with you.

It is a tranquil place, with an air of mystery. On weekdays you have a good chance of finding yourself alone in the park, apart from a colony of red deer.</p> <p>Cycling through Frisia you see animals everywhere. Frisian horses, for example, that look like mythical beasts with their shiny, jet black coats and long, wavy mane. Once I spotted two white deer \u2013 albino twins, which, as the owner of a nearby tea garden told me, are very rare. She also said she didn\u2019t put photos of the animals on her Facebook page for fear of attracting too many visitors. That\u2019s what makes De Wouden such a relaxing place: people attach more value to living quietly than to doing business.</p> <p>Although Frisian bakeries sell delicious sugar loaves, ginger bread and <em>dumkes</em> (biscuits with aniseed), this is not an area where you will spot many exciting places to eat. <br><strong>Stay</strong> <a href=\"http://www.hetvolleleven.com/\" title=\"\">Het Volle Leven</a> has rooms and serves excellent three-course vegetarian meals.

      "bodyText": "Swimming, Aurlandsfjord, Norway Jannet Aksnes, 46, from Fl\u00e5m When I walk down the rocky beach and into the freezing Aurlandsfjord, I\u2019m almost in a trance. I have to be. To concentrate fully, to lock everything else out and to force myself not to feel the cold is the only way I can cope with the temperature. Friends ask me how this can be anything but torture, but my swim routine feels almost ceremonial. The fjord is tranquil, beautiful and reflects the majesty of the surrounding 1,500-metre mountains. I\u2019ve tried swimming in the ocean, but the waves ruin it for me. They are meant for summer; winter waves are loud, unpleasant and cold. I go swimming every Saturday, year-round, but the most memorable experiences always occur in the crisp months. Mastering the salty water at zero degrees gives me an overwhelming sense of happiness. Occasionally friends come along, and I have invited \u2013 or forced \u2013 my two daughters to join, too. They enjoy it in July and August, but refuse to swim the rest of the year. Kids these days \u2026 A friend of mine makes sure I feel safe. She lives on the other side of the fjord, and tells me that she keeps an eye on me to make sure I\u2019m OK. Once she took a photo of me with a zoom lens to prove her guardian angel capabilities. Leaving my clothes on the beach in a particular order is important. After leaving the water, I need to get out of my bathing suit, dry myself with a big fluffy towel and get dressed as fast as humanly possible, which means I have ended up in some really strange non-matching outfits. But I don\u2019t care, as long as I\u2019m warm. Stay Fl\u00e5msbrygga Hotel (doubles from \u00a3115 B&amp;B) or rent a cabin at Fl\u00e5m Camping &amp; Hostel (two to four people from \u00a370). Interview by Gunnar Garfors Rural life in the Apennines, Italy Francesca Iarusso, 30, from Naples About 40 miles north-east of Naples is the lesser-known region of Taburno Camposauro, dramatic countryside on the edge of Apennines mountains, where I go to escape the chaos of life in Naples. My partner Domenico and I are architects, so we are glued to the city in the week, but every weekend we love to drive out here to breathe the clean air and enjoy simple country living. During the winter these mountains are capped with snow and the villages are largely deserted, but in summer, when all the university students return home to visit their families, they are brimming with life. Friends converge on the slopes for picnics, or to go swimming in the natural Telese thermal pools to the north, or spend a day on the high ropes and climbing walls of the woodland adventure park. Every so often one of the villages has a harvest festival or celebrates their local saint. These are popular events that mix pagan and Christian traditions. My favourite is the Sagra della Castagna \u2013 the chestnut festival in Vitulano in November. Religious processions flow through the streets, folk musicians play the pipes and farmers bring their produce to town to be enjoyed in a huge collective feast. Food plays an important role in daily life here. The soil is particularly fertile, which means that vegetables can be grown without fertilisers and cattle are left to graze freely on the hillside. Olives, potatoes and beans grow especially well but the valley is most famous for its wine. This is where the ancient Romans grew their vines. Several years ago, Domenico decided to do up a place in the quiet village of Cautano, where we grew up, which has allowed us to lead a healthier lifestyle. If once the weekends were for partying, they are now for relaxing, eating good food and feeling the benefits of being outdoors. The cottage backs on to a rugged hill, which is lined with vines and planted with fruit trees. As soon as we arrive from Naples, Domenico heads out onto to the hillside to tend to his produce and enjoy the peace. Underneath the house is a small cantina where we store the vats of olive oil, wine and tomato passata, which we make yearly, carrying on the tradition of our parents and grandparents. It\u2019s the desire for a more wholesome way of life that keeps drawing us back. However, we have noticed we are not the only ones enjoying the countryside: the villages are slowly repopulating as city dwellers are rediscovering the joys and health benefits of country living. Stay Family-run Poggio Antico Agriturismo (doubles from \u20ac70). Interview by Sophia Seymour Running, Serra da Freita, Portugal Hugo Brito, 45, from Porto When I need a break from the city, I get in my car (or, if I\u2019m feeling energetic, get on my bike) and head out to the Serra da Freita, a range of low hills about 40 miles south-east of Porto. Although it\u2019s close to the city, it\u2019s always empty. I don\u2019t know why, because it has some amazing bike trails and climbing routes. But my main thing is running: that\u2019s mostly what I go there to do. There are some small villages around the edge of the range, hamlets really \u2013 places like Aldeia da Pena, Felgueiras and Mizarela. To eat, Felgueiras has a small restaurant that\u2019s popular with locals. A speciality is beef from these hills, which tastes completely different because the cows are reared naturally on pastures rather than in feedlots. Serra da Freita isn\u2019t a formal park as such. It\u2019s more like this strange area of forgotten wilderness, full of granite boulders and coarse vegetation and biting wind. Once you\u2019re on the top of it, there\u2019s a vast plateau and you can see for miles. It\u2019s beautiful but really quite barren, only the odd tree here and there. The fog often comes down, which adds to the magical atmosphere of the place. There are some signposted hikes, such as the 8.5 km long Passadi\u00e7os do Paiva, on a wooden walkway, but I like to follow my nose when I run there. I just head off and see where the trails take me. The further you get into the range, the emptier and more barren it becomes. There are abandoned hamlets dotted about the place, which I love \u2013 a reminder that the area was once more inhabited than it is now. I\u2019m quite a sociable person usually, but when I run I really enjoy being by myself. I even spent my birthday there once, running through the night in the dark. Being alone helps me connect with the surroundings and clear my head. But when I go climbing, I always go with a friend. It\u2019s safer that way. The best climbing is around the Cascata da Frecha da Mizarela. Outside the Alps, it\u2019s one of the highest waterfalls in Europe, at 75 metres. There are different routes up to the top, some easy and some for more advanced climbers. Stay Hotel Rural da Freita (doubles from \u20ac55 B&amp;B) in Mizarela, just above the waterfalls. Interview by Oliver Balch Outdoor meditation, Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, Hungary Zs\u00f3fia Fischer, 42, from Budapest I first started going to Dobog\u00f3k\u0151 mountain when I was a child. About an hour\u2019s drive from Budapest, it is easy to get there, but back then we would take the H\u00c9V, the city\u2019s suburban railway, and then get on to one of the bright orange and yellow buses. I didn\u2019t return until a few years ago, and when I saw that it was as beautiful as it ever was, high up in the Visegr\u00e1d mountains and overlooking the Danube, I wondered why it had taken me so long to come back. Dobog\u00f3k\u0151 translates as \u201cthe stone of the beating heart\u201d, perhaps a reference to the fact that the 700-metre peak at the heart of the area \u2013 called Dobog\u00f3-k\u0151 \u2013 has been considered the \u201cheart chakra\u201d of the Earth since ancient times by followers of the shamanistic T\u00e1ltos faith. Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, near the village of Pilisszentkereszt, has a spiritual feel. The moment you arrive you sense great calm. Past the ornate entry gate there\u2019s an easy trail through the forest. There is so much positive energy here \u2013 it is perfect for an outdoor meditation session. Some people come in the summer but for me it is magical in the winter, especially if there is snow clinging to the trees. The air is crisp and sobering and there is a cosy ambience in the restaurants, like Zsindelyes Vend\u00e9gh\u00e1z in Pilisszentkereszt. It serves traditional Hungarian food such as bean guly\u00e1s (paprika-spiced soup), but its real draw is the setting, an old wooden hut in the hilltop village where you can take off your wet winter boots and warm up by the fireplace with a tea. Another atmospheric place in the village is the restaurant Baro Eotvos Lorand Menedekhaz. Try bogr\u00e1cs, the Hungarian beef stew cooked over open flames in a cast-iron kettle. The last time I was in Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, I brought my three-year-old daughter and we took her through the snow on a sled. From the smile on her face I could tell that she loved the experience as much as I had all those years ago. Stay In Pilisszentkereszt, Dobog\u00f3k\u0151jurta is a collection of yurts (from \u00a315 for two people). There\u2019s also the apartment-style Erdei Villa (doubles from \u00a350). Interview by Alia Akkam Swimming, Gyllebosj\u00f6n lake, Sweden Hanna Scott, 42, from Malm\u00f6 Winter bathing is one of the main ways in which I manage stress. If I feel like there is too much going on at work, at home, or just generally, I escape to the sauna by Gyllebosj\u00f6n. It\u2019s a small, wooden sauna on wheels, by this beautiful picturesque lake, very close to our summer house in \u00d6sterlen. \u00d6sterlen is in the south-east corner of Sweden, attracts artists, writers, hippies and hipsters from Stockholm, and people with summer houses. The great thing about this sauna is that it only opens when the summer season comes to a close. So when the sauna reopens its gates, it\u2019s a bit like \u201cOK, now we\u2019re back on\u201d. It\u2019s so small that everyone sits very close together and you end up having these great conversations. The social aspect is one thing, but the reason why people go there is to swim. You sit in the sauna until you feel like you can\u2019t take it any more. And then it\u2019s just a short skip and a jump to the jetty, and into the lake. The temperature of the water can be anything between 4C and 9C in the winter. The sauna only opens in the evenings, so often it\u2019s very dark, with candles lining the path to the water. It\u2019s very beautiful here, surrounded by beechwood forest, with a starry sky above. Because the water is very cold, it\u2019s just a quick dip, then back into the sauna. After doing this a couple of times, you can feel your mind and body start to relax. Stay There are several cottages at the Gyllebo holiday village to rent from about \u00a325 per night on Airbnb, all of which are within 10 minutes\u2019 walk of the lake. There\u2019s an excellent hostel run by the Swedish Tourist Association in the nearby village of Baskem\u00f6lla, eight miles away (doubles from \u00a352). Interview by Richard Orange Hiking, Picos de Europa national park, Spain Juan Jos\u00e9 Cacho, 40, from Madrid I live in Madrid, but I grew up in Cantabria in the north of Spain, and I love to visit whenever I can. The Picos de Europa national park sits across the borders of three of Spain\u2019s autonomous regions: Cantabria, Asturias and Castile-Le\u00f3n. I have fond memories of visiting with my parents when I was a child, and I still love the cool, clear air of the mountains. The stunning landscape was created by glacial erosion of the huge limestone massifs in the Cantabrian mountains, resulting in rocky peaks towering over steep valleys with forests of beech and oak. Some peaks are over 2,600 metres, but you\u2019re still relatively close to the sea and rainfall is high so there is a lot of different vegetation: you can go from green pastures to craggy rock formations in just a few hours. While you\u2019re walking you often see rebecos (the small mountain goat native to the area, also called Cantabrian chamois) bounding over the rocks near the trails, and vultures overhead. There are also brown bears and even a few wolves, but sightings are rare. I started hiking there with a group of friends when I was in my early twenties on the network of hiking trails called El Anillo. We used to spend days in the mountains, staying at tiny, isolated mountain refuges. Perhaps my favourite hike is the ascent from Fuente D\u00e9 to the top of Pico Tesorero, but there are many to choose from. Apart from hiking, there is a lot to explore in the surrounding area: pretty villages like Potes with stone buildings in the distinctive Cantabrian style, and even some prehistoric caves. The local dish is a beef, pork and chickpea stew called cocido lebaniego, which is perfect after a long hike. Stay The isolated refuge Collado Jermoso (\u20ac15pp, meals available) is high in the mountains and can only be reached on foot. Sit on the little terrace and watch the sun set with a beer and all your problems fade to insignificance. For those who prefer a little more comfort, the Parador Nacional in Fuente D\u00e9 (doubles from \u20ac75) is next to the cable car that takes you up to 1,843 metres in a breathtaking four minutes. Interview by Annette Pacey Climbing, Mercantour national park, France St\u00e9phane Bertone, 50, from Nice My maternal grandparents are from Saint-Martin-V\u00e9subie, a small village 40 miles north of Nice, where my grandfather was the baker. Every summer holiday I would stay there, filling my days with hiking trips, mountaineering and rock climbing. The village is the gateway to one of the most beautiful national parks in France, the Mercantour, home to some of the highest summits of the southern Alps. Its highest point is the Cime du G\u00e9las at 3,143 metres, which has been my favourite place since I first climbed it at the age of 13, having told my parents I was spending the day at the pool because they wouldn\u2019t have allowed me to go on my own. Instead, I hitchhiked to the sanctuary of La Madone de Fenestre, eight miles away, where the mountain hikes begin. You can get the bus to it from Saint-Martin-V\u00e9subie. It takes about four hours to climb but the 360-degree views are magical; on the way up there are spruces, larches and pines, with chamois, ibex and marmots. Then after the treeline you\u2019ll get a better view of any eagles and bearded vultures overhead. It is a mountain I have climbed many times, both alone and with friends. There\u2019s a tough ascent for experienced climbers (with ropes) and an easier route for hikers. A few years ago a group of us walked to the summit from the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, 75 miles away. It took three days but it was an amazing experience, and despite a few aches and pains we all reached the top. In the mountains and especially at the top of G\u00e9las, I feel a sense of completeness. When I return to \u201ccivilisation\u201d, the benefits of being in nature and at altitude stay with me for a while. Whenever mental or physical fatigue reappears, I simply head for the mountains again! Escapade \u2013 Les Guides du Mercantour, in Saint-Martin-V\u00e9subie, offers accompanied walking tours as well as canyoning, trekking, climbing and via ferrata trips. Stay Chalet de la Madone de Fenestre (adult \u20ac20.20 a night, child over 8, \u20ac16.15) has 62 dorm beds and provides hot showers and meals, including a fine blueberry tart. Online booking required. Interview by Jon Bryant Walking, Mount Oiti national park, Greece Villy Rodopoulou, 52, from Athens Whenever I need a break from my job as a plastic surgeon in Athens, I head straight for the mountains. I started going to Mount Oiti with my father when I was younger, and now make the pilgrimage with my husband and son. Although it\u2019s one of Greece\u2019s largest national parks, it remains fairly off the radar \u2013 even to many Greeks. We usually stay in the village of Pavliani, about a 2\u00bd-hour drive north-west of Athens. The first thing I do when we arrive is go to a river and simply sit a while. There\u2019s something about the sound of water trickling down a mountain that really brings me peace of mind. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the chaotic beach scenes you get on the islands. The activities we like to do are quite simple: hike the trails, go mushroom picking or explore the mountain villages by car. Often we are the only visitors here. According to mythology, Oiti was where Heracles (Hercules to Romans) came to die. After being poisoned, the Greek hero trekked to the top of the mountain and built himself a funeral pyre, intending to die by self-immolation. The story enraptured the ancient Greeks, who built a temple to him on the same spot in the third century BC, and which remained in use until the late Roman period. The ruins of the temple, which are reached by a challenging hike from Pavliani or an equally challenging drive up dirt roads, are breathtaking. Whenever I need to disconnect, I come here. It may sound a bit strange, but there\u2019s something about sitting by an ancient temple on a mountain, contemplating all that has happened on these lands, that really relaxes me. I feel a deep connection to my country\u2019s ancient history. It\u2019s a kind of meditation that takes me away and makes me forget about the chaos of modern life. Stay Vasilikia Mountain Farm offers comfortable mountain lodging in Pavliani, (doubles from \u00a3135). Interview by Alex Sakalis Slow living, Prangli, Estonia Eveliis Kund Zujev, 38, from Tallinn I fell in love with the island of Prangli the moment my husband and I first arrived at Kelnase harbour nine years ago and were welcomed by our host, who drove us to our weekend holiday home on the back of an all-terrain vehicle. Local transportation is limited to ATVs, a fleet of rusty Ladas and a couple of army-green Soviet Kamaz trucks, and most roads are sand, rock and smashed corrugated roofing sheets. One of my favourite activities is to take an excursion through the forest on the back of a Kamaz. The island is home to just 63 people in the winter but is much busier in midsummer, when we build a huge bonfire and dance late into the night. It is traditional to make garlands for young girls out of wild flowers, which they then put under their pillows before bed. We also search the forest for glow-worms. It is said that if you find one you will be able to speak with birds and animals. I worked as an export sales manager until recently, which involved a lot of communication and travelling. But on Prangli I can shut out life on the mainland, and relax in the saunas, or by taking a walk along the beach at night, admiring the lights of Tallinn over the shore. From Tallinn, it is a 30-minute drive to Leppneeme harbour, where the Wrang\u00f6 ferry departs two to three times a day on the hour-long trip to the island. On our first visit we picked the Praaga holiday house at random, and found that Iivar, the captain of the old mail boat Helge, which until recently was the only connection to the mainland, was the owner. It seems wrong to call it a holiday house now, as for the past nine years my family have visited at least two to three times a year, even in winter, when there are almost no tourists. When we discovered that my husband\u2019s grandfather, who once worked as the island\u2019s doctor, delivered Iivar, we felt a deep connection to the island. Stay Praaga Farmstay (doubles from \u00a334 B&amp;B) is on the tip of the island and includes access to a traditional Estonian sauna. Iivar sometimes takes guests out into the Baltic Sea fishing and watching for seals. Interview by Daryl Mersom Cycling, Bohemian Switzerland national park, Czech Republic Pavel \u0160imek, 35, from Prague Being a civil engineer can be both busy and stressful, so I like to get outdoors at weekends. I cycle all over but my absolute favourite spot is the Bohemian Switzerland national park. The mountains here are very exotic, different from the rest of the Czech Republic on account of the spectacular sandstone towers. The scenery blows my mind every time \u2013 it was here that The Chronicles of Narnia was filmed. There are lots of cycle routes in the region, and it\u2019s one I took recently that I\u2019d recommend. Start at D\u011b\u010d\u00edn (regular trains go there from Prague) and cycle north towards H\u0159ensko \u2013 a rocky village with gorges offering impressive views over the River Labe (or Elbe in German). Nearby is Prav\u010dick\u00e1 br\u00e1na: the biggest sandstone arch in Europe. Although you can\u2019t cycle to it, it\u2019s definitely worth locking up your bike and walking the two miles to it on foot. Once you\u2019re back on the bikes, pedal west towards the village of Jet\u0159ichovice, where there are several great viewpoints. It\u2019s a good place to camp, or stay the night in the Bellevue Hotel (see below). The next day, head through the tree-lined valley of Doubice, which boasts five different rock types, and finish your route in Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 L\u00edpa. It\u2019s a tree-filled town in the north-west of Czech Switzerland \u2013 the name translates as \u201cbeautiful linden\u201d, referring to the country\u2019s national tree. As any cyclist will tell you, one of the best things about cycling is the beer at the end of it! This route is perfect for that because in Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 L\u00edpa is one of the best small breweries in the country, Falken\u0161tejn. They have loads of good beers on tap, but I especially like their bottled APA, Svi\u017enej Emil (Speedy Emil). It\u2019s named after the Czech long-distance runner Emil Z\u00e1topek, who won three gold medals at the 1952 Olympics. It\u2019s lower in alcohol \u2013 which is definitely a plus when you have to get back on the bike! I love cycling because you can see way more than on foot, and you can pedal away from other people to find your own quiet, peaceful spot. This region is perfect for that. The air is fresh, the views are incredible and I can clear my mind in preparation for another week at work. Stay The Bellevue Hotel (doubles from \u20ac30) in Jet\u0159ichovice has a great swimming pool (open in summer), perfect for resting your body after all the cycling. Interview by Mark Pickering Outdoor activities, Engreux, Belgium Jonathan Moskovic, 29, from Brussels Every two to three months I visit my in-laws in Engreux, a small village 100 miles south-west of Brussels. This hidden village, near the confluence of the east and west Ourthe rivers, is a haven of peace and nature. In winter, snowfall transforms the scenery into a postcard. There\u2019s sledging and skiing at Baraque Fraiture, one of the highest points of Belgium (652 metres), where there are three alpine ski slopes and several cross-country ski trails. In summer, I go kayaking on the river or swim in Lake Nisramont. Sometimes I walk in the forest and never meet anyone. I\u2019ve seen deer several times but never wild boars \u2013 although I\u2019m told they are there. One of the reasons for Engreux\u2019s secrecy is that it is difficult to access by public transport. From Brussels, you have to take a train for two hours to Libramont and then take two buses. I don\u2019t have a car so I opt for carpooling. I like meeting new people and chatting on the way. Stay My in-laws\u2019 neighbours rent a farmhouse with sauna called Le Tunnel De Saule , sleeps nine, from around \u00a3400 for three nights. Interview by Aubry Touriel Cycling, Frisia, the Netherlands Dick Noordhoek, 64, from The Hague For me, the most relaxing thing to do is to go cycling in Frisia, a green and peaceful province in the north of the Netherlands. My favourite area is De Wouden, in the east of the province, which is totally untainted by tourism. There are quiet bicycle lanes everywhere and while I listen to the meadow birds and the spinning of my wheels, I feel all tension falling away. De Wouden means \u201cthe woods\u201d, but you actually come across a lot of moorland and meadows in this region. It\u2019s a simple and charming landscape. It\u2019s also very flat, which makes cycling easy and allows you to gaze far into the distance. The Frisian people have their own traditions and language, of which they are extremely proud. They have a reputation for being stubborn, but they are very friendly and know all about slow living. Often, when you ask for directions, they start a lengthy conversation with you. It\u2019s easy to forget the time in the Frisian countryside. My favourite destination for a bicycle trip is an old mansion called Fogelsanghstate (Bird\u2019s Song Estate). It is a tranquil place, with an air of mystery. On weekdays you have a good chance of finding yourself alone in the park, apart from a colony of red deer. Cycling through Frisia you see animals everywhere. Frisian horses, for example, that look like mythical beasts with their shiny, jet black coats and long, wavy mane. Once I spotted two white deer \u2013 albino twins, which, as the owner of a nearby tea garden told me, are very rare. She also said she didn\u2019t put photos of the animals on her Facebook page for fear of attracting too many visitors. That\u2019s what makes De Wouden such a relaxing place: people attach more value to living quietly than to doing business. Although Frisian bakeries sell delicious sugar loaves, ginger bread and dumkes (biscuits with aniseed), this is not an area where you will spot many exciting places to eat. Stay Het Volle Leven has rooms and serves excellent three-course vegetarian meals. In the summer you can eat in the garden, which borders a forest and has chickens mingling freely with the guests. The atmosphere is, of course, totally relaxed. Interview by Renate van der Zee Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

These are for people to use to travel to and from their holiday destination. More than 30 companies have signed up so far, according to the charity Possible (formerly known as 10:10 Climate Action), which launched the scheme.</p> <p>These are for people to use to travel to and from their holiday destination. Crucially, these days don\u2019t come out of your annual leave allocation \u2013 so if, say, you get 25 days\u2019 holiday a year, you get those extra travel days on top of that.</p> <p>More than 30 companies have signed up so far, according to the charity. In return, employers receive accreditation \u201cin recognition of their climate leadership\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to cutting plane travel, the solution must be based in behavioural and social change because there is no real technological solution for cutting aviation emissions,\u201d says Emma Kemp at Possible.</p> <p>Although it recently signed up to Climate Perks, the ethical insurer Naturesave launched a similar initiative more than a decade ago for trips to Europe. \u201cIn recent years we have seen it grow,\u201d says the marketing manager, Nick Oldridge. \u201cOver the period we have run the policy, a quarter of staff have taken advantage of the benefit each year, resulting in an additional one or two days\u2019 annual leave per person.\u201d</p> <p>While he concedes there is a cost associated with this, there are undoubtable benefits. \u201cThose who use the scheme have reported they enjoyed their holidays more and rediscovered the pleasure of travel,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are also proud of being able to demonstrate to their friends and relatives that they have an employer who takes environmental issues seriously.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2fcff8f344e975596bdcf2e9f3bb71f42c5a2ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fcff8f344e975596bdcf2e9f3bb71f42c5a2ec6/784_405_3248_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abha Wells\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abha Wells enjoyed her overland trip so much she plans to take more.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abha Wells</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One employee taking advantage of the scheme is finance manager Abha Wells, who has used it for trips to Scotland and Belgium during the past two years. \u201cNot only was it better for the environment, but we were also able to take our bikes, which made it even better.

I was spending time with people who were disabled, dying, often people who were much less materially fortunate than myself. Having a foot in these two worlds gave me a perspective on just how unequal things are.\u201d</p> <p>Delaney\u2019s son Henry was two years old when he died from a brain tumour. Shortly after, Delaney posted a profoundly moving statement online about losing his son, and how he was determined to stay positive for the sake of his other children (Delaney and his wife have two older sons and a younger one born after Henry\u2019s death). \u201cI will endeavour to not go mad with grief,\u201d he wrote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f413a4a37c17f15ce8129122c9e45bf144ddda8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f413a4a37c17f15ce8129122c9e45bf144ddda8/0_0_2835_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delaney with Sharon Horgan in Catastrophe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delaney with Sharon Horgan in Catastrophe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Stewart/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As he dealt with the unimaginable trauma of Henry\u2019s deteriorating condition, he was also busy writing and filming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/13/catastrophe-rob-delaney-sharon-horgan-greatest-tv-ending-since-the-sopranos\">fourth series of the sitcom Catastrophe</a> for Channel 4. He was surprised to find that he could still work, that crippling grief was not incompatible with humour. He hired an office near Great Ormond Street Hospital so he could be near his son. He would film scenes and then head to a room to cry his eyes out.

It\u2019s an hour-long standup set that\u2019s hard to categorise \u2013 at times goofy and reliant on funny things his kids have said, but at others downright twisted. During one bit he concedes that he would probably use a futuristic sex robot if it was readily available; in another he tells the true story of the drunken car crash in his mid-20s that left him with a broken shoulder and wrist, and elaborates on how he was able to masturbate while in recovery: \u201cUsing my fingertips, ever so gently, like the way you would jerk off a baby if you had to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df8b322227d3421737de4288a2aad533094123d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df8b322227d3421737de4288a2aad533094123d0/33_58_1266_759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delaney in the new Channel 4 comedy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Powering on ...

He spent a long time working on one bit about the time he met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bill-cosby\">Bill Cosby</a> because he wanted to get the tone right. Early in his career, Delaney and his wife had been invited backstage to meet the comic before his crimes had come to light. Cosby told Delaney\u2019s wife that he could smell that she was breastfeeding then told Delaney to enjoy her breasts while he still could. As he describes it, the pair left thinking: \u2018Ewww \u2026 I guess we just saw Bill Cosby do the first creepy thing he\u2019s ever done.\u2019 And rather than trust what they\u2019d witnessed they questioned themselves. In the show, Delaney examines this behaviour, as someone who smelled smoke only to learn later that there was a big fire.</p> <p>Delaney, who was born and raised in Massachusetts, didn\u2019t plan to be a funny man \u2013 he studied performance at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and thought he might end up in musicals (he says he\u2019d like to present the Tony awards one day). But seeing the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/amy-poehler\">Amy Poehler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tina-fey\">Tina Fey</a> shortly before he graduated made him realise his true calling and so he began gigging.

Delaney has talked before about how Catastrophe used to feel like an exaggerated version of his own life \u2013 there are plenty of rows and the characters, also called Rob and Sharon, don\u2019t exactly hide their flaws. But now his real life experience has made what goes on in Catastrophe seem like a breeze. Is it strange looking back on it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"691fc2d2b1c3a796f4ea07ae6b2a1ef9cb428c0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/691fc2d2b1c3a796f4ea07ae6b2a1ef9cb428c0f/480_54_835_1044/800.jpg\" alt=\"RobDelaney \u2013 Jackie\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rob Delaney: Jackie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon Prime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says not: \u201cIt still feels like an honest show. And hey, more people can relate to Catastrophe than my own life, having lost a child, and thank God for that. But I look back at that show and feel like I left it all on the field.\u201d The final scene, where Rob and Sharon take a daring swim through dangerous waters, is one of the classic TV endings \u2013 strange, unnerving and deliciously unresolved. \u201cWe just really wanted to leave it up to the audience, as a show of respect to them. We were so grateful that anybody watched it at all, we wanted to give them something to mull over, to keep it working on their consciousness.\u201d</p> <p>It seems astonishing, really, that Delaney was putting all of this together while nursing a very sick child. Again, he credits the NHS for their care. If the family had been living in the US, he says, they would have had to spent the final months of Henry\u2019s life on the phone to insurance companies (providing they had cover in the first place) trying to wrangle cover for each separate bit of care. Instead he got to spend that precious time with Henry, which Delaney talks about lovingly.</p> <p>\u201cHe had Bell\u2019s palsy on one side of the face because of nerve damage, so half of his beautiful face was slack which is just <em>charming</em>-looking. It makes an already chubby toddler cheek even chubbier. And then just these little imperfections where you knew you had to be careful, like surgical scars on his head or when his hair fell out from chemo. A human head is warm, and it was such a pleasure to just hold his head and kiss it and rest your face on it. You don\u2019t <em>want</em> your kid\u2019s hair to fall out through chemo \u2013 but if it does, aesthetically, a sweet little fuzzy head is quite lovely to hold and kiss. If you think about how fascinating your average, bog-standard one-year-old is, then imagine that with all his little curious physical traits,\u201d he says with a warm smile.</p> <p>Delaney drifts off when discussing Henry, his face transforming into a full-beam smile when he alights on particular memories. In some ways, talking about Henry is when he\u2019s at his most comfortable. But then there will be times when he\u2019ll snap out of his reverie, look a little lost, and I wonder just how much he really wants to talk about it. Delaney says he\u2019s determined to be open because it might help other grieving families who don\u2019t have a support network to lean on \u2013 but sharing jokes and sharing cheese is one thing, sharing grief is another, and the mental effort of compelling yourself to do so can take its toll. Even in Delaney\u2019s own words he\u2019s far from OK and knows in some ways he never will be. \u201cI\u2019m damaged by my son\u2019s death,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m <em>messed up</em>. But I am trying to model good behaviour for my kids and as a side-effect it\u2019s leaving me in a better position. Obviously that\u2019s a testament to why families are wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>Delaney\u2019s family does sound that way. Last night he says he sat down with his wife and they completed a jigsaw puzzle of an old farmhouse in a field next to a lake. \u201cAnd I enjoyed myself so much,\u201d he says. What he loves most of all, he says, is to be sat on by as many of his children as possible at any one time. \u201cThe most important thing I will ever do is raise these kids to the best of my ability and be the best husband I can,\u201d he says. \u201cThat will leave a much greater mark on the world than any TV show I make.\u201d You sense the cheese man on the canoe would approve.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rob-Delaney-Jackie-Season-1/dp/B082V9DPSK\">Rob Delaney: Jackie is available now on Amazon Prime Video</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A fire was burning out-of-control on French Island at Victoria\u2019s Mornington Peninsula on late Saturday as firefighters backburned around the northern edge of a separate 90,000ha fire in Victoria\u2019s alpine region. On Saturday evening an emergency warning \u2013 the highest alert level \u2013 was issued for the French Island blaze at Ridge Track, which was travelling south towards McLeods Road. People in the area were told leaving immediately and heading towards the Tankerton Pier was the safest option, before conditions became too dangerous. \u201cEmergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,\u201d the warning read. About 130 firefighters from the Country Fire Authority and Forest Fire Management Victoria were also working on the Abbeyard fire in the alpine region near Bright, after warnings to the communities of Nug Nug and Buffalo River were downgraded from an emergency alert to a watch and act alert in the early hours of Saturday morning. Other communities around the north-western edge of the fire, from Dandongadale to Porepunkah to the Buckland Valley, were warned to be on high alert for changes in wind speed and direction that could cause an increase in fire activity on Saturday afternoon but no new evacuation warnings were issued. A spokesman for the Victorian State Control Centre said spotfires were reported in the Buffalo Valley overnight and crews were performing asset protection, but there was no confirmation that any private property was damaged. The bulk of the fire remained on public land. \u201cLast night and today our crews have continued to try and work at any backburning and burning out of the fire\u2019s edge,\u201d the spokesman said. Crews from the Australian defence force were clearing dangerous trees from roads and fire tracks around Cheshunt, Carboor and Rose River. The historic Buffalo Chalet, which sits at the top of 300m high cliffs in the Mount Buffalo national park, has so far been saved from damage. The most historic \u2013 and portable \u2013 artefacts were removed from the chalet some days ago and fire retardant has been dropped around the building as part of a critical asset protection plan enacted by state firefighting authorities. In East Gippsland, emergency services led a convoy of three dozen civilian cars from the Victorian town of Mallacoota to Eden, which is about 60km north over the border with New South Wales. Mallacoota has been cut off by road since 30 December, when fires first threatened the town, and authorities have warned that the roads may not be reopened to unescorted traffic for weeks while army personnel clear dangerous trees from the burned-out forest which overhangs the bitumen. People stranded in East Gippsland have been warned they could face a $250 fine for driving on a closed road to get supplies, even if the fire is no longer active in the area. Residents of the small town of Noorinbee told the Age they were running out of food, fodder and other supplies but had been told by police that they were not allowed to drive to their nearest supply drop-off point in Cann River, which is less than 7km away. The smoke haze that made the air quality in Melbourne \u201cthe worst in the world\u201d on Monday, and caused coughing fits among tennis players at the Australian Open, had mostly lifted in the CBD but was still hanging around the bay. The air quality in Melbourne and most of the state was rated as good to moderate on Saturday by the Environment Protection Authority but a statewide air quality warning remained in place. In East Gippsland it was moderate to poor, and poor to very poor in the north-east. The air quality in Greater Sydney, lower Hunter and the Illawarra remained poor. The NSW Rural Fire Service said firefighters were making the most of \u201cbenign conditions\u201d to control 75 active fires, of which 25 are yet to be contained. While conditions are milder in Victoria this week, the state did not receive the drenching rain that caused joyous scenes on farms in NSW and flash-flooding and road closures in Queensland. That rain also skipped the most recently fire-affected areas of NSW, including the south coast and the border region near Albury. Falls of up to 15mm were recorded in parts of East Gippsland early in the week but other areas received only a few millimetres.",

Talking about the fact that we had to write a review of our date. Good table manners? Nothing to complain about. Best thing about Charlotte? She was willing to call time straight after dessert, rather than continuing when we didn\u2019t have a connection. She also seemed to genuinely care about the children she works with. Would you introduce her to your friends? I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d enjoy the experience. They\u2019re very intrusive. Describe Charlotte in three words Prompt, assertive, mild-mannered.

Instead of the usual conventionally-pretty-woman-meets-conventionally-handsome-man trope, she wants to see love between able-bodied and disabled characters, mixed-race love and, why not, tall women with short men.</p> <p>It is with much shame that I admit to having been one of <em>those</em> women: the ones who judge the attractiveness of a partner as proportional to his height. My old online dating bio used to carry the tagline \u201csix foot and above only\u201d.</p> <p>I could distance myself from my height-shaming by telling you that 99.9% of my boyfriends have been under 6ft (in the same vein as racists who often attest \u201cbut I have a black friend!\u201d) but the truth is that I signed up to the mantra that taller means better.</p> <p>It does seem like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/21/praise-short-men-king-toxic-masculinity-jaboukie-jonas-brothers\">short kings</a> \u2013 the internet\u2019s pet name for short men \u2013 are having a moment. Ever since the comedian Jaboukie Young-White coined the term in 2018 (\u201cWe are valid. We are strong. We are at a lower risk of heart disease,\u201d he joked on Twitter) there has been more space to talk about short men being desirable. Why not extend this newfound acceptance of short men to the big screen?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/1217160787384586246\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In film and media I want to see short men with tall women.

But consider this: our obsession over tall men is related to patriarchy.</p> <p>Take the movies in which mixed-height couples do appear. In Shallow Hal, Gwyneth Paltrow (5ft 9in) towers over Jack Black (5ft 6in). The premise of that movie (man gets hypnotized so he doesn\u2019t realize he is dating an overweight woman) tells us something about the rules of attraction in a patriarchal world: a short man can date a tall woman, but only if she is fat (and he is tricked into it).</p> <p>In the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence (5ft 9in) plays Katniss Everdeen, who is taller than her partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, 5ft 7in). Peeta\u2019s character is soft: he\u2019s a bread-baker who hides from conflict rather than facing it. He can\u2019t compete with Everdeen\u2019s best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth, 6ft 3in) who hunts and blows things up. At the end of the movie, Gale indirectly <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/124227-did-gale-kill-prim-heres-why-its-hard-to-determine-whos-responsible-for-the-mockingjay-death\">kills</a> Katniss\u2019s sister, which should probably be a lesson to us all about toxic masculinity.</p> <p>If the problem with toxic masculinity is that it idolizes men for all those things that pointlessly connote masculinity without equating to it \u2013 violence, machismo, confidence \u2013 then why not consider height in this equation?</p> <p>People constantly (and wrongly) equate height with<a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/psychology/news/archive/title,251908,en.php\"> masculinity</a>. Men who are taller get promoted more, <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/5552-taller-people-earn-money.html\">paid more</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/18/voters-tall-politicians-leadership\">are considered better leaders</a>. CEOs have an average height <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tall-people-are-richer-and-successful-2015-9\">over 6ft</a>. <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/does-the-tallest-presidential-candidate-win-3367512\">Presidential candidates</a> who are taller are preferred (except in France, it seems).</p> <p>Height is an unattainable beauty standard for short men \u2013 what are they supposed to do, grow?</p> <p>Come on, feminists: to accept that there are conventional male beauty standards doesn\u2019t undermine our cause, it elevates it. Patriarchy isn\u2019t just a standard that entraps women, it\u2019s a standard that entraps everyone. This year, let\u2019s spotlight the worth of our short kings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week, the actor Jameela Jamil said she wants to see fewer dating stereotypes on screen. Instead of the usual conventionally-pretty-woman-meets-conventionally-handsome-man trope, she wants to see love between able-bodied and disabled characters, mixed-race love and, why not, tall women with short men. It is with much shame that I admit to having been one of those women: the ones who judge the attractiveness of a partner as proportional to his height. My old online dating bio used to carry the tagline \u201csix foot and above only\u201d. I could distance myself from my height-shaming by telling you that 99.9% of my boyfriends have been under 6ft (in the same vein as racists who often attest \u201cbut I have a black friend!\u201d) but the truth is that I signed up to the mantra that taller means better. It does seem like short kings \u2013 the internet\u2019s pet name for short men \u2013 are having a moment. Ever since the comedian Jaboukie Young-White coined the term in 2018 (\u201cWe are valid. We are strong. We are at a lower risk of heart disease,\u201d he joked on Twitter) there has been more space to talk about short men being desirable. Why not extend this newfound acceptance of short men to the big screen? Now, I know what you\u2019re all thinking \u2013 there is such a dearth of diversity on screen, should this really be the hill we die on? But consider this: our obsession over tall men is related to patriarchy. Take the movies in which mixed-height couples do appear. In Shallow Hal, Gwyneth Paltrow (5ft 9in) towers over Jack Black (5ft 6in). The premise of that movie (man gets hypnotized so he doesn\u2019t realize he is dating an overweight woman) tells us something about the rules of attraction in a patriarchal world: a short man can date a tall woman, but only if she is fat (and he is tricked into it). In the Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence (5ft 9in) plays Katniss Everdeen, who is taller than her partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, 5ft 7in). Peeta\u2019s character is soft: he\u2019s a bread-baker who hides from conflict rather than facing it. He can\u2019t compete with Everdeen\u2019s best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth, 6ft 3in) who hunts and blows things up. At the end of the movie, Gale indirectly kills Katniss\u2019s sister, which should probably be a lesson to us all about toxic masculinity. If the problem with toxic masculinity is that it idolizes men for all those things that pointlessly connote masculinity without equating to it \u2013 violence, machismo, confidence \u2013 then why not consider height in this equation? People constantly (and wrongly) equate height with masculinity. Men who are taller get promoted more, paid more and are considered better leaders. CEOs have an average height over 6ft. Presidential candidates who are taller are preferred (except in France, it seems). Height is an unattainable beauty standard for short men \u2013 what are they supposed to do, grow? Come on, feminists: to accept that there are conventional male beauty standards doesn\u2019t undermine our cause, it elevates it. Patriarchy isn\u2019t just a standard that entraps women, it\u2019s a standard that entraps everyone. This year, let\u2019s spotlight the worth of our short kings.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government awarded a $500,000 sports grant in the rural Victorian seat of Mallee a year and a half after it was first rejected \u2013 when the seat became hotly contested due to the resignation of Nationals MP Andrew Broad. The Northern Grampians shire council applied for the grant in September 2018 and was rejected in the first round of the controversial community sport infrastructure grant program, only to see the $500,000 Lord Nelson Park project in St Arnaud approved in April 2019, just weeks out from the election. Bridget McKenzie, the deputy Nationals leader and former sports minister responsible for the $100m program\u2019s distributional bias in favour of marginal seats, has so far resisted mounting calls to step aside or face a Senate inquiry into the program. In a scathing report, the auditor general found that 70% of projects announced in the second round in March 2019 were not recommended by Sport Australia, rising to 73% in the third round in April 2019 after an extra $40m was tipped into the program. A further Guardian analysis shows at least 69 of the 228 projects approved in the project\u2019s third round \u2013 when the election campaign was well underway \u2013 were in marginal seats. In Western Australia and Queensland, more than 80% of the projects approved in the program\u2019s third round were in Liberal and National seats. The analysis also shows how money began to flow to seats like Mallee deep into the election campaign. Mallee, a safe National seat, was thrust into the national limelight in December 2018 when Broad quit after allegations about improper conduct on a work trip. The seat attracted two Coalition candidates and a large field of independents, before the National candidate, Anne Webster, comfortably won the seat despite a large primary vote swing against her. Analysis of data on the Sport Australia website shows Mallee received $1.47m in grants but only $67,886 was awarded in the first round of the program. The vast majority ($1.4m) of the money was given in the program\u2019s final two rounds, including the $500,000 Lord Nelson Park project in round three. A former councillor and mayor of Yarriambiack shire council, Ray Kingston, who ran in the seat of Mallee as an independent, told Guardian Australia that it was \u201cmore than suspicious\u201d that the electorate experienced a \u201cmassive, unprecedented spike of announcements\u201d in the lead-up to the 2019 election, including through the sports grants program. A spokesperson for the Northern Grampians shire council confirmed the Lord Nelson Park project for a \u201cmultipurpose community sporting and events precinct\u201d to encourage participation by women, girls and the elderly was unsuccessful in the first round but later funded in the third round. According to the council\u2019s website, the Lord Nelson Park grant was announced by McKenzie and Webster on 4 May, a fortnight before the election. Kingston said \u201cgiven what\u2019s come out\u201d about the way McKenzie\u2019s office ran a parallel selection process, he believed, it was \u201cjust about a certainty\u201d the grant was targeted at the seat because it was hotly contested. \u201cI ran specifically because I believe Mallee has been missing out for years and years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we see the political pressure here bearing fruit.\u201d Webster has defended Mallee\u2019s share of sports grants, which she said amounted to 4.8% of funding allocated in Victoria. \u201cIn a sense we\u2019ve received more than our population base compared to the rest of Victoria just slightly, so I think you\u2019d be pushing [it] to say that we were pork-barrelled in any way,\u201d Webster reportedly told the ABC. \u201cI think the sport grants opened in the latter part of 2018 and it just so happened that I was preselected in the January, so the decisions of the sports grants were made in the March and the April.\u201d On Friday, Anthony Albanese said that McKenzie\u2019s position was untenable because Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations had been \u201cignored in favour of political decisions \u2026 based upon the marginality of electorates\u201d. Fergus Chisholm, the secretary of the Woodend tennis club in the safe Labor seat of Bendigo, told Guardian Australia its application for a joint facility with Braemar College was rejected after about 20 hours of work and \u201ca few thousand dollars for consultants\u2019 reports\u201d. Chisholm said revelations the funding allocation was skewed were \u201cvery disappointing\u201d but the club was \u201cfairly philosophical\u201d about whether it had missed out as a result. \u201cWe\u2019re not particularly aggrieved \u2013 you don\u2019t always get every grant \u2026 I\u2019d prefer not to buy into that.\u201d On Friday, the Greens, One Nation and Centre Alliance all lent support to a Senate inquiry of some form.

Trump previously had said that there were no injuries or harm caused to US forces. From the AP: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said defense secretary Mark Esper did not know of the injuries until he was told Thursday afternoon that the 11 troops had been sent for evaluation at US medical facilities \u2014 eight in Germany and three in Kuwait. Hoffman said the notification to Esper was in line with military procedures, which he said do not require notification of service member casualties to the Pentagon unless they involve the loss of life, limb or eyesight.</p> <p>As recently as Tuesday night, Trump said he had been told no American had been harmed in the Iranian missile strike on 8 January. The question of American casualties was especially significant at the time because the missile attack\u2019s results were seen as influencing a US decision on whether to retaliate and risk a broader war with Iran.</p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier on Friday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader delivered a rare sermon describing Trump as a \u201cclown\u201d who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/iran-supreme-leader-trump-clown-friday-sermon-ayatollah-ali-khamenei\">pretended to support the Iranian people</a> but would push a poisonous dagger into their backs.</p> <p>Some background on the 11 injuries: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlexHortonTX/status/1218160956678733825\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Days ago, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leloveluck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@leloveluck</a> reported U.S. troops suffered concussions in the Iranian missile attack, with some flung from a guard tower.<br><br>The Pentagon didn&#39;t announce the severity of injuries, or that 11 troops were evaced, until <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DefenseOne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DefenseOne</a> reported new details <a href=\"https://t.co/8ySNfp1dw3\">https://t.co/8ySNfp1dw3</a></p>&mdash; Alex Horton (@AlexHortonTX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexHortonTX/status/1218160956678733825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 17, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2245ed8f0879d539efa5a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-17T23:44:33.592Z\">11.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump has arrived at Mar-a-Lago for his first fundraiser of the new year, 94th as president. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/1218305607637159936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">First Family arrives at their Mar-a-Lago estate.

Some links and key events from the day: The White House unveiled Trump\u2019s legal team for his Senate impeachment trial, a list of attorneys whose own controversies threaten to overshadow their efforts to defend the president. That list includes Alan Dershowitz, known for defending the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and Kenneth Starr, the dogged prosecutor who led the investigation that culminated in the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton and lost a university post in 2016 for mishandling sexual assaults on campus. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo broke his silence on reports of alleged surveillance and threats to the former US ambassador to Ukraine. The House foreign affairs committee chair, Eliot Engel, scheduled a hearing for the end of the month to hear Pompeo\u2019s testimony about the use of force in Iran and Iraq. A coalition of 13 states, New York City and Washington DC announced they are suing the Trump administration over new restrictions for food stamp benefits for unemployed Americans. The US supreme court decided it will consider allowing the Trump administration to enforce rules that enable employers to deny insurance coverage for contraceptives. Chris Collins, a former congressman and one of Trump\u2019s earliest supporters, was sentenced to two years and two months in federal prison in an insider trading case. Police arrested three more men linked to a violent white supremacist group, charging them with conspiring to kill members of an anti-fascist group. Iran\u2019s supreme leader delivered a rare sermon at Friday prayers in Tehran in which he described Trump as a \u201cclown\u201d who pretended to support the Iranian people but would push a poisonous dagger into their backs. An appeals court dismissed a lawsuit brought by 21 youth plaintiffs against the federal government over climate crisis, citing concerns about separation of powers. The House intelligence committee has released new documents this evening relating to Lev Parnas, the close associate of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Parnas made headlines this week when he added to evidence that Trump personally directed an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival. The new records include contact between Parnas and a top aide to Devin Nunes, the Republican congressman and Trump ally: Some more details on the new documents in this thread from a Politico reporter. Police have arrested three men linked to a violent white supremacist group called The Base, charging them with conspiring to kill members of an anti-fascist group. The arrests come one day after three other alleged members of the neo-Nazi group were arrested on federal charges in Maryland and Delaware. Authorities have alleged that members had discussed opening fire at a pro-gun rally in Virginia: More from the AP: A criminal complaint included details of how some of the men built an assault rifle using parts, purchased thousands of rounds of ammunition and traded vests that could carry body armor. They were believed to be planning to attend the pro-gun rally in Richmond, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to the AP. In encrypted chat rooms, members of The Base have discussed committing acts of violence against blacks and Jews, ways to make improvised explosive devices and their desire to create a white \u201cethno-state\u201d, the FBI has said in court papers. On Friday, police in Georgia confirmed that three other men linked to The Base were arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and participating in a criminal street gang. Authorities said the men planned to kill a married couple who were anti-fascist protesters and believed killing the couple would send a message to enemies of The Base. Officials revealed today that 11 US troops were flown out of Iraq for evaluation of concussion-like symptoms after the Iranian missile strike. Trump previously had said that there were no injuries or harm caused to US forces. From the AP: The Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said defense secretary Mark Esper did not know of the injuries until he was told Thursday afternoon that the 11 troops had been sent for evaluation at US medical facilities \u2014 eight in Germany and three in Kuwait. Hoffman said the notification to Esper was in line with military procedures, which he said do not require notification of service member casualties to the Pentagon unless they involve the loss of life, limb or eyesight. As recently as Tuesday night, Trump said he had been told no American had been harmed in the Iranian missile strike on 8 January. The question of American casualties was especially significant at the time because the missile attack\u2019s results were seen as influencing a US decision on whether to retaliate and risk a broader war with Iran. Earlier on Friday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader delivered a rare sermon describing Trump as a \u201cclown\u201d who pretended to support the Iranian people but would push a poisonous dagger into their backs. Some background on the 11 injuries: Trump has arrived at Mar-a-Lago for his first fundraiser of the new year, 94th as president. It\u2019s apparently his 344th day at a Trump property as president. Chris Collins, a former congressman and one of Trump\u2019s earliest supporters, has just been sentenced to two years and two months in federal prison in an insider trading case. Collins was previously forced to resign and had admitted he helped his son and others dodge $800,000 in stock market losses when he learned that a drug trial by a small pharmaceutical company had failed. From the AP: Collins, 69, was sentenced by US district judge Vernon S Broderick in Manhattan after the Republican pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and lying to law enforcement officials. Collins broke down and apologized to his family and his former constituents and colleagues. \u201cI stand here today as a disgraced former member of Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life has been shattered.\u201d The sentence came even after Collins\u2019 lawyers argued he was sorry and should face no prison time in the insider trading case. Prosecutors asked for a five-year sentence. There\u2019s been another release of secret FBI documents from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, published by BuzzFeed, which sued the US government for the records: The documents are heavily redacted, and reporters are currently reviewing them: Trump is also tweeting about the conflict in Virginia, where an intense political fight over gun policy has escalated this month. The president claimed that the second amendment is \u201cunder very serious attack\u201d in Virginia and that Democrats \u201cwill take your guns away\u201d. As my colleague Lois Beckett recently reported, the backlash to gun control efforts in the state have been fueled by conspiracy theories and misinformation: Earlier this week, the FBI arrested three suspected members of a neo-Nazi group, with authorities alleging that they had built a machine gun and had hoped to spark violence before a planned gun-rights rally in Virginia. The governor had banned guns from the capitol before the rally and declared a state of emergency due to concerns of violence. One Virginia legislator, who is a socialist, told the Guardian that he had been facing death threats over his bill that pro-gun activists wrongly interpreted as a threat to gun rights. The legislation was related to public school teachers and had nothing to do with guns. Here\u2019s a response this evening from a Virginia congressman to Trump\u2019s tweet: Trump has responded to the reports that Iran\u2019s supreme leader called him a \u201cclown\u201d during a rare sermon at Friday prayers in Tehran, tweeting, \u201cHe should be very careful with his words!\u201d More on the earlier remarks from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei here: Trump reportedly said he regretted that his administration got involved in vaping policy, according to a new report in Axios, citing sources familiar with the president\u2019s private conversation: According to Axios, the president told his health secretary, \u201cI should never have done that fucking vaping thing.\u201d The president has pushed a ban on flavored vapes. There\u2019s new info out on the rules for the next Democratic debate, on 7 February in New Hampshire, which will be the first one after voting has begun. Based on the new rules, the qualifying candidates appear to be Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren, according to ABC News, which is hosting the debate. That\u2019s the same (all-white) group that debated earlier this week. Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. The US supreme court has just decided it will consider allowing the Trump administration to enforce rules that enable employers to deny insurance coverage for contraceptives. The justices agreed that they will hear yet another case challenging Obama\u2019s healthcare law, with arguments expected in April. More from the AP: The high court will review an appeals court ruling that blocked the Trump administration rules because it did not follow proper procedures. The new policy on contraception, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, would allow more categories of employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious objections. The policy also would allow some employers, though not publicly traded companies, to raise moral objections to covering contraceptives. Employers also would be able to cover some birth control methods, and not others. Some employers have objected to covering modern, long-acting implantable contraceptives, such as IUDs, which are more expensive and considered highly effective in preventing pregnancies. Some reactions and context: Hello again, US politics watchers, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin on the west coast will take over the blog now and keep you covered for the next few hours. Main events this afternoon so far: The House foreign affairs committee chair, Eliot Engel, has scheduled a hearing for the end of the month to hear the testimony of the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, about the use of force in Iran and Iraq. A coalition of 13 states, New York City and Washington DC are suing the Trump administration over new restrictions for food stamp benefits for unemployed Americans. The US court of appeals for the ninth circuit struck down a lawsuit filed by 21 young people who sued the federal government claiming that it has failed to address the climate crisis. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, is fighting the narrative she can\u2019t run for president and participate in the Senate impeachment trial. A delegation from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) is in Brownsville, Texas and Matamoros, Mexico today as part of an investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s Remain in Mexico policy and the use of tent courts to process those cases. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, a Democrat from California, said a child from El Salvador with Down syndrome and a heart condition was not being allowed to seek entry in the US, despite having family in Philadelphia. After being pressured by Congresspeople, Barrag\u00e1n said US Customs and Border Patrol admitted the child, who could seek parole for medical help. A jury of seven men and five women were picked for the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial today after a two-week selection process in which scores of people were dismissed. Opening statements are expected to begin on Wednesday. More from the AP: During jury selection, prosecutors had accused Weinstein\u2019s lawyers of systematically trying to keep young women off the panel, though the final makeup of the jury turned out to be more closely balanced. For its part, the defense raised an outcry and demanded a mistrial because one of the jurors is the author of an upcoming novel about young women dealing with predatory older men. The request was denied, but Weinstein\u2019s lawyers continued to claim outside court that the juror had withheld the information on her questionnaire. The House foreign affairs committee chair, Eliot Engel, has scheduled a hearing for the end of the month to hear the testimony of the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, about the use of force in Iran and Iraq. The hearing was supposed to happen this week, but Pompeo refused to participate. The hearing is being held in part because of the fatal strike on the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani earlier this month, which spurred questions about the Trump administration\u2019s strategy in the Middle East and whether it would be sharing that information with Congress. A coalition of 13 states, New York City and Washington DC are suing the Trump administration over new restrictions for food stamp benefits for unemployed Americans \u2013 a measure they say could disqualify nearly 700,000 from federal food assistance. The lawsuit is the latest pushback by Democratic states against the Trump administration, as opponents criticize the president for what they say are proposed changes that target the poor, unemployed and those in large metropolitan areas. The US government is moving to cut the amount of fruits and vegetables required in school lunches and expanding schools\u2019 ability to sell them more pizza, burgers and fries. The US department of agriculture (USDA) announced the proposed rule change on Friday, which happened to be the birthday of the woman who helped improve the vegetable and fruit the USDA is undoing: Michelle Obama. Colin Schwartz, deputy director of legislative affairs for Center for Science in the Public Interest, told the Washington Post that the rules, if finalized, \u201cwould create a huge loophole in school nutrition guidelines, paving the way for children to choose pizza, burgers, french fries and other foods high in calories, saturated fat or sodium in place of balanced school meals every day.\u201d The US court of appeals for the ninth circuit struck down a lawsuit filed by 21 young people who sued the federal government claiming that it has failed to address the climate crisis. In a divided opinion, the court determined the young people do not have the standing to pursue the case in federal court. \u201cWe do not dispute that the broad judicial relief the plaintiffs seek could well goad the political branches into action,\u201d wrote judge Andrew Hurwitz in an opinion. \u201cWe reluctantly conclude, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 case must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large, the latter of which can change the composition of the political branches through the ballot box.\u201d Judge Josephine Staton wrote a strongly-worded dissent which compared the climate crisis to an asteroid barreling towards Earth. \u201cSeeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the nation,\u201d Staton wrote. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash said that since Evelyn Yang, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang\u2019s wife, revealed last night that she was sexually assaulted by her obstetrician-gynecologist while she was pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child, more women have come forward with allegations against the same doctor. Yang said in an interview televised on Thursday by CNN that the assault happened in 2012, and she was initially afraid to tell anyone. She and 31 other women were suing the doctor and hospital system, saying they conspired and enabled the crimes. Today, six more women have come forward, according to Bash. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, is fighting the narrative she can\u2019t run for president and participate in the Senate impeachment trial at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m a mom, I can do two things at once,\u201d Klobuchar said today on CBS This Morning. Klobuchar is one of four candidates in the Senate who will be obligated to be in Washington DC for the impeachment trial weeks before the critical Iowa caucus. But two others, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have much stronger support in the pools and the fourth, Michael Bennet, is considered much more of a long shot than Klobuchar. In the interview she said she had a strong network in Iowa and planned to \u201cSkype-in or phone-in,\u201d to some campaign events. \u201cWhen I can go campaign in those early states, including Nevada and South Carolina, I will,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when I have to be there [the Senate], I will.\u201d Arizona senator, Martha McSally, a Republican, went Washington DC-viral yesterday after a CNN journalist asked her if the Senate should \u201cconsider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial?\u201d The senator responded by calling the reporter, Manu Raju, \u201ca liberal hack.\u201d Within hours of the encounter, McSally had registered the domain name \u201cliberalhack.com\u201d and then started selling a t-shirt to fundraise for her campaign that reads: \u201cYou\u2019re a liberal hack, buddy.\u201d But when asked the same question by Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham on Thursday night, McSally continued to fight the question - suggesting her problem is with \u201chacks\u201d of all political stripes. In response to McCally swerving the question once, Ingraham pressed: \u201cYou can call me a conservative hack, but do you want witnesses, yes or no? Why aren\u2019t you telling us?\u201d McSally said the public would have to wait and see what she did. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell everyone what my votes are going to be,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty easy question, don\u2019t you think, senator?\u201d Ingraham interjected. One CNN reporter noted McSally\u2019s feelings about the news company haven\u2019t always been so negative: Secretary of state Mike Pompeo broke his silence about alleged surveillance and threats to the former US ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cWe will do everything we need to do to evaluate whether there was something that took place there,\u201d Pompeo said in a radio interview with Tony Katz, a right-wing radio host. More than eight in 10 black Americans said they believe Donald Trump is a racist, according to a national poll by the Washington Post and Ipsos published this morning. Donald Trump\u2019s legal team for the impeachment trial is set to include: Kenneth Starr (the independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial), Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz and Robert Ray, among others. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are attempting to move on from a testy exchange they had on the debate stage this week, after tensions between to the two longtime friends reached a flash point as they compete for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Donald Trump started his Friday by attacking Mike Bloomberg, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. The squabbling between Bloomberg and Trump, both billionaires from New York, comes after the for years kept a cordial and even friendly relationship as they repeatedly ran into each other at charity events and parties writes Guardian senior political reporter, Daniel Strauss: Trump has even praised Bloomberg\u2019s past positions on gun control on Fox News\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends. Bloomberg has also thrown Trump some kind words. At the same ribbon-cutting ceremony Bloomberg said: \u201cIf there is anybody who has changed this city, it is Donald Trump.\u201d In 2004, Bloomberg appeared on an episode of The Apprentice. Trump at the time said he invited Bloomberg on to the show because he had \u201cgreat respect for him\u201d. Yet even back then the identities they each fostered as famous billionaires were radically different. They ran in different social circles. Nearly 72 hours after reports emerged about alleged surveillance and threats to the former US ambassador to Ukraine, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo broke his silence about the issue in interviews with conservative radio hosts. Pompeo said he had an obligation to investigate the claims, but believed they would be proven wrong. His silence was criticized by current and former diplomats after documents provided by an associate of Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Lev Parnas, suggested there may have been a threat to the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch. \u201cWe will do everything we need to do to evaluate whether there was something that took place there,\u201d Pompeo said in a radio interview with Tony Katz, a right-wing radio host. \u201cI suspect that much of what\u2019s been reported will ultimately prove wrong, but our obligation, my obligation as secretary of state, is to make sure that we evaluate, investigate. Any time there is someone who posits that there may have been a risk to one of our officers, we\u2019ll obviously do that.\u201d \u201cIt is always the case at the Department of State that we do everything we can to ensure that our officers, not only our ambassadors but our entire team, has the security level that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Pompeo said. At the White House today, Donald Trump is honoring the 2019 college football national champions before heading to Mar-a-Lago. He told the players, speaking about the presidency and himself: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good one now, even though they\u2019re trying to impeach the son of a bitch. Can you believe that?\u201d The anti-abortion group Susan B Anthony List on Friday said it plans to spend $52m to help Donald Trump win the 2020 election. The day before, women\u2019s health group Planned Parenthood said it would spend $45m on candidates who support a woman\u2019s right to seek an abortion. It is the most election spending for both groups in history, according to CNBC. More reports are emerging about what Trump\u2019s impeachment legal team will look like. Former Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, and a lawyer for Trump in the Mueller investigation, Jane Raskin, are also said to be on the list. The only official announcement about the legal team has come from Alan Dershowitz. Other names on the list have come from journalists, citing a source. Dershowitz is one of the best known attorneys in the US after representing high-profile people including OJ Simpson and Jeffrey Epstein. Axios reported that several White House officials had said they didn\u2019t want Dershowitz on the team because of his ties to Epstein. Starr also was involved with the Epstein case, as is noted in this Miami Herald article from Nov 2018: Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, Jay Lefkowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Jack Goldberger, Roy Black, Guy Lewis and former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr \u2014 reached a consensus: Epstein would never serve time in a federal or state prison. Trump is ... Team Bernie? Shortly after the notorious independent counsel in Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, Kenneth Starr, was named to Trump\u2019s impeachment defense team, a woman who said Starr turned her life into \u201cliving hell,\u201d has something to say: In September 2018, the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington asked Starr if he owed Lewinsky an apology. Starr responded: \u201cNo.\u201d He added: \u201cI regret the sorrow she went through, the travail she went through.\u201d Starr is asked the same question, again, in the interview, which is well worth reading in full: Donald Trump\u2019s legal team for the impeachment trial will include: Kenneth Starr (the independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial), Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz and Robert Ray, according to multiple US news outlets. They will join White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and Trump attorney, Jay Sekulow. In a statement to the New York Times, a representative for Trump\u2019s legal team said: \u201cProfessor Dershowitz will present oral arguments at the Senate trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and approval.\u201d The statement said Dershowitz is \u201cnon partisan when it comes to the constitution\u201d and \u201cis participating in this impeachment trial to defend the integrity of the Constitution and to prevent the creation of a dangerous constitutional precedent.\u201d More than eight in 10 black Americans said they believe Donald Trump is a racist according to a national poll by the Washington Post and Ipsos published this morning. The same amount, 83%, said Trump has made racism a bigger problem in the US. The survey of 1,008 non-Hispanic black people also found that nine in 10 black people disapprove of his job performance. Of those surveyed who planned not to vote for Trump, 75% said it was \u201cextremely important\u201d Trump does not win a second term and 14% said it was \u201cvery important.\u201d Among those who \u201cleaned Democratic,\u201d 40% said they would support Joe Biden if the Democratic primary was today. The second most popular candidate was Bernie Sanders, with 20% support. More from the big Politico story about Warren and Sanders\u2019 attempts to put an end to talk of their conflict, which has \u201cfreaked out left-wing organizations and activists who see the conflict as a boon to Biden \u2014 and insist it\u2019s all in the rearview mirror.\u201d \u2026 fully exorcising the conflict will be more difficult than simply having the candidates proclaim that it\u2019s over. Warren and many on her campaign responded intensely after POLITICO reported that the Sanders campaign had quietly deployed talking points to its canvassers in multiple early states that included language attacking her electability. The talking points weren\u2019t particularly vicious, but the leaked script struck a raw nerve with Warren and her campaign because they felt they had held up their end of a nonaggression pact with Sanders \u2014 even after some Sanders staffers and surrogates had spent most of the race hitting Warren. The Warren campaign got so frustrated about critical tweets and comments from Sanders\u2019 staffers that it privately expressed its displeasure to Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir last summer. But top Sanders aides kept throwing elbows throughout the fall. Hello and good morning. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are attempting to move on from a testy exchange they had on the debate stage this week, after tensions between to the two longtime friends reached a flash point as they compete for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Politico obtained talking points from the Sanders campaign which include: \u201cPlease refrain from commenting on the CNN story on the meeting between Bernie and Sen Elizabeth Warren.\u201d And Warren on Thursday told reporters she had \u201cno further comment\u201d on the matter. The two senators will spend their weekend campaigning and preparing for the Senate impeachment trial, which will keep them away from the presidential race for at least the next few weeks. The impeachment trial doesn\u2019t start again until Tuesday, but the impeachment managers and legal team for Trump will be spending the long holiday weekend preparing legal briefs and preparing to make their case. Today, Donald Trump is welcoming the championship college football team, Louisiana State University, to the White House before jetting off to Mar-a-Lago.",

The cast of this landmark Aboriginal play, set in the 1960s, delivers this long-awaited new production with brio, instilling hope that with unity there is a way forward to reconciliation. Marcus Corowa gives a fabulously open-hearted and limber performance as Willie, the rebellious Aboriginal teenager who runs away from his Catholic boarding mission school in Perth, run by strict disciplinarian Father Benedictus (Andrew Moran). Hitch-hiking his way home to remote coastal Broome, Willie falls in with the irascible elder Uncle Tadpole, played Ernie Dingo, reprising his role in the original stage production and later film adaptation. Uncle Tadpole says he has given up his days of droving \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t given up his days of drinking. The pair catch a lift with two hippies driving a Kombi van, German tourist Slippery (Callan Purcell) and his friend Marijuana Annie (understudy Danielle Sibosado in the opening night performance).

This goodwill flows through Bran Nue Dae. But Chi also understood the darkness, as he struggled for years with mental illness: an inquest heard in 2019 that Chi did not have access to an appropriate health facility when he died in 2017, aged 69. Under the direction of Andrew Ross, who has also directed Chi\u2019s other noted musical Corrugation Road, there is a reverence for the original production in this new production by The Opera Conference, the national partnership of opera companies; Ernie Dingo told the audience after the opening night performance that the cast was keen to stay as true as possible to Chi\u2019s original approach. But a couple of structural lessons could have been heeded from Rachel Perkins\u2019s 2009 film version, co-written with Reg Cribb.

      "bodyText": "Every great race deserves a replay and last month\u2019s thrilling Tingle Creek could be played out once more at Ascot, where the first and second face each other in the Clarence House Chase. Defi Du Seuil (3.35) is rightly favourite to come out on top again. This could be called an away game for him, as he was beaten at odds-on when he last ran at Ascot, whereas Un De Sceaux is a triple winner of this race. But Defi\u2019s yard was under a cloud when he flopped here in 2017 and he has since made up into an exciting chaser. With Philip Hobbs\u2019s runners in great form, he should get his third win of the season. 1.50 Ascot Papagana should not be underestimated but it is easy enough to accept Magic Of Light as the superior talent and she can repeat last year\u2019s success. 2.05 Haydock A hood is tried on Edwardstone, who raced keenly in victory at Aintree last month. He wouldn\u2019t get away with similar behaviour on this deeper ground and Thebannerkingrebel makes more appeal. He won here in November and should thrive in the mud, though his jumping could be tidier. 2.25 Ascot A disappointing eight runners for this handicap hurdle, which may fall to the only last-time-out winner, Bold Plan. A progressive type with Evan Williams, he was impressive at Haydock in November and can defy a 10lb rise. 2.40 Haydock It was a huge run by the confusingly named Acting Lass to be second in Ascot\u2019s Silver Cup just before Christmas, giving 5lb to the winner, a course specialist. He comes from an in-form yard, so there is every hope of a similar effort here, which would probably be enough. Midnight Tune is hard to weigh up but should go well from the other end of the weights. 3.00 Ascot Espoir De Guye was breathtakingly good around here four weeks ago but he has been raised a stone and the opposition is classier this time. Preference is for Happy Diva, who is having such a great winter. Having landed the BetVictor in November, she ran to a similar level when just a head behind Lady Buttons last time and still looks ahead of her mark. 3.15 Haydock It\u2019s surprising to see Pentland Hills sent here, as a free-going sort who finished weakly last time, a profile which ought to make him vulnerable in this mud. Moreover, he meets all three rivals on worse terms than if this were a handicap. It\u2019s a tricky contest but Ballyandy may be the percentage play after his fair third in the Christmas Hurdle. He should be staying on stoutly at the finish.",
