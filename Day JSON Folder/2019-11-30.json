      "body": "<p>I thought about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bxwv\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney and the Music of What Happens</a> (BBC Two) long after the credits had passed, and not just because it is a gorgeous, almost luxurious documentary about one of the all-time greats. While it stands as an excellent tribute to the man and his work, it acts, too, as a history of the second half of the 20th century, laying out the Troubles through anecdote and verse. Given the current political climate, it is an apt time for people to be reminded of what happened in our very recent past, and what that was like for the people living through it.</p> <p>That lovely title is from Song. In archive footage \u2013 and there are a lot of great interviews plundered here \u2013 Heaney recalls taking it from the answer Fionn MacCool gave when asked about the best music in the world. \u201cSo I used it as the basis for a little declaration about poetry,\u201d he explains casually, as if it were that easy. In these old clips, with his polo necks and coats, his cigarette and Bob Dylan hair, Heaney has the look of a rock star. It is delightful to spend so long in his company.</p> <p>His family and friends talk about his life and work with affection, but this is no saccharine tribute. His old pal Michael Longley recalls the first collection, Death of a Naturalist, being published in 1966. It was an overnight success and made Heaney a star. Longley says fondly that Heaney was \u201ceasily the luckiest poet in the history of English literature\u201d. His wife, Marie, to whom he was married for more than 50 years, reads Wedding Day. Its first line is, \u201cI am afraid.\u201d \u201cNot the happiest wedding poem,\u201d she smiles. She remembers one year that he had forgotten to get her a Christmas present. Instead, he wrote out all the love poems he had written to her, by hand, in a single notebook. From that, she reads Scaffolding, the camera lingering on his script. It is read, she notes, at practically every wedding in Ireland.</p> <p>Heaney is a curriculum staple. Like many, my first encounter with him came through an anthology at school. We read Digging and Mid-Term Break and talked about the stories they contained and what they might mean. For anyone who has held on to a love of those poems, this documentary is a rich gift. His brothers talk about life on the farm in Bellaghy on which he grew up. We see photographs of family members, of his brother, Christopher, who was killed aged three by a car on the road outside the house, immortalised in Mid-Term Break. Heaney named one of his sons after him.</p> <p>The film follows Heaney\u2019s life chronologically, from university in Belfast, to living in the city as violence flared and its buildings went up in flames. A second cousin was shot and killed in 1975; in a Thames TV interview from 1980, Heaney calmly takes the pulse of the situation. We see him having a family and moving to Wicklow, then Dublin, and later his stint at Harvard. There are plenty of admiring voices who try to explain the magic in his work, from the American poet laureate Tracy K Smith, to Paul Muldoon, whom Heaney taught at Queen\u2019s. His daughter Catherine recalls finding out that her father had won the Nobel prize in 1995; his brothers talk of their happiness and surprise, and apprehension, too. The archive footage throughout is extraordinary, whether news reels accompanying stories of Belfast women tarred and feathered for associating with British soldiers, or clips of Heaney presenting documentaries for RTE and the BBC. Hearing his poetry read by him, with the voices of the people they were for or about woven through, is stirring. More than once, I had to choke down a tear.</p> <p>Heaney died in 2013, the day after he and his family discovered he had a heart condition. Catherine says he had texted Marie the night before, ending the message, \u201cnoli timere\u201d \u2013 do not be afraid. Marie reads a poem he had written about her flat in Belfast, Tate\u2019s Avenue, where she lived before they were married, and her voice cracks on its final line: \u201cWhen we moved I had your measure and you had mine.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have read it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful poem.\u201d</p> <p>This is a beautiful film. When Longley talks about the heartbreak at the loss of his old friend, he says, simply, \u201cI thought we were all going to go on forever, you know.\u201d Two days after Heaney died, 80,000 people attended the All Ireland semi-final at Croke Park, and a picture of him was put up on the screens. \u201cI can think of no other country where a football crowd will have a minute\u2019s silence and cheer a poet,\u201d says Marie. By the end of this long, loving tribute, I went straight back to Heaney\u2019s poems, another way, I suppose, of cheering a poet.</p>",

Brendan Cox, husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, and a member of the campaign group Survivors Against Terror, called on all politicians to resist using the tragedy as a pretext for political point-scoring: \u201cWe don\u2019t want terrorists changing the course of our election and we definitely don\u2019t want politicians of any party using it for party advantage. By all means debate the right policy response but please don\u2019t use it to score cheap political points.\u201d Met commissioner Cressida Dick praised the public for their response to Khan\u2019s rampage. Visiting the scene, she said that she was \u201cvery proud to be a Londoner\u201d.",

One loss doesn\u2019t take the spots off a cheetah. I\u2019ve been world champion, I\u2019ve been Olympic champion, I\u2019ve been world silver medallist.\u201d</p> <p>Still the words keep tumbling out. \u201cIt was clear to see that I was the man on the table with four of the rings out of the five and people were still debating where my position was in the heavyweight division,\u201d he says, although now he sounds more astonished than angry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/20/anthony-joshua-primed-heavyweight-rematch-andy-ruiz-jr\">Anthony Joshua on course and primed for heavyweight return with Andy Ruiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of a sudden, though, Joshua\u2019s aggression strays into outright crassness when talking about the \u201chustle\u201d of being the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion. \u201cIt\u2019s like killing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says. \u201cBang; next one. Bang; next one. Bang; next one.\u201d</p> <p>It is a horribly ill-judged line, especially given the deaths in the ring in recent years and certainly not one to expect from someone regarded as one of the sport\u2019s more eloquent participants.</p> <p>Joshua, who is expected to come in lighter and faster for the rematch, also takes exception to claims he took Ruiz too lightly after the Mexican-American replaced his original opponent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/19/anthony-joshua-new-opponent-jarrell-miller-eddie-hearn-boxing\" title=\"\">Jarrell Miller, after he failed a drugs test six weeks</a> before they were due to meet.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t really know what went into my last training camp,\u201d Joshua says. \u201cI hear what people say about me and it\u2019s like: \u2018Put some respect by our name.\u2019 We don\u2019t play games when it comes to boxing, we\u2019re serious and now after the loss I\u2019ve had time to reflect, it\u2019s like: \u2018I took this shit seriously.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So why did people underestimate him? \u201cBecause we make it look easy.\u201d </p> <p>Those close to Joshua say he has always been dedicated but this dedication has now become an obsession. Another difference is that he is regularly in contact with Wladimir Klitschko, the fighter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/anthony-joshua-beats-wladimir-klitschko-wembley-heavyweight-champion-round-11\" title=\"\">he vanquished in 2017</a>, absorbing his advice on how to make it back to the summit. \u201cHe\u2019s helped me with loads of stuff, including diet and training,\u201d Joshua says. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why \u2013 because I\u2019ve adapted some of his teachings \u2013 that my weight may fluctuate. Wlad was definitely ahead of the game.\u201d</p> <p>Joshua insists his trainer, Robert McCracken, remains a vital part of his entourage: a prime dispenser not only of boxing knowledge but of life wisdom. \u201cI respect Rob a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s more than just a coach. We talk and we never fall out over money or training. I\u2019m quite a solid, secure person. If Rob thinks some of my ideas are shit, he can tell me. I don\u2019t have yes men around me.\u201d</p> <p>There is an obvious hunger for redemption, a deep yearning to put right what happened at Madison Square Garden in June. Yet Joshua insists he misses nothing about being world champion. For him the belts were a by-product of success \u2013 not jewellery to wear around his waist and let go to his head.</p> <p>\u201cYou see certain fighters get to championship level and their whole demeanour changes,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see the cars, the chains. I\u2019ve also seen people go to the club with their belts but I don\u2019t really do that kind of stuff. I\u2019m not really someone who has the big trophy cabinet or something like that. This is hustle, this is grind, this ain\u2019t about patting myself on the back.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Joshua\u2019s analysis of his defeat by Ruiz \u2013 that he merely got caught with a \u201cpunch from the gods\u201d after dropping his opponent in the third \u2013 is too superficial. But there is no doubt he is thirsting to be the main man in the heavyweight division again. \u201cI want to take it more seriously because I\u2019m going to that next level,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when I win, I will be like: \u2018Fuck everybody.\u2019With that he sticks up both his middle fingers.</p>",

But six months on from his shock defeat by Ruiz, blinking and stumbling like a man in a waking nightmare before being stopped in the seventh, that sharpness now possesses a more jagged edge. \u201cAfter I took the loss, I started hearing what people really thought of me,\u201d he says, bristling. \u201cBut this is fighting. One loss doesn\u2019t take the spots off a cheetah. I\u2019ve been world champion, I\u2019ve been Olympic champion, I\u2019ve been world silver medallist.\u201d Still the words keep tumbling out. \u201cIt was clear to see that I was the man on the table with four of the rings out of the five and people were still debating where my position was in the heavyweight division,\u201d he says, although now he sounds more astonished than angry. All of a sudden, though, Joshua\u2019s aggression strays into outright crassness when talking about the \u201chustle\u201d of being the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight champion. \u201cIt\u2019s like killing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says. \u201cBang; next one. Bang; next one. Bang; next one.\u201d It is a horribly ill-judged line, especially given the deaths in the ring in recent years and certainly not one to expect from someone regarded as one of the sport\u2019s more eloquent participants. Joshua, who is expected to come in lighter and faster for the rematch, also takes exception to claims he took Ruiz too lightly after the Mexican-American replaced his original opponent, Jarrell Miller, after he failed a drugs test six weeks before they were due to meet. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really know what went into my last training camp,\u201d Joshua says. \u201cI hear what people say about me and it\u2019s like: \u2018Put some respect by our name.\u2019 We don\u2019t play games when it comes to boxing, we\u2019re serious and now after the loss I\u2019ve had time to reflect, it\u2019s like: \u2018I took this shit seriously.\u2019\u201d So why did people underestimate him? \u201cBecause we make it look easy.\u201d Those close to Joshua say he has always been dedicated but this dedication has now become an obsession. Another difference is that he is regularly in contact with Wladimir Klitschko, the fighter he vanquished in 2017, absorbing his advice on how to make it back to the summit. \u201cHe\u2019s helped me with loads of stuff, including diet and training,\u201d Joshua says. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why \u2013 because I\u2019ve adapted some of his teachings \u2013 that my weight may fluctuate. Wlad was definitely ahead of the game.\u201d Joshua insists his trainer, Robert McCracken, remains a vital part of his entourage: a prime dispenser not only of boxing knowledge but of life wisdom. \u201cI respect Rob a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s more than just a coach. We talk and we never fall out over money or training. I\u2019m quite a solid, secure person. If Rob thinks some of my ideas are shit, he can tell me. I don\u2019t have yes men around me.\u201d There is an obvious hunger for redemption, a deep yearning to put right what happened at Madison Square Garden in June. Yet Joshua insists he misses nothing about being world champion. For him the belts were a by-product of success \u2013 not jewellery to wear around his waist and let go to his head. \u201cYou see certain fighters get to championship level and their whole demeanour changes,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see the cars, the chains. I\u2019ve also seen people go to the club with their belts but I don\u2019t really do that kind of stuff. I\u2019m not really someone who has the big trophy cabinet or something like that. This is hustle, this is grind, this ain\u2019t about patting myself on the back.\u201d It remains to be seen whether Joshua\u2019s analysis of his defeat by Ruiz \u2013 that he merely got caught with a \u201cpunch from the gods\u201d after dropping his opponent in the third \u2013 is too superficial. But there is no doubt he is thirsting to be the main man in the heavyweight division again. \u201cI want to take it more seriously because I\u2019m going to that next level,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when I win, I will be like: \u2018Fuck everybody.\u2019With that he sticks up both his middle fingers.",

Local tycoon Yorgen Fenech, the 38-year-old head of a gambling and property empire, was arraigned on Saturday evening, and charged with participating in a criminal organisation, complicity in causing an explosion, and complicity in the murder of Caruana Galizia. He has pleaded not guilty. Fenech has been held in custody and his assets have been frozen on request by the police. His lawyers did not request bail. The journalist, who had exposed corruption at the highest levels within the Maltese government, died when an explosive device planted under the driver\u2019s seat of her rental car was detonated on 16 October 2017. The assassination and subsequent accusations of a cover-up have provoked international condemnation, and pitched Malta into its biggest political and constitutional crisis since the former British colony became an independent country in 1964.

Three men are already awaiting trial for planting the explosive device, but the family have been waiting for two years for those who ordered the killing to be identified and charged. The penalty for complicity to murder in Malta is a life sentence. The indictment states Fenech \u201cpromoted, constituted, organised or financed a group with the intention of committing a crime\u201d, and that he \u201cactively participated in the criminal actions of this group, including but not limited to giving information or material means or recruiting new members when he knew that the purpose and general activity of the group had already been established\u201d.

And on Thursday afternoon this hangout of the <em>Friends</em> gang, transported from New York to east London for a festival named <a href=\"https://www.friendsfestive.co.uk/\" title=\"\">FriendsFestive</a>, was packed with fans celebrating 25 years since the show appeared on our screens.</p> <p>Charlotte Hardinge is 24. She was born after <em>Friends</em> began and was 11 when it ended. Her trip was a surprise Christmas present from her boyfriend Michael, who watches it too. As she sits on the cafe\u2019s big sofa, she looks around the coffee shop she has seen so many times in her home. \u201cI watch it every day,\u201d she says. \u201cMy parents loved it, and I would come in from school and it would be on. So I kept watching it, series after series. It never gets old.\u201d</p> <p>She is briefly interrupted by an outbreak of Phoebe\u2019s anthem, Smelly Cat, from the stage in the corner of the shop. \u201cEven though it\u2019s very 90s, it\u2019s still relatable: twentysomethings starting life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76031767272b90e0c4d8c4ddea23afa1dd9f372b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76031767272b90e0c4d8c4ddea23afa1dd9f372b/415_114_4571_2742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Long-time fan Charlotte Hardinge and her boyfriend Michael Hougham pose on the iconic Central Perk sofa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Long-time fan Charlotte Hardinge and her boyfriend Michael Hougham pose on the iconic Central Perk sofa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The relatability, which comes up time and again when people discuss the show, is why the <em>Friends</em> juggernaut just keeps trucking.

Co-creator Marta Kauffman said it was a \u201cglorious surprise to me that the show has lasted and has this whole new other life\u201d. The secret, she said, was that its subjects are fundamentally nice people: \u201cIt\u2019s not dark, not twisted, not about corrupt people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/21/the-age-of-comfort-tv-why-people-are-secretly-watching-friends-and-the-office-on-a-loop\" title=\"\">It\u2019s comfort food</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, viewers see themselves in the characters, says Ian Youngs, arts and entertainment reporter for BBC News. \u201cIt was the biggest show of its day for a reason, and quality lasts. But even saying that, its popularity among viewers who weren\u2019t alive first time around is remarkable. One reason it connects is that the characters are dealing with the stuff teenagers and young adults are all navigating: friendship, love, independence.</p> <p>\u201cAnd while the characters tackle some big life events, there\u2019s a simplicity and innocence. The outside world rarely encroaches, and the show\u2019s an escape from some of the shadowy things people have on their minds today \u2013 including social media, which the friends never had to worry about. Above all, it\u2019s warm, it\u2019s cosy, it\u2019s relatable, and it\u2019s still very funny.\u201d</p>",

And on Thursday afternoon this hangout of the Friends gang, transported from New York to east London for a festival named FriendsFestive, was packed with fans celebrating 25 years since the show appeared on our screens. Charlotte Hardinge is 24. She was born after Friends began and was 11 when it ended. Her trip was a surprise Christmas present from her boyfriend Michael, who watches it too. As she sits on the cafe\u2019s big sofa, she looks around the coffee shop she has seen so many times in her home. \u201cI watch it every day,\u201d she says. \u201cMy parents loved it, and I would come in from school and it would be on. So I kept watching it, series after series. It never gets old.\u201d She is briefly interrupted by an outbreak of Phoebe\u2019s anthem, Smelly Cat, from the stage in the corner of the shop. \u201cEven though it\u2019s very 90s, it\u2019s still relatable: twentysomethings starting life.\u201d The relatability, which comes up time and again when people discuss the show, is why the Friends juggernaut just keeps trucking. It\u2019s the most-streamed show in Britain, and at No 2 on Netflix in the US (behind The Office). Not surprising when 10 million people in Britain \u2013 53 million in the US \u2013 tuned in to the final episode in 2004. At FriendsFestive \u2013 which runs until 21 December \u2013 fans have the chance to re-enact their favourite scenes in Monica and Rachel\u2019s apartment, studying costumes and memorabilia from the show, practising Ross and Monica\u2019s dance routine and getting into a festive Friends-themed singalong outside the Holiday Armadillo\u2019s grotto. There is a sense of electric excitement at being able to act out lives with which the show\u2019s devotees are so familiar. The sitcom is astonishingly inter-generational. Joanne Undrell, 40, is at the event with her daughter, Charlotte, and Charlotte\u2019s best friend, Phoebe. The girls are both 10 and have seen all 236 episodes. \u201cOver and over again,\u201d Undrell adds. \u201cI like them watching it because it reinforces the meaning of friendship and fun.\u201d Charlotte grins and nods. \u201cYou can relate to it in modern days, and not only back in those days,\u201d she explains as a big screen behind them shows Chandler\u2019s desperate attempt to cover up his relationship with Monica. Phoebe agrees with her friend: \u201cIt\u2019s a good way of thinking about life \u2013 they come together as friends in a single year and stay together for 10 years. It\u2019s good to have friends.\u201d Friends is even making its way on to the silver screen this Christmas. From 8 December, cinema chains are screening 12 of the best-loved episodes in four-episode chunks. It\u2019s virtually unknown for TV shows to be shown in cinemas, but the sheer torrent of support for the sitcom makes it commercially viable. Retailers, too, are getting in on the act. Fashion house Ralph Lauren is releasing a special Friends line to mark the fact that in the series Rachel worked there. It\u2019s inspired by her style in the show: polo-neck jumpers and sleek office wear. For younger fans, Lego has released a Central Perk set for the 25th anniversary. Along with miniatures of the usual gang, you get a bleached-haired Gunther thrown in. Or \u2013 something of a niche in-joke for fans, perhaps \u2013 the US homeware chain Pottery Barn will be re-releasing its faux-antique \u201capothecary table\u201d that was the centre of a plotline in the sixth series. Even the makers of Friends have been taken aback by the show\u2019s continuing appeal. Co-creator Marta Kauffman said it was a \u201cglorious surprise to me that the show has lasted and has this whole new other life\u201d. The secret, she said, was that its subjects are fundamentally nice people: \u201cIt\u2019s not dark, not twisted, not about corrupt people. It\u2019s comfort food.\u201d Above all, viewers see themselves in the characters, says Ian Youngs, arts and entertainment reporter for BBC News. \u201cIt was the biggest show of its day for a reason, and quality lasts. But even saying that, its popularity among viewers who weren\u2019t alive first time around is remarkable. One reason it connects is that the characters are dealing with the stuff teenagers and young adults are all navigating: friendship, love, independence. \u201cAnd while the characters tackle some big life events, there\u2019s a simplicity and innocence. The outside world rarely encroaches, and the show\u2019s an escape from some of the shadowy things people have on their minds today \u2013 including social media, which the friends never had to worry about. Above all, it\u2019s warm, it\u2019s cosy, it\u2019s relatable, and it\u2019s still very funny.\u201d",

Kiku, his wife, and their two small children started walking toward the Papua New Guinea border. So did most of their village and some 11,000 other Papuans, trekking on foot or navigating the coast in outrigger canoes - a seismic exodus of political protest that continued over nearly 18 months, triggering deployments of UN aid workers and international journalists, and upsetting regional sensitivities.

One child, aged two, died along the way. They crossed the Fly River where its wandering course bulges through the colonial cartographer\u2019s best effort to carve up the island of New Guinea with a neat vertical rule. Here, in the middle of nowhere, the refugees declared they would not go home until they had \u201c<em>merdeka</em>\u201d - a word heavy with the promise of liberation, independence, freedom.</p> <p>And still they wait, separated from their homeland by the wide, brown, infamously despoiled river that has served as the drain for the toxic sludge of the Ok Tedi mine for as long as they\u2019ve been here. The more formidable and baffling barriers are the ones they can\u2019t see, but which continue to mire the cause of West Papuan independence 50 years after the malodorous \u201cAct of Free Choice\u201d delivered the province to Indonesia.</p> <h2>\u2018They have their own agenda \u2013 freedom\u2019</h2> <p>At last count, in 2014, the number of people living in refugee villages along the Fly was 5,500. A PNG immigration official who has lately been on the ground, part of a government team collecting registrations for long-awaited citizenship, suspects the population may be closer to 7,000. These are the hard-core stayers from within the 1984 movement, most of them from the Muyu tribe whose customary land straddles both sides of the border, plus their children and grandchildren.</p> <p>They dug in when others drifted back, and refused relocation to the United Nations refugee agency\u2019s settlement situated \u2013 diplomatically, and invisibly \u2013 well inland from the border.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was with UNHCR we tried our best to pull them out of the villages to go to East Awin [settlement],\u201d recalls Robin Moken, himself a Muyu man and former official in the provincial capital of Kiunga. \u201cThey said \u2018no, we are fighting for our rights, and we stay here\u2019. They remain there, they have their own agenda \u2013 freedom.\u201d</p> <p>For this they\u2019ve paid a high price, forfeiting powerful inducements like recognition, schools and health care.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db8edb0b1b2f32716231058ef56c480e3dbe31ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db8edb0b1b2f32716231058ef56c480e3dbe31ad/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"West Papuan refugees rely on the notoriously polluted Fly River to provide food and drinking water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">West Papuan refugees rely on the notoriously polluted Fly River for food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Chandler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kiku, now a wiry 68-year-old, secures our dinghy to the muddy bank below his village and brokers introductions to the people emerging, curious, from a cluster of stilt huts and the surrounding bush. </p> <p>The past few months have been anxious ones for the West Papuan diaspora. Despite media constraints including internet blackouts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/28/i-feel-like-im-dying-west-papua-witnesses-unrest-indonesia-police\">horrific stories float over the river</a> as another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/31/an-earthquake-racism-rage-and-rising-calls-for-freedom-in-papua\">violent eruption of independence activism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/sep/02/indonesian-security-forces-open-fire-on-papuan-protesters-video\">retaliation</a> plays out. There are questions around what that might mean along this wild, porous frontier, and how those ructions might be felt more widely.</p> <p>UNHCR and UNDP representatives have recently visited Kiunga, reportedly working with local authorities and refugee representatives on their preparedness to receive a new wave, though neither agency would confirm these reports.</p> <p>Western Province Bishop Giles Cotes has confirmed that 13 families have reportedly crossed the Fly River north west of Kiunga. There is a committee forming to organise care for those who come across.</p> <h2>\u2018We don\u2019t want to fight\u2019</h2> <p>To smooth the way in exploring these delicate issues, our delegation to two refugee villages also enlists a guerrilla veteran of the \u201870s jungle struggle and two next generation activists.</p> <p>One of them, Toni Sapioper, like Kiku, was part of the 1984 wave, though he was just three when his mother smuggled him and his six siblings across the sea border from Jayapura into Vanimo. He grew up in East Awin settlement and proudly claims lineage as a nephew of the late Seth Rumkorem, a founding leader of the Free Papua Movement (<em>Organisasi Papua Merdeka,</em> or OPM), who proclaimed the Republic of West Papua in 1971.</p> <p>The villages remain OPM strongholds. Refugee communities have two fervent articles of faith \u2013 independence, and Catholicism.</p> <p>Damianus Warip, 62, is at church with most of the other elders praying the rosary when we arrive. Another veteran of the jungle conflict says he worries that the escalation in clashes on \u201cthe other side\u201d will bring more Indonesian military to the border. He crossed the river in 1983, ahead of the main wave, determined \u201cto stay and to fight for <em>merdeka</em>\u201d. That refrain punctuates his answers to every question: \u201cThe only thing is <em>merdeka</em>, the only thing\u201d. But it must be realised peacefully, he says. Through a translator, he asks that \u201cIndonesia hear our peaceful demands \u2026 we don\u2019t want to fight against Indonesia\u201d.</p> <p>In the next village, another grey-haired warrior who today himself as the region\u2019s OPM commander-in-chief is more belligerent. In an hour-long, impassioned oration to a closely attending audience of younger men he speaks of how he wants West Papuans over the border to rise up again this 1 December, urging them to \u201ccome and join, because this is our opportunity to rise to our destination, our idea \u2026 what we want is international community support when we do this, like [Timor Leste]\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe want everyone to arise,\u201d he says, adding his people are \u201cout of patience\u201d and have suffered enough.</p> <h2>Refugees on their own land</h2> <p>The sufferings of West Papuans over the border are often hard to know due to the lack of access for outsiders, including media, though the glimpses that break through are horrifying. On this side, remoteness and disinterest cloak the less dramatic, grinding hardships of displacement, compounded by layers of cruel luck and circumstance.</p> <p>The combination of vast distances, lack of infrastructure and corrupted budgets mean health services are shatteringly scarce across PNG, and in Western Province, they are worse than even the national average. For decades, Fly River refugees have relied almost entirely on basic health patrols by nuns from the Catholic missions. There\u2019s a lot of sickness \u2013 malaria, tuberculosis, elephantiasis, chronic malnutrition, says a village leader, Robert Maun. In his community two teachers instruct more than 100 elementary students divided into four classes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"391e68b68aae999b485f07b9b815c64330c5f922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/391e68b68aae999b485f07b9b815c64330c5f922/0_162_5236_3142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a schoolroom in one of the refugee villages along the Fly River, where two teachers instruct more than 100 elementary students.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Januarius Anton, 30, teaches 57 students in a single room class with a broken floor and just a half a dozen old desks.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 35 years since Agapitus Kiku decided he didn\u2019t want a future without freedom. As a young man he\u2019d been pressed into a work gang, bristling under the watch of Indonesian soldiers whose authority over his tribal country, in the south-east corner of the vast contested province then called Irian Jaya, he refused to recognise. He saw no prospects for finding the work he wanted in forestry or mining. Those jobs went to soldiers, he says, or to the Javanese settlers pouring in through the transmigration program which the Dutch administration had begun and the Indonesians continued. In February 1984, an uprising by Melanesian nationalists in the provincial capital of Jayapura ignited months of brutal retaliations. Kiku, his wife, and their two small children started walking toward the Papua New Guinea border. So did most of their village and some 11,000 other Papuans, trekking on foot or navigating the coast in outrigger canoes - a seismic exodus of political protest that continued over nearly 18 months, triggering deployments of UN aid workers and international journalists, and upsetting regional sensitivities. Indonesia was not to be messed with. Kiku\u2019s family walked for a week, hiding at night from the soldiers. One child, aged two, died along the way. They crossed the Fly River where its wandering course bulges through the colonial cartographer\u2019s best effort to carve up the island of New Guinea with a neat vertical rule. Here, in the middle of nowhere, the refugees declared they would not go home until they had \u201cmerdeka\u201d - a word heavy with the promise of liberation, independence, freedom. And still they wait, separated from their homeland by the wide, brown, infamously despoiled river that has served as the drain for the toxic sludge of the Ok Tedi mine for as long as they\u2019ve been here. The more formidable and baffling barriers are the ones they can\u2019t see, but which continue to mire the cause of West Papuan independence 50 years after the malodorous \u201cAct of Free Choice\u201d delivered the province to Indonesia. \u2018They have their own agenda \u2013 freedom\u2019 At last count, in 2014, the number of people living in refugee villages along the Fly was 5,500. A PNG immigration official who has lately been on the ground, part of a government team collecting registrations for long-awaited citizenship, suspects the population may be closer to 7,000. These are the hard-core stayers from within the 1984 movement, most of them from the Muyu tribe whose customary land straddles both sides of the border, plus their children and grandchildren. They dug in when others drifted back, and refused relocation to the United Nations refugee agency\u2019s settlement situated \u2013 diplomatically, and invisibly \u2013 well inland from the border. \u201cWhen I was with UNHCR we tried our best to pull them out of the villages to go to East Awin [settlement],\u201d recalls Robin Moken, himself a Muyu man and former official in the provincial capital of Kiunga. \u201cThey said \u2018no, we are fighting for our rights, and we stay here\u2019. They remain there, they have their own agenda \u2013 freedom.\u201d For this they\u2019ve paid a high price, forfeiting powerful inducements like recognition, schools and health care. Kiku, now a wiry 68-year-old, secures our dinghy to the muddy bank below his village and brokers introductions to the people emerging, curious, from a cluster of stilt huts and the surrounding bush. The past few months have been anxious ones for the West Papuan diaspora. Despite media constraints including internet blackouts, horrific stories float over the river as another violent eruption of independence activism and retaliation plays out. There are questions around what that might mean along this wild, porous frontier, and how those ructions might be felt more widely. UNHCR and UNDP representatives have recently visited Kiunga, reportedly working with local authorities and refugee representatives on their preparedness to receive a new wave, though neither agency would confirm these reports. Western Province Bishop Giles Cotes has confirmed that 13 families have reportedly crossed the Fly River north west of Kiunga. There is a committee forming to organise care for those who come across. \u2018We don\u2019t want to fight\u2019 To smooth the way in exploring these delicate issues, our delegation to two refugee villages also enlists a guerrilla veteran of the \u201870s jungle struggle and two next generation activists. One of them, Toni Sapioper, like Kiku, was part of the 1984 wave, though he was just three when his mother smuggled him and his six siblings across the sea border from Jayapura into Vanimo. He grew up in East Awin settlement and proudly claims lineage as a nephew of the late Seth Rumkorem, a founding leader of the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka, or OPM), who proclaimed the Republic of West Papua in 1971. The villages remain OPM strongholds. Refugee communities have two fervent articles of faith \u2013 independence, and Catholicism. Damianus Warip, 62, is at church with most of the other elders praying the rosary when we arrive. Another veteran of the jungle conflict says he worries that the escalation in clashes on \u201cthe other side\u201d will bring more Indonesian military to the border. He crossed the river in 1983, ahead of the main wave, determined \u201cto stay and to fight for merdeka\u201d. That refrain punctuates his answers to every question: \u201cThe only thing is merdeka, the only thing\u201d. But it must be realised peacefully, he says. Through a translator, he asks that \u201cIndonesia hear our peaceful demands \u2026 we don\u2019t want to fight against Indonesia\u201d. In the next village, another grey-haired warrior who today himself as the region\u2019s OPM commander-in-chief is more belligerent. In an hour-long, impassioned oration to a closely attending audience of younger men he speaks of how he wants West Papuans over the border to rise up again this 1 December, urging them to \u201ccome and join, because this is our opportunity to rise to our destination, our idea \u2026 what we want is international community support when we do this, like [Timor Leste]\u201d. \u201cWe want everyone to arise,\u201d he says, adding his people are \u201cout of patience\u201d and have suffered enough. Refugees on their own land The sufferings of West Papuans over the border are often hard to know due to the lack of access for outsiders, including media, though the glimpses that break through are horrifying. On this side, remoteness and disinterest cloak the less dramatic, grinding hardships of displacement, compounded by layers of cruel luck and circumstance. The combination of vast distances, lack of infrastructure and corrupted budgets mean health services are shatteringly scarce across PNG, and in Western Province, they are worse than even the national average. For decades, Fly River refugees have relied almost entirely on basic health patrols by nuns from the Catholic missions. There\u2019s a lot of sickness \u2013 malaria, tuberculosis, elephantiasis, chronic malnutrition, says a village leader, Robert Maun. In his community two teachers instruct more than 100 elementary students divided into four classes. Most of the refugees share customary ties with their PNG kin, seeing themselves as refugees on their own land.

So that notion died. A new generation of fighters In the villages, the words of ageing warriors provide a glimpse of the tensions that have long distracted and derailed their movement\u2019s ambitions. Back in the lively refugee corners of Kiunga, another dimension comes into play, one that will define where it goes in the future \u2013 the generational shift. Here the children of the 1984 exodus \u2013 largely those hailing from East Awin, who had an education denied the children in the river camps \u2013 are preoccupied with learning what is playing out over the border, finding opportunities for leveraging diplomacy and enlisting international human rights law.

Gazidis had spoken of the \u201cchemistry between us\u201d in Emery\u2019s interview but had also been quick to divide responsibility for the choice, stressing it was unanimous. The noises since then suggest it was in fact Sanllehi, who held the more lowly head of football relations title at that point, who got his man in the end. For every painstaking analysis of Emery\u2019s failings there must be an acknowledgement that the biggest error in the first place was to decide he ticked more boxes than seven other interviewees.</p> <p>Sanllehi will sit on a new committee this time, joined by his choice for the technical director role, Edu, and the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham. The merry-go-round that took place in the executive positions while Emery was in charge offers some mitigation for the on-pitch performance.</p> <p>The house needs to be in order upstairs and how effectively the panel works to choose the most suitable manager now will be a sound indicator of Arsenal\u2019s health.</p> <p>It is why alarm bells sounded when Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, the Wolves manager, was mentioned in connection with the role in the 48 hours before Emery was sacked. Nuno\u2019s performance at Molineux, albeit with the resources of Fosun and the network of Jorge Mendes, has been exceptional but the catch lay in the small print. Sanllehi knows Mendes well and an element of distaste surfaced among some sections of the fanbase at the prospect of Arsenal handing de facto control to the so-called super-agent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95f105fed72012cd394ea58108e162a613b2eedf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95f105fed72012cd394ea58108e162a613b2eedf/0_19_2514_1508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unai Emery\u2019s time at Arsenal saw a merry-go-round among the executive positions at the club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unai Emery\u2019s time at Arsenal saw a merry-go-round among the executive positions at the club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact Nuno is not being seriously considered for the role but it would be no surprise if his name had been used to test the water for what might be deemed acceptable. It would be unfair to suggest Sanllehi is hellbent upon thrusting the club into Mendes\u2019s clutches; the salient point is nobody really knows what shape he or the Kroenkes, who will ultimately nod through whoever is proposed to succeed Emery, want Arsenal to take.</p> <p>The jury is out on Sanllehi among some who work closely with Arsenal on player-related issues. The 15 years he spent at Barcelona, working as director of football and riding out the different intrigues that arise in that boardroom, marked him out as a skilled negotiator. But he is perceived as a contracts and contacts man; someone fluent in legalese and a master broker of deals in South America but hardly a club-builder or player-spotter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/nov/29/arsenal-unai-emery-manchester-united-arsene-wenger-david-moyes\">Expectations met with Unai Emery fated to be our version of David Moyes | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That would seem less important had he not given the ambitious Mislintat, whom he and Venkatesham passed over for the technical director role, little choice but to depart. Mislintat, a magnetic character with encyclopaedic knowledge and a compelling talker about the sport, was hugely popular with those who regularly crossed his path and informed observers ask how on earth anyone with his gifts could be perceived as a square peg in a round hole.</p> <p>The perception is that Arsenal\u2019s power-brokers are short on genuine football expertise and, in some ways, the current setup feels like a regression to the days before Gazidis began ripping up Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s old power structure. That theory may be proved wrong if Edu, described as \u201cthe final and very important part\u201d of the club\u2019s jigsaw by Sanllehi, can bring his own instincts to the fore. If Sanllehi appears the dominant figure in the recruitment triumvirate, there is an argument Edu is at least as crucial: should his keen sense of the club\u2019s history be matched by a convincing, football-literate vision of how Arsenal should proceed, perhaps he can temper any reflexive recourse to the contacts book from elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWe had some clear criteria,\u201d Gazidis said on that day 18 months ago. \u201cAggressive, entertaining football; personality that fitted with Arsenal\u2019s values; also a record of developing players through detailed tactical instruction and also cultural demand, pushing players.\u201d Even today it sounds like a perfect balance; now Arsenal must hope Sanllehi and his reshuffled band of power-brokers can make it second time lucky.</p>",

So the common denominator in the two exercises will be Raul Sanllehi, who became head of football when Gazidis departed last December, and there is a sense the former Barcelona administrator will stand or fall by the decision he oversees next. The way Emery, who never looked a comfortable fit at Arsenal and struggled to communicate with his players, fell short casts a sharp light on the machinations that brought him there. Gazidis had spoken of the \u201cchemistry between us\u201d in Emery\u2019s interview but had also been quick to divide responsibility for the choice, stressing it was unanimous. The noises since then suggest it was in fact Sanllehi, who held the more lowly head of football relations title at that point, who got his man in the end. For every painstaking analysis of Emery\u2019s failings there must be an acknowledgement that the biggest error in the first place was to decide he ticked more boxes than seven other interviewees. Sanllehi will sit on a new committee this time, joined by his choice for the technical director role, Edu, and the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham. The merry-go-round that took place in the executive positions while Emery was in charge offers some mitigation for the on-pitch performance. The house needs to be in order upstairs and how effectively the panel works to choose the most suitable manager now will be a sound indicator of Arsenal\u2019s health. It is why alarm bells sounded when Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, the Wolves manager, was mentioned in connection with the role in the 48 hours before Emery was sacked. Nuno\u2019s performance at Molineux, albeit with the resources of Fosun and the network of Jorge Mendes, has been exceptional but the catch lay in the small print. Sanllehi knows Mendes well and an element of distaste surfaced among some sections of the fanbase at the prospect of Arsenal handing de facto control to the so-called super-agent. In fact Nuno is not being seriously considered for the role but it would be no surprise if his name had been used to test the water for what might be deemed acceptable. It would be unfair to suggest Sanllehi is hellbent upon thrusting the club into Mendes\u2019s clutches; the salient point is nobody really knows what shape he or the Kroenkes, who will ultimately nod through whoever is proposed to succeed Emery, want Arsenal to take. The jury is out on Sanllehi among some who work closely with Arsenal on player-related issues. The 15 years he spent at Barcelona, working as director of football and riding out the different intrigues that arise in that boardroom, marked him out as a skilled negotiator. But he is perceived as a contracts and contacts man; someone fluent in legalese and a master broker of deals in South America but hardly a club-builder or player-spotter. That would seem less important had he not given the ambitious Mislintat, whom he and Venkatesham passed over for the technical director role, little choice but to depart. Mislintat, a magnetic character with encyclopaedic knowledge and a compelling talker about the sport, was hugely popular with those who regularly crossed his path and informed observers ask how on earth anyone with his gifts could be perceived as a square peg in a round hole. The perception is that Arsenal\u2019s power-brokers are short on genuine football expertise and, in some ways, the current setup feels like a regression to the days before Gazidis began ripping up Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s old power structure. That theory may be proved wrong if Edu, described as \u201cthe final and very important part\u201d of the club\u2019s jigsaw by Sanllehi, can bring his own instincts to the fore. If Sanllehi appears the dominant figure in the recruitment triumvirate, there is an argument Edu is at least as crucial: should his keen sense of the club\u2019s history be matched by a convincing, football-literate vision of how Arsenal should proceed, perhaps he can temper any reflexive recourse to the contacts book from elsewhere. \u201cWe had some clear criteria,\u201d Gazidis said on that day 18 months ago. \u201cAggressive, entertaining football; personality that fitted with Arsenal\u2019s values; also a record of developing players through detailed tactical instruction and also cultural demand, pushing players.\u201d Even today it sounds like a perfect balance; now Arsenal must hope Sanllehi and his reshuffled band of power-brokers can make it second time lucky.",

      "body": "<p>Outside a small white and green mosque in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, at Zuhr prayers on Saturday lunchtime dozens of men and women in padded jackets, heavy coats and kurtas gathered in the car park, unable to squeeze into the single-storey building for the funeral taking place inside.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our community elders has passed. It\u2019s a massive death,\u201d explained a softly-spoken man in his 20s who didn\u2019t want to give his name. He grew up with Usman Khan, whose family live in a terraced cul-de-sac around the corner. A day earlier Khan had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/usman-khan-attack-at-london-bridge-what-we-know-so-far\" title=\"\">brought terror to central London</a>, embarking on a knife rampage, killing Cambridge University postgraduate Jack Merritt, and an unnamed woman, and injuring three others.</p> <p>As the sky darkened, the congregation in Cobridge became increasingly subdued as locals struggled to digest the news that a man who once was a neighbour had wrought such barbarism in the capital.</p> <p>\u201cWe grew up on the same streets, we know every one of his brothers and sisters, his mum and dad,\u201d said one. Another said: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how [Khan] ended up like this. How can you have a person who went to prison for extremism and terror, and then he\u2019s let out and he\u2019s got a tag on and ends up back in London to do this? How? Why?\u201d</p> <p>More than 150 miles south, in the headquarters of MI5 on the banks of the Thames, investigators are asking the same questions: how did Khan, a 28-year-old convicted terrorist who had been participating in an event showcasing the rehabilitation of inmates, manage to perpetrate such an act while out on licence? And why?</p> <p>Born in Stoke-on-Trent in 1991 to Pakistani parents, Khan was arrested 19 years later in a major counterterrorism operation, along with eight others who formed an al-Qaida-inspired terror cell. Charged with plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange, Khan spent eight years in prison before being released in December 2018 \u2013 fitted with an electronic tag to track his movements.</p> <p>The authorities knew that Khan needed monitoring. After all, this was a man who had been radicalised by two of the most prominent and extreme preachers. The first was the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who has remained the pre-eminent English-language jihadist internet recruiter eight years after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/anwar-al-awlaki-killed-yemen\" title=\"\">killed</a> in a US drone strike.</p> <p>Documents from 2012 confirm that Khan was, while a member of a nine-strong UK cell with networks in London, Cardiff and Stoke, inspired \u201cby the ideology and methodology of Awlaki\u201d. The documents describe the radical preacher as promoting \u201caims include attacking Western countries by any means possible\u201d.</p> <p>Awlaki has repeatedly surfaced as a principal radicaliser in terrorism plots including the 7 July 2005 London bombings and US attacks such as the Times Square bombings in New York.</p> <p>Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, confirmed that, despite his death, Awlaki\u2019s online footprint ensured he remained a prominent recruiter. He said: \u201cWhen you look at what people are reading and looking at, he keeps showing up.\u201d</p> <p>The second notorious Islamist preacher accused of helping influence Khan is Anjem Choudary, the infamous leader of the banned but active terrorist group, al-Muhajiroun. Details surfaced on Saturday that Khan was a student and close friend of Choudary. When arrested in 2010, Khan even had Choudary\u2019s private mobile number stored on his phone, according to the Henry Jackson Society, a foreign policy think tank.</p> <p>The connection raises fresh questions over al-Muhajiroun. A number of the network\u2019s members were released from prison over a six-month period beginning in the autumn of 2018. One of them was Khan.</p> <p>Security services have been monitoring the organisation intensively. Earlier this year a significant arms cache, including a sniper rifle and tracer rounds linked to al-Muhajiroun was discovered in Coventry, 60 miles from the Staffordshire bail hostel raided by police in the wake of Khan\u2019s attack. Whitehall sources told the <em>Observer</em> that security services believed the group was finding it hard to operate or pose a threat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f93d42142eebd9706b07c9808f64ca8b0c19ffeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93d42142eebd9706b07c9808f64ca8b0c19ffeb/0_141_1992_2490/800.jpg\" alt=\"Usman Khan.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usman Khan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: West Midlands Police/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When asked if the al-Muhajiroun network was attempting to expand operations out of its traditional powerbase of south east England, sources said the group was being \u201ccontained\u201d. That confidence now looks misplaced.</p> <p>Pantucci said the fluid structure of al-Muhajiroun posed severe challenges for the security services, adding: \u201cThe problem is that we continue to see persistent members of that group show up, and it\u2019s not necessarily always the obvious ones.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who was a bit player in one of these bigger plots later turns out to be someone who decides to do something. It\u2019s clear that we haven\u2019t quite understood how to manage that side of the residual threat.\u201d</p> <p>Friday\u2019s attack, said Pantucci, exposed the perennial dilemma within the security services, namely which individual should be prioritised for the highest levels of surveillance.</p> <p>Information is held on 20,000 people who are labelled \u201cclosed subjects of concern\u201d, people previously investigated but who the authorities believe could pose a threat in the future, alongside current subjects of concern.</p> <p>\u201cAl-Muhajiroun is a few hundred guys whose numbers keep growing and shrinking over the years and every so often one of them pops up and the difficulty is pinpointing which one,\u201d said Pantucci.</p> <p>Inevitably a strand of the debate since Friday\u2019s attack revolves around funding. A former senior Metropolitan Police officer said the attack highlighted shortfalls in security expenditure.</p> <p>Dal Babu, a chief superintendent until 2013, said: \u201cFundamentally, a lack of resources to policing and the criminal justice system puts us all in danger. We need to carry out an urgent review of the resources available to monitor convicted terrorist by the police and security services.\u201d</p> <p>Most immediate scrutiny will focus on Khan\u2019s network of contacts, both online and real, since his release. Already apparent is that the convicted terrorist was known to be an expert in \u201cfield craft\u201d \u2013 the art of evading monitoring by police and the security services.</p> <p>When he was arrested in 2010, court documents reveal that Khan was worried that he and a few others were \u201cdealing with an inexperienced and hot-headed group who might get them all arrested despite their own well developed field craft\u201d. The documents reveal that Khan and several others were keenly aware that covert tactics may be implemented against them. \u201cThey were careful about what was said near buildings and in cars; they walked around the park talking,\u201d they stated.</p> <p>Khan would know that a low-tech knife attack carried the greatest chance of success.

      "bodyText": "Outside a small white and green mosque in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, at Zuhr prayers on Saturday lunchtime dozens of men and women in padded jackets, heavy coats and kurtas gathered in the car park, unable to squeeze into the single-storey building for the funeral taking place inside. \u201cOne of our community elders has passed. It\u2019s a massive death,\u201d explained a softly-spoken man in his 20s who didn\u2019t want to give his name. He grew up with Usman Khan, whose family live in a terraced cul-de-sac around the corner. A day earlier Khan had brought terror to central London, embarking on a knife rampage, killing Cambridge University postgraduate Jack Merritt, and an unnamed woman, and injuring three others. As the sky darkened, the congregation in Cobridge became increasingly subdued as locals struggled to digest the news that a man who once was a neighbour had wrought such barbarism in the capital. \u201cWe grew up on the same streets, we know every one of his brothers and sisters, his mum and dad,\u201d said one. Another said: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how [Khan] ended up like this. How can you have a person who went to prison for extremism and terror, and then he\u2019s let out and he\u2019s got a tag on and ends up back in London to do this? How? Why?\u201d More than 150 miles south, in the headquarters of MI5 on the banks of the Thames, investigators are asking the same questions: how did Khan, a 28-year-old convicted terrorist who had been participating in an event showcasing the rehabilitation of inmates, manage to perpetrate such an act while out on licence? And why? Born in Stoke-on-Trent in 1991 to Pakistani parents, Khan was arrested 19 years later in a major counterterrorism operation, along with eight others who formed an al-Qaida-inspired terror cell. Charged with plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange, Khan spent eight years in prison before being released in December 2018 \u2013 fitted with an electronic tag to track his movements. The authorities knew that Khan needed monitoring. After all, this was a man who had been radicalised by two of the most prominent and extreme preachers. The first was the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who has remained the pre-eminent English-language jihadist internet recruiter eight years after being killed in a US drone strike. Documents from 2012 confirm that Khan was, while a member of a nine-strong UK cell with networks in London, Cardiff and Stoke, inspired \u201cby the ideology and methodology of Awlaki\u201d. The documents describe the radical preacher as promoting \u201caims include attacking Western countries by any means possible\u201d. Awlaki has repeatedly surfaced as a principal radicaliser in terrorism plots including the 7 July 2005 London bombings and US attacks such as the Times Square bombings in New York. Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, confirmed that, despite his death, Awlaki\u2019s online footprint ensured he remained a prominent recruiter. He said: \u201cWhen you look at what people are reading and looking at, he keeps showing up.\u201d The second notorious Islamist preacher accused of helping influence Khan is Anjem Choudary, the infamous leader of the banned but active terrorist group, al-Muhajiroun. Details surfaced on Saturday that Khan was a student and close friend of Choudary. When arrested in 2010, Khan even had Choudary\u2019s private mobile number stored on his phone, according to the Henry Jackson Society, a foreign policy think tank. The connection raises fresh questions over al-Muhajiroun. A number of the network\u2019s members were released from prison over a six-month period beginning in the autumn of 2018. One of them was Khan. Security services have been monitoring the organisation intensively. Earlier this year a significant arms cache, including a sniper rifle and tracer rounds linked to al-Muhajiroun was discovered in Coventry, 60 miles from the Staffordshire bail hostel raided by police in the wake of Khan\u2019s attack. Whitehall sources told the Observer that security services believed the group was finding it hard to operate or pose a threat. When asked if the al-Muhajiroun network was attempting to expand operations out of its traditional powerbase of south east England, sources said the group was being \u201ccontained\u201d. That confidence now looks misplaced. Pantucci said the fluid structure of al-Muhajiroun posed severe challenges for the security services, adding: \u201cThe problem is that we continue to see persistent members of that group show up, and it\u2019s not necessarily always the obvious ones. \u201cSomeone who was a bit player in one of these bigger plots later turns out to be someone who decides to do something. It\u2019s clear that we haven\u2019t quite understood how to manage that side of the residual threat.\u201d Friday\u2019s attack, said Pantucci, exposed the perennial dilemma within the security services, namely which individual should be prioritised for the highest levels of surveillance. Information is held on 20,000 people who are labelled \u201cclosed subjects of concern\u201d, people previously investigated but who the authorities believe could pose a threat in the future, alongside current subjects of concern. \u201cAl-Muhajiroun is a few hundred guys whose numbers keep growing and shrinking over the years and every so often one of them pops up and the difficulty is pinpointing which one,\u201d said Pantucci. Inevitably a strand of the debate since Friday\u2019s attack revolves around funding. A former senior Metropolitan Police officer said the attack highlighted shortfalls in security expenditure. Dal Babu, a chief superintendent until 2013, said: \u201cFundamentally, a lack of resources to policing and the criminal justice system puts us all in danger. We need to carry out an urgent review of the resources available to monitor convicted terrorist by the police and security services.\u201d Most immediate scrutiny will focus on Khan\u2019s network of contacts, both online and real, since his release. Already apparent is that the convicted terrorist was known to be an expert in \u201cfield craft\u201d \u2013 the art of evading monitoring by police and the security services. When he was arrested in 2010, court documents reveal that Khan was worried that he and a few others were \u201cdealing with an inexperienced and hot-headed group who might get them all arrested despite their own well developed field craft\u201d. The documents reveal that Khan and several others were keenly aware that covert tactics may be implemented against them. \u201cThey were careful about what was said near buildings and in cars; they walked around the park talking,\u201d they stated. Khan would know that a low-tech knife attack carried the greatest chance of success. By the same measure, he would have also known that acting alone meant a significantly lower probability of detection. On Saturday Met commissioner Cressida Dick indicated that Khan acted alone. She said: \u201cAt this stage that is our understanding. Of course, the investigation will continue following all the most pressing and obvious lines of inquiry and we must make 100% of that, of course.\u201d An assessment of the terror attacks of 2017 concluded that lone attackers were more likely to evade detection. \u201cAll four attacks were committed by lone actors or small groups, with little evidence of detailed planning or precise targeting,\u201d states the report. Elsewhere, court documents reveal that racism may have also played a role in radicalising Khan. They cite how Khan and others discussed bombing pubs in Stoke as a response to \u201cracist incidents\u201d. On Saturday, as the night drew in over Stoke, local taxi driver Mirza Mahmood bemoaned the lack of prospects, and bigotry facing the city\u2019s young British Pakistani community, particularly young men. He also knew Khan\u2019s murderous actions would invoke fresh prejudice. He said: \u201cLet me tell you, there is always more abuse, and we drivers get attacked much more every time there is an incident like this. \u201cOur children suffer, everyone suffers. The racism is much worse than it was a decade ago. It\u2019s tense. Everyone is tense.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And that, dear people, is your lot. Ben Fisher was our man at St Mary\u2019s, and here\u2019s his hot take on events near the Solent. Enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Some Watford reaction from Will Hughes: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have VAR, you need to take as long as you need to reach the correct decision. When you see Djenepo\u2019s handball before their equaliser, it\u2019s frustrating looking back on that. We were fairly comfortable at that point. If we got the second goal would have gone on to win the game.\u201d Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl: \u201cTons of weight have fallen off our shoulders. In the first half there was so much weight, we couldn\u2019t move. The subs came in with fresh energy, and it was a completely different second half, we deserved to score. I am happy to take the three points, they give us a little lift.\u201d And now James Ward-Prowse. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken another step in the right direction tonight. Over the years we\u2019ve been successful because we do win our home games. We\u2019ve got a great belief in what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve come out of a relegation struggle with three points. We could easily have gone downhill after the 9-0 against Leicester, but we\u2019ve shown the togetherness you need to push forward.\u201d He\u2019s then given the official man-of-the-match award by Sky, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the MBM version, right? Ings it is. A word with the man-of-the-match Danny Ings. \u201cIt\u2019s massive. To go 1-0 down and come back to win like that shows the character of the lads. You can tell by the atmosphere, it was great at the end. It was thoroughly deserved. It was a great night for us. It was very, very important for us.\u201d Not so much a game of two halves, more a game of three thirds. The first two belonged to Watford. They should have scored more than one goal; Southampton were nothing short of dreadful. But Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl made a double change that changed the mood and shifted the momentum. Suddenly Saints looked dangerous every time they came forward, and got their reward with two late goals to turn defeat into glorious, pressure-relieving victory! So it\u2019s Watford who end the day bottom, six points from safety. Southampton rise to 18th, a mere two points behind Everton, whose match at Leicester tomorrow suddenly takes on even more importance. Saints clear, and the place erupts in celebration of their first home win of the season! 90 min +6: Nope, there\u2019s time for another, as Capoue crosses from the right. It looks like creeping in over the keeper\u2019s head! McCarthy is forced to tip over for a corner. From which ... 90 min +5: Some head tennis in the Southampton box. The ball drops to Gray, on the edge of the box. He\u2019s got time to shoot - not much, but just enough. However, he slices his effort well wide left. Watford\u2019s last chance looks to have been spurned. 90 min +3: Nothing comes of the corner. Sky have just shown some footage of Southampton\u2019s equaliser, in which Djenepo, stooping mid dribble, keeps control with his hand. Had VAR seen it, the goal would probably have been ruled out. But VAR didn\u2019t see it, and here we are. 90 min +2: Watford pump it into the mixer. Saints blooter it back upfield. This is desperate stuff. Foster returns it, and Valery carelessly runs it out for a corner for Watford. 90 min +1: Bednarek cynically knocks Masina over just as the Watford man was thinking about breaking. A free kick just inside the Saints area, and a chance to load the box. 90 min: There will be six minutes of added time. 89 min: Ings drives down the inside-left channel and nearly breaks into the box. Not quite. Collectively, Southampton have been a mixed bag tonight, and no mistake, but Ings has been their one constant all match. He\u2019s been fantastic. 87 min: Sarr goes scampering after a long ball down the left. Suddenly Stephens looks in control of himself, and draws a foul from the frustrated striker as he shepherds the ball away from danger. So much changed in the space of five minutes. 85 min: Watford had so many chances to put this one to bed. And now they\u2019re the ones who\u2019ll be bottom of the Premier League tonight, six adrift of safety. In the dugout, Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores wears the look of a condemned man. His second coming at Vicarage Road isn\u2019t going to plan at all. The free kick was worth waiting for! Ward-Prowse whips a Beckhamesque effort into the top left. Right in the corner! Foster can\u2019t keep it out, at full stretch, the ball always bending away from him. That was perfectly placed, and sent whistling in at speed to boot. St Mary\u2019s, so quiet for so long, is buzzing now! 82 min: Before the free kick can be taken, Femenia is replaced by Foulquier. 81 min: Hojbjerg dribbles down the inside left. Capoue sticks out a tired leg and brings the Saints captain down just outside the box. Close enough that Saints claim a penalty, but they\u2019re not getting it, and rightly so. 80 min: Suddenly it\u2019s all Saints. They\u2019ve been so much better since the double substitution. Big credit to Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. This had been coming. Djenepo dribbles with purpose down the right, sashays past Holebas and from the byline pulls back to Ings, who bundles in from the middle of a melee by the right-hand post. St Mary\u2019s erupts! 77 min: It\u2019s end to end. Saar bombs down the inside-right but he\u2019s hustled out of it by Bertrand. Saints go up the other end. Ward-Prowse curls a deep cross in from the right. Ings, at the far post, hooks it back to Long, who bobbles the ball towards the bottom left. But Cathcart hooks it off the line! 76 min: Southampton\u2019s final roll of the dice: Cedric is replaced by Valery. 74 min: Hughes goes off ... slo-o-o-o-ooooowly ... to be replaced by Chalobah. Djenepo gives him a wee shove in the back to hurry him up. And why not. 73 min: Nothing comes of the corner. 72 min: But the troubles at the back aren\u2019t going away. Stephens plays a sloppy pass out of defence, allowing Hughes to take up possession. He feeds Gray down the left. Gray tries to tee up Saar in the middle, but Bednarek arrives to deflect the ball out for a corner. 70 min: Djenepo wins a corner down the right. Nothing comes of it, but team and crowd are finally energised. Saints have finally turned up, just over an hour into the match. 69 min: VAR say relax no penalty. 68 min: Some good work by Ings out on the left. The ball\u2019s hooked to Long, who scoops a shot towards the top right. It\u2019s going to waft into the net, but Foster gets a fingertip on it, diverting the ball onto the crossbar. Watford half-clear. Cedric fires the ball back into the box from the right. Djenepo goes over near Capoue. He wants a penalty! VAR check. 67 min: And that\u2019s Deulofeu\u2019s last contribution this evening. He\u2019s replaced by Gray, and takes his gloves off in a stroppy fashion as he walks off, the great diva. 66 min: Hughes sends Deulofeu scampering free down the left. Sarr\u2019s in the middle, waiting for the delivery that could put Saints in all sorts of trouble, but turns out Deulofeu is a couple of inches offside. 64 min: And suddenly it\u2019s Watford who are looking a little nervous. Foster dithers over a clearance, the ball at his feet. He slips, and Ings looks to benefit. Foster sticks out an arm to impede the striker, but Ings falls onto Foster\u2019s back, so Watford get the decision, even though Saints scream for a penalty. 63 min: But this is much better! Djenepo reaches the byline down the right and fizzes a cross that Long contests. The ball breaks to Boufal, just inside the area on the left. His shot is blocked out for a corner. Ward-Prowse\u2019s dead-ball delivery hasn\u2019t been great this evening, and this one goes straight into Foster\u2019s arms. An improvement. 61 min: On this showing, you have to wonder how Southampton gave Arsenal so much trouble last weekend. Ah but hold on. 60 min: Ward-Prowse blooters the free kick straight into Capoue\u2019s coupon. The Watford captain is flat on his back. The referee stops play so he can be revived and assessed. Looks like he\u2019s good to continue. 59 min: The corner leads to another corner that comes to nothing, but Long is already putting himself about. And suddenly there\u2019s a little surge of Saints energy, as Djenepo dribbles straight at Mariappa, draing a foul just outside the Watford area. A good position, this. 57 min: Before the set piece can be taken, Saints make a double switch. Redmond and Obafemi are hooked, Boufal and Long coming on in their stead. Redmond looks a tad affronted at the decision, but off he trots. 56 min: Ings presses the Watford defence, a one-man show. He wins a corner off Mariappa, something out of nothing. He\u2019s been feeding on scraps, poor chap. 54 min: Not that Ward-Prowse\u2019s proud industry has stopped the Saints faithful from giving their team pelters. They\u2019ve been abysmal so far, and it would appear patience has finally run dry. Matters aren\u2019t helped when Sarr fizzes a shot towards the top right from distance - it flies inches over - nor when the same player nearly bustles Stephens out of the road for another strike on goal. Stephens stands firm this time. 52 min: Ward-Prowse gifts possession to Sarr in midfield. Sarr tears off up the other end. Southampton\u2019s captain is fortunate that Sarr suddenly becomes indecisive, with Deulofeu in space to his right. He\u2019s allowed to redeem himself by snapping back at Sarr and regaining the ball, just as it looked as though Southampton would be opened up again. 50 min: There\u2019s an air of weary resignation around St Mary\u2019s right now. Southampton are doing nothing; their fans are deflated. Someone\u2019s got to get the wheel turning again, and quick. As things stand, Saints will be bottom tonight, five points adrift of 17th-placed Everton. 48 min: Redmond goes on a purposeful run down the left but can\u2019t find anyone with his cutback. Then as Watford clear, he\u2019s booked for standing on Femenia\u2019s foot. 46 min: Capoue dithers over an opportunity to shoot at the Southampton goal from the edge of the box. The defenders do nothing to resolve the situation whatsoever, and are fortunate their striker Ings is wily enough to track back and block. Danger over. Watford get the ball rolling again. No half-time changes. Half-time reading. The Euro 2020 draw has been made. Never mind who England and Wales have got; Group F has Germany, France and reigning champions Portugal in it! Now that\u2019s a good old-fashioned group of death. And that\u2019s the end of the first half. Saints are booed off. They\u2019ve been nervous, tentative and at times downright rank bad. Watford have been the more dangerous side, and could easily be further ahead. It\u2019s going to be a big second half for both teams. Can Saints relocate their mojo? Can Watford hang on? A season-shaping 45 minutes coming up. 45 min: Space for Ings inside the Watford area on the left. His cross is plucked from the sky by Foster. Suddenly Southampton have remembered how to play. Just a shame for them that there are only two additional minutes to be played before the break. 44 min: And after all that\u2019s gone before, Saints are an inch or two away from a sensational equaliser! Cedric drags a low cross into the Watford box from the right. Ward-Prowse meets it with a clever backflick, guiding the ball towards the bottom left. Foster scrambles across in a panic, and he\u2019s not getting there in time. But the ball bobbles just wide. 43 min: The tension in St Mary\u2019s is palpable as last man Stephens dithers over a backpass to McCarthy with Sarr breathing down his neck. Saints clear their lines just in time. 41 min: Stephens makes another error under a long ball, and is lucky that Deulofeu\u2019s touch lets him down again as he scarpers clear down the left. This is a risible defensive display by Southampton. But they\u2019ve somehow kept Watford to the single goal, and there\u2019ll be a chance to regroup coming up at half-time. A big few minutes coming up. 40 min: Some good work between Hojbjerg and Bertrand down the left. Corner. Again Ward-Prowse\u2019s delivery is nonsense, but the ball\u2019s recycled down the left for Redmond, who isn\u2019t too far away with a cute curler meant for the top-right corner. Just over. And that\u2019s better from the Saints. 38 min: Djenepo gives up possession easily and suddenly Deulofeu is scuttling with menace down the left, Saints extremely light at the back. Sarr is in the middle, one on one with Bednarek. A better pass from Deulofeu, and he\u2019d be through on goal. But no. Saints are giving up a number of chances here. They\u2019ll be most grateful they\u2019re not playing Leicester. 36 min: Holebas is up and about again. The break in play for his treatment leads to a lull. 34 min: A break in play as Ward-Prowse and Holebas collide and roll about injured. Holebas appears to have come off worse; he looks genuinely pained, while Ward-Prowse springs back up again quickly. 32 min: Hughes dinks a pass down the right to release Deulofeu. Where\u2019s Bertrand? Deulofeu would be in on goal, but takes a poor touch to the right. So instead of shooting he crosses towards Sarr. McCarthy does well to tip the cross away from the striker, who was preparing to bundle the ball home. The resulting corner comes to nothing. Watford could be out of sight, three goals clear, quite easily. The small margins. 30 min: Hughes swings the free kick deep. Sarr, brimful with confidence, meets the dropping ball and sends a volley towards the bottom left. McCarthy does extremely well to save the day by sticking out a strong leg. So close to a second for the Hornets. 29 min: Saints faff about with the ball in the midfield, and allow Deulofeu, Sarr and Hughes to make merry down the left flank. They earn a cheap foul, and here\u2019s another chance to load the Saints box and kick off some trouble for the home side. 27 min: Redmond races down the left into a bit of space. But there are five Watford defenders lined up across the front of the box, and it\u2019s hard to pick a pass. Eventually the ball\u2019s scooped towards Ings, who sends a looping header straight at Foster. The Watford keeper hasn\u2019t had to make a serious intervention yet. 25 min: Southampton do not like playing at St Mary\u2019s, do they. Yes, I miss the Dell too. Saints try to bounce back immediately, forcing a corner down the left, but Ward-Prowse can\u2019t beat the first man when taking the set piece. Yep, a jittery shambles all right. Femenia lumps the ball down the right for Sarr. Stephens should intercept, but only manages to help the ball into the path of Sarr, allowing Watford\u2019s new striker to advance clear on goal. He draws McCarthy and lashes the ball past him. A smattering of boos from the home fans. 22 min: McCarthy diddles the pressing Deulofeu with a cute change of feet ... then the cheers turn to jeers as he passes the ball straight out of play, nowhere near his full-back Cedric. Saints are a jittery shambles at the back, though the team are enjoying the bulk of possession, twice as much as their opponents. So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. 21 min: ... Doucoure sends a soft header into the arms of McCarthy. 20 min: Sarr turns Cedric this way and that, and earns himself a corner. From which ... 18 min: Ward-Prowse, out on the right, plays a crossfield ball towards absolutely nobody. As it flies into the stand, the away fans cheer sarcastically, while the home support begins to grumble, curse, eff and jeff. 17 min: Cedric looks long for Ings. The striker flicks a header on, but neither Redmond nor Obafemi are on the same wavelength, and there goes possession. 15 min: Deulofeu swings it in. Saints half clear. Watford come back at the hosts through Holebas on the left. There\u2019s a game of head tennis in the box, and then Femenia shoots wide from the penalty spot. The flag had gone up for offside anyway, but Saints were all over the shop there. 14 min: Sarr is blocked by Bednarek has he attempts to scoot down the right wing. A free kick, and a chance for Watford to load the box. 13 min: Saints press Watford hard. Hojberg wins possession and slips Redmond away down the left. The flag goes up for offside, a hair-trigger decision. Redmond looked on, just, and would have been making his way towards the Watford area with extreme prejudice. 12 min: Cedric plays long down the inside-right channel, looking for Ings. It\u2019s not a bad idea, but Foster is out quickly and claims on the edge of his box. 10 min: Saints knock it around the back awhile, establishing a semblance of control. 8 min: Redmond drives in from the left and rides a half-hearted Capoue challenge. When he reaches the edge of the D, he sends a powerful curler towards the top right. A highly decent effort, but one anticipated by Foster, who gathers without fuss. 7 min: Masina slides in recklessly on Obafemi. Referee Michael Oliver keeps his cards in his pocket, but lectures the Watford defender with great feeling. Next one yellow. 6 min: McCarthy plays a loose pass out to Cedric, who should nevertheless take up possession but lets the ball run out of play. A chance for Watford to fling the ball into the box from the throw. They don\u2019t take it, but that\u2019s not the point: Saints are looking extremely shaky at the back, their collective lack of confidence writ large. 4 min: Hojbjerg is much more assured up the other end, chesting down a loose ball on the edge of the Watford box and lashing a Le Tissieresque rasper just over the bar. It could easily be 1-1 already. 2 min: Saints nearly shoot themselves in the foot early doors. Cedric passes back down his right flank to Hojbjerg, who plays a blind pass inside ... straight to Sarr! The striker tears into a huge hole in the middle of the Saints defence, but shoots straight at McCarthy from the edge of the box. What a let-off for Southampton, whose home form is appalling. And we\u2019re off! Saints get the ball rolling. The ball\u2019s launched long by Stephens, then shanked straight out of play by Mariappa. The only way is up. The teams are out! Southampton are in their red and white stripes, while Watford play in second-choice blue. We\u2019ll be off at a shivering St Mary\u2019s before you know it! A quick reminder that the draw for Euro 2020 will be made while this game is on. You can keep an eye on that with Will Unwin\u2019s live blog. But don\u2019t go leaving us for good, now. Promise? Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores speaks! \u201cIt is very similar to our match at Norwich. Both teams with necessities. We need to win. We will try to repeat the good performances away against Tottenham and Norwich, when we were focused and concentrating well. We will try to be quicker than Southampton and more clinical in the last third.\u201d The Tonight Show with Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl: \u201cThe most positive thing about the 2-2 draw at Arsenal was that we were on the front foot and really aggressive. It was an OK game for us. Today will be different, Watford will not build up so much from the ground, so more long balls. But we have shown we can handle this. We are conceding early goals at home and it makes things difficult. We have to change this behaviour. This is our goal for today: start in a different way. Every Premier League game is difficult, but we have a chance to take points against opponents who are near to us in the table. It is an important period of the season, and the last game against Arsenal was a small step in the right direction.\u201d One change to the Southampton team named at Arsenal last week. The injured Stuart Armstrong (hamstring) is replaced by Moussa Djenepo. Sofiane Boufal is on the bench, despite stubbing a big toe on his kitchen table at home. Watford make two changes to the side that went down hard against Burnley. Andre Gray and the injured Craig Dawson are replaced by record signing Ismaila Sarr and Adam Masina. Southampton: McCarthy, Cedric, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Djenepo, Ward-Prowse, Hojbjerg, Redmond, Ings, Obafemi. Subs: Yoshida, Long, Adams, Romeu, Boufal, Gunn, Valery. Watford: Foster, Femenia, Mariappa, Cathcart, Masina, Holebas, Doucoure, Capoue, Hughes, Deulofeu, Sarr. Subs: Gomes, Deeney, Chalobah, Gray, Quina, Foulquier, Pereyra. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Anyone up for a relegation six-pointer? Good, good, just as well, because the bottom two face off at St Mary\u2019s this evening, and whoever loses this will find themselves careering hysterically towards the slough of despond. A draw\u2019s no good for either team, we know this much already. Watford are bottom, five points adrift of safety already, while Saints are just one place and point better off. The Hornets have only won one game in the league this season; Southampton have managed to double that tally, but then Watford haven\u2019t lost one of their home fixtures 9-0. So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Up and down and round and round we go. Watford beat Norwich impressively at the start of the month, a mere two Premier League fixtures ago; Saints haven\u2019t tasted victory in the division since the middle of September. But that was at Sheffield United, who are now proven to be nobody\u2019s mugs, and Conan O\u2019Brien Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s men really should have trounced Arsenal by two or three goals last weekend, the eventual 2-2 result at the Emirates scarcely believable given the chances they carved out. Good luck calling this one, then. Both teams are desperate; both are capable of pulling a performance out of the bag on their day. Both are good for capitulation, too. So this could be a rollercoaster ride. Buckle up. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden has embarked upon an eight-day \u201cno malarkey barnstorm\u201d bus tour across Iowa as the former US vice-president attempts to arrest his flagging poll numbers in the key state, which is the first to vote in the race to be the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee. Biden started his election blitz on Saturday, telling supporters in a fundraising email that he was undertaking an \u201ceight-day, 18 county, \u2018no nalarkey\u2019 barnstorm\u201d across Iowa. \u201cThe plan is to meet as many caucus-goers as I can, and we\u2019re going to cover a lot of ground to do it,\u201d the email read. On Sunday, the former vice president was due to attend a meet-and-greet in Carroll, a town hall in Storm Lake, meet and greets in Jefferson and Perry, and a town hall in Spencer. The bus tour follows recent polling that shows Biden\u2019s standing has slipped among Democratic voters in Iowa who, on 3 February, will be the first caucus in the US to pick a favored candidate to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. After topping the Democratic field in the state in several polls as recently as September, the 77-year-old has seemingly been eclipsed by Pete Buttigieg in recent surveys of Iowan Democrats. Still, the polls show a tight race and Biden\u2019s supporters deny that his campaign is in any sort of trouble, especially as he still frequently leads the Democratic field in national polls. \u201cAs people get closer and closer to February, they become more and more practical about this,\u201d said the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack, who recently gave Biden his most high-profile Iowa endorsement. \u201cHe can make the strongest case, among all the candidates, that he is in a position to get things done, and he is in a position to win.\u201d Biden opened November with an underwhelming speech at the state party\u2019s \u201cLiberty &amp; Justice\u201d gala.

In south-east Iowa, the state party\u2019s rural caucus vice-chairman says Biden\u2019s footprint isn\u2019t visible. \u201cI know the names of the people who are supporting various other candidates,\u201d Glenn Hurst said. \u201cBut in terms of people out there knocking on doors, who attend other campaign events, district events, I can\u2019t name a member of the south-east Iowa Democrats who\u2019s supporting Joe Biden.\u201d Fairly or not, Biden\u2019s national staff has fueled skeptical assessments with pronouncements that he doesn\u2019t have to win Iowa to win the nomination. Iowa is overwhelmingly white; Biden\u2019s national advantage leans heavily on non-white voters who help determine outcomes in Nevada, South Carolina and many 3 March Super Tuesday states. Yet all the handwringing misses key variables in Iowa, according to Vilsack and other Biden supporters. They contend that, public enthusiasm aside, Biden has the broadest range of support both demographically and geographically, especially in rural and small-town Iowa and among the growing minority population that, while small, could prove important with so many candidates dividing the overall caucus vote. Those Biden organizers that get so much criticism, the campaign says, spend their days not with local party officials, but with volunteers knocking on doors and making calls. Their focus: reliable caucus participants, plus disaffected Republicans and independents. \u201cThe media seems to have picked up this narrative that the Biden campaign is not doing well or not as well as it should,\u201d said the longtime party activist and Biden supporter Phyllis Hughes Ewing, daughter of a former Iowa governor and US senator. \u201cI\u2019m on the phones with voters two nights a week for several hours at a pop. I\u2019m a boot on the ground, and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a recap of what we know so far. The attack started just before 2pm on Friday at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, at the north end of London Bridge, where a prisoner rehabilitation conference was underway. 28-year-old Usman Khan, who was attending the conference, stabbed five people, before moving onto the bridge where he was restrained by members of the public and shot by police. Two people were killed, a man and a woman. The man has been named as 25-year-old Jack Merritt, the course coordinator for Learning Together, a programme run by the University of Cambridge\u2019s institute of criminology, which was running the event. Three people, a man and two women, are injured and remain in hospital. A convicted murderer was among ex-prisoners and members of the public who grappled with the attacker. One man was armed with a fire extinguisher and another \u2013 identified in reports as Polish chef \u0141ukasz \u2013 wielded a 5ft narwhal tusk taken from Fishmongers\u2019 Hall. Among those who pinned down the attacker was James Ford, 42, who is also thought to have tried to save the life of a woman who had been stabbed. He was jailed for life in 2004 for the murder of 21-year-old Amanda Champion. British Transport police have confirmed that a man in a suit filmed running away from the scene with a knife taken from the attacker was one of their officers in plain clothes. Usman Khan was previously jailed for an al-Qaida inspired plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange and was wearing an electronic tag at the time of the attack. He released from jail on licence in 2018, half way through a 16-year sentence. Khan\u2019s lawyer told the Guardian that his client had asked for help to be deradicalised while he was in prison. Police have searched properties in Stoke, where Khan was from, and Stafford. They have said that there is no evidence anybody else was involved. Isis claimed that the attack was carried out by one of its fighters, though it provided no evidence. Politicians have sought to blame each other for the fact that Khan was able to stage the attack after being convicted on terrorism offences. Home secretary Priti Patel blamed it on legislation brought in by the previous Labour government, while shadow home secretary Diane Abbott pointed to a lack of resources. More from Nosheen Iqbal in Stoke: Outside Khan\u2019s family home, where his parents lived, nobody was answering the door but half a dozen young Muslim men were gathered in the cold, rebuffing reporters from the BBC and Daily Mail. \u201cWhy are they hanging here?\u201d Mahmood, a taxi driver, was incensed by the group. \u201cThey\u2019re just hanging about in the streets and when they\u2019re hanging about like that people think they\u2019re gangs. Then they act like gangs and get into drugs and extremism,\u201d he speculated. \u201cThese are awara boys, awara means loafer, layabout, good for nothing. That\u2019s one problem with young boys when they leave school and have no hope in life. It makes some of them easy to brainwash into drugs and extremism \u2013 they are both the same thing to me. Dangerous. Bad. If you\u2019re taking drugs or a criminal, it\u2019s easier to become an extremist I think.\u201d Two streets down, Mr Rehman, who has children the same age as Khan, said locals were still processing what had happened. \u201cYesterday, this was something that happened in London. It wasn\u2019t until 2am that people found out in the news that there were links to Staffordshire; when I woke up, [reports] said Khan had come from here? No he didn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t living here.\u201d The community wasn\u2019t in denial, he said, but everyone was feeling \u201cvery sensitive\u201d. How was the community feeling towards the Khan family? \u201cLook, it\u2019s shameful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people feel sorry for the family. No one wants to get involved and put any blame on the parents, everyone knows it\u2019s not their fault. Some kids become uncontrollable, what are they supposed to do?\u201d The Khan family originate from Mirpur, in Azad Kashmir, which has grown to become the largest city in the region and is known as \u201cLittle England\u201d \u2013 much of the modern buildings, several storey homes and restaurants in recent decades have been built by the British Mirpuri expat community. Islamic State has said that the London Bridge attack on Friday was carried out by one of its fighters, though they did not provide any evidence. The group\u2019s Amaq news agency reported that the attack was made in response to Isis calls to target countries that have been part of a coalition fighting the jihadist group. More from Nosheen Iqbal in Stoke-on-Trent: Mohammed Pervez, local councillor for the Moorcroft ward where Khan\u2019s parents live, was dealing with a questions from residents when we met in the street. Everyone is shocked. Our heart goes out to the people affected by this horrific attack, and we are all upset but for one, this person has not been in this community or connected to this community for over a decade now. To my knowledge, he hasn\u2019t been back here. He was forgotten in effect until the incident. He has nothing to do with us and we didn\u2019t know he had been released from prison. Rabeea, a teaching assistant who was carrying groceries from Costcutter, couldn\u2019t understand how a close neighbour could have been involved in the terror attack. Yes, this is a socially deprived area in some ways but you can\u2019t talk about that because it sounds like an excuse for this person and there is no excuse. He has committed such an haraam act, but what can his parents do? You can\u2019t blame them \u2013 some of that generation are in a funny middle ground where they don\u2019t listen to their parents or the elders. They use their rights and freedoms to tell them that they can\u2019t be told what to do. They don\u2019t listen. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has tweeted that the government \u201cneed to listen to police chiefs who say a lack of resources to policing and the criminal justice system puts us all in danger\u201d. \u201cWe need the proper resources to monitor convicted terrorists,\u201d she said. Observer reporter Nosheen Iqbal has been speaking to people in Stoke-on-Trent. At zuhr prayers on Saturday lunchtime outside a small white and green mosque in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, dozens of men and women in puffa jackets, heavy coats and kurtas gathered in the car park, unable to fit into the single storey building for the funeral taking place inside. \u201cOne of our community elders has passed, it\u2019s a massive death,\u201d explained a young, softly-spoken man in his twenties who didn\u2019t want to give his name. He grew up with Usman Khan, whose family live in a terraced cul-de-sac around the corner. The congregation was unusually subdued, making the street eerily quiet. \u201cHe grew up in our ends, we grew up on the same streets, we know every single one of his brothers and sisters, his mum and dad, we went to primary school and high school with him.\u201d A murmur of disquiet rippled among the older parents behind him, who asked their community to be left alone. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time and nobody wants to talk about it to journalists because we don\u2019t want to be associated with what happened in London,\u201d said the young man apologetically. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how [Khan] ended up like this. How can you have a person who went to prison for extremism and terror and then he\u2019s let out and he\u2019s got a tag on and ends up back in London to do this? How? Why?\u201d Home Secretary Priti Patel has blamed the previous Labour government for the fact that Usman Khan was free to carry out the attack at London Bridge. Patel took to Twitter to respond to Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, who had posted a series of tweets asking how the London Bridge attacker could have been released when he was deemed so dangerous. The Home Secretary responded: Because legislation brought in by your government in 2008 meant that dangerous terrorists had to automatically be released after half of their jail term. Conservatives changed the law in 2012 to end your automatic release policy but Khan was convicted before this. Patel then posted a link to a news article and tweeted: \u201cThe Parole Board could not be involved in this decision [Jeremy Corbyn]. Your party changed the law in 2008 so that Khan was automatically released irrespective of the danger he posed. Very concerning that you want to be PM but don\u2019t understand this.\u201d The Parole Board said it had no involvement in his release and that Khan \u201cappears to have been released automatically on licence\u201d halfway through his sentence. Downing Street said government officials, police and security officials held a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee on Saturday afternoon. A spokesperson said that the prime minister would receive further updates from security officials this evening and tomorrow morning. The BBC has this clip of Usman Khan speaking after his address was raided by anti-terror police in 2008. He later admitted being involved in a terrorist conspiracy. Khan denies that he is a terrorist, saying he is \u201cborn and bred in England\u201d. \u201cAll the community knows me and they will know, if you ask them, they will know. These labels that they will put on us like terrorist ... they will know. I ain\u2019t no terrorist,\u201d he says. Met assistant commissioner for specialist operations, Neil Basu, has been speaking to the press outside New Scotland Yard. He said there was no evidence that anybody else was involved in the attack. At this time we have found no evidence, no evidence to suggest that anybody else was involved in this attack. However, we\u2019re still making extensive enquiries to make sure nobody else was involved. Usman Khan was under the MAPPA \u2013 multi-agency public protection arrangements \u2013 at the time and \u201cthere was an extensive list of licence conditions\u201d, said Basu. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge he was compliant with those conditions\u201d. He said police had carried out two searches in Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent. The attack started just before 2pm in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall yesterday, said Basu. \u201cThe attacker, whose identity we confirmed last night, stabbed a number of people inside the building and as a result five people have suffered injuries. Three people, a man and two women, are injured and remain in hospital.\u201d He repeated that a man and a woman had been killed in the attack. \u201cOf course I am fully aware that the media and social media have named one of those victims. You must understand that I have to wait for formal identification from the coroner, but I will provide you with an update as soon as I can,\u201d he said. Basu said that the attacker was attending the event, called Learning Together, before he stabbed a number of people. He then left the building and went onto London Bridge, where he was pursued and detained by members of the public, as well as a plain clothed officer from the British Transport Police. Armed officers from both the City and Met polices then shot the attacker. He was wearing what \u201clooked like a very convincing explosive device\u201d. \u201cThankfully we now know that was a hoax device,\u201d he said. My colleague Molly Blackall has been at the scene of the attack today. Tony Fitzgerald, 50, walked past the TV cameras stationed at the base of the bridge carrying a bunch of flowers. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bunch of flowers other than my bunch,\u201d he said, visibly upset. \u201cWhere is everyone? I thought it would be packed with flowers, but you can\u2019t see anyone. I\u2019ve come all the way from Essex to be here, I couldn\u2019t sleep last night because it makes me sick.\u201d Imams left the first bunch of flowers at the site early this morning, and later joined Fitzgerald at the bridge where they shared an embrace. \u201cWhen we arrived this morning, there were no flowers, nothing,\u201d Mansoor Clarke said. \u201cWe thought it\u2019d be appropriate that for an act done in the name of Islam, we were the first to lay flowers.\u201d His fellow imam, Sabah Ahmedi, said: \u201cThe word Islam actually means peace, so when you have a Muslim terrorist, it\u2019s an oxymoron because it translates to peaceful terrorist.\u201cWe wanted to stand in solidarity with Londoners, and really the whole of humanity, and we\u2019ve found a community here in our shared grief,\u201d he added. Fitzgerald said: \u201cMy family are Irish, and Irish people shouldn\u2019t be blamed for the IRA, so why should Muslims be blamed for this?\u201d NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens, has said that the condition of a London Bridge victim who was critically injured has improved. \u201cWhile three people remain in hospital, this means two are now stable and a third has less serious injuries,\u201d he said. While the NHS is now dealing with immediate physical injuries, the psychological impact of such events sometimes only comes to light in the days and weeks afterwards. Those caught up in the attack - supported by their friends and loved ones - can access NHS advice and support, in the first instance through calling NHS 111 and the NHS website and from specialist services if needed. British Transport police have confirmed that a man in a suit filmed running away from the scene with a knife taken from the attacker was one of their officers in plain clothes. We are able to confirm that a serving British Transport Police officer was involved in yesterday\u2019s terror incident on London Bridge in the City of London. The officer, who was in plain clothes and who is based in London, helped other members of the public in detaining the suspect and preventing any further killings. He is seen in social media videos, holding a knife and walking away from the scene as City of London firearms officers arrive. The Metropolitan police service have asked that his image be pixelated, and we are kindly asking the public and media to respect this request and not identify the officer in any way. Chief constable Paul Crowther from British Transport Police, said: This morning I spoke with the British Transport Police officer who bravely ran towards danger yesterday afternoon. The courageous actions he took when faced with the horrors of this attack are remarkable. He, as well as other members of the public, should be extremely proud of what they did to stop this man on London Bridge. You can read the whole story about the comments from Usman Khan\u2019s lawyer here. Lawyer Vajahat Sharif said Khan, whom he last spoke to in March, was released to a bail hostel from where he had to report to a police station every day, had interactions with the probation service and had to wear a tag. In prison he begin to realise his Islamic thinking was not correct; he accepted that. He criticised the al-Qaida ideology and violent extremism. He did recognise that his Islamic understanding was incomplete. A lot of these characters pick and choose from different sermons, it\u2019s like an echo chamber. Sharif said the policy for terrorist prisoners needed to change to boost efforts to turn them away from supporting ideologies that incite violence: \u201cThere is a flaw in the policy. You should have substantial ideological evaluation of these individuals before they are released on licence.\u201d In a series of tweets, Jack Merritt\u2019s father warned that he did not want his son\u2019s death to be used as an excuse to introduce \u201cmore draconian\u201d sentences. He wrote: My son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people unnecessarily. R.I.P. Jack: you were a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog. [...] Cambridge lost a proud son and a champion for underdogs everywhere, but especially those dealt a losing hand by life, who ended up in the prison system. One of the victims has been named in reports as Jack Merritt, who worked as a co-ordinator for Learning Together, a prisoner rehabilitation initiative run by the University\u2019s Institute of Criminology, which organised the conference at which the attack started. Cambridgeshire Live is quoting from a tweet, sent by Merritt\u2019s father, David, in which he pays tribute to his son. \u201cYou were a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog,\u201d he said. City of London police have released a statement from the commissioner, Ian Dyson. In a statement at the scene, Sadiq Khan said that London Bridge was set to stay closed for \u201csome time\u201d while investigations and forensic tests took place, reports Molly Blackall. The mayor of London confirmed that one of the injured was in critical condition. Khan said that police thought the attacker was acting alone, describing the attack as \u201cnot sophisticated\u201d. He said he was proud of the \u201cordinary people who acted in extraordinary ways\u201d, describing them as the \u201cbest of us, and the best of humanity\u201d. \u201cThere are many reasons to be depressed and gloomy, but every day miracles occur,\u201d he said, praising the \u201camazing heroism\u201d, with people \u201cusing their initiative regarding weapons to de-weaponise the man who had two knives\u201d. \u201cThe members of the public and police who intervened had no idea whether the device [the attacker was wearing] was real, or what other weapons he had,\u201d he added. Khan insisted that while the terror threat level had been taken down to \u2018substantial\u2019, meaning a terror attack was likely, that \u201cdidn\u2019t mean the police or others were any less vigilant\u201d. Responding to speculation over the nationalities of the members of the public who apprehended the attacker, he confirmed that one was a Londoner of Polish origin. \u201cOne of the great things about London is its diversity, so I\u2019m not surprised at all. When I say \u2018the best of us\u2019, I include EU citizens as well.\u201d The mayor said London was \u201cgetting back to business as usual\u201d and praised people carrying on with day-to-day life, saying it was great to see so many people in \u201cbustling\u201d Borough market. Former chief prosecutor, Nazir Afzal, has said the government was repeatedly warned of the risk posed by convicted terrorists being released from prison while still radicalised. Writing on twitter, he said he had spoken to Boris Johnson on 30 June 2016 at a 50th anniversary function at Brunel University, in Uxbridge, west London, where he is an MP. He asked me what keeps me awake at night and I told him it was this issue. When he wanted to know what to do about it, I told him it was more resources for one-to-one deradicalisation. Back then, he hadn\u2019t found the \u2018money tree\u2019 so he frustratingly said there was no money [...] The problem of those convicted for terrorist-related offences being released from prison whilst ostensibly rehabilitated but still radicalised was one that many of us raised in meetings with this government over the past few years. Radicalised prisoners will not change their mind set with traditional rehabilitation and I don\u2019t see any major strategy to alter that reality. We are in danger from several men who have served their sentence but remain fixated on doing us harm. We may have missed the time for action, I sincerely hope not. A convicted murderer was among ex-prisoners and members of the public who grappled with and eventually grounded the London Bridge knife attacker before police arrived, Sarah Marsh reports. Among those who pinned down the attacker was James Ford, 42, who is also thought to have tried to save the life of a woman who had been stabbed. Ford was jailed for life in 2004 for the murder of 21-year-old Amanda Champion. Ford, who is understood to be serving the final days of his sentence at HMP Standford Hill, an open prison in Kent, was on London Bridge as the attack unfolded. The prime minister has been speaking to journalists on his visit to the scene. He said he had \u201clong said\u201d that the system of automatic early release wasn\u2019t working: Obviously it\u2019s early days and there\u2019s a lot of investigations that need to be done. But it is clear to me that this guy was out, he\u2019d served half of his sentence. He was out on automatic early release and I have long said that this system simply isn\u2019t working. It does not make sense for us as a society to be putting people convicted of terrorist offences, of serious violent offences, out on early release. I\u2019ve argued that when people are sentenced to a certain number of years in prison they should serve every year of that sentence.\u201d Asked about reassuring the public that they are safe if other convicted terrorists are out on licence, the prime minister said: \u201cWell I can tell you that we\u2019ve had a long discussion already today about all those cases and a great deal of work is being done right now to make sure that the public is protected.\u201d The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, is at London Bridge. He said: \u201cYesterday we saw ordinary people acting in extraordinary ways.\u201d ITV News has a letter written by the attacker from jail, asking to take part in a deradicalisation course. He wrote: I would like to do such a course so I can prove to the authorities, my family and soicity (sic) in general that I don\u2019t carry the views I had before my arrest and also I can prove that at the time I was immature, and now I am much more mature and want to live my life as a good Muslim and also a good citizen of Britain. The Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, has been speaking to journalists at the scene. It is a terrible thing to see where people lost their lives and there was so much devastation and carnage. Rest assured our teams are incredibly professional. They have all of the equipment and skills they need to find out exactly what happened here and indeed what lead up to the events here yesterday ... She said police would be in the area of the attack for some time to come, but that they were doing their best to open roads and that London Bridge station was open. Yesterday we saw \u201cthe most extraordinary courage\u201d from members of the public, she said. \u201cIt was a terrible thing that people found themselves in that position, but as we saw the worst of human kind, we also saw the very best of human spirit and of London.\u201d She repeated that they believed the attacker was acting alone. The London Bridge attacker had asked while in prison for help to be deradicalised, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif told the Guardian that Usman Khan had come to see violent extremism as wrong and had accepted his understanding of Islam was deficient. Sharif told the Guardian: He requested intervention by a deradicaliser when he was in prison. The only option was the probation service and they cannot deal with these offenders. He asked me on the phone to get assistance from a specific deradicaliser. He asked (me) once or twice before he was released in 2018. Probation do a good job with conventional offenders but they can\u2019t deal with ideological offenders. The full story will be up soon. The man who used a narwhal tusk to apprehend the attacker has been named in media reports as \u0141ukasz, a chef from Poland who worked in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall. The prime minister and home secretary have visited the scene of the attack. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel met with Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, and City of London police commissioner, Ian Dyson, inside the police cordon shortly after 11.30am. They then accompanied the police chiefs in a walkabout of the area. The BBC has agreed to allow the prime minister to appear on tomorrow\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, in light of yesterday\u2019s terrorist attack. The broadcaster previously said it would not offer Boris Johnson a slot on Marr unless he agreed to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, as the Labour party leader was earlier this week. Here\u2019s some background. Dal Babu, former Met police chief superintendent, has called for an urgent review of the resources available to monitor convicted terrorists. The terrorist attack on London Bridge demonstrated the worst and best in society. This cowardly individual sought to kill indiscriminately, but brave Londoners alongside the police prevented further deaths because of their swift actions. They are truly heroes. Fundamentally, a lack of resources to policing and the criminal justice system puts us all in danger. We need to carry out an urgent review of the resources available to monitor convicted terrorists by the police and security services, including what impacts privatisation has had on the probation service. Usman Khan was previously convicted of terror offences, including plotting to attack the London Stock Exchange in 2010. He was part of a gang of nine extremists from Stoke-on-Trent, Cardiff and London who were sentenced in February 2012 at Woolwich crown court. You can read the judge\u2019s sentencing remarks here. Here is a key passage: In my judgment they are more serious jihadis than the others ... They were intent on obtaining training for themselves and others whom they would recruit and, as such, were working to a more ambitious and more serious jihadist agenda. In my judgment, these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on licence in the community, subject to conditions, by reference to a preordained release date. In my judgment the safety of the public in respect of these offenders can only adequately be protected if their release on licence is decided upon, at the earliest, at the conclusion of the minimum term which I fix today. In a statement, the Queen has said: Prince Philip and I have been saddened to hear of the terror attacks at London Bridge. We send our thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to all those who have lost loved ones and who have been affected by yesterday\u2019s terrible violence. I express my enduring thanks to the police and emergency services, as well as the brave individuals who put their own lives at risk to selflessly help and protect others. The PA news agency has been speaking to residents living near a flat in Stafford believed to have been occupied by the London Bridge attacker. Retired police officer Justin Lightfoot, who lives in a nearby street, said he instantly recognised Usman Khan when a friend showed him a photograph on Saturday morning. The only thing I\u2019ve seen is him just walking past my house. I\u2019ve seen his picture this morning online and when I saw that obviously I recognised him. A friend showed me the picture and as soon as I saw it, I recognised him straight away. It\u2019s just frightening when somebody lives so close to you - you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on so near to your home. He added: I\u2019ve seen him for probably the last three or four weeks. Whether he was there longer or not I don\u2019t know. When I came home from work last night I saw the police here between half four and five o\u2019clock. There was a couple of police cars, a police car across the road. I had this feeling it might be something to do with that (the London Bridge attack) and then when I heard it on the radio last night and it said Staffordshire and then Stafford... it\u2019s just frightening. Usman Khan was likely to be considered a low to medium risk, priority-three target for Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies, reports the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh. MI5 characterises the individuals it monitors in four categories, with priority one applying where there is \u201ccredible and actionable\u201d intelligence of attack planning. Priority three individuals are those where \u201cfurther action is needed to determine where a threat exists\u201d. The majority of individuals released from prison after having served time for terror offences are placed in this category, and the reality is they are largely a matter for probation services, because there is not the resources - or necessarily the justification - to keep an intense focus on such people. Intelligence investigators will now be focusing on Khan\u2019s phone, email, as well as his home and any other key locations, in order to determine whether he had any associates or connections that spurred him on to the deadly attack. The working hypothesis is that Khan was a lone actor, who decided to act with little pre-planning, but that is far from settled as investigations continue. Such lone actors are notoriously difficult for the intelligence agencies to spot - a marked contrast to the more typical plots of a decade ago, where individuals would prepare in advance, seeking direction, perhaps travelling abroad as Khan himself did at the beginning of the decade, making them easier to disrupt. Some more on that Sky News report that the attacker had links to Anjem Choudary, who co-founded the now banned Al-Muhajiroun group. The broadcaster reports: Usman Khan was one of a series of Al-Muhajiroun connected terrorists to be released over a six-month period beginning in the autumn of 2018. He was known to have attended a series of Al-Muhajiroun protests and street stalls in the Midlands area prior to his arrest. In the months before his arrest and conviction for the London Stock Exchange terror plot, police raided his home in Tunstall, Staffordshire, over concerns about his links to Choudary. At the time of his arrest, investigators found Choudary\u2019s phone details on Khan\u2019s mobile phone. A counter-terrorism specialist has described the criminal justice system as playing \u201cRussian roulette\u201d with the public, after it was revealed the London Bridge attacker had been released from jail after being convicted of terror offences. Chris Phillips, a former head of the UK National Counter Terrorism Security Office, told the PA news agency: The criminal justice system needs to look at itself. We\u2019re letting people out of prison, we\u2019re convicting people for very, very serious offences and then they are releasing them back into society when they are still radicalised. So how on Earth can we ever ask our police services and our security services to keep us safe? I\u2019ve said it a few times today, we\u2019re playing Russian roulette with people\u2019s lives, letting convicted, known, radicalised Jihadi criminals walk about our streets. Sky News is reporting that the attacker was \u201ca student and personal friend\u201d of the radical preacher Anjem Choudary. Choudary was released from prison last year after serving half of the five-and-a-half-year sentence he received in 2016 for urging support for Isis and pledging allegiance to the terrorist group. The Metropolitan Police has renewed its call for anybody with information to come forward, particularly anyone who was at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall. The attacker \u2013 28-year-old Usman Khan \u2013 attended Fishmongers\u2019 Hall on Friday for a University of Cambridge-organised conference on rehabilitating offenders. Three members of the public, including one armed with a fire extinguisher and another a five-foot narwhal tusk, grappled with and eventually grounded the London Bridge knife attacker before police arrived, reports my colleague Sarah Marsh. Footage has emerged showing people at the scene surrounding the attacker, who is eventually pinned to the floor. One man sprays him with a fire extinguisher before trying to hit him with it, while another approaches him with a narwhal tusk, lunging at him with it. It is believed the item was pulled from the wall of Fishmongers\u2019 Hall. Read the full story here: Craig Heathcote was walking across the bridge as the attack happened. \u201cI was on the east side of the bridge, walking across it \u2013 heading to the supermarket on my lunch break. A man appeared in front of me and started screaming that there was someone with a knife, then I realised something was happening,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He said it took a while to process what was going on, but he could see what looked like a \u201cbig scuffle happening\u201d and what felt like \u201chundreds of people screaming\u201d on the bridge. \u201cThe police were not yet there so I called 999 as I felt no one else was [calling them] \u2026 While I was on the phone I think a car appeared. It was either the first response or by chance a car driving across the bridge, someone jumped out and waved them down. Two armed officers jumped out and took over situation,\u201d he said. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, has also been speaking to broadcasters this morning. Speaking to Sky News, he refused to comment on the specifics of the attack, but said more assessment was needed of the sentences given to violent criminals. We take what action we need to do and we believe is right under the advice of the police and look at all of the lessons learned from any case as quickly as we can to ensure people\u2019s safety. He said it would be \u201cinappropriate and dangerous\u201d to speculate on how the attacker had been able to arm himself even though he was on licence from prison. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: I think it is right that we do have to look again at the sentences, as I say, around these violent crimes. The prime minister has ... made that point previously and made it very clearly last night. We will want to move very swiftly because our first priority is the safety of people around the country. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has been speaking to broadcasters. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that \u201cyou can\u2019t disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation, the tools that judges have\u201d. He said armed police patrols would be stepped up in the capital over the coming days. The key thing is we need to support the police and security service. And of course politicians can\u2019t use trite words and trite language after a terror attack. The key thing is to remind ourselves of two things. First is yesterday we saw the very best of Londoners, but also, secondly, we\u2019ve got to make sure the right lessons are learnt. You can\u2019t disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation, the tools that judges have. It\u2019s all linked. He told Sky News that he did not think someone convicted of serious offences should be automatically released. Here are some photographs of the three-storey block of flats in Stafford in the West Midlands that is being searched by police following Friday\u2019s attack. The Press Association reports from the scene \u2013 Police tape and a large cordon remain in place around the London Bridge area on Saturday morning. A blue forensic tent has been erected at the junction of Cannon Street and King William Street, next to the entrance of Monument station. The station entrance remains closed as officers patrol the area. The Parole Board has issued a statement saying it had no involvement in the release of London Bridge attacker Usman Khan. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said that flags on UK government buildings will fly at half-mast on Saturday as a mark of respect to those who lost their lives and those who were affected by the attack. The London bridge attacker has been identified as Usman Khan. He was previously jailed for an al-Qaida inspired bomb plot. Scotland Yard were investigating the 28-year-old, who was known to the authorities and fitted with an electronic tag to monitor his movements. He was allowed out a year ago after serving time for his part in a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange. A police search believed to be linked to the London Bridge investigation is being carried out at a three-storey block of flats in Wolverhampton Road, Stafford, close to the town centre. A police photographer and search teams entered one of two doors at the front entrance, while two uniformed officers were present at a cordon outside the building. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has argued that more resourcing is needed for the policy, saying \u201cyou can\u2019t disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation, the tools that judges have\u201d. He said there would be an increased police presence on the streets in the wake of the attack to reassure members of the public Security minister Brandon Lewis refused to say whether the attack on London Bridge showed a failure by authorities. He repeatedly refused to comment on the specifics of the incident, but said that more assessment was needed of the sentences given to violent criminals. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog on the London bridge attack. We will be giving you regular coverage and updates on the situation.

      "bodyText": "The Bundaberg sugarcane farmer turned billionaire financier Lex Greensill wants to get inside your wallet. Greensill, who heads a global financial empire of the same name, has already enmeshed himself in the corporate world by offering a controversial product, supply-chain financing, which allows suppliers to big business to be paid earlier \u2013 for a fee. Now he says he wants to extend the idea to employees, who would get early access to their pay from Greensill through an app that acts \u201cas an ATM\u201d. At a meeting last month he told Scott Morrison the system could be applied to the 150,000 employees of the commonwealth public service. But critics of supply-chain financing have warned that it can encourage businesses to push out the terms they offer their suppliers, effectively using them as a source of finance. How does supply-chain financing work? In its supply-chain financing business, Greensill Capital strikes deals with big companies under which it offers their suppliers early payment terms on their invoices. This means that instead of getting paid in 30 or 60 days \u2013 or longer, as is a consistent complaint made by small businesses when dealing with big ones \u2013 a supplier can get paid immediately. In Australia, Telstra and the contractor CIMIC, formerly known as Leighton Holdings, are known to be using Greensill Capital. Effectively Greensill is offering suppliers a loan, and charging them interest at rates that depend on the level of risk that it won\u2019t be able to collect from the corporate client. Market sources say those rates can be as much as 8% a year, in the case of the Whyalla steel mill, which owner Gupta has previously told the Guardian has \u201cfundamental problems\u201d. But Greensill said the average rate was much lower. \u201cThe average here in Australia for our customers, it\u2019s between 1% and 2% per annum, and there are no other fees,\u201d he said. What concerns have been raised? The small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell, is investigating concerns about supply-chain financing, also known as reverse factoring, and the ratings agency Moody\u2019s is worried about the risk it might pose to the financial strength of companies. According to Moody\u2019s, big companies can benefit by extending the formal notice period for payments, thus putting pressure on suppliers to deal with supply-chain financers \u2013 a possibility that worries Carnell and Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor. Launching her inquiry on 30 October, the same day Greensill met the PM, Carnell said she would \u201cinvestigate whether supply-chain finance is being used by big business as a means to stretch out formal payment terms and as a strategy to manipulate the reporting of working capital and cash reserves\u201d. Labor\u2019s O\u2019Connor is blunter, accusing the government of allowing big business to use their suppliers as \u201cpiggy banks\u201d. He said he was \u201cconcerned about contrived \u2018reverse factoring\u2019 arrangements used by large businesses to obscure unreasonable extended payment times to small businesses\u201d. \u201cSmall businesses require prompt payments to help manage cash flow and to grow, particularly when access to finance is tight, and yet small business minister Michaelia Cash has to date been silent on the issue of reverse factoring,\u201d he said. Greensill stressed there was no obligation on suppliers to work with his company. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to say it\u2019s completely optional,\u201d Greensill said. \u201cI think the point Kate is making more generally is an encouragement for corporations to think carefully about having payment terms with smaller suppliers that are at or faster than 30 days.\u201d But he acknowledged the fee his company charges a supplier was sometimes shared with the big business it is billing. \u201cIn the case of the majority of the customers, we do not share the rate that we charge their suppliers back to them,\u201d he said. \u201cMost companies in Australia are focused on us delivering the cheapest possible credit to their suppliers.\u201d Moody\u2019s has also warned that the rise of reverse-factoring firms has been implicated in giant company failures overseas.

Unlike advances he offers to corporate suppliers \u2013 and also unlike a payday loan \u2013 Greensill proposes that it would be the employer, not the employee, who would pay a fee to his company for the credit. For employees, the fee would be nothing \u2013 \u201cever\u201d \u2013 he said. Both Greensill and a spokeswoman for the prime minister declined to discuss their meeting, which they said was private. However, Greensill was happy to talk about the company\u2019s push into the consumer world more generally. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, and we\u2019ve announced it publicly, we\u2019ve launched a product that we think will have pretty profound impact economically, around enabling employees to get paid every day and to do so at no cost,\u201d Greensill said. \u201cI meet with a number of world leaders \u2013 the British government is one of our biggest customers.

While it declared a profit of US$49.4m last year, up from US$20.8m in 2017, some observers struggle to understand how the sausage is made. Greensill himself seemed stumped when the Guardian asked how a US$9m negative operating cash flow \u2013 money spent to run the business \u2013 at its UK company translated into revenue declared by the same entity of more than US$233m. There was a pause. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what the answer to that is,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s finance team later provided a detailed answer, bridging the gap between the two numbers.

      "bodyText": "There was pressure from investors this week for more of the Westpac board to resign in the wake of Austrac revealing the company allegedly breached anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws 23m times, for $11bn in transactions, including several involving child abuse. Investors have already pressured the chief executive, Brian Hartzer, into resigning, and the chair, Lindsay Maxsted, to bring forward his departure. The moves come after a series of other scandals at the other major banks, and a scathing royal commission report earlier this year, which may have customers questioning who they do their banking with. While it might be easy for investors to throw their weight around and get action from the bank, customers only have a couple of options to voice discontent. Gerard Brody, the chief executive of the Consumer Action Law Centre, told Guardian Australia the first step for customers unhappy with Westpac is to lodge a complaint directly with the bank. The second move is to switch to another bank. The difficulty is, most of the banks have had issues. \u201cScandals have hit nearly all the banks,\u201d Brody said. \u201cThe CBA smart deposit machines similarly allowed wide-scale breaches of anti-money laundering [laws]. As demonstrated by the banking royal commission, there have been a range of other scandals \u2013 from the notorious \u2018fees for no service\u2019 on investment and superannuation products, to widespread mis-selling of junk insurance requiring millions of dollars in remediation.\u201d \u201cThese scandals have been in all the big banks.\u201d It is \u201cdisturbing\u201d for customers that Westpac didn\u2019t heed the warnings of the Commonwealth Bank scandal, Choice policy and campaigns adviser Patrick Veyret said. \u201cThey allegedly continued to break the law until as late as June this year,\u201d Veyret said. Another problem is a lot of the smaller banks are also linked to the big four. Westpac owns St George, Bank of Melbourne and Bank SA. Commonwealth owns BankWest and NAB owns UBank. \u201cThe banks create a false perception that there are lots of options in the market by using multiple brands or \u2018white labelling\u2019 products,\u201d Veyret said. \u201cThe best way to escape is to do your research about ownership \u2013 check to see if the little bank you\u2019re looking at is really independent.\u201d \u201c[Ownership] isn\u2019t always clear from their marketing,\u201d Brody said. \u201cHowever, there are a number of other smaller banks that are not owned by the big banks, and there are also international banks in the Australian market.\u201d Veyret said ING and Suncorp are two mid-sized banks that options away from the big four, and there are several customer-owned banks that focus on returning profits to members rather than shareholders. There is still a perception that changing banks is a hassle, and customers tend to be \u201csticky\u201d when it comes to who they bank with, Brody said. Some of the hassle is being removed from the process, however. Consumer Data Right laws that came into effect in July this year are slowly making it easier for customers to switch banks. As of July the big four banks have began providing customers with their transaction data to help their move. It will be a requirement for the big four banks to provide customers access to their data across all accounts, bar mortgages, from February next year, with all data to be available from the big four from February 2021. \u201cUnder the ePayments Code, banks must help existing and new customers when they switch their accounts between financial institutions,\u201d Brody said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The existing bank can provide you with over a year\u2019s worth of direct debit, credit and payment histories, and the new bank can help you notify organisations you have accounts with that you are moving. \u201cOur research has found that people who have switched banks found it straightforward and in many cases an easy process,\u201d Veyret said. Banks are also required to allow you to cancel a credit card online, provided you pay the outstanding balance. Veyret said customers should look at banks that have no monthly fees and unlimited free ATM and Eftpos transactions and transactions accounts should be linkable to a savings account with a reasonable interest rate. The process for moving home loans requires people to go to the new bank and get the home loan. The new bank can then arrange for the previous loan to be paid out and closed. Home loans are the biggest way to send Westpac a message, Veyret said. \u201cMortgages account for the largest source of income for Westpac,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat sends the clearest message to Westpac executives that their behaviour is unacceptable is when a Westpac mortgage holder switches banks. This will make the bank stand up and take notice.\u201d Veyret said if customers are pressured to stay with the bank when trying to close their account, they should stay strong. \u201cThey may ask you why you\u2019re leaving or try and get you to speak to a \u2018retention team\u2019. \u201cStay strong \u2013 you don\u2019t have to provide any explanation about why you\u2019re leaving if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d There isn\u2019t an easy way to avoid Westpac entirely, though, if your employer uses the bank to pay your salary, or if the state governments use them. \u201cMany stores that you use may bank with them, so you may have to use a particular bank\u2019s payment facilities,\u201d Brody said. \u201cHowever, you can have an impact by switching away your banking and service from them.\u201d Veyret said the market in Australia was very interconnected, but moving banks sends the clearest message to Westpac.

      "body": "<p>Askutasquash, askutasquash, askutasquash. I\u2019ve been rolling this word around my tongue and repeating it under my breath like a spell, a prayer for rain, an expression of gratitude to the Earth for producing it. The word askutasquash is from Narragansett, a Native American language from which the word squash derives. It translates to \u201ca green thing eaten raw or uncooked\u201d. What a beautiful word it is too.</p> <p>This genus of cucurbita includes many domesticated, cultivated species including <em>C. moschata</em> (crookneck pumpkin), <em>C. pepo</em> (field pumpkin) and <em>C. ficiofolia</em> (fig leaf gourd).</p> <p>So what is the difference between a squash and a pumpkin? A pumpkin is a variety of squash. The word is often used to describe a winter squash, thicker-skinned and starchier, harvested later in the season to store over the colder months.</p> <p>As the origin of the name suggests, we often think of squash as a summer vegetable eaten soft-skinned, young and tender. That\u2019s where the confusion between pumpkin and squash lies.</p> <p>The first known domestication of squash was in Mesoamerica, before maize and legumes, at least 8,000 years ago. An ancient and adaptive food, squash has spread globally. Every culture I can think of does delicious things with squash; you could say it\u2019s become instinct.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/27/masterclass-recipe-how-to-make-a-pumpkin-pie-felicity-cloake\">How to make a pumpkin pie \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I love growing them. On the farm we have more than 30 varieties, both summer and winter squashes, all heirlooms.</p> <p>I can relate to them totally. By nature they are nomadic, prolific, adaptive and lush. Then they completely cark it and give in, drying up, going back to the Earth \u2013 but not before leaving behind glorious fruit which we then harvest.</p> <p>Before the farm, I used to grow them in my backyard, cheering on the little seedlings as they pushed their way through the heavy mulching and well-composted soil. Then watching flabbergasted as they seemingly doubled in real estate overnight, covering my whole yard with an eye to bolt over to the neighbour\u2019s garden too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13721809e2a0add2017c53ec85910f802748c06b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13721809e2a0add2017c53ec85910f802748c06b/339_430_3304_2512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"When they\u2019re ready to harvest, delicata squash develop a light sunset blush.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"760\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When they\u2019re ready to harvest, delicata squash develop a light sunset blush.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Palisa Anderson/Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can\u2019t choose my favourite squash. They all have quite different flavour profiles, but at the moment the one I\u2019m most drawn to (probably because it\u2019s the one I\u2019ve seen most in the past week while harvesting) is the delicata.</p> <p>It originates from central America but it is becoming more widely available commercially in Australia. I spot it often at farmers\u2019 markets. It\u2019s a good choice if you aren\u2019t wanting to tackle a whole pumpkin because it isn\u2019t very large \u2013 perfect for a single meal. It is so beautiful with its pale-lemon-coloured skin, contrasted dramatically with ribbed grooves that are a deep emerald green. When they\u2019re ready to harvest they develop a light sunset blush, and the first leaf next to the fruit starts to die off.</p> <p>Whenever it is at its peak season locally I love cooking with it or eating it at restaurants. With its sweet, smooth flesh, nutty taste and thin skin it works in savoury and sweet dishes. It can behave like a summer or a winter squash.</p> <p>My friend Analiese Gregory, the wonderful chef from Franklin in Hobart, cuts them in half lengthwise then lightly steams and then roasts her delicatas, leaving the seeds in. If they have not become too woody the seeds are perfectly edible. I find the fibrous strands to be the most flavourful when eating whole squash roasted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d7bcd56200c634101f0bfa731f102bd0341540\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d7bcd56200c634101f0bfa731f102bd0341540/0_529_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delicata squash at Franklin restaurant in Hobart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delicata squash at Franklin restaurant in Hobart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franklin Restaurant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been having it for dessert recently, steamed Thai style and filled with a coconut and palm sugar custard.

The word askutasquash is from Narragansett, a Native American language from which the word squash derives. It translates to \u201ca green thing eaten raw or uncooked\u201d. What a beautiful word it is too. This genus of cucurbita includes many domesticated, cultivated species including C. moschata (crookneck pumpkin), C. pepo (field pumpkin) and C. ficiofolia (fig leaf gourd). So what is the difference between a squash and a pumpkin? A pumpkin is a variety of squash. The word is often used to describe a winter squash, thicker-skinned and starchier, harvested later in the season to store over the colder months. As the origin of the name suggests, we often think of squash as a summer vegetable eaten soft-skinned, young and tender. That\u2019s where the confusion between pumpkin and squash lies. The first known domestication of squash was in Mesoamerica, before maize and legumes, at least 8,000 years ago. An ancient and adaptive food, squash has spread globally. Every culture I can think of does delicious things with squash; you could say it\u2019s become instinct. I love growing them. On the farm we have more than 30 varieties, both summer and winter squashes, all heirlooms. I can relate to them totally. By nature they are nomadic, prolific, adaptive and lush. Then they completely cark it and give in, drying up, going back to the Earth \u2013 but not before leaving behind glorious fruit which we then harvest. Before the farm, I used to grow them in my backyard, cheering on the little seedlings as they pushed their way through the heavy mulching and well-composted soil. Then watching flabbergasted as they seemingly doubled in real estate overnight, covering my whole yard with an eye to bolt over to the neighbour\u2019s garden too. I can\u2019t choose my favourite squash. They all have quite different flavour profiles, but at the moment the one I\u2019m most drawn to (probably because it\u2019s the one I\u2019ve seen most in the past week while harvesting) is the delicata. It originates from central America but it is becoming more widely available commercially in Australia. I spot it often at farmers\u2019 markets. It\u2019s a good choice if you aren\u2019t wanting to tackle a whole pumpkin because it isn\u2019t very large \u2013 perfect for a single meal. It is so beautiful with its pale-lemon-coloured skin, contrasted dramatically with ribbed grooves that are a deep emerald green. When they\u2019re ready to harvest they develop a light sunset blush, and the first leaf next to the fruit starts to die off. Whenever it is at its peak season locally I love cooking with it or eating it at restaurants. With its sweet, smooth flesh, nutty taste and thin skin it works in savoury and sweet dishes. It can behave like a summer or a winter squash. My friend Analiese Gregory, the wonderful chef from Franklin in Hobart, cuts them in half lengthwise then lightly steams and then roasts her delicatas, leaving the seeds in. If they have not become too woody the seeds are perfectly edible. I find the fibrous strands to be the most flavourful when eating whole squash roasted. I\u2019ve been having it for dessert recently, steamed Thai style and filled with a coconut and palm sugar custard. It\u2019s not traditional, as this is not the typical variety used for this dish and yet it\u2019s entirely instinctual. Askutasquash, askutasquash, askutasquash. Delicata with coconut custard \u2013 Fak Thong Sangkaya (Dairy free and gluten free) Serves 2, with extra custard 1 organic delicata squash topped and tailed close to the edge of the fruit, just enough for it to be stable when standing in a steam basket without cutting through to the seed pith. Keep the top and tail as you will use this to pop on as a lid when serving. Cut again in centre equatorially and using a teaspoon scoop out the seeds and fibrous strands. For the custard 1 beaten organic duck egg or 1 organic hens egg + 1 extra yolk 1 cup of coconut cream 1.5 tbs coconut sugar slightly melted 1/4tsp sea salt 1 pandan leaf knotted 1 vanilla pod seeds scraped and pod popped back into your sugar container Beat all the ingredients together. Don\u2019t over-beat as this will lead to a custard that isn\u2019t lovely and silky. Place the squash into your steam basket. Pour custard into the cavity of the squash filling it all the way to the top. Pour the rest of the custard into a little bowl and pop inside the steamer along with the top and tail of the squash. Steam gently for 40 minutes, making sure to check that your steamer does not dry out. Serve warm or cold with the extra custard scooped out on the side. Who doesn\u2019t love a little bit of extra custard?",

When reporting on the prime minister\u2019s actions you can only really do as Katharine Murphy did and call it as you see it. And yet this week is the prime example of how reality is defined now by whatever is chosen by the conservative politicians and their friendly media outlets. The robodebt scheme was found by the federal court this week to be invalid. As a result the government, which had previously said the problems applied only to a \u201csmall cohort\u201d of debt recipients, were forced to dismantle it.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s Indigenous traditional owners will closely observe what promises to be the glacial progress of a quest by a north-east Arnhem Land clan for commonwealth compensation for the loss of culture and income from half a century of bauxite mining. The Gumatj clan of the Yolngu people have received statutory mining royalties since 1978 and are now recipients, via a future fund, of $700m in incremental payments stretching out to 2053. But the Gumatj elder Galarrwuy Yunupingu is now also seeking commonwealth compensation for the cultural impact of mining on his land and people by Nabalco and Rio Tinto. Complicated legal precedents will be examined. And non-Indigenous Australians, to understand what is at stake, will need to grapple with equally complex, challenging notions of Indigenous and spiritual connections to land, sea and sky \u2013 to explore the meanings of \u201ccountry\u201d in First Nations sensibility. Yunupingu enjoys a sometimes controversial reputation as a canny negotiator for his people. This week his lawyers launched a federal court case that will challenge interpretations of the constitution and the 1968 parliamentary act that granted Nabalco its mining rights on Gove Peninsula, part of north-east Arnhem Land and home to the Yolngu for at least 60,000 years. The constitution stipulates that land can be taken \u201con just terms\u201d \u2013 the heart of the challenge in question, because the Gumatj insist the terms have been anything but that, given the levels of cultural destruction wrought on them by mining and the financial loss they have endured through the appropriation of their mineral rights. The challenge over cultural loss is inspired by a high court precedent set earlier this year. The court granted a small number of Indigenous custodians some $2.5m for the extinguishment of their non-exclusive native title rights \u2013 due to dozens of acts by the Northern Territory government between 1980 and 1996 \u2013 over 1.26sq km of the town of Timber Creek. It included compensation for loss of culture. The Gumatj case will seek commonwealth compensation for the loss of native title over minerals exploited by Nabalco and its successor Rio Tinto, and for the destruction of key cultural sites. Nabalco began bauxite mining on Yolngu country in 1969 in defiance of the traditional owners, who used the Yirrkala bark petitions in 1963 to assert their long sovereignty over the land. But the mining leases were granted and excised without deference to the traditional owners or the petitions, which were effectively ignored. Today, however, in light of the high court\u2019s 1992 Mabo decision, which dispelled the notion of \u201cterra nullius\u201d \u2013 the basis on which the government granted mining leases on Indigenous land \u201con just terms\u201d \u2013 the petitions now hang with some reverence in Parliament House. Yolngu associated with the new legal action \u2013 which could take many years and will almost certainly end up in the high court \u2013 say Indigenous traditional owners across the continent will parse the case closely for implications about the destruction of their own traditional lands and loss of culture by mining and other industry. The outcome could potentially give rise to hundreds of similar claims for compensation in the billions of dollars. This week the Noongar people of Western Australia filed a compensation claim of more than $290bn in the federal court for \u201cspiritual damage\u201d caused by loss of their traditional land under the same Timber Creek precedent. A source associated with the Gumatj action said: \u201cThere are big questions at stake \u2013 how do you compensate for the loss and destruction of traditional culture and how does a whitefella court ultimately apportion a monetary cost to that?\u201d The federal government executive blithely rejected the Yirrkala bark petitions in the 1960s, blind to any understanding that so much of Yolngu culture and belief is reflected in the traditional, ongoing practice of bark art painting. The Yolngu have rich and long connections with people of other continents, including the Macassans of Suluwesi, with whom they traded fishing rights for beche de mere (sea cucumber) in exchange for iron tools, tobacco, gin and other goods.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s national environment law is under review, an exercise the government has said is aimed at cutting \u201cgreen tape\u201d. Scott Morrison and the environment minister, Sussan Ley, announced the review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act last month. It is a statutory review of the act that occurs every 10 years. To support their case for reform, Morrison and Ley have said approvals of major projects are taking an average of three and a half years. But do their claims stack up? What is the reason for the delays? And how does the time taken to approve developments compare with the time taken to develop plans to protect species and habitats under the act? How long are approvals taking under the EPBC Act? The important word in Morrison and Ley\u2019s statements is the word \u201cmajor\u201d. The figure of three and a half years is not based on an analysis of all projects assessed under national environment law. It\u2019s based on a portion of them. Less than half, in fact. Under the EPBC Act there are different assessment types, depending on the complexity of projects. The environment department told Guardian Australia it had reached the figure by examining four assessment types that \u201ctend to be\u201d those used for major projects \u2013 such as an extension to the Brockman 2 iron ore project in WA, or Kentbruck\u2019s green power hub in Victoria. The department wouldn\u2019t supply the documents containing its analysis, but said it examined 365 projects between July 2014 and June 2019. But the projects used in the analysis that gave the three-and-a-half year figure account for just 42% of all assessments under the act. The average time from referral to the department until approval for the remaining 58% of projects \u2013 for example residential developments or road upgrades \u2013 was 1.9 years. James Trezise, a policy analyst at the Australian Conservation Foundation, says: \u201cMajor projects make up the minority of assessments under the EPBC Act. Most approvals are completed through low complexity assessments that are completed far more quickly than the government acknowledges.\u201d Delays in EPBC decisions have increased Another point not made by Morrison or Ley is that delays in decisions under national environment law have increased since the Coalition came to power. The environment and energy department\u2019s annual report says there were 2,161 decisions made under the EPBC Act in 2018-19. Of those, 861 were late. The number of late decisions has risen every year since 2014-15, when fewer than 500 were late from a total of more than 2,500. In its annual report, the department says delays typically occur due to high workloads for department staff or because the department is waiting for more information from development proponents to conduct environmental assessments. The budget for the divisions of the department responsible for these assessments has fallen in the past five years from $63m in 2014-15 to $56.4m in 2018-19. Tim Beshara, the federal policy director of the Wilderness Society, says the department\u2019s own data shows an increasing proportion of decisions are not being made within statutory timeframes, but \u201cwhat the department don\u2019t publish is which projects are delayed by poorly prepared applications versus which are delayed due to an under-resourced department\u201d. \u201cAnd while we have some idea about how fast these approvals are made, we have no objective assessment of whether the decisions made are actually the right decisions. The primary question about approvals should be \u2018are good decisions being made?\u2019, not \u2018are quick decisions being made?\u2019. And we have no oversight of this question from the courts or from anywhere else.\u201d The EPBC Act isn\u2019t all about development approvals. How long are other processes taking? The primary purpose of the EPBC Act is environmental protection and the conservation of Australia\u2019s flora and fauna. If we compare the time taken for project approvals to some of the processes for Australian threatened species, developers are not faring so badly. Threatened species and ecological communities \u2013 groups of animals and plants that are protected as a single habitat \u2013 are listed under environment law when they are in danger of extinction and need protection. Species must first be nominated for a potential listing. They must then be selected for inclusion on the finalised priority assessment list (FPAL). The independent threatened species scientific committee then assesses whether a species qualifies for listing as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered and makes a recommendation to the environment minister. The environment department told Guardian Australia the average time from when a species makes it on to the FPAL to when it is listed under national environment laws is 1.3 years. For ecological communities they say it is 2.6 years. But this analysis excludes the period of seven months between nomination and selection for listing on the FPAL. The department also used a longer 12-year time frame \u2013 from 2007 to 2019 \u2013 to calculate these averages rather than the five-year time frame it applied to its analysis of major development approvals. This distinction matters, to make a fair comparison and also because in recent years the process of listing species and ecological communities has slowed. The environment department\u2019s database shows assessment timeframes of three years are being set for many species. Five ecological communities have been listed under the EPBC Act in 2019. Of those, two took five years and nine months to be listed, one took three years and 11 months, another two years and nine months. Only one, at one year and 11 months, came in under the 2.6 year average timeframe given by the department. Evan Quartermain is the head of programs for Humane Society International in Australia, which is the organisation behind 40% of the threatened habitats (ecological communities) listed nationally. He says the time taken to recognise their status has \u201cslowed unacceptably\u201d. \u201cThe last five habitats listed that we nominated took an average of four years and nine months to assess, but 10 years ago this timeframe was just one year and eight months,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from processing lots of threatened matters in a reasonable timeframe to just a few at a snail\u2019s pace, and the main reason is departmental capacity being slashed.\u201d What happens after a species is listed? The process doesn\u2019t end there for threatened species and ecological communities. Once they are listed, it\u2019s up to the minister to decide if a species requires a recovery plan, which is a document that outlines what needs to be done to prevent extinction. As reported previously by Guardian Australia, most threatened species and habitats are no longer given recovery plans. Instead, a weaker document known as a conservation advice is prepared, usually in the period when the species is being listed. The department\u2019s 2018-19 annual report shows that of 1,972 listed species and habitats, just 747 have recovery plans. A further 172 require recovery plans that have not been developed. The department says it does not track the average time taken for development of recovery plans, because most are \u201cprepared by state and territory governments\u201d and then adopted federally under the EPBC Act. But the annual report again gives some insight. It says that in 2018-19 just five recovery plans were adopted and \u201cnone were completed within statutory time frames\u201d \u2013 three years, followed by a three-year extension if necessary. In 2017-18, four recovery plans were adopted and again none were completed within the statutory time frames. Trezise says: \u201cSince the Coalition has taken office in 2013 it has taken an average of seven years to complete a national recovery plan, which is in breach of the statutory deadlines under national environmental law and partly explains the perilous state of Australia\u2019s biodiversity. \u201cThe Morrison government should probably focus on the fact that it has gutted the environment department to the point where the most recent recovery plan to be released took 10 years to complete.\u201d What about legal challenges to projects approved under the act? In an opinion piece this month, Ley said: \u201cIn the past four years, 1,401 days have been spent on court cases over applications, including before the federal court and even the high court\u201d. Again, the government has not made public the analysis it used to reach this figure. But the suggestion that legal challenges are a major burden on the system of environmental assessments is overblown. The department\u2019s annual report lists only six legal challenges against the 2,161 decisions in that year.",

Sudan\u2019s former president, Omar al-Bashir, overthrown in a military coup this year, has been indicted by the international criminal court for war crimes in Darfur. His regime was part of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.khartoumprocess.net\" title=\"\">Khartoum process</a>\u201d, an EU initiative to cut off the migrant route from the Horn of Africa. One of the most effective instruments in policing migrants is Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries. Until 2013 they were known as the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/sudan0404/4.htm\" title=\"\">Janjaweed</a>, a vicious militia that pursued almost genocidal violence in Darfur. Earlier this year, the RSF was responsible for massacres against anti-government protesters in Khartoum. It also plies its trade <a href=\"https://eritrea-focus.org/open-appeal-to-the-eus-donald-tusk-over-eritrea-and-sudan/\" title=\"\">on behalf of the EU</a>.</p> <p>Nor does the EU particularly worry about whom its \u201cpartners\u201d lock up, so long as they lock up potential migrants to Europe. In the Sahel, 80% of migration is not to Europe but is regional, involving people who for decades have moved around an area in which borders are naturally porous. Militias and security forces don\u2019t care to sift through different kinds of migrants, so all become targets for the new kidnap and detention industry. The result is the disruption of traditional trade routes, growing economic instability and rising discontent \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.saferworld.org.uk/resources/publications/1217-partners-in-crime-the-impacts-of-europeas-outsourced-migration-controls-on-peace-stability-and-rights#.XTbUZ3yWrb0.twitter\" title=\"\">feeding the desire</a> for migration.</p> <p>The EU turns a blind eye to the treatment of detainees, too. European governments are not just aware of the torture, sexual abuse and extortion to which detainees are subject but also, in the words of Amnesty International\u2019s John Dalhuisen, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/12/libya-european-governments-complicit-in-horrific-abuse-of-refugees-and-migrants/\" title=\"\">complicit in these abuses</a>\u201d.

The more hostile the climate for migrants in countries such as Libya or Niger, the more effective the policy of keeping migrants away from Europe.</p> <p>The consequences of EU migration policy should, as the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res puts it, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.msf.org/libya-open-letter-european-governments-are-feeding-business-suffering\" title=\"\">shock the collective conscience</a> of Europe\u2019s citizens and elected leaders\u201d. Yet it is barely discussed. For those hostile to immigration, it\u2019s a price worth paying. For liberals, it\u2019s a touchy issue, for they fear feeding hostility to the EU. For Brussels, the policy is a political success. For dictators and warlords, it\u2019s a means to riches and power.

His regime was part of the \u201cKhartoum process\u201d, an EU initiative to cut off the migrant route from the Horn of Africa. One of the most effective instruments in policing migrants is Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitaries. Until 2013 they were known as the Janjaweed, a vicious militia that pursued almost genocidal violence in Darfur. Earlier this year, the RSF was responsible for massacres against anti-government protesters in Khartoum. It also plies its trade on behalf of the EU. Nor does the EU particularly worry about whom its \u201cpartners\u201d lock up, so long as they lock up potential migrants to Europe. In the Sahel, 80% of migration is not to Europe but is regional, involving people who for decades have moved around an area in which borders are naturally porous. Militias and security forces don\u2019t care to sift through different kinds of migrants, so all become targets for the new kidnap and detention industry. The result is the disruption of traditional trade routes, growing economic instability and rising discontent \u2013 feeding the desire for migration. The EU turns a blind eye to the treatment of detainees, too. European governments are not just aware of the torture, sexual abuse and extortion to which detainees are subject but also, in the words of Amnesty International\u2019s John Dalhuisen, \u201ccomplicit in these abuses\u201d. The whole point of outsourcing is to pay others to do Europe\u2019s dirty work. The more hostile the climate for migrants in countries such as Libya or Niger, the more effective the policy of keeping migrants away from Europe. The consequences of EU migration policy should, as the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res puts it, \u201cshock the collective conscience of Europe\u2019s citizens and elected leaders\u201d. Yet it is barely discussed. For those hostile to immigration, it\u2019s a price worth paying. For liberals, it\u2019s a touchy issue, for they fear feeding hostility to the EU. For Brussels, the policy is a political success. For dictators and warlords, it\u2019s a means to riches and power. And so, the biggest scandal of our time has become an outrage that dare not speak its name. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

Since its beginnings, netball has always been the ultimate team sport. </p> <p>The restrictions to the footwork rules and the areas players are allowed to enter on court means that it is a difficult sport to dominate as an individual. However throughout Diamonds history, there have been those special players who have made an era their own. </p> <p>Vicki Wilson, Liz Ellis, Laura Geitz and new Hall of Fame inductee Sharelle McMahon have all been dominant individuals who could single-handedly turn a game.</p> <p>The current iteration of the Diamonds on the other hand, is where Sargeant\u2019s words ring most true. Although they lost the most recent Netball World Cup and Commonwealth Games by the slimmest of margins, they have retained their world number one status. They are by any definition a world class team. </p> <p>And yet individual stars are hard to come by. With coach Lisa Alexander doing away with the concept of a starting seven, there is more of a rotation of players moving on and off the court. In a sport where individual dominance is hard enough, doing it while taking the court in short bursts is incredibly tough.</p> <p>The Liz Ellis Diamond is usually netball\u2019s most hotly contested award. Taking into account international and Super Netball performances throughout the year, the award is bestowed on Australia\u2019s top player each year. However in 2019, many of the stand out individual players have hailed from other corners of the globe. </p> <p>Karla Pretorius (South Africa), Jhaniele Fowler and Shamera Sterling (Jamaica), Laura Langman (New Zealand) and Sam Wallace (Trinidad) have been the names on everyone\u2019s lips this season when individual performances and honours have been discussed.</p> <p>So the awarding of the Liz Ellis Diamond to Gretel Tippett had a different feeling to years gone past.

      "bodyText": "As netball royalty Anne Sargeant was elevated to legend status in Netball Australia\u2019s Hall of Fame on Saturday night, some poignant words stood out. \u201cI could throw and catch and shoot a few goals, but in the company of my teammates, that became something special,\u201d Sargeant said, overcome with emotion at being recognised, with her daughter making a surprise visit from the United States to meet her mother on stage. While the order of the evening is to recognise outstanding individuals, Sargeant made an important point about the nature of the sport. Since its beginnings, netball has always been the ultimate team sport. The restrictions to the footwork rules and the areas players are allowed to enter on court means that it is a difficult sport to dominate as an individual. However throughout Diamonds history, there have been those special players who have made an era their own. Vicki Wilson, Liz Ellis, Laura Geitz and new Hall of Fame inductee Sharelle McMahon have all been dominant individuals who could single-handedly turn a game. The current iteration of the Diamonds on the other hand, is where Sargeant\u2019s words ring most true. Although they lost the most recent Netball World Cup and Commonwealth Games by the slimmest of margins, they have retained their world number one status. They are by any definition a world class team. And yet individual stars are hard to come by. With coach Lisa Alexander doing away with the concept of a starting seven, there is more of a rotation of players moving on and off the court. In a sport where individual dominance is hard enough, doing it while taking the court in short bursts is incredibly tough. The Liz Ellis Diamond is usually netball\u2019s most hotly contested award. Taking into account international and Super Netball performances throughout the year, the award is bestowed on Australia\u2019s top player each year. However in 2019, many of the stand out individual players have hailed from other corners of the globe. Karla Pretorius (South Africa), Jhaniele Fowler and Shamera Sterling (Jamaica), Laura Langman (New Zealand) and Sam Wallace (Trinidad) have been the names on everyone\u2019s lips this season when individual performances and honours have been discussed. So the awarding of the Liz Ellis Diamond to Gretel Tippett had a different feeling to years gone past. This is not to say that Tippett has not had an incredible year. Although her Queensland Firebirds finished at the bottom of the ladder, Tippett was the shining light in an otherwise struggling outfit. In the national team, she cemented her place in the side after many years of falling in and out of selection. Her flair and unorthodox style has provided a point of difference and her accuracy has kept the Diamonds right in matches. However at times she has still struggled with her timing into the circle and forming a combination with Australian captain Caitlin Bassett, as both prefer to dominate the back space. In previous years, this flaw may have locked her out of the award, but in 2019 she was the obvious choice. With four of the 10 players named in the Super Netball team of the year from overseas (with Laura Langman a very unlucky omission) and four of the Australians not part of the Diamonds team for either some or all of the international campaigns, it highlighted that the Australian team is much more a champion team, than a team of champions. Tippett was typically humble and gracious in victory, as unassuming off the court as she is entertaining on it. She was full of gratitude for her teammates and coaches for believing in her and supporting her in her unorthodox style. The most obvious lift to her game in recent times has been the increase in her shooting percentage, a change she credits to a shift in mindset. \u201cI knew I had to pick up that part of my game and I worked quite hard at it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one thing I did was bring my enjoyment more into my game and that relaxed me. Before I was getting too uptight and trying to force it. I know I\u2019ve still got a lot of other things to work on, so I\u2019m going to continue to work hard to develop my game in the next few years.\u201d Tippett also took out the International Player of the Year award, with Super Netball Player of the Year going to Jamaican captain and West Coast Fever star Jhaniele Fowler. Giants wing defence Amy Parmenter was presented with the Rising Star award for her breakout season. Diamonds captain Caitlin Bassett was acknowledged for reaching her 100-game milestone this season and put current record holder Liz Ellis on notice telling her she was aiming to knock off that record next, suggesting the awards night may soon change its name to the Caitlin Bassett Diamond. However, whatever the night may be called and whichever individuals are honoured, the shared glory of the team will always remain at the centre of the sport and that is what the players will continue to celebrate.",

The minke whale was found on Friday evening at about 10pm by a Port of London Authority boat, but it is not yet known how it got there or why it died. The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) are set to undertake a postmortem examination to determine the cause of death.

Corbyn called the London Bridge attack \u201ca complete disaster\u201d, adding: \u201cI think there is also a question about what the Probation Office were doing \u2013 where they involved at all - and whether the Parole Board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released from prison in the first place, and also what happened in prison? \u201cThat somebody who clearly was a danger to society \u2026 was he given a deradicalisation programme or not? \u201cI think we have to ensure that the public are safe, that means supervision of prisoners in prison but it also means supervision of ex-prisoners when they are released ahead of the completion of their sentence, to have tough supervision of them to make sure this kind of danger is not played out on the public in future.\u201d In 2012, Khan was sentenced to indeterminate detention for \u201cpublic protection\u201d with a minimum jail term of eight years after being convicted for his role in a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange. The sentence would have allowed him to be kept in prison beyond the minimum term. However, the court of appeal quashed the sentence in 2013, replacing it with a 16-year-fixed term, of which Khan should serve half in prison. He was released on licence last year but was required to wear an electronic tag while he lived in Stafford. Khan\u2019s solicitor, Vajahat Sharif, said his client had asked for help to be deradicalised while in prison. Sharif said: \u201cHe requested intervention by a deradicaliser when he was in prison. \u201cThe only option was the probation service and they cannot deal with these offenders. \u201cHe asked me on the phone to get assistance from a specific deradicaliser. \u201cProbation do a good job with conventional offenders but they can\u2019t deal with ideological offenders.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, wrote on Twitter that the government needed \u201cto listen to police chiefs\u201d. \u201cWe need the proper resources to monitor convicted terrorists.\u201d Sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPPs) were introduced in 2005 and given to violent or sexual offenders who posed a risk to society. They would not include a fixed term of imprisonment but instead would give an offender a minimum period to serve before they could be released. A prisoner serving an indeterminate sentence would stay in prison until it was found they were safe to be released. IPPS were abolished in 2012 but not for existing prisoners. Khan and two others were originally given indeterminate sentences with a minimum term of eight years behind bars instead of a fixed term. Khan, along with Nazam Hussain and Mohammed Shahjahan, appealed against their sentences and had the indeterminate sentences dropped by the Court of Appeal in 2013. Mr Justice Leveson found the original decision had \u201cwrongly characterised\u201d the three men as more dangerous than the other defendants. The former chief prosecutor, Nazir Afzal, said the government was repeatedly warned of the risk posed by convicted terrorists being released from prison while still radicalised. Writing on Twitter, he said he had spoken to Johnson in 2016 at Brunel University, in Uxbridge, west London, where Johnson is an MP. Afzal said: \u201cHe asked me what keeps me awake at night and I told him it was this issue. \u201cWhen he wanted to know what to do about it, I told him it was more resources for one-to-one deradicalisation. \u201cBack then, he hadn\u2019t found the \u2018money tree\u2019 so he frustratingly said there was no money [...]. \u201cThe problem of those convicted for terrorist-related offences being released from prison whilst ostensibly rehabilitated but still radicalised was one that many of us raised in meetings with this government over the past few years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining me. I will now runaway and not look back. Anyway ... here is a hot take on the draw ... In your face ... It is quite unfair ... Giggs: \u201cVery proud, we were in the last Euros and didn\u2019t want it to be a flash in the pan. \u201cLogistically for us and the fans, it\u2019s much better. At this stage they are all tough games. Switzerland are a talented team. \u201cYou just hope when June comes around you have a healthy group of players to pick from. If we get that, we can beat anyone.\u201d Southgate on favourites tag: \u201cWe have to accept that expectations have changed. We have to improve, though. We would rather be a team that is favoured.\u201d If England win their group, they will play the team who finish second in Group F (the group of death). Southgate: \u201cIf you can win, you\u2019ve got to take control of your own destiny. People will also be worried about playing us.\u201d Southgate: \u201cI am never sure what a good draw is but we\u2019ve played two of the teams before. Playing at Wembley will be very special.\u201d Have Croatia peaked? \u201cI thought that maybe 12 months ago but they recovered very well in their group. I had a picture with Davor Suker before the draw, he wanted to play in London.\u201d Shearer: \u201cI think Gareth will be delighted with that draw. He will be confident England can get out of the group and do very well in the tournament.\u201d They are just showing every final ever. I am off to open wine if it carries on like this. Sean gets more PR emails than I do. The Beeb have cut to \u2018classic Euros moments\u2019 as there is no analysis left. Conor Blennerhassett says: \u201cThe police will be praying Scotland win their playoffs because they won\u2019t fancy a Croatia v Serbia in Hampden on June 23.\u201d This is a tournament of peace. There will be no violence. Already got a PR email saying England are favourites to win the tournament! FOOTBALL IS COMING HOME! Where is slap, bang in the middle of Rome and Baku? Istanbul? Two trips to Baku for Wales in four days. Elis James will have some explaining to do at home. Playoff Winner C are the dark horses for me! GROUP F has made this whole blog worthwhile. Portugal, France and Germany in one group really is great fun. Mark Hughes is another man who looks a lot better for not being a football manager. I like the guess work, it makes a tedious draw even more annoying. Does that make sense? Wales will be pleased with the draw, I guess. England will be laughing. Four of the six third place teams will also progress from the group. Group A (Rome, Baku): Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Wales Group B (St Petersburg, Copenhagen): Russia, Denmark, Belgium, Finland Group C (Amsterdam, Bucharest): Netherlands, Ukraine, Austria (Georgia, Kosovo, Belarus, North Macedonia) Group D (London, Glasgow): England, Croatia, Czech Republic (Scotland, Israel, Norway, Serbia) Group E (Bilbao, Dublin): Spain, Poland, Sweden (N Ireland, Bosnia, Slovakia or Ireland) Group F (Munich, Budapest): Germany, France, Portugal (Iceland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary) Playoff winner B in Group E. So that\u2019s N Ireland, Bosnia, Slovakia or Ireland Finland are in Group B with Denmark, Belgium and Russia. Scotland, Israel, Norway or Serbia will be in Group D with England. Playoff winner D are in Group C. Wales are in Group A with Turkey, Italy and Switzerland. Enjoy Baku, lads. Playoff winner A will be in Group F. That almost means nothing. It could be Iceland, Romania, Bulgaria or Hungary. But if Romania win it then they will be into Group C, anyway, and they\u2019ll have to change it all. Rather tedious having teams who faced each other in qualifying in the same groups. Why bother? Surely this concept could have been done more competently. The final pot consists of Finland and Wales, not to mention the teams we don\u2019t know about yet. Portugal, France and Germany in Group F. Spicy. Sweden go into Group E. They joined Spain, who they played in the qualifiers, and Poland. Italy v Turkey will be the opening game of the tournament next summer. Czech Republic will play England again, having been drawn in Group D. Southgate will be pleased. Austria find themselves in Group C alongside Netherlands and Ukraine. Turkey will be in Group A with Italy and Switzerland. Pot 3 follows Pot 2!! France versus Germany in Group F! That will be exciting. Poland are in Group E with Spain. Bilbao and Dublin are lovely. Croatia join England in Group D!! They will play each other in the opening group game on 14 June. Ruud Gullit is the man pulling out of the Pot 2 balls. He is doing it very well, I must say. He twists those balls open without any trouble - he must have opened plenty of Kinder surprises in his time. Switzerland are in Group A! They take position four and can enjoy a trip to Baku. England will play all their group games at Wembley, which is exciting news for those who do not like travelling. Pot 1 is done! This is a relief. Unsurprisingly, Pot 2 is next up. England are drawn into Group D (we already knew this) and put into the first position. Logistically exciting. Belgium go into Group B, the only group they could have been drawn in. This is a waste of time. Ted Lee has got me far more excited that this draw ever could: \u201cDoes anyone get tired of seeing draw-after-draw with ping-pong balls? Why not darts? Or have each country send a 4 x 100 relay team, or even a geography quiz? Or combine the draw with Eurovision?\u201d The first bit is basically working out logistics for host countries. This is mildly mind-numbing. Ukraine are first out and drawn into Group C, the only one they are permitted to be in. Netherlands are also in that group. \u2018Now we all know how the group works ...\u2019 it\u2019s all clear Pedro, you crack on. The draw procedure! This is exciting! Let\u2019s remember that four teams are still to qualify through the playoffs. Totti has turned up in full tux and looks fantastic. What a chap! Arshavin is here too! They are just bringing them all out at once. Learn to build the tension, please. Eleven special guests! I can\u2019t wait. Let\u2019s predict them! Casillas and Desailly are next up. We\u2019re on the stage! We can all expect plenty of needless chat. Joao Mario is up first to say that winning the tournament is good. Ricardo Carvalho follows this by also explaining that winning is nice. Mrs Live Blogger is from Bucharest, so I assume this is why I was brought in for this role. I also used to live in Bilbao, so I am full of insight on the various host cities. Jonathan Tasker says: \u201cThere are over sixty million people in this country. It is beyond belief that the best the BBC can come up with as a panel is Mark Hughes, presumably because he\u2019s Welsh, Micah Richards, still best known for swearing live on the telly and a journalist. Embarrassing.\u201d 1. Mark Hughes did manage Wales 2. Micah Richards did a bit more than swear in his career and is a very good pundit I bloody love Micah. Just remind me if this comes true ... Our man Ed Aarons is there ... Very much the tournament\u2019s slogan ... Bilbao and Dublin is the best collection of host cities, really. Mark Chapman is trying to explain the draw but does not seem convinced. Here is our explanation. The actual draw should start in about 20 minutes. It is supposed to take around an hour but will almost certainly take longer. Here we go! This is exciting, to some extent. I wrote this before Finland qualified but it still makes sense ... And here is a team-by-team guide ... Good evening! Is there anything better than a long, drawn-out couple of hours of balls being plucked from buckets? There will be a parade of former international turning up in their shiny suits for a small fee, some chitter chatter on stage and the pride of picking Ukraine out of a hat. Bucharest must be ruddy freezing at the moment, which will make it easier to spot the hot balls. We actually already know which group some of the teams will be in, as they are hosting some of the tournament which is spread across Europe, so hopefully that will cut down how long this whole process takes. I am mainly hoping there is a parade of the Romania \u201994 World Cup squad, and if there isn\u2019t I will be writing a lengthy lesson. There is a lot to take in, so here is a guide to the big show:",

      "body": "<h2>Group A</h2> <h2>Turkey</h2> <p>To be completely frank when Group H was first drawn I did not expect Turkey to qualify \u2013 \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f inherited a side in complete disarray. But they surprised just about everybody and even managed to take four points from the world champions France, booking a place in Euro 2020 with a game to spare. After years of defensive trauma it is strange to see Turkey so strong at the back. \u00c7a\u011flar S\u00f6y\u00fcnc\u00fc is the standout name but there is intense competition to be his centre-back partner with Juventus\u2019s Merih Demiral, Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s Kaan Ayhan, Ozan Kabak of Schalke and Roma\u2019s Mert \u00c7etin all competing for a spot. And they are all young, the oldest being the 25-year-old Ayhan. The midfield do not exactly play aesthetically pleasing football but they are industrious and protect the back four. There are not a lot of options up front with an ageing Burak Yilmaz and Cenk Tosun in the forward line. The main attacking and creative spark will be the Roma winger Cengiz \u00dcnder but there is a lot of young talent coming through and G\u00fcne\u015f is not afraid to give them a chance. </p> <p><strong>Emre Sarigul, <a href=\"https://turkish-football.com/\">Turkish-football.com</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Italy</strong></h2> <p>The Renaissance returns. Roberto Mancini took over as Italy\u2019s coach in May 2018, six months after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/13/italy-sweden-world-cup-qualifying-play-off-second-leg-match-report\">elimination against Sweden</a> in a cruel, ugly World Cup qualifying play-off. Mancini chose to rebuild the team on new pillars: attacking football, technical players, youth. Against all odds, everything worked immediately. Italy won all their matches in Group J, scoring 3.7 goals per game and conceding only four. Italy now play with a 4-3-3 formation based on pressing, possession and speed. The team may lack structure (Marco Verratti, Lorenzo Insigne, Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Jorginho are not heavyweight champions) but seem ready to impress Europe with a new generation of talents such as Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo \u2013 who was called up before he had even made his Serie A debut \u2013 Gianluigi Donnarumma, Stefano Sensi, Sandro Tonali and Federico Chiesa. \u201cWe\u2019re not far off the best European teams,\u201d said Mancini. He could be right.</p> <p><strong>Luca Bianchin, <a href=\"https://www.gazzetta.it/\">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a></strong></p> <h2>Wales</h2> <p>After an arduous 57-year wait to reach a major tournament, Wales will attend their second in four years next summer. Until reaching Euro 2016, Wales were defined by their failures but there is something refreshingly fearless about this new generation, even if they did make hard work of qualifying. A slow start under Ryan Giggs provided them with an uphill challenge but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/wales-hungary-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">after beating Hungary</a> in a winner-takes-all match in Cardiff, they finished this year unbeaten in six matches. Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey continue to provide the pizzazz for a nation that flourished at Euro 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/01/wales-belgium-euro-2016-match-report\">reaching the semi-finals</a> and, with seemingly more depth than ever, Wales will fancy their chances of going deep into the competition.</p> <p><strong>Ben Fisher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">The Guardian</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e51841639cd90c27f9581681f108689f5fdca12f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e51841639cd90c27f9581681f108689f5fdca12f/0_106_3092_2056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale will lead the Wales charge at Euro 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale will lead the Wales charge at Euro 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Switzerland</strong></h2> <p>Switzerland didn\u2019t play well in qualification for Euro 2020, but ended up topping their group thanks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/18/republic-of-ireland-denmark-euro-2020-qualifying-match\">Denmark\u2019s failure to beat the Republic of Ireland</a>. A big problem was Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s absence \u2013 the Liverpool man didn\u2019t play a single minute of qualification because of injury. So the Swiss team were short of creativity but still had enough quality to qualify. Another problem is Granit Xhaka\u2019s situation at Arsenal. So Switzerland have to solve the problems surrounding Xhaka and Shaqiri before the Euros start. There is also uncertainty over the future of the national coach, Vladimir Petkovic, whose contract ends after the tournament. But the team are talented and the key players such as Xhaka, Shaqiri, Yann Sommer, Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, Fabian Sch\u00e4r or Haris Seferovic have played together for a long time. So after three consecutive eliminations in the round of 16 in major tournaments the goal is the quarter-finals this time.</p> <p><strong>Andreas B\u00f6ni, <a href=\"https://www.blick.ch/\">Blick</a></strong></p> <h2>Group B</h2> <h2><strong>Denmark</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s been an odd qualification campaign for Denmark. The team scored goals like never before and didn\u2019t lose any of eight group outings but still only just managed to secure their place at Euro 2020. That said Denmark fully deserved their ninth appearance at the European Championship finals, which they won so memorably in 1992. This national team have gone 34 matches without defeat since October 2016 \u2013 not enough to always satisfy fans and media who have demanded more adventurousness and entertainment, much to the annoyance of \u00c5ge Hareide, the Norwegian manager. He is very proud of a team that seldom make mistakes and have a world-class keeper in Kasper Schmeichel. As a negative counterweight Christian Eriksen is surrounded by much uncertainty. He needs to become a regular at Spurs or find a new club in January \u2013 without him at his best Denmark stand almost no chance of progressing from their group.</p> <p><strong>Thomas M\u00f8ller Kristensen, <a href=\"https://jyllands-posten.dk/sport/\">Jyllands-Posten</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a96174bd8374bc9e9b7bd93506da84d13802b1e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a96174bd8374bc9e9b7bd93506da84d13802b1e9/0_238_4562_2739/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Kasper Schmeichel Denmark have a word class goalkeeper\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Kasper Schmeichel Denmark have a word class goalkeeper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Finland</h2> <p>Finland did not win a single game in 2016 under Hans Backe, the former assistant coach to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson at Manchester City. This prompted the Finnish FA to give the job to Markku Kanerva, who had held a caretaker-manager role twice previously. Not much was expected from Kanerva, a former school teacher and once a national team centre-back with almost no coaching experience at club level. But Finland started to win games. First they won their Nations League group and then qualified for the first time in their history <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/15/finland-liechtenstein-teemu-pukki-norway-faroe-islands-euro-2020\">for the European Championships</a>. The core of the team is the same as that which qualified for the Under-21 Euros in 2009, under Kanerva, but it took them almost a decade to blossom at senior level. Although these are not the best individual players Finland have ever had, this is definitely the best team, one with a special bond and team identity on and off the field. Only four of Finland\u2019s players (Teemu Pukki, at Norwich, Lukas Hradecky with Leverkusen, Fredrik Jensen at Augsburg and Jesse Joronen of Brescia) earn their salary in one of the top five European leagues.</p> <p><strong>Saku-Pekka Sundelin, <a href=\"https://www.is.fi/\">Ilta-Sanomat</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a816d1f3cb8655078c847190b26ea9365e16ef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a816d1f3cb8655078c847190b26ea9365e16ef7/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Finland fans salute the team in Athens after their final qualifying game\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finland fans salute the team in Athens after their final qualifying game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panagiotis Moschandreou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Belgium</h2> <p>A truly easy ride. Belgium wrote history in a flawless qualification campaign with 30 points out of 30, 40 goals scored and only three conceded. When Roberto Mart\u00ednez walked to school with his five-year-old daughter Lula the day after Belgium had thrashed Cyprus 6-1, she asked: \u201cHow many goals did you make last night?\u201d When he answered \u201csix\u201d, she said \u201coh\u201d, as if she thought it wasn\u2019t good enough. Belgium and their fans have been spoilt over the past few years \u2013 the heavy defeat in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/18/nations-league-roundup-swizterland-stun-belgium-comeback\">Nations League against Switzerland</a> serving as the only wake-up call. With three of the best players in the prime of their career \u2013 Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku \u2013 and an ageing defence this feels like the last chance for the Golden Generation to claim a trophy. When you talk to the players the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/10/france-belgium-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\">lost semi-final against France</a> at the World Cup in Russia always gets a mention. They want to put things straight. </p> <p><strong>Kristof Terreur, <a href=\"https://www.hln.be/sport\">HLN</a></strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Russia\u2019s team has almost completely changed in the 18 months since they opened their World Cup campaign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/14/russia-saudi-arabia-world-cup-2018-match-report\">against Saudi Arabia</a>. Three players from that starting XI retired from international duty (Igor Akinfeev, Sergei Ignashevich and Aleksandr Samedov), two have been out this year because of injuries (Alan Dzagoev and Yuri Gazinskiy) and two more lost their places in the squad (Fyodor Smolov and Ilya Kutepov). M\u00e1rio Fernandes, Aleksandr Golovin, Roman Zobnin and the ageless Yuri Zhirkov are the only players who have survived. The key character in this team is certainly Zenit\u2019s striker Artem Dzyuba. Fans love the captain for both his human qualities and footballing ones. Dzyuba is the most prolific striker in the team (scoring nine goals in 10 qualifiers). Golovin is another star man, who made a breakthrough at the World Cup. The goalkeeping spot is Russia\u2019s weak link. The team are struggling without the retiredAkinfeev: Andrey Lunyov (Zenit) and Guilherme (Lokomotiv Moscow) have not impressed.</p> <p><strong>Gosha Chernov, <a href=\"https://www.sport-express.ru/\">Sport-Express</a></strong></p> <h2>Group C</h2> <h2><strong>Netherlands</strong></h2> <p>There have been two years of progress under Ronald Koeman. We have seen young players such as Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt burst onto the world scene, the coming of age of Memphis Depay and Daley Blind as well as Georginio Wijnaldum and Virgil van Dijk winning the Champions League with Liverpool. This team reached the final of the Nations League before losing against Portugal. In Euro 2020 qualifying they had to deal with Germany along with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/16/northern-ireland-netherlands-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">resilient Northern Ireland</a>. They reached the finals after a \u201cGerman-style\u201d win, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/06/euro-2020-qualifiers-roundup-germany-netherlands\">coming from 2-0 behind to win 4-2 in Hamburg</a> against their arch rivals. There are some weak areas but talented players keep popping up. In addition to those mentioned above we may well see the best of Donny van de Beek, Donyell Malen, Calvin Stengs, and others next summer.</p> <p><strong>Bart Vlietstra, <a href=\"https://www.volkskrant.nl/sport\">de Volkskrant</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11a0c895bde743482dbe04b6fd0ee1736e6eeadb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a0c895bde743482dbe04b6fd0ee1736e6eeadb/0_56_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frenkie De Jong leads the Netherlands\u2019 new generation of stars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frenkie De Jong leads the Netherlands\u2019 new generation of stars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ukraine</strong></h2> <p>It was the country\u2019s best ever qualifying campaign \u2013 eight games, six wins, two draws. This was firstly down to the goalkeeper\u2019s Andriy Pyatov ability but the defensive line is quite strong with young players such as Mykola Matvienko, Vitaliy Mykolenko and Eduard Sobol and the experienced Serhiy Kryvtsov and Oleksandr Karavaev. Shevchenko has a very competitive midfield with Taras Stepanenko in a defensive role and Marlos, Ruslan Malinovskiy, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Viktor Tsyhankov and Andriy Yarmolenko in attack. The main strength of these players is footballing intelligence and creativity. Malinovskiy is perfect at free-kicks and corners, while Zinchenko acts as a nuclear engine for the team. The best forward, Roman Yaremchuk, can conjure a goal even during poor performances. The power of the squad is in mutual understanding and hard work.</p> <p><strong>Olha Zorina, <a href=\"https://footballhub.com.ua/\">FootballHub</a></strong></p> <h2>Austria</h2> <p>What was meant to be a walk in the park in qualifying turned into a rollercoaster ride. When the draw for Group G was announced, Austria had every reason to be happy. Besides the top seeds Poland, Franco Foda\u2019s side were the other clear favourites to get throughahead of Slovenia, Latvia, North Macedonia and Israel. But defeat in the first fixture, against Poland at home, was followed by a disastrous 2-4 defeat in Israel and pressure began to mount. But Marco Arnautovic and co started delivering some better performances, and crucial wins against Slovenia and North Macedonia followed. The pressure slowly started to ease when the team showed what they are capable of. Nevertheless Foda was criticised for stubbornly sticking to his system and not getting everything out of a squad which is undoubtedly capable of very good football. </p> <p><strong>Andreas Hagenauer, <a href=\"https://www.derstandard.at/sport\">Der Standard</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Also: Play-off Winner D (A)</strong></p> <h2>Group D</h2> <h2>England</h2> <p>After the carefree run to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup expectations will be higher next summer. It will feel like a home tournament at times for England, who will play all their group matches at Wembley, and they will start as one of the favourites after dominating a weak qualification group. The possibilities feel endless for Gareth Southgate\u2019s young, exciting side and plenty of England\u2019s rivals will be casting envious glances at their attacking riches. Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford form one of the best forward lines in the world, with competition provided by Tammy Abraham, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Jadon Sancho, and there are goals from midfield as well. Yet Southgate will be wary of the hype. The manager is yet to settle on his starting XI and issues in defence and midfield have been exposed during defeats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/11/czech-republic-england-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">by the Czech Republic</a> in qualification and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/06/netherlands-england-nations-league-semi-final-match-report\">Netherlands in the Nations League</a>.

Internazionale\u2019s Marcelo Brozovic has grown into a fine defensive midfielder of the type this side lacked for years. The squad has been infused with fresh blood: Everton \u201cflop\u201d Nikola Vlasic, now at CSKA Moscow, was a hero of the qualifiers, while Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s Bruno Petkovic surpassed expectations to fill Mario Mandzukic\u2019s shoes, already scoring five times in eight appearances since his debut in March. On the minus side, Ivan Rakitic missed half of the qualifying campaign as he contemplated his fading status at Barcelona; the manager, Zlatko Dalic, has been very patient over his withdrawals, but Rakitic may have lost his starting place to Vlasic. Croatia hit a few bumps on the road to the Euros, but will again be a force to be reckoned with come the tournament.</p> <p><strong>Aleksandar Holiga, <a href=\"https://telesport.telegram.hr/\">Telesport</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f5b32ab93172523662642b16e1ee4a7549698ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f5b32ab93172523662642b16e1ee4a7549698ea/0_0_3500_2371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Croatia squad celebrates qualification\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Croatia squad celebrates qualification.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Broni\u0107/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Czech Republic</h2> <p>Qualifying for their seventh European Championship in row is a remarkable achievement for the Czech Republic, especially given as only a few Czechs currently play for major European clubs. The key point in the most recent qualifying campaign was the change of manager in September 2018, when the unpopular Karel Jarolim was replaced by Jaroslav Silhavy, who improved the mood in the squad and identified a core for the team quite quickly \u2013 based around Tomas Vaclik, Ondrej Celustka and Vladimir Darida. Team spirit and good organisation will be probably their biggest strengths. But will be it be enough? The Czech Republic really need Patrik Schick to be in good shape at the tournament. Reaching the last 16 is a basic target.</p> <p><strong>Karel H\u00e4ring, Football Club football magazine</strong></p> <p><strong>Also: Play-off Winner C</strong></p> <h2>Group E</h2> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>At his presentation upon returning as Spain manager, Luis Enrique was asked if they could win the Euros. The question was laced with pessimism, an awareness that the generation that won it all has almost all gone and that this is a team that have now gone three tournaments in a row without winning a knockout game, but Luis Enrique didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. Spain\u2019s qualification had shown that, he said: the <em>selecci\u00f3n</em> were unbeaten. It was a qualification finally clinched by his assistant Robert Moreno, who took over when Luis Enrique was forced to step aside because his nine-year-old daughter was seriously ill and subsequently died. His return hasn\u2019t been smooth \u2013 Moreno has gone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/27/luis-enrique-sacked-robert-moreno-spain-disloyal-no2-euro-2020\">accused of disloyalty by Luis Enrique</a> \u2013 but he is back now. And while he admits that Spain don\u2019t have an XI (\u201cI would love us to\u201d), and much as this generation certainly isn\u2019t <em>that</em> one, they do have players \u2013 and good ones.</p> <p><strong>Sid Lowe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">The Guardian</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c31965ff73e055fe98f578c13875d73a3bb4a5a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c31965ff73e055fe98f578c13875d73a3bb4a5a7/0_138_2144_1286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barcelona youngster Ansu Fati could be one to watch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barcelona youngster Ansu Fati could be one to watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sweden</h2> <p>By Swedish standards reaching the 2018 World Cup quarter-finals was a success, and Sweden\u2019s best campaign since coming third in 1994. The coach, Janne Andersson, has continued to build on that success with most of the team intact. After the World Cup Sweden won their Uefa Nations League group ahead of Turkey and Russia, and in the qualifiers they lost only once, away to Spain (3-0), and finished second in their group. The Mainz forward Robin Quaison has shouldered some of the goalscoring responsibility and was Sweden\u2019s top scorer in qualifying with five goals. Sweden\u2019s game is built upon a well-organised collective. Apart perhaps from Victor Lindel\u00f6f (Manchester United) and Emil Forsberg (RB Leipzig) Sweden do not really have any superstars, although Dejan Kulusevski (Parma) and Alexander Isak (Real Sociedad) are highly regarded for the future. </p> <p><strong>Ludwig Billengren and Sven Bertil Liljegren, <a href=\"https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/\">fotbollskanalen.se</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83dd991cb9596fdb946242b28d009a9c75e16e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83dd991cb9596fdb946242b28d009a9c75e16e10/420_115_2926_1756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweden\u2019s Mattias Svanberg celebrates his goal against the Faroe Islands with Dejan Kulusevski and Kristoffer Olsson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweden\u2019s Mattias Svanberg celebrates his goal against the Faroe Islands with Dejan Kulusevski and Kristoffer Olsson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tt News Agency/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Poland</strong></h2> <p>Jerzy Brzeczek replaced Adam Nawalka after their failure at the World Cup and there were plenty of question marks over whether he was a suitable man for the job. Their Nations League campaign and friendlies prior to the Euro 2020 qualifiers only added to those doubts but fans need not have worried. Brzeczek has done exactly what the Polish FA chairman, Zbigniew Boniek, wanted him to do \u2013 win the group but also rebuild and refresh the squad with some new faces. The 20-year-old Sebastian Szymanski can be a first-choice winger for years. Krystian Bielik proved that his fine performances during the European Under-21 Championship were not a fluke. And there was also Krzysztof Piatek, a revelation in the 2018-19 season in Serie A. But Lewandowski has to be at the top of his form. His contribution in his three big tournaments? Only two goals.</p> <p><strong>Tomasz W\u0142odarczyk, <a href=\"https://www.przegladsportowy.pl/\">Przegl\u0105d Sportowy</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Also: Play-off Winner B</strong></p> <h2>Group F</h2> <h2>Portugal</h2> <p>Portugal will be at Euro 2020 defending the title won in France in 2016. Qualification was guaranteed only in the last game, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/17/euro-2020-qualifying-portugal-cristiano-ronaldo\">modest victory in Luxembourg</a>, but the <em>Sele\u00e7\u00e3o</em> still had the play-offs as plan B, thanks to their victory in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/09/portugal-netherlands-nations-league-final-match-report\">the first Nations League</a> in the summer. The performances were not always convincing, butwith Fernando Santos in charge, Portugal have achieved good results and won two trophies. Cristiano Ronaldo is set to be the first player in history to play in five European Championship finals, and now with Bernardo Silva taking on a more relevant role (and players such as Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, Bruno Fernandes and R\u00faben Neves), Portugal can dream big again.</p> <p><strong>Nuno Travassos, <a href=\"https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/\">Maisfutebol</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>France</strong></h2> <p>Simply because they had a bad day at the office in June in Turkey where they suffered their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/08/euro-2020-roundup-turkey-shock-france-northern-ireland-comeback-win\">only defeat of the year (0-2)</a>, the 2018 world champions and 2016 Euro finalists did not make the top seeding pot. No big deal, though. France have reached their eighth Euro finals in a row rather comfortably and qualified untroubled by a raft of major injuries. Consequently Didier Deschamps had to use 29 players, among them a few newcomers such as Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet, L\u00e9o Dubois, Ferland Mendy, Tanguy Ndombel\u00e9 and Jonathan Ikon\u00e9, but his strongest possible lineup looks very similar to the one that won the World Cup, with only Lenglet having edged out Samuel Umtiti in central defence. The team rely heavily on set pieces , tournament experience and defensive nous. And at 28 Antoine Griezmann remains their undisputed technical leader and main inspiration. Anything but a place in the last four next summer would be considered a failure.</p> <p><strong>Patrick Urbini, <a href=\"https://www.francefootball.fr/\">France Football</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Germany</strong></h2> <p>After the team crashed out of the 2018 World Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/27/south-korea-germany-world-cup-group-f-match-report\">at the group stage</a>, an overhaul was inevitable. Former key players such as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, Mats Hummels and Thomas M\u00fcller were told that they were surplus to requirements, while Mesut \u00d6zil retired in the wake of the debate triggered by his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/mesut-ozil-ilkay-gundogan-recep-tayyip-erdogan-picture\">photo with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Erdo\u011fan</a>. The remaining stalwarts are the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and playmaker Toni Kroos. Add to that Marco Reus or Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, who have plenty of experience but have not yet been able to win any trophies with the national team due to injuries. The bulk of the side, however, is made up of players born between 1994 and 1997, foremost among them the Bayern striker Serge Gnabry, whose record on the international stage is astonishing: 13 goals in as many games. Joachim L\u00f6w thinks his team are too young to be one of the tournament favourites. Then again, life as a dark horse can be quite enjoyable.</p> <p><strong>Jens Kirschneck, <a href=\"https://www.11freunde.de/\">11 Freunde</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Also: Play-off Winner A (D)</strong></p>",

But they surprised just about everybody and even managed to take four points from the world champions France, booking a place in Euro 2020 with a game to spare. After years of defensive trauma it is strange to see Turkey so strong at the back. \u00c7a\u011flar S\u00f6y\u00fcnc\u00fc is the standout name but there is intense competition to be his centre-back partner with Juventus\u2019s Merih Demiral, Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s Kaan Ayhan, Ozan Kabak of Schalke and Roma\u2019s Mert \u00c7etin all competing for a spot. And they are all young, the oldest being the 25-year-old Ayhan. The midfield do not exactly play aesthetically pleasing football but they are industrious and protect the back four. There are not a lot of options up front with an ageing Burak Yilmaz and Cenk Tosun in the forward line. The main attacking and creative spark will be the Roma winger Cengiz \u00dcnder but there is a lot of young talent coming through and G\u00fcne\u015f is not afraid to give them a chance. Emre Sarigul, Turkish-football.com Italy The Renaissance returns. Roberto Mancini took over as Italy\u2019s coach in May 2018, six months after the elimination against Sweden in a cruel, ugly World Cup qualifying play-off. Mancini chose to rebuild the team on new pillars: attacking football, technical players, youth. Against all odds, everything worked immediately. Italy won all their matches in Group J, scoring 3.7 goals per game and conceding only four. Italy now play with a 4-3-3 formation based on pressing, possession and speed. The team may lack structure (Marco Verratti, Lorenzo Insigne, Nicol\u00f2 Barella and Jorginho are not heavyweight champions) but seem ready to impress Europe with a new generation of talents such as Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo \u2013 who was called up before he had even made his Serie A debut \u2013 Gianluigi Donnarumma, Stefano Sensi, Sandro Tonali and Federico Chiesa. \u201cWe\u2019re not far off the best European teams,\u201d said Mancini. He could be right. Luca Bianchin, La Gazzetta dello Sport Wales After an arduous 57-year wait to reach a major tournament, Wales will attend their second in four years next summer. Until reaching Euro 2016, Wales were defined by their failures but there is something refreshingly fearless about this new generation, even if they did make hard work of qualifying. A slow start under Ryan Giggs provided them with an uphill challenge but, after beating Hungary in a winner-takes-all match in Cardiff, they finished this year unbeaten in six matches. Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey continue to provide the pizzazz for a nation that flourished at Euro 2016, reaching the semi-finals and, with seemingly more depth than ever, Wales will fancy their chances of going deep into the competition. Ben Fisher, The Guardian Switzerland Switzerland didn\u2019t play well in qualification for Euro 2020, but ended up topping their group thanks to Denmark\u2019s failure to beat the Republic of Ireland. A big problem was Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s absence \u2013 the Liverpool man didn\u2019t play a single minute of qualification because of injury. So the Swiss team were short of creativity but still had enough quality to qualify. Another problem is Granit Xhaka\u2019s situation at Arsenal. So Switzerland have to solve the problems surrounding Xhaka and Shaqiri before the Euros start. There is also uncertainty over the future of the national coach, Vladimir Petkovic, whose contract ends after the tournament. But the team are talented and the key players such as Xhaka, Shaqiri, Yann Sommer, Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, Fabian Sch\u00e4r or Haris Seferovic have played together for a long time. So after three consecutive eliminations in the round of 16 in major tournaments the goal is the quarter-finals this time. Andreas B\u00f6ni, Blick Group B Denmark It\u2019s been an odd qualification campaign for Denmark. The team scored goals like never before and didn\u2019t lose any of eight group outings but still only just managed to secure their place at Euro 2020. That said Denmark fully deserved their ninth appearance at the European Championship finals, which they won so memorably in 1992. This national team have gone 34 matches without defeat since October 2016 \u2013 not enough to always satisfy fans and media who have demanded more adventurousness and entertainment, much to the annoyance of \u00c5ge Hareide, the Norwegian manager. He is very proud of a team that seldom make mistakes and have a world-class keeper in Kasper Schmeichel. As a negative counterweight Christian Eriksen is surrounded by much uncertainty. He needs to become a regular at Spurs or find a new club in January \u2013 without him at his best Denmark stand almost no chance of progressing from their group. Thomas M\u00f8ller Kristensen, Jyllands-Posten Finland Finland did not win a single game in 2016 under Hans Backe, the former assistant coach to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson at Manchester City. This prompted the Finnish FA to give the job to Markku Kanerva, who had held a caretaker-manager role twice previously. Not much was expected from Kanerva, a former school teacher and once a national team centre-back with almost no coaching experience at club level. But Finland started to win games. First they won their Nations League group and then qualified for the first time in their history for the European Championships. The core of the team is the same as that which qualified for the Under-21 Euros in 2009, under Kanerva, but it took them almost a decade to blossom at senior level. Although these are not the best individual players Finland have ever had, this is definitely the best team, one with a special bond and team identity on and off the field. Only four of Finland\u2019s players (Teemu Pukki, at Norwich, Lukas Hradecky with Leverkusen, Fredrik Jensen at Augsburg and Jesse Joronen of Brescia) earn their salary in one of the top five European leagues. Saku-Pekka Sundelin, Ilta-Sanomat Belgium A truly easy ride. Belgium wrote history in a flawless qualification campaign with 30 points out of 30, 40 goals scored and only three conceded. When Roberto Mart\u00ednez walked to school with his five-year-old daughter Lula the day after Belgium had thrashed Cyprus 6-1, she asked: \u201cHow many goals did you make last night?\u201d When he answered \u201csix\u201d, she said \u201coh\u201d, as if she thought it wasn\u2019t good enough. Belgium and their fans have been spoilt over the past few years \u2013 the heavy defeat in the Nations League against Switzerland serving as the only wake-up call. With three of the best players in the prime of their career \u2013 Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku \u2013 and an ageing defence this feels like the last chance for the Golden Generation to claim a trophy. When you talk to the players the lost semi-final against France at the World Cup in Russia always gets a mention. They want to put things straight. Kristof Terreur, HLN Russia Russia\u2019s team has almost completely changed in the 18 months since they opened their World Cup campaign against Saudi Arabia. Three players from that starting XI retired from international duty (Igor Akinfeev, Sergei Ignashevich and Aleksandr Samedov), two have been out this year because of injuries (Alan Dzagoev and Yuri Gazinskiy) and two more lost their places in the squad (Fyodor Smolov and Ilya Kutepov). M\u00e1rio Fernandes, Aleksandr Golovin, Roman Zobnin and the ageless Yuri Zhirkov are the only players who have survived. The key character in this team is certainly Zenit\u2019s striker Artem Dzyuba. Fans love the captain for both his human qualities and footballing ones. Dzyuba is the most prolific striker in the team (scoring nine goals in 10 qualifiers). Golovin is another star man, who made a breakthrough at the World Cup. The goalkeeping spot is Russia\u2019s weak link. The team are struggling without the retiredAkinfeev: Andrey Lunyov (Zenit) and Guilherme (Lokomotiv Moscow) have not impressed. Gosha Chernov, Sport-Express Group C Netherlands There have been two years of progress under Ronald Koeman. We have seen young players such as Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt burst onto the world scene, the coming of age of Memphis Depay and Daley Blind as well as Georginio Wijnaldum and Virgil van Dijk winning the Champions League with Liverpool. This team reached the final of the Nations League before losing against Portugal. In Euro 2020 qualifying they had to deal with Germany along with a resilient Northern Ireland. They reached the finals after a \u201cGerman-style\u201d win, coming from 2-0 behind to win 4-2 in Hamburg against their arch rivals. There are some weak areas but talented players keep popping up. In addition to those mentioned above we may well see the best of Donny van de Beek, Donyell Malen, Calvin Stengs, and others next summer. Bart Vlietstra, de Volkskrant Ukraine It was the country\u2019s best ever qualifying campaign \u2013 eight games, six wins, two draws. This was firstly down to the goalkeeper\u2019s Andriy Pyatov ability but the defensive line is quite strong with young players such as Mykola Matvienko, Vitaliy Mykolenko and Eduard Sobol and the experienced Serhiy Kryvtsov and Oleksandr Karavaev. Shevchenko has a very competitive midfield with Taras Stepanenko in a defensive role and Marlos, Ruslan Malinovskiy, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Viktor Tsyhankov and Andriy Yarmolenko in attack. The main strength of these players is footballing intelligence and creativity. Malinovskiy is perfect at free-kicks and corners, while Zinchenko acts as a nuclear engine for the team. The best forward, Roman Yaremchuk, can conjure a goal even during poor performances. The power of the squad is in mutual understanding and hard work. Olha Zorina, FootballHub Austria What was meant to be a walk in the park in qualifying turned into a rollercoaster ride. When the draw for Group G was announced, Austria had every reason to be happy. Besides the top seeds Poland, Franco Foda\u2019s side were the other clear favourites to get throughahead of Slovenia, Latvia, North Macedonia and Israel. But defeat in the first fixture, against Poland at home, was followed by a disastrous 2-4 defeat in Israel and pressure began to mount. But Marco Arnautovic and co started delivering some better performances, and crucial wins against Slovenia and North Macedonia followed. The pressure slowly started to ease when the team showed what they are capable of. Nevertheless Foda was criticised for stubbornly sticking to his system and not getting everything out of a squad which is undoubtedly capable of very good football. Andreas Hagenauer, Der Standard Also: Play-off Winner D (A) Group D England After the carefree run to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup expectations will be higher next summer. It will feel like a home tournament at times for England, who will play all their group matches at Wembley, and they will start as one of the favourites after dominating a weak qualification group. The possibilities feel endless for Gareth Southgate\u2019s young, exciting side and plenty of England\u2019s rivals will be casting envious glances at their attacking riches. Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford form one of the best forward lines in the world, with competition provided by Tammy Abraham, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Jadon Sancho, and there are goals from midfield as well. Yet Southgate will be wary of the hype. The manager is yet to settle on his starting XI and issues in defence and midfield have been exposed during defeats by the Czech Republic in qualification and the Netherlands in the Nations League. As ever England have much to prove against the very best. Jacob Steinberg, The Guardian Croatia The captain Luka Modric still reigns supreme in midfield and with far more consistency than on club level. Internazionale\u2019s Marcelo Brozovic has grown into a fine defensive midfielder of the type this side lacked for years. The squad has been infused with fresh blood: Everton \u201cflop\u201d Nikola Vlasic, now at CSKA Moscow, was a hero of the qualifiers, while Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s Bruno Petkovic surpassed expectations to fill Mario Mandzukic\u2019s shoes, already scoring five times in eight appearances since his debut in March. On the minus side, Ivan Rakitic missed half of the qualifying campaign as he contemplated his fading status at Barcelona; the manager, Zlatko Dalic, has been very patient over his withdrawals, but Rakitic may have lost his starting place to Vlasic. Croatia hit a few bumps on the road to the Euros, but will again be a force to be reckoned with come the tournament. Aleksandar Holiga, Telesport Czech Republic Qualifying for their seventh European Championship in row is a remarkable achievement for the Czech Republic, especially given as only a few Czechs currently play for major European clubs. The key point in the most recent qualifying campaign was the change of manager in September 2018, when the unpopular Karel Jarolim was replaced by Jaroslav Silhavy, who improved the mood in the squad and identified a core for the team quite quickly \u2013 based around Tomas Vaclik, Ondrej Celustka and Vladimir Darida. Team spirit and good organisation will be probably their biggest strengths. But will be it be enough? The Czech Republic really need Patrik Schick to be in good shape at the tournament. Reaching the last 16 is a basic target. Karel H\u00e4ring, Football Club football magazine Also: Play-off Winner C Group E Spain At his presentation upon returning as Spain manager, Luis Enrique was asked if they could win the Euros. The question was laced with pessimism, an awareness that the generation that won it all has almost all gone and that this is a team that have now gone three tournaments in a row without winning a knockout game, but Luis Enrique didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. Spain\u2019s qualification had shown that, he said: the selecci\u00f3n were unbeaten. It was a qualification finally clinched by his assistant Robert Moreno, who took over when Luis Enrique was forced to step aside because his nine-year-old daughter was seriously ill and subsequently died. His return hasn\u2019t been smooth \u2013 Moreno has gone, accused of disloyalty by Luis Enrique \u2013 but he is back now. And while he admits that Spain don\u2019t have an XI (\u201cI would love us to\u201d), and much as this generation certainly isn\u2019t that one, they do have players \u2013 and good ones. Sid Lowe, The Guardian Sweden By Swedish standards reaching the 2018 World Cup quarter-finals was a success, and Sweden\u2019s best campaign since coming third in 1994. The coach, Janne Andersson, has continued to build on that success with most of the team intact. After the World Cup Sweden won their Uefa Nations League group ahead of Turkey and Russia, and in the qualifiers they lost only once, away to Spain (3-0), and finished second in their group. The Mainz forward Robin Quaison has shouldered some of the goalscoring responsibility and was Sweden\u2019s top scorer in qualifying with five goals. Sweden\u2019s game is built upon a well-organised collective. Apart perhaps from Victor Lindel\u00f6f (Manchester United) and Emil Forsberg (RB Leipzig) Sweden do not really have any superstars, although Dejan Kulusevski (Parma) and Alexander Isak (Real Sociedad) are highly regarded for the future. Ludwig Billengren and Sven Bertil Liljegren, fotbollskanalen.se Poland Jerzy Brzeczek replaced Adam Nawalka after their failure at the World Cup and there were plenty of question marks over whether he was a suitable man for the job. Their Nations League campaign and friendlies prior to the Euro 2020 qualifiers only added to those doubts but fans need not have worried. Brzeczek has done exactly what the Polish FA chairman, Zbigniew Boniek, wanted him to do \u2013 win the group but also rebuild and refresh the squad with some new faces. The 20-year-old Sebastian Szymanski can be a first-choice winger for years. Krystian Bielik proved that his fine performances during the European Under-21 Championship were not a fluke. And there was also Krzysztof Piatek, a revelation in the 2018-19 season in Serie A. But Lewandowski has to be at the top of his form. His contribution in his three big tournaments? Only two goals. Tomasz W\u0142odarczyk, Przegl\u0105d Sportowy Also: Play-off Winner B Group F Portugal Portugal will be at Euro 2020 defending the title won in France in 2016. Qualification was guaranteed only in the last game, with a modest victory in Luxembourg, but the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o still had the play-offs as plan B, thanks to their victory in the first Nations League in the summer. The performances were not always convincing, butwith Fernando Santos in charge, Portugal have achieved good results and won two trophies. Cristiano Ronaldo is set to be the first player in history to play in five European Championship finals, and now with Bernardo Silva taking on a more relevant role (and players such as Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, Bruno Fernandes and R\u00faben Neves), Portugal can dream big again. Nuno Travassos, Maisfutebol France Simply because they had a bad day at the office in June in Turkey where they suffered their only defeat of the year (0-2), the 2018 world champions and 2016 Euro finalists did not make the top seeding pot. No big deal, though. France have reached their eighth Euro finals in a row rather comfortably and qualified untroubled by a raft of major injuries. Consequently Didier Deschamps had to use 29 players, among them a few newcomers such as Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet, L\u00e9o Dubois, Ferland Mendy, Tanguy Ndombel\u00e9 and Jonathan Ikon\u00e9, but his strongest possible lineup looks very similar to the one that won the World Cup, with only Lenglet having edged out Samuel Umtiti in central defence. The team rely heavily on set pieces , tournament experience and defensive nous. And at 28 Antoine Griezmann remains their undisputed technical leader and main inspiration. Anything but a place in the last four next summer would be considered a failure. Patrick Urbini, France Football Germany After the team crashed out of the 2018 World Cup at the group stage, an overhaul was inevitable. Former key players such as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, Mats Hummels and Thomas M\u00fcller were told that they were surplus to requirements, while Mesut \u00d6zil retired in the wake of the debate triggered by his photo with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Erdo\u011fan. The remaining stalwarts are the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and playmaker Toni Kroos. Add to that Marco Reus or Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, who have plenty of experience but have not yet been able to win any trophies with the national team due to injuries. The bulk of the side, however, is made up of players born between 1994 and 1997, foremost among them the Bayern striker Serge Gnabry, whose record on the international stage is astonishing: 13 goals in as many games. Joachim L\u00f6w thinks his team are too young to be one of the tournament favourites. Then again, life as a dark horse can be quite enjoyable.

      "body": "<p>The irony that Usman Khan, who killed two people before being shot dead on London Bridge by police, had been attending a conference on prisoner rehabilitation only minutes before launching his attack is obvious.</p> <p>Less apparent is the lack of surprise with which that particular element of the attack will have been greeted by many working on extremism and counter-terrorism.</p> <p>States face one of their thorniest problems when one of their citizens is identified and located as a threat by security services.</p> <p>One extreme option is to kill them \u2013 Anwar al-Awlaqi, a US citizen and radical preacher who was an influence on Khan, was killed in Yemen in 2011 by a drone strike ordered by President Obama. A more common response is to process them through the criminal justice system. Khan was found guilty of terror offences, including plotting to attack the London Stock Exchange in 2010 and jailed.</p> <p>One key question is whether to segregate extremists or keep them with the rest of the prison population. The choice is between exposing ordinary prisoners to radical ideologies, or allowing hardened and experienced actors to network, plot and reinforce their existing views. No one has come up with a clear answer to this dilemma.</p> <p>Then there is a question of release. There are three well-known and high-profile examples of what can go wrong here: Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of al-Qaida, was incarcerated in Egypt following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981; Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was freed in an amnesty in 1999 in Jordan and went on to found al-Qaida\u2019s branch in Iraq; and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the late leader of Isis, whose time in Camp Bucca, a vast prison for suspected militants set up in Iraq by the US after the 2003 invasion, was critical to his rise. All three were set free because they were no longer thought to be a threat. In each case, this proved to be a tragic error.</p> <p>Usman Khan was originally classed as never to be released unless deemed no longer a threat, but this condition was later lifted. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/usman-khan-profile-terrorist-who-wanted-to-bomb-london-stock-exchange\" title=\"\">released on licence</a> in December 2018.</p> <p>Clearly keeping all those convicted of any terrorism-related offence in prison indefinitely raises a host of legal, moral, ethical, political and practical questions. So some will always have to be released at some point.</p> <p>Twenty, even 10, years ago, this was not much of an issue. But the sudden surge of Islamic militant violence in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq war led to a new cohort of convicts facing terms of five to 15 years. Many have now been freed, or will be very soon.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/03/surge-in-terrorists-eligible-for-parole-poses-threat-to-uk-security\" title=\"\">A <em>Guardian</em> analysis</a> last year showed that more than 80 of the 193 sentences for terrorism offences between 2007 and 2016 in the UK ran out by the end of 2018.

      "bodyText": "The irony that Usman Khan, who killed two people before being shot dead on London Bridge by police, had been attending a conference on prisoner rehabilitation only minutes before launching his attack is obvious. Less apparent is the lack of surprise with which that particular element of the attack will have been greeted by many working on extremism and counter-terrorism. States face one of their thorniest problems when one of their citizens is identified and located as a threat by security services. One extreme option is to kill them \u2013 Anwar al-Awlaqi, a US citizen and radical preacher who was an influence on Khan, was killed in Yemen in 2011 by a drone strike ordered by President Obama. A more common response is to process them through the criminal justice system. Khan was found guilty of terror offences, including plotting to attack the London Stock Exchange in 2010 and jailed. One key question is whether to segregate extremists or keep them with the rest of the prison population. The choice is between exposing ordinary prisoners to radical ideologies, or allowing hardened and experienced actors to network, plot and reinforce their existing views. No one has come up with a clear answer to this dilemma. Then there is a question of release. There are three well-known and high-profile examples of what can go wrong here: Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of al-Qaida, was incarcerated in Egypt following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981; Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was freed in an amnesty in 1999 in Jordan and went on to found al-Qaida\u2019s branch in Iraq; and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the late leader of Isis, whose time in Camp Bucca, a vast prison for suspected militants set up in Iraq by the US after the 2003 invasion, was critical to his rise. All three were set free because they were no longer thought to be a threat. In each case, this proved to be a tragic error. Usman Khan was originally classed as never to be released unless deemed no longer a threat, but this condition was later lifted. He was released on licence in December 2018. Clearly keeping all those convicted of any terrorism-related offence in prison indefinitely raises a host of legal, moral, ethical, political and practical questions. So some will always have to be released at some point. Twenty, even 10, years ago, this was not much of an issue. But the sudden surge of Islamic militant violence in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq war led to a new cohort of convicts facing terms of five to 15 years. Many have now been freed, or will be very soon. A Guardian analysis last year showed that more than 80 of the 193 sentences for terrorism offences between 2007 and 2016 in the UK ran out by the end of 2018. That is far too many people for stretched security services to monitor permanently. If these individuals were successfully rehabilitated \u2013 the topic under discussion when Khan launched his attack \u2013 there would be no problem. But even if they were adequately funded, deradicalisation programmes have had only very patchy success in recent years. There is no silver bullet for preventing recidivism. Like so much of counter-terrorism, the result is a messy compromise between the often conflicting demands of the public, their elected representatives, officials, the law and many others. Inevitably, mistakes are made. And equally inevitably, people then die. Jason Burke is the author of four books about Islamic extremism",

Anonymous, 37, Alberta, Canada Alex Preston, author and Observer critic, writes: Well now, I have to say that my first instinct here is somewhat mutinous. Haven\u2019t upper-middle-class Americans rather had their time in the literary sun? There\u2019s a whole world out there, you know. So what about something from the trailblazing Cassava Republic Press, a publisher of extraordinary, mind-expanding books from Africa? I\u2019d recommend in particular A Small Silence, the superb debut novel from the Nigerian poet Jumoke Verissimo. Or how about Alia Trabucco Zer\u00e1n\u2019s The Remainder, published by And Other Stories and translated by Sophie Hughes? This deeply compelling excavation of the crimes of Pinochet\u2019s Chile has gained new urgency now tyranny has once again reared its head in the country. But if you insist on Americans in the Franzen/Tartt mould, how about looking back a generation to the greats such as James Salter, William Maxwell and (the slightly younger) Marilynne Robinson? Or what about the remarkable Olive and Lucy Barton novels by Elizabeth Strout? I didn\u2019t entirely see what the fuss was about until her most recent, Olive, Again, which left me speechless with admiration. To my mind, though, the best contemporary American novelist of middle-class mores by some distance is one who happens to live in England: Benjamin Markovits . You Don\u2019t Have to Live Like This is one of the essential books of the past 10 years \u2013 breathtakingly clever, hugely entertaining and a powerful commentary on the financial crisis and its aftermath. His recent Essinger novels \u2013 A Weekend in New York and Christmas in Austin \u2013 are also glorious, showing us that America will always be best perceived through the prism of the family, and that, as Hemingway knew, sometimes you have to leave a place to understand it.

      "body": "<p>Marie-Elsa Bragg, 54, is an author, Anglican priest, therapist and duty chaplain at Westminster Abbey. She is half-French and half-Cumbrian and grew up in London with her father, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. She wrote her debut novel, <em>Towards Mellbreak</em><em>,</em> in 2017. Her forthcoming book, <em>Sleeping Letters, </em>is a memoir addressed to both her parents about her mother, Marie-Elisabeth Roche, who took her own life when Marie-Elsa was six years old. The book is written \u2013 in part \u2013 as a series of unsent letters to her mother and father. It is also a description of the ritual of the eucharist.</p> <p><strong>What was the starting point for <em>Sleeping Letters</em>?</strong><br>I was commissioned to write another novel but I went into a silent retreat and this is what came out. I thought, Well, I\u2019ve just got to do this. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted my editor to see it but then they kept asking and I felt there was something universal about what I was writing. I\u2019ve watched so many people go through grief now, and I\u2019ve also done a lot of funerals, and there really is no shame to suffering. It\u2019s actually quite beautiful. If you allow yourself to still love, even when you\u2019ve had incredible grief, then all of you comes through it somehow.</p> <p><strong>You write in the book that you would like to tell your mother that she has always been with you \u201clike a scent\u201d. But you say you have often turned away from her \u201cfrom fear of what happened\u201d. What made you turn back?</strong><br>Love. It\u2019s got to be love. And defiantly refusing to accept that pain can be the end of the story. It\u2019s more than hope, it\u2019s a refusal to let the difficult things have the last word. There\u2019s something about getting older that means you have a longer view about what forgiveness is and how we really heal. It is often the case that people find it easier to give forgiveness than to receive it.</p> <p><strong>The form of <em>Sleeping Letters</em> is unusual \u2013 it\u2019s a memoir made up of prose, poetry, religious reflections and letters. You call it a confession \u2013 why?</strong><br>Because it was written in the ritualistic atmosphere of a silent retreat. But there\u2019s also something about facing my own pain, which has to be a confession about the things I irrationally believe I\u2019ve done wrong. We all collude somehow in even the most difficult situations because we don\u2019t know what to do. But I feel very different having written the book \u2013 it was a question of confessing that pain to myself. I know it\u2019s there and I feel ready to bite on it now.</p> <p><strong>You have said that writing the book has been very cathartic. In what ways?</strong><br>When you live with grief, you can hide parts of yourself from yourself and often those parts are the ones longing to see that person again. We often just don\u2019t know what to do with them, so they\u2019re just stored. Living with unanswered questions can feel like you\u2019re holding your breath because you don\u2019t have the other person answering them. But even in a relationship with someone who is alive, we don\u2019t fully understand how we are encountering each other. I was able to go through that pain threshold to talk to both my parents.</p> <p><strong>Has your father read <em>Sleeping Letters</em>?</strong><br>Yes, he read it in the summer. I felt a mixture of nervousness and also so much love. Everything I have possibly found from my soul to give to my parents is in the book. It\u2019s something he\u2019s never been able to hear and is continually tortured by.</p> <p>I genuinely wrote it to both of them in the hope I could say: \u201cHey, I\u2019m your daughter and this is what I\u2019ve found and I have the courage to speak to you now.\u201d It was very emotional when he read it, but what\u2019s nice is that over the last couple of months, he\u2019s reading it again and beginning to find it healing. He\u2019s 80 years old and seeing dear friends die so I really wanted to be able to give it to him.</p> <p><strong>When I was reading your book, I had both </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/frieda-hughes-i-felt-my-parents-were-stolen\" title=\"\"><strong>Frieda Hughes</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/10/stranger-baby-emily-berry-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Emily Berry</strong></a><strong> in mind, two poets whose mothers took their own lives and have written about that loss. Did their poetry give you a confidence to write about your mother?</strong><br>I do feel that there is a really interesting movement of women poets now, Emily Berry being one of them, where we are feeling a freedom of being able to talk in whatever form is natural to us. We\u2019re neither feeling conformed by a sonnet nor so rebellious that we never write anything like that. So I was able to take the eucharist, which in its history has been deeply patriarchal in its structure and in its manner of use and breathe with authenticity without feeling ashamed of being a woman. I feel very companioned with poets such as Emily Berry and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/22/alice-oswald-interview-falling-awake\" title=\"\">Alice Oswald</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who are the writers who have inspired you most?</strong><br>Personally, I feel very [much] in a line of conversation with Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf. When I was younger, I was nervous of those writers because their lives ended in the same way as my mother\u2019s. The question for me has been: how does a woman go deeply into creativity and survive? Part of my letter to my mother is saying that I\u2019m really going to dive into this. I think I\u2019ve found a form which helps me survive.</p> <p><strong>Which book or author do you always return to?</strong><br><em>Mrs Dalloway</em><em>, </em>because it has this web of reality in it that I find comforting and such delicately drawn characters. You have layers upon layers of Woolf\u2019s sense that we are all affecting each other whether we know it or not. It\u2019s funny, when you are duty chaplin at Westminster Abbey, you go and live there for one or two weeks a year. Having always been obsessed with <em>Mrs Dalloway</em>, I thought what a lark to be sleeping near Big Ben! But by 11pm when it chimed, I thought: \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m never going to sleep!\u201d</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re an Anglican priest. How do you balance your clerical duties with being creative?</strong><br>I find the craft of priesthood deeply creative. I\u2019m about to write a sermon for the church I work with in Golders Green and I have to have an intuitive sense of what that congregation needs. You meet people who have made terrible mistakes or are in terrible trouble and may never get out of it but they can be inspiring.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s foremost authority on military events, the distinguished historian Sir Michael Howard, has died shortly after his 97th birthday. Friends and fellow academics have expressed admiration for the talents of Howard, born in Dorset, who is best known for his analysis of historical conflicts in relation to their social and political impact, moving away from the traditional concentration on tactics. He was educated at Wellington College and then Oxford, where he was later Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford University. He was also the founder of the Department of War Studies at Kings College London that bears his name. The academic once told an interviewer he had wanted to be a historian since boyhood and so regarded himself as \u201clucky\u201d to get his first job. Asked what contribution to the field he wished to be remembered for, Howard said: \u201cI think it has been to reintegrate the study of war into mainstream history, particularly for British historians.\u201d And who did he regard as the most influential academic in his field? \u201cMe.\u201d Along with Prof Peter Paret, of the Institute for Advanced Study, Howard translated from German Carl Von Clausewitz\u2019s On War, which is now considered the standard English version. Howard also helped establish the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an independent centre for research and debate on the problems of conflict, and was twice appointed vice-president of the British Academy between 1978 and 1980. He received the Nato Atlantic award, the Paul Nitze award from the US Center for Naval Analyses and was knighted in 1986.",

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all from us - thanks for reading! Here\u2019s Barney Ronay on West Ham\u2019s triumph at Stamford Bridge: And from Crystal Palace\u2019s win at Burnley: Here\u2019s our match report from Spurs\u2019 latest rollercoaster win under Jose Thrill-a-Minute Mourinho: Cheltenham 1-3 Port Vale Forest Green 2-2 Carlisle Kingstonian 0-2 AFC Fylde Oldham 0-1 Burton Portsmouth 2-1 Altrincham Shrewsbury 2-0 Mansfield Walsall 0-1 Oxford Utd Southampton make short work of take on Watford in just under half an hour. Follow the buildup \u2013 and the game \u2013 with the esteemed Scott Murray here: Charlton 1-3 Sheff Wed Barnsley 3-1 Hull Birmingham 1-1 Millwall Brentford 7-0 Luton Bristol City 5-2 Huddersfield Derby 1-1 QPR Leeds 4-0 Middlesbrough Nottm Forest 0-1 Cardiff Stoke 1-2 Blackburn Wigan 1-3 Reading I am going here now ... Burnley 0-2 Palace Chelsea 0-1 West Ham Liverpool 2-1 Brighton Spurs 3-2 Bournemouth A pretty simple win for the Eagles. Mourinho\u2019s men just about hold on. David Martin keeps a cleansheet in the shock win. The \u2018keeper falls to his knees at full-time and is crying. Spurs get away with one at the last, as the defence recover to clear when it looked like Bournemouth were about to score. Wilson gets a second. Spurs love conceding late consolation goals. Liverpool hold on after having their goalkeeper sent off. It certainly does not ... Da Silva has a hat-trick for Brentford and they are 7-0 up against Luton. Brighton are on top at Anfield and chasing the equaliser! Adrian looks nervous, so it could be an interesting finish. All seemed to have been done by the rules. Puscas gets a hat-trick for Reading at Wigan. He has scored three in just five minutes! Altrincham equalise at Portsmouth! Josh Hancock from the spot. Will we have a shock? Keane Lewis-Potter has pulled one back for Hull at Barnsley. A feat to have three surnames. George Puscas has scored two in as many minutes to turn things around at Wigan. Reading are now leading 2-1. Bradley Dack has scored at both ends after putting the ball into the back of his own net at Stoke to equalise. Our man at Stamford Bridge ... I had written off Brighton but they are now just a goal behind and playing against 10 men. This could be exciting! Schlupp takes advantage of Mee kicking a clearance against himself by whacking the loose ball into the net. Dunk takes a quick free-kick and it catches out Liverpool as he drills it into the back of the net. GAME ON! The Brazilian goalkeeper charges out and handles the ball outside of his area as he stops the ball going over his head and is rightly sent off. At least Liverpool can bring Adrian on. Brentford net their sixth of the day against Luton after Benrahma coverts a penalty. Leeds are 3-0 up against Middlesbrough thanks to Helder Costa\u2019s first goal for the club. Harry Wilson curls a free-kick into the top corner to give the Cherries hope. Tom Pope has a hat-trick for Port Vale against Cheltenham. The Valiants are heading into the third round of the FA Cup. A cracking volley from Sissoko finishes off this fixture. VAR rules out West Ham goal! Snodgrass chips a cross to the back post where Antonio is waiting and manages to bundle the ball home after a couple of attempts but it is adjudged to have hit his arm. Stockport are three goals to the good at Torquay. What a long way to go for a day in the fifth tier. Burnley are on top against Palace but are yet to find an equaliser. Can they break down Palace who have replaced Dann with Sakho. West Ham almost double their lead as Balbuena heads at goal but Kepa is up to the challenge, then Antonio has a good chance but can only knee the ball towards goal and the \u2018keeper grabs it. Ben Close puts Portsmouth ahead against Altrincham, meaning we\u2019re even less likely to get an FA Cup shock today. Alli misses a cracking chance to secure his hat-trick but I am sure he will get another opportunity. 11 minutes to go! Kevin Nesbit has a fourth for Dunfermline against Partick Thistle! Dave Tindall offers: \u201cGary Gillespie got a hat-trick for Liverpool in 1986 when playing as a defender. Third was a spot-kick.\u201d Mourinho and Alli are a match made in heaven, it would seem. Alli gets the ball from Vertonghen, takes a couple of touches and slots home. Ruddy heck! West Ham break on Chelsea, Fornals sends the ball through to Cresswell, who cuts back onto his weaker right foot and curls the ball in. Another 45 minutes of fun! 11-0!!! James Debens might be making this up: \u201cRoque Junior got a hat trick of goals for Leeds United back in the early Noughties.\u201d Kudos to Graeme Thorn: \u201cSteve Nicol\u2019s hat-trick in 87 against Newcastle doesn\u2019t count as he was playing in midfield - Mark Lawrenson (wearing 9) was at right-back that day.\u201d Some defender hat-trick options ... John Potter offers: \u201cSteve Bruce surely.\u201d P\u00e1draig McAuliffe says: \u201cSteve Watson scored a hat-trick for Everton against Leeds in 2003. He was normally a right-back, though he wasn\u2019t playing in that position that day. Steve Nicol got one in the 87-88 season against Newcastle.\u201d James Boyle asks: \u201cI was just wondering who was the last central defender to score a hat trick in the top English league - any ideas?\u201d Brentford go into the break 5-0 up against Luton! We want 10! And the report from St James\u2019 Park ... Half-time reading ... Burnley 0-1 Crystal Palace Chelsea 0-0 West Ham Liverpool 2-0 Brighton Spurs 1-0 Bournemouth Zaha whacks a shot towards the near post and Pope allows the ball to fly past him just before the break. It\u2019s a poor effort from the England goalkeeper. Nothing close to an FA Cup upset so far in the 3pm kick-offs. Where is the fun in that? Someone else is happy to tempt fate ... Five goals at Ashton Gate already today. Bristol City are 4-1 up against Huddersfield. Maybe they will inflict another 10-1 defeat on Huddersfield, just 30 years since Man City did it to them. Elsewhere in the Championship, Brentford are 4-0 up against Luton. VAR spots an offside after Van Aanholt puts the ball into the back of the net for Palace at Burnley. He was miles off but VAR took ruddy ages. Love the modern game. Giroud not having a great game ... Brighton should be back in it at Anfield but Lewis Dunk scuffed his shot when he had an open goal to aim from just a few yards out! Wigan do not have Pele or Puscas but they have someone better in Joe Garner, who has opened the scoring against Reading. Dunfermline are now 4-0 up after 31 minutes against 10-man Partick. A hat-trick for Kevin Nesbit. Julian Borrill says: \u201cRe: 15:08, despite playing with 10 men and being 3 down in 22 minutes, Partick have still had 64% possession.\u201d Can they maintain it? Pele sends in a cross to Puscas for Reading at Wigan! It does not result in a goal but what a combination. A Mr Cottage emails in to say: \u201cWho can ever forget the wonderfully named Wolfgang Wolf, who managed.... Wolfsburg! Beautiful.\u201d West Ham almost took at shock lead at Chelsea! VAR rules out Sanchez goal! Son played in Sissoko, who whacks the ball against Rico and then Sanchez finishes. The referee goes upstairs and it\u2019s disallowed for handball. This game is done and dusted, as Van Dijk once again heads home, this time from a Alexander-Arnold cross. Is the title race over? QPR are the only team in the country without a cleansheet. They are currently 1-0 down to Derby after Martyn Waghorn opened the scoring. Defending is overrated. Benjamin Lewis says: \u201cIn the Chelsea-West Ham match a West Ham player has gone down injured in the Chelsea half. West Ham keep attacking for the best part of a minute, then when Chelsea win the ball back and are about to break, the referee blows the whistle to get the West Ham player treatment. Surely this is totally unsporting from West Ham, and ridiculous from the referee?\u201d All a bit odd ... The ball is sent down the middle, Son takes control of it on the edge of the box and nudges it into the path of Alli who strokes the ball home. Mourinho certainly seems to have revitalised the England midfielder. Van Dijk rises highest in the box to head home a cross at the back post. Can Brighton back into this? Kari Tulinius says: \u201cWhen it comes to players sharing names with their clubs, few can top Icelander Valur Valsson, who played for the football club Valur. Because most Icelanders have patronyms as their last names, his name means Valur, son of Valur.\u201d Firmino is the first person to test Ryan at Anfield. The Brazilian cuts inside and fires in a low shot but the Brighton goalkeeper does well to save it. Stoke are behind at home against Blackburn with Dack the first to react after a bit of pinball in the box. Michael O\u2019Neill has a big job on his hands there. No goal in the Premier League so far and it\u2019s all been quite boring across the board. No goalkeeper has been put under pressure so far. Fylde have taken the lead at Kingstonian in the FA Cup, so we\u2019re unlikely to see an upset there. Mike McKenzie mocks one of my fellow Guardian employees: \u201cI\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t the expert who recommended that Jonjo be shelved in Ten Talking Points earlier this week.\u201d Re the post at 3.05pm. I AM VERY WRONG! Good for morale ... Partick Thistle have had a man sent off and conceded from the penalty spot in the opening four minutes. They are in for a tough afternoon at Dunfermline. Luke Forrester, known solely as \u2018Luke\u2019, says: \u201cI see that the pendulum has swung back in favour of referring to Lucas Moura as \u2018Lucas\u2019 rather than \u2018Moura\u2019 on teamsheets etc. Hopefully we won\u2019t see a repeat of the Idrissa Gueye \u2018Gana/Gueye\u2019 nonsense. I hope someone from Opcom is keeping tabs. Absolutely disgusting.\u201d Big goal in the Championship as Leeds\u2019 Patrick Bamford scores at the second chance of asking against Middlesbrough. The Leeds striker had a spell at Boro earlier in his career and his strike is further bad news for Jonathan Woodgate who is having a tough start to his managerial career. I would like to be proved wrong but I anticipate the answer is no. Our man at Stamford Bridge could be about to witness a mauling. At Turf Moor, Crystal Palace\u2019s Milivojevi\u0107 lines up a free-kick after Zaha is taken down but he whips it just over. Burnley will need to be on it today, as Zaha is already looking dangerous. Justin Kavanagh says: \u201cGood to see Callum Hynes in the Spurs squad today. That Mourhino knows how to keep jaded players on their toes. On the subject of place names (and I\u2019m showing my age here), but as a young boy, I was always troubled by the fact that Mike England could play for Wales. It just didn\u2019t seem right!\u201d Peep! Peep! Peep! The whistles are blown around the country. Here is a cracking header from friend of the show Jay Bothroyd today to get you in the mood: Anyway ... we\u2019re about to get some actual football! Players are walking out of tunnels across the country. Now we\u2019re talking ... Kevin Smith asks: \u201cCan you get your brother to tell Owen Hargreaves that Canada hates him?\u201d I\u2019ll pass it on. Rusto Kulkki says: \u201cHere in Finland, earlier this month Veikkausliiga side Fc Lahti announced the signing of centre back Timi Lahti.\u201d I am a huge fan of Finnish football. My brother is currently in the same Cheshire pub as Ed Woodward and Owen Hargreaves. More as we get it. Kieron Malone says: \u201cWho can forget Stephen Ireland playing (long time ago admittedly) for Ireland.\u201d He\u2019s still available. As a Manchester City fan, my day is already written off but I did get 12 bottles of wine delivered, so I have to focus on the positives. Stats! Keith Keith would be a better name. J.R. rightly fires in a correction: \u201cI\u2019m sure I will just be one of 1,057 others (okay, maybe I will be the only one) but I can\u2019t let it go without correcting the record. Kilkenny is not a town. It is a city. A lovely one at that. Up the cats!\u201d I am currently wearing a Boston Red Sox shirt and drinking coffee from Boston Red Sox mug despite having no interest in baseball. Please feel free to share with me your random memorabilia you own. Good to see lots of clubs and players supporting Rainbow Laces today ... Lynda Bailey seems to have emailed the wrong live blog: \u201cSlightly off-field but weren\u2019t you surprised to learn that David Attenborough\u2019s family came from a village called\u2026Attenborough?\u201d This is the first I\u2019ve heard of it. Kilkenny update from Dan Moriarty: \u201cYoung Kilkenny is an Irish lad, midfielder. I believe he had a stormer against Lyon in a pre season friendly. \u201cHe is also an Irish town name which is notable as I suspect not many footballers have a surname that is also a town name in their country, perhaps one for the knowledge boffins?\u201d Hytner on the whole emery situation ... A nice gesture from Spurs to the ball boy who helped set up a goal in the week: It\u2019s ended 2-2 at St James\u2019 Park. City were pretty poor for the majority of the game and Newcastle defended well. Bournemouth\u2019s bench includes Kilkenny and Saydee. I\u2019ve genuinely never heard of them. If anyone has some insight, it would be greatly appreciated. Shelvey has just scored a stunner to equalise for Newcastle as City have little to no understanding of what defending is. Kevin De Bruyne has absolutely smashed one in off the bar to give City the lead against Newcastle. You will never see a ball hit harder. You will probably have noticed that Unai Emery has been binned. Jonathan Wilson gives his view. Picking the bones out of the various team news: West Ham have indeed dropped Roberto for David Martin who has made it to the Premier League via Liverpool reserves, MK Dons and Millwall. Dier keeps his place in the Spurs team despite his very early substitution in midweek. Giroud is the man given the job of replacing the injured Abraham for Chelsea. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Cork, Hendrick, Brady, Wood, Barnes. Subs: Hart, Lowton, Drinkwater, Gibson, Rodriguez, Pieters, Lennon. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Kelly, Dann, Tomkins, Van Aanholt,Townsend, Kouyate, Milivojevic, McArthur, Zaha, Ayew. Subs: Hennessey, Sakho, Schlupp, Benteke, McCarthy, Camarasa, Riedewald. Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, James, Zouma, Tomori, Emerson, Jorginho, Kovacic, Mount, Pedro, Pulisic, Giroud. Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Azpilicueta, Kante, Willian, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi. West Ham: Martin, Fredericks, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Noble, Rice, Fornals, Snodgrass, Anderson, Antonio. Subs: Roberto, Zabaleta, Masuaku, Ajeti, Sanchez, Yarmolenko, Haller. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Lovren, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mane, Salah, Firmino Subs: Adrian, Milner, Keita, Gomez, Lallana, Shaqiri, Origi Brighton: Ryan, Montoya, Dunk, Webster, Burn, Gross, Stephens, Propper, Bissouma, Mooy, Connolly Subs: Button, Duffy, Maupay, Trossard, Murray, Schelotto, Alzate Spurs: Gazzaniga, Vertonghen, Aurier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Dier, Ndombele, Sissoko, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Whiteman, Rose, Winks, Walker-Peters, Lo Celso, Eriksen, Lucas. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Rico, S. Cook, Ake, Stacey, Lerma, L. Cook, Groeneveld, Fraser, Solanke, C. Wilson. Subs: Boruc, Gosling, H. Wilson, Simpson, Mepham, Kilkenny, Saydee. Newcastle v Manchester City is a pretty bad advert for walking football. The tempo has been incredibly slow and City have lacked ideas for the majority. Ben Fisher has been for a chat with Eddie Howe ... Will Klopp need to change formation today with the news that Fabinho is set to miss the next two months through injury? It\u2019s FA Cup second round weekend and I have personally got you covered ... Our man at Stamford Bridge thinks David Martin could replace Roberto today ... Get in the mood with Mason Mount and Declan Rice ... Good afternoon! For a Saturday at 3pm, there\u2019s actually plenty happening. Three of the now traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019 are playing. Chelsea could finish the West Ham careers of Manuel Pellegrini and Roberto at Stamford Bridge. The Hammers have looked awful since Lukasz Fabianski succumbed to injury and his replacement looks to have the yips.

Liverpool have not been at their best in recent times but the prospect of Brighton at home will bring little fear to their squad who will be keen on boosting their own confidence with a few goals. Klopp is without a few players after recent injuries and considering how critical the next month or so will be, there could be plenty of changes. There is a first Premier League outing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for Jose Mourinho, with Bournemouth in town. It\u2019s a battle of 10th v 11th, which is the one we\u2019ve all been waiting for. Both teams will be on the front foot and looking to make an impact. We can also hope that there is some sort of FA Cup shock at Kingstonian v Fylde or Portsmouth v Altrincham. If we do not get one, then we should scrap the competition.",

      "body": "<p>This, rugby\u2019s fiercest derby, has produced some crackling encounters of high drama and intensity. This one was little more than an exhibition. Not that it was any less enjoyable if you are a Saint. They are playing the rugby of the gods just now and this latest bonus-point win, sparked by two tries from new boy Matt Proctor, takes them back to the top of the table.</p> <p>\u201cToday was one of our better performances,\u201d said Chris Boyd, the latest Kiwi coach to reveal the game\u2019s secrets to us up here. \u201cTo get the points and play well, at home, East Midlands derby \u2013 the supporters go home happy, hopefully.\u201d</p> <p>What a joy they are to watch these days, bursting with star performers up front and behind, but how Leicester spirited them on their way.

He woke to find his room full of thick black smoke. The elderly Somali man ran outside to the stairwell, where he vomited. He remembers a black substance coming out of his mouth and nose.</p> <p>Omar managed to escape alive, but others in the 25-floor public housing complex located in the heart of Minneapolis\u2019s Somali community did not. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/minneapolis-high-rise-fire-five\">fire killed five people</a>, injured at least four more and has sparked an argument in the city about its dilapidated public housing.</p> <p>In a debate with echoes of Britain\u2019s Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 in 2017, the conversation has centered on whether the city has failed to make safe the housing it provides to its poor and vulnerable, essentially putting their lives at risk as it seeks to save money and maintain a system long <a href=\"https://www.abtassociates.com/projects/abt-finds-billions-are-needed-to-renovate-aging-public-housing\">underfunded</a> by the federal government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/minneapolis-high-rise-fire-five\">'It was absolutely gutted': five dead after fire in Minneapolis high-rise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Omar was taken to an emergency room where, he said, doctors removed black smoke from his lungs.

I need help,\u201d he told the Guardian with the help of a volunteer translator, clutching a report from this ER visit in his hand as he spoke.</p> <p>Investigators have not determined what caused the fire, which happened during the year\u2019s first major snow storm, though the Minneapolis fire chief, John Fruetel, said he believed it was an accident.</p> <p>Public attention has begun to center around what Fruetel has acknowledged could have contributed to the rapid spread of the flames: the high rise did not have sprinkler systems above the two lowest floors.</p> <p>City officials have said that because of the age of the building, which was constructed in 1969, it was not required by city code to have a sprinkler system \u2013 but that, some say, is exactly the problem.</p> <p>\u201cNobody should have died. A small fire should not have resulted in the death of five people. Because if you\u2019re having such dense housing, there should be a sprinkler system in an apartment building. Even though that may not be required by code, that should be required because Minneapolis public housing authority has a responsibility to provide safe and secure housing to all of its residents,\u201d said Kaaha Kaahiye, a resident of public housing and organizer with Defend Glendale, an advocacy group long critical of the public housing authority (MPHA).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5b6608fba7f9fb245f3ae489bcdf517ceb1ea3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5b6608fba7f9fb245f3ae489bcdf517ceb1ea3/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Warsame Omar survived the Cedar High fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warsame Omar survived the Cedar High fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Jared Goyette</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As first <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/11/29/agency-cited-sprinkler-need-months-before-highrise-fire?sfns=mo\">reported</a> by Minneapolis Public Radio, the MPHA had identified the need to retrofit its older high rises with sprinkler system in its annual plan, approved in September, which also noted limiting funding and a need for \u201cmajor reinvestment\u201d.</p> <p>MPHA did not ask for additional funds from the city for sprinkler systems in its last budget request, according to the office of the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government is the primary funder of public housing, but funds have been short for decades.

      "bodyText": "Warsame Omar lives on the 15th floor of Minneapolis\u2019s Cedar High apartments, exactly one floor above where a fire started early on Wednesday morning. He woke to find his room full of thick black smoke. The elderly Somali man ran outside to the stairwell, where he vomited. He remembers a black substance coming out of his mouth and nose. Omar managed to escape alive, but others in the 25-floor public housing complex located in the heart of Minneapolis\u2019s Somali community did not. The fire killed five people, injured at least four more and has sparked an argument in the city about its dilapidated public housing. In a debate with echoes of Britain\u2019s Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 in 2017, the conversation has centered on whether the city has failed to make safe the housing it provides to its poor and vulnerable, essentially putting their lives at risk as it seeks to save money and maintain a system long underfunded by the federal government. Omar was taken to an emergency room where, he said, doctors removed black smoke from his lungs. Now, many of his belongings and clothing in his home are covered in soot, and he\u2019s worried about how what happened could affect his health. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to complain but I need help. I need help,\u201d he told the Guardian with the help of a volunteer translator, clutching a report from this ER visit in his hand as he spoke. Investigators have not determined what caused the fire, which happened during the year\u2019s first major snow storm, though the Minneapolis fire chief, John Fruetel, said he believed it was an accident. Public attention has begun to center around what Fruetel has acknowledged could have contributed to the rapid spread of the flames: the high rise did not have sprinkler systems above the two lowest floors. City officials have said that because of the age of the building, which was constructed in 1969, it was not required by city code to have a sprinkler system \u2013 but that, some say, is exactly the problem. \u201cNobody should have died. A small fire should not have resulted in the death of five people. Because if you\u2019re having such dense housing, there should be a sprinkler system in an apartment building. Even though that may not be required by code, that should be required because Minneapolis public housing authority has a responsibility to provide safe and secure housing to all of its residents,\u201d said Kaaha Kaahiye, a resident of public housing and organizer with Defend Glendale, an advocacy group long critical of the public housing authority (MPHA). As first reported by Minneapolis Public Radio, the MPHA had identified the need to retrofit its older high rises with sprinkler system in its annual plan, approved in September, which also noted limiting funding and a need for \u201cmajor reinvestment\u201d. MPHA did not ask for additional funds from the city for sprinkler systems in its last budget request, according to the office of the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey. \u201cThe federal government is the primary funder of public housing, but funds have been short for decades. With respect to local funding authority, the city of Minneapolis can only approve requests submitted by MPHA,\u201d said the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Mychal Vlatkovich. Like many cities across the country, Minneapolis is experiencing an affordable housing crisis, with high demand for urban housing driving a surge in the development of new luxury condos. The Hennepin county commissioner, Angela Conley, whose district includes the Cedar Riverside neighborhood, where the apartments are located, pointed to what she sees as a problematic discrepancy: new buildings with high rents are required to have sprinkler systems, while older high rises, historically home to immigrants and lower-income populations, have no such requirement. \u201cSo does that tell us that the lives of seniors and vulnerable people and disabled people and people who are lower income in high-rises, are their lives more expendable than people who can afford to live in more expensive, newer condos? Absolutely not. But that\u2019s the message that we get when we know that certain buildings take priority over others,\u201d Conley said. On Friday, organizers with Defend Glendale met with residents and collected stories. They plan to push MPHA and the mayor to do more to help residents whose apartments were damaged, and to improve fire safety standards at other buildings. \u201cBlack and black Muslims and low-income and disabled people are invisible in a city that says that [it is] anti-Trump and therefore progressive,\u201d says the group\u2019s founder, Ladan Yusuf. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that this could happen anywhere else. And it\u2019s already happened. It happened in Grenfell in England. It\u2019s happening here because politicians and political officials have to be held accountable. It\u2019s important to know that we are one community and that we have to come together to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",

He thought of them as \u201cmorning coffee notes\u201d \u2013 audio meditations about what was on his mind first thing in the morning. The term \u201cpodcast\u201d was coined later in 2004 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia\" title=\"\">Ben Hammersley</a> as a portmanteau term that combined \u201cpod\u201d (from the Apple iPod) and \u201cbroadcast\u201d. This was a great term for the medium, though it has taken 15 years for the radio and TV industry to realise that it\u2019s nothing like broadcasting. Which only goes to confirm HL Mencken\u2019s observation that it\u2019s difficult to explain anything to a person if their salary depends on not understanding it.</p> <p>The thing that the broadcast industry didn\u2019t get is that podcasting is a new and distinctive medium. The BBC for years persisted in not understanding it \u2013 as shown by the way its radio programmes that were hosted on a web server after transmission were described as podcasts. They\u2019re not: they\u2019re stored radio programmes available for access at the listener\u2019s convenience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Podcasting can often convey more intellectually challenging ideas and content than broadcasting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The most distinctive thing about podcasts is the more intimate relationship between creator and listener that they enable. A radio broadcast reaches large numbers of listeners simultaneously, many of them not giving the programme their undivided attention. Most podcasts, on the other hand, are heard via headphones so the producer has a different relationship with the listener. You have to choose what you\u2019re going to hear rather than just accepting what the station transmits. And while you may be doing something else at the same time \u2013 walking, jogging, exercising, washing-up, cooking, whatever \u2013 the audio signal is no longer just background noise: it\u2019s coming straight into your ears. This means that podcasting has a higher cognitive bandwidth than broadcasting, and so can often convey more intellectually challenging ideas and content.</p> <p>Podcasting also reaches parts that broadcasting, despite its power, sometimes cannot reach. For example, <a href=\"https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/\" title=\"\">Talking Politics</a>, a weekly podcast created and presented by the Cambridge academic David Runciman (and on which I have occasionally been a guest), has had 10.2 million listens in 165 countries since they started keeping records in 2016, and is currently running at more than half a million listeners every month. This for a podcast that produces weekly conversations between a group of serious scholars in a range of disciplines and makes few of the concessions to the audience that a broadcast show on the same subject would be obliged to make.</p> <p>Another example is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily\" title=\"\"><em>The Daily</em></a>, the <em>New York Times</em>\u2019s<em> </em>weekday podcast, on which the host Michael Barbaro takes a news story of the day and probes it with a journalist who has broken \u2013 or worked on \u2013 the story. One of the things that surprised the <em>Times</em> about <em>The Daily</em> was that its audience has a radically different demographic from its normal readership. They\u2019re younger, for one thing; and most of them would never dream of buying a newspaper. These lessons have not been lost on other publications, not least our stablemate, the <em>Guardian</em>, which last month celebrated the first anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/todayinfocus\" title=\"\"><em>Today in Focus</em></a>, its daily news-based podcast.</p> <p>For a long time, podcasting was a hidden treasure enabled by the affordances of the technology. It was \u2013 just as blogging was \u2013 the province of enthusiasts and evangelists like Winer who did it because it was empowering, interesting, communal and fun. But now it seems to be falling prey to the same phenomenon that has bedevilled the web \u2013 the thundering herds motivated by corporate greed. In that sense, it may be subject to the pernicious cycle first noticed by Tim Wu in his landmark book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-master-switch-9781848879867.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Master Switch</em></a> \u2013 in which a medium starts out gloriously free but winds up being captured and zombified by commercial interests.</p> <p>Podcasting certainly started out free. At the end of his first \u201caudioblog\u201d, Winer said: \u201cThe conclusion I came to was: forget about starting a business. When I started blogging, the last thing I was thinking about was how am I going to turn this into a business. I just found it interesting, then found it fascinating, then decided to just go with the flow \u2013 to keep doing it and see where it led. The only way to find out is to start doing it.\u201d</p> <p>So he did, and we are all in his debt.</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading</h2> <p><strong>AI bans in the pipeline?</strong><br>The second wave of algorithmic accountability is the basis <a href=\"https://lpeblog.org/2019/11/25/the-second-wave-of-algorithmic-accountability/\" title=\"\">of a great essay</a> by the legal scholar Frank Pasquale about how we have to think beyond the regulation of existing tech and which technologies should be banned outright.</p> <p><strong>Let\u2019s be honest...</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/special_report/building-honest-internet-public-interest.php\" title=\"\">Ethan Zuckerman of MIT writes on building a more honest internet </a>and what social media would look like if it really served the public interest and what we can do to fix it.</p> <p><strong>Deep in thought</strong><br>An <a href=\"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/\" title=\"\">innovative teaching text</a> on neural networks and deep learning by Michael Nielsen comes in the form of a free eBook.

The most distinctive thing about podcasts is the more intimate relationship between creator and listener that they enable. A radio broadcast reaches large numbers of listeners simultaneously, many of them not giving the programme their undivided attention. Most podcasts, on the other hand, are heard via headphones so the producer has a different relationship with the listener. You have to choose what you\u2019re going to hear rather than just accepting what the station transmits. And while you may be doing something else at the same time \u2013 walking, jogging, exercising, washing-up, cooking, whatever \u2013 the audio signal is no longer just background noise: it\u2019s coming straight into your ears. This means that podcasting has a higher cognitive bandwidth than broadcasting, and so can often convey more intellectually challenging ideas and content. Podcasting also reaches parts that broadcasting, despite its power, sometimes cannot reach. For example, Talking Politics, a weekly podcast created and presented by the Cambridge academic David Runciman (and on which I have occasionally been a guest), has had 10.2 million listens in 165 countries since they started keeping records in 2016, and is currently running at more than half a million listeners every month. This for a podcast that produces weekly conversations between a group of serious scholars in a range of disciplines and makes few of the concessions to the audience that a broadcast show on the same subject would be obliged to make. Another example is The Daily, the New York Times\u2019s weekday podcast, on which the host Michael Barbaro takes a news story of the day and probes it with a journalist who has broken \u2013 or worked on \u2013 the story. One of the things that surprised the Times about The Daily was that its audience has a radically different demographic from its normal readership. They\u2019re younger, for one thing; and most of them would never dream of buying a newspaper. These lessons have not been lost on other publications, not least our stablemate, the Guardian, which last month celebrated the first anniversary of Today in Focus, its daily news-based podcast. For a long time, podcasting was a hidden treasure enabled by the affordances of the technology. It was \u2013 just as blogging was \u2013 the province of enthusiasts and evangelists like Winer who did it because it was empowering, interesting, communal and fun. But now it seems to be falling prey to the same phenomenon that has bedevilled the web \u2013 the thundering herds motivated by corporate greed. In that sense, it may be subject to the pernicious cycle first noticed by Tim Wu in his landmark book, The Master Switch \u2013 in which a medium starts out gloriously free but winds up being captured and zombified by commercial interests. Podcasting certainly started out free. At the end of his first \u201caudioblog\u201d, Winer said: \u201cThe conclusion I came to was: forget about starting a business. When I started blogging, the last thing I was thinking about was how am I going to turn this into a business. I just found it interesting, then found it fascinating, then decided to just go with the flow \u2013 to keep doing it and see where it led. The only way to find out is to start doing it.\u201d So he did, and we are all in his debt. What I\u2019m reading AI bans in the pipeline? The second wave of algorithmic accountability is the basis of a great essay by the legal scholar Frank Pasquale about how we have to think beyond the regulation of existing tech and which technologies should be banned outright. Let\u2019s be honest... Ethan Zuckerman of MIT writes on building a more honest internet and what social media would look like if it really served the public interest and what we can do to fix it.

      "body": "<p>For London, Uber is not yet over. But last week\u2019s decision by the capital\u2019s transport authority to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/25/uber-loses-licence-london-tfl\" title=\"\">reject the global ride-hailing firm\u2019s application to renew its licence</a> has put its long-term prospects in doubt.</p> <p>Two years ago, Uber <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/24/uber-london-licence-transport-for-london\" title=\"\">promised to work</a> with Transport for London (TfL) to become a better service provider, and can list many positive steps taken. Yet TfL still had doubts about its security processes \u2013 doubts confirmed by revelations that 14,000 journeys were undertaken by drivers who had faked their ID on the app. Now, to the delight of the vocal black-cab lobby, London has once more told Uber that is not fit to hold a private hire licence.</p> <p>An appeals process virtually guarantees it at least another year: Uber can go on operating in the capital until every legal avenue is exhausted. And it may well be granted a licence again if it demonstrates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/26/uber-case-licence-london\" title=\"\">to a judge</a> that it has made changes. Competitors, meanwhile, are circling, eager to capture a share of the lucrative London market.</p> <p>For the 3.5 million Londoners who have downloaded Uber\u2019s app and grown used to its convenience, how do the alternative apps shape up? Here the <em>Observer </em>test-drives Uber\u2019s key rivals in the capital.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://bolt.eu/en-gb/cities/london\" title=\"\">Bolt</a></h2> <p>Founded in Estonia in 2013 (and formerly known as Taxify) this company has spread across Europe and beyond. It launched in the UK this year (after a failed attempt in 2017), operating within greater London and at airports around the capital.</p> <p><strong>USP </strong>It looks much the same as Uber, but claims to charge drivers less commission, offset all carbon emissions and still offer lower fares. Having signed up 30,000 drivers in London, it says the average waiting time for a cab is now 4.5 minutes. With 1.5 million app downloads, it appears to be emerging as a direct and serious rival to Uber.</p> <p><strong>Quick test drive</strong><strong> </strong>Quotes were cheaper \u2013 especially with generous introductory offers \u2013 in a smaller fixed range, and as quick to arrive as Uber. But will it remain sustainable? The driver was on his first trip after switching from Uber, looking to hedge his bets.</p> <h2>Kapten</h2> <p>Launched in London in May, this French firm now has about 20,000 drivers and 900,000 customers on its app.</p> <p><strong>USP</strong> It claims to have the lowest prices, with fares fixed when a booking is confirmed. Kapten also has about 1,000 electric cars in its fleet, sometimes at a discount in central London, although usually with a longer wait for the nearest one available.</p> <p><strong>Quick test drive</strong> Prices jumped at peak times, despite claims of \u201cmore sensitive\u201d and transparent surge pricing \u2013 and the base fare for a trip also seemed to vary significantly. A booked \u201celectric\u201d car also turned out be a hybrid Prius, a fairly standard choice across Uber and the rest. And when bad traffic and bad reception forced a cancellation, conflicting messages in the app warned variously of a \u00a35 fee and no charge.</p> <h2>ViaVan</h2> <p>A joint venture set up by Via \u2013 which licenses its tech for car-pooling services in the US \u2013 and Mercedes-Benz Vans, it has operated an Uber-style service in central London, since April 2018, with 1.2 million customers and more than 20,000 drivers. (It\u2019s also available in Milton Keynes.)</p> <p><strong>USP</strong> The app encourages car-pooling, with the default option being a shared ride \u2013 slightly cheaper than a private cab even if no other passengers are along. It claims to have a better algorithm that means customers will not have to endure such big detours as they do on Uber\u2019s platform.</p> <p><strong>Quick test drive</strong> Several attempts at booking saw the first vehicle offered disappear, although ViaVan lets you cancel for free if the initial wait is long. Prices were not much cheaper than Uber, even with an offer to share the ride. The actual ViaVan, when it arrived, was, again, a Prius.</p> <h2>The verdict</h2> <p>After a brief monitoring of the apps and several trips in central London Bolt seemed to emerge as a ready and serious rival to Uber. Kapten didn\u2019t quite live up to its promises, and ViaVan would be impressive if its stated ambition to drive smarter car-pooling took off and eased congestion, but that won\u2019t happen until it achieves critical mass. For now Uberpool quotes look cheaper.</p> <p>The promiscuous traveller could grab promotional deals on these other apps now, especially Bolt, but \u2013 as with early Uber \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see these fares being sustainable. Meanwhile, drivers\u2019 option to work on multiple platforms gives them more leverage and choice. For passengers, like consumers switching electricity provider, the ultimate product looks pretty much the same.</p> <p>While TfL has approved the other apps, Uber is for now the only one that flags up public transport alternatives \u2013 which are often quicker and far cheaper \u2013 in central London. After fiddling with multiple apps and frustrating waits, the idea of a bus, a walk and more cash in your pocket is pretty appealing.</p> <h2>And the also-rans</h2> <p><strong>Addison Lee</strong><br>An extensive fleet of smart private hire vehicles made this the big challenger to black cabs, pre-Uber. App offers fixed fares and future bookings.</p> <p> <strong>Free Now</strong><br>Formerly MyTaxi (which swallowed Hailo), this is an app to call traditional black cabs rather than flag one down on the street. Taxis get to go quicker on congested roads using bus lanes, and the fare difference can be erased during rivals\u2019 surge pricing. It is in eight other UK cities, including Edinburgh, Manchester and Brighton.</p> <p><strong>Gett</strong><br>Another black-cab app, with the same advantages. Fares are charged by the meter, with an electric taxi option. It\u2019s bigger in cities outside the capital.</p> <p><strong>Ola </strong><br>This Uber-style rival from India is threatening to join the turf war. It started its UK operations in south Wales but is now licensed by TfL and recruiting for a full London launch.</p>",

Yet TfL still had doubts about its security processes \u2013 doubts confirmed by revelations that 14,000 journeys were undertaken by drivers who had faked their ID on the app. Now, to the delight of the vocal black-cab lobby, London has once more told Uber that is not fit to hold a private hire licence. An appeals process virtually guarantees it at least another year: Uber can go on operating in the capital until every legal avenue is exhausted. And it may well be granted a licence again if it demonstrates to a judge that it has made changes. Competitors, meanwhile, are circling, eager to capture a share of the lucrative London market. For the 3.5 million Londoners who have downloaded Uber\u2019s app and grown used to its convenience, how do the alternative apps shape up? Here the Observer test-drives Uber\u2019s key rivals in the capital. Bolt Founded in Estonia in 2013 (and formerly known as Taxify) this company has spread across Europe and beyond. It launched in the UK this year (after a failed attempt in 2017), operating within greater London and at airports around the capital. USP It looks much the same as Uber, but claims to charge drivers less commission, offset all carbon emissions and still offer lower fares. Having signed up 30,000 drivers in London, it says the average waiting time for a cab is now 4.5 minutes. With 1.5 million app downloads, it appears to be emerging as a direct and serious rival to Uber. Quick test drive Quotes were cheaper \u2013 especially with generous introductory offers \u2013 in a smaller fixed range, and as quick to arrive as Uber. But will it remain sustainable? The driver was on his first trip after switching from Uber, looking to hedge his bets. Kapten Launched in London in May, this French firm now has about 20,000 drivers and 900,000 customers on its app. USP It claims to have the lowest prices, with fares fixed when a booking is confirmed. Kapten also has about 1,000 electric cars in its fleet, sometimes at a discount in central London, although usually with a longer wait for the nearest one available. Quick test drive Prices jumped at peak times, despite claims of \u201cmore sensitive\u201d and transparent surge pricing \u2013 and the base fare for a trip also seemed to vary significantly. A booked \u201celectric\u201d car also turned out be a hybrid Prius, a fairly standard choice across Uber and the rest. And when bad traffic and bad reception forced a cancellation, conflicting messages in the app warned variously of a \u00a35 fee and no charge. ViaVan A joint venture set up by Via \u2013 which licenses its tech for car-pooling services in the US \u2013 and Mercedes-Benz Vans, it has operated an Uber-style service in central London, since April 2018, with 1.2 million customers and more than 20,000 drivers. (It\u2019s also available in Milton Keynes.) USP The app encourages car-pooling, with the default option being a shared ride \u2013 slightly cheaper than a private cab even if no other passengers are along. It claims to have a better algorithm that means customers will not have to endure such big detours as they do on Uber\u2019s platform. Quick test drive Several attempts at booking saw the first vehicle offered disappear, although ViaVan lets you cancel for free if the initial wait is long. Prices were not much cheaper than Uber, even with an offer to share the ride. The actual ViaVan, when it arrived, was, again, a Prius. The verdict After a brief monitoring of the apps and several trips in central London Bolt seemed to emerge as a ready and serious rival to Uber. Kapten didn\u2019t quite live up to its promises, and ViaVan would be impressive if its stated ambition to drive smarter car-pooling took off and eased congestion, but that won\u2019t happen until it achieves critical mass. For now Uberpool quotes look cheaper. The promiscuous traveller could grab promotional deals on these other apps now, especially Bolt, but \u2013 as with early Uber \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see these fares being sustainable. Meanwhile, drivers\u2019 option to work on multiple platforms gives them more leverage and choice. For passengers, like consumers switching electricity provider, the ultimate product looks pretty much the same. While TfL has approved the other apps, Uber is for now the only one that flags up public transport alternatives \u2013 which are often quicker and far cheaper \u2013 in central London. After fiddling with multiple apps and frustrating waits, the idea of a bus, a walk and more cash in your pocket is pretty appealing. And the also-rans Addison Lee An extensive fleet of smart private hire vehicles made this the big challenger to black cabs, pre-Uber. App offers fixed fares and future bookings. Free Now Formerly MyTaxi (which swallowed Hailo), this is an app to call traditional black cabs rather than flag one down on the street. Taxis get to go quicker on congested roads using bus lanes, and the fare difference can be erased during rivals\u2019 surge pricing. It is in eight other UK cities, including Edinburgh, Manchester and Brighton. Gett Another black-cab app, with the same advantages. Fares are charged by the meter, with an electric taxi option. It\u2019s bigger in cities outside the capital. Ola This Uber-style rival from India is threatening to join the turf war. It started its UK operations in south Wales but is now licensed by TfL and recruiting for a full London launch.",

I will be starting a change.org petition to cast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jason-statham\" title=\"\">Jason Statham</a> as the negotiator in this deal. (I would have said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/liam-neeson\" title=\"\">Liam Neeson</a>, but, well, perhaps not this year.)</p> <p>Of course, Abrams was merely firing the starting gun on this particular whodunnit. Eventually, John Boyega had to hold his hands up and <a href=\"https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/star-wars-actor-john-boyega-admits-lost-script-67343446\" title=\"\">confess</a> that yes, it was him.</p> <p>These days spoilers are defended with a terrifying ferocity. The etiquette of when to discuss a significant plot twist online, especially in the age of streaming, is a minefield. Official channels are scarier. Abrams talked about the special \u201cuncopyable\u201d paper that the scripts were printed on. I\u2019ve spoken to actors in huge franchises who have to wear massive monastic cloaks whenever they leave their trailers, in case anyone snaps a glimpse of them in costume.</p> <p>Even lowly critics often have to sign their first born over to the devil before they\u2019re allowed to watch the opening credits of something new and buzzy.</p> <p>And yet, despite the ninth <em>Star Wars </em>probably being the most carefully guarded story of all, working hard to maintain its mysteries until release day, Boyega still managed to put all of that at risk, by leaving the script under his bed and forgetting it was there, because he\u2019d invited a few friends over and they had, as he explained, partied a little bit. I would\u2019ve loved to have heard the phone calls that took place when eBay turned up its treasure, at that bargain basement price, those furious officials knowing that all the security in the world didn\u2019t manage to stop it.</p> <p>Boyega, then, is a hero of the scatty and absent-minded, a role model for the forgetful. In a saga of man v machine, of human nature v secure technological advances, the simple human act of leaving something behind still managed to triumph.</p> <h2>Elizabeth I: the queen The Crown needs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8deeaac1e78782d4125f72e5ee1d4d8a054c11e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8deeaac1e78782d4125f72e5ee1d4d8a054c11e0/0_10_4510_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth I\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth I: scholar queen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout Bonhams</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viewers currently slogging their way through the strained third season of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/17/the-crown-series-three-review-netflix-olivia-colman\" title=\"\"><em>The Crown</em></a>, which has gone so heavy on the soap that the suds seem to have clouded its common sense and judgment, may be wishing that it might jump forward in time.</p> <p>I\u2019ll say nothing of Prince Andrew, a tactic he must wish he had employed himself, but let\u2019s at least get to the Diana, Princess of Wales era, if not for the drama, then for the iconic fashion.

In what must be one of the rare cases of a poetry podcast setting the news agenda, the spoken word artist, real name George Mpanga, explained, through conversations with actors playing Uganda and Britain, that he had been offered the honour and then discussed why he had ultimately decided to reject it. \u201cThe colonial trauma inflicted on the children of Africa, entrenched across our geopolitical and macroeconomic realities, prevents me from accepting the title, Member of the British Empire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gesture is deeply appreciated. The wording is not.\u201d</p> <p>There was a minor, ill-considered backlash to his decision, a few grumbling phone-ins to news programmes and a few tone-deaf tweets, but anyone who has heard the podcast will know that he had already countered their arguments with far more eloquence than some of those responses deserved. \u201cI love this country but I do so with transparency,\u201d he said. He also apologised to the friend who put him forward for it, when he initially thought he might accept it, in order to make his parents proud.</p> <p>Though people have many reasons for declining a title, it always gives me a thrill to know that someone has had the strength and gumption to stand up to the establishment and say thank you, but not for me. In 2003, when Tony Blair put Benjamin Zephaniah forward for an OBE, Zephaniah wrote an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/27/poetry.monarchy\" title=\"\">article for the <em>Guardian</em></a> arguing along similar lines to Mpanga: \u201cI am profoundly anti-empire,\u201d he said. Others who have reportedly said no include Danny Boyle, Stephen Hawking, Ken Loach and David Bowie. Just imagine having that lot round for dinner.</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist</p>",

I want to, but I won\u2019t,\u201d said Abrams, settling into the role of \u201cdad \u2013 not mad, just disappointed\u201d. The unnamed actor had left a script under their bed, it was taken by a cleaner, given to another person, then put on eBay for \u00a365, where it was spotted by a Disney official and ultimately reclaimed. This was a plot that had everything. This was a script I would pay \u00a365 for on an internet shopping forum. I will be starting a change.org petition to cast Jason Statham as the negotiator in this deal. (I would have said Liam Neeson, but, well, perhaps not this year.) Of course, Abrams was merely firing the starting gun on this particular whodunnit. Eventually, John Boyega had to hold his hands up and confess that yes, it was him. These days spoilers are defended with a terrifying ferocity. The etiquette of when to discuss a significant plot twist online, especially in the age of streaming, is a minefield. Official channels are scarier. Abrams talked about the special \u201cuncopyable\u201d paper that the scripts were printed on. I\u2019ve spoken to actors in huge franchises who have to wear massive monastic cloaks whenever they leave their trailers, in case anyone snaps a glimpse of them in costume. Even lowly critics often have to sign their first born over to the devil before they\u2019re allowed to watch the opening credits of something new and buzzy. And yet, despite the ninth Star Wars probably being the most carefully guarded story of all, working hard to maintain its mysteries until release day, Boyega still managed to put all of that at risk, by leaving the script under his bed and forgetting it was there, because he\u2019d invited a few friends over and they had, as he explained, partied a little bit. I would\u2019ve loved to have heard the phone calls that took place when eBay turned up its treasure, at that bargain basement price, those furious officials knowing that all the security in the world didn\u2019t manage to stop it. Boyega, then, is a hero of the scatty and absent-minded, a role model for the forgetful. In a saga of man v machine, of human nature v secure technological advances, the simple human act of leaving something behind still managed to triumph. Elizabeth I: the queen The Crown needs Viewers currently slogging their way through the strained third season of The Crown, which has gone so heavy on the soap that the suds seem to have clouded its common sense and judgment, may be wishing that it might jump forward in time. I\u2019ll say nothing of Prince Andrew, a tactic he must wish he had employed himself, but let\u2019s at least get to the Diana, Princess of Wales era, if not for the drama, then for the iconic fashion. It might be more fruitful, however, for the series to leap back in time and news that Claire Foy will be temporarily reprising her role as Young Liz for a flashback appears to confirm that we\u2019re all on the same page. We need to go back centuries, not decades, however. Elizabeth I has been making headlines after she was revealed as the secret author of a 42-page manuscript, a translation of Tacitus\u2019s writings from his history of the Roman empire. Dramatising this incredible intellectual feat would mean we\u2019d miss out on the one true joy of the current Crown \u2013 Helena Bonham Carter playing drunk Princess Margaret \u2013 but it would be an improvement, at least, on those awkward chats with Harold Wilson. George the Poet: rhyme and reason for refusing MBE On the latest edition of his award-winning BBC podcast, Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast?, George the Poet revealed that he turned down an MBE earlier this year. In what must be one of the rare cases of a poetry podcast setting the news agenda, the spoken word artist, real name George Mpanga, explained, through conversations with actors playing Uganda and Britain, that he had been offered the honour and then discussed why he had ultimately decided to reject it. \u201cThe colonial trauma inflicted on the children of Africa, entrenched across our geopolitical and macroeconomic realities, prevents me from accepting the title, Member of the British Empire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gesture is deeply appreciated. The wording is not.\u201d There was a minor, ill-considered backlash to his decision, a few grumbling phone-ins to news programmes and a few tone-deaf tweets, but anyone who has heard the podcast will know that he had already countered their arguments with far more eloquence than some of those responses deserved. \u201cI love this country but I do so with transparency,\u201d he said. He also apologised to the friend who put him forward for it, when he initially thought he might accept it, in order to make his parents proud. Though people have many reasons for declining a title, it always gives me a thrill to know that someone has had the strength and gumption to stand up to the establishment and say thank you, but not for me. In 2003, when Tony Blair put Benjamin Zephaniah forward for an OBE, Zephaniah wrote an article for the Guardian arguing along similar lines to Mpanga: \u201cI am profoundly anti-empire,\u201d he said. Others who have reportedly said no include Danny Boyle, Stephen Hawking, Ken Loach and David Bowie. Just imagine having that lot round for dinner. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

The Middle Eastern music was incredible. The pace of the show was deliberately slow. When I\u2019m doing shows I\u2019m all over the cast about going faster all the time: this was an eye-opener for me, to see how bold it was with the restraint around that.

      "bodyText": "Born in Dublin in 1971, playwright, director and screenwriter Conor McPherson studied at University College Dublin and co-founded Fly By Night Theatre Company in the early 90s. His plays include the Olivier award-winning The Weir, the Tony-nominated Shining City and The Seafarer and The Night Alive. He also wrote and created the 2017 BBC series Paula starring Denise Gough. His critically acclaimed production Girl from the North Country is at London\u2019s Gielgud theatre from 10 December to 1 February; his adaptation of Uncle Vanya will be at the Harold Pinter theatre from 14 January. 1. Gig Weyes Blood at the Button Factory, Dublin I first heard her voice on Father John Misty\u2019s God\u2019s Favorite Customer \u2013 I immediately thought \u201cOh, who\u2019s that?\u201d and got her previous albums. I was thrilled to see she was coming to Dublin. I and my wife went along to see her, and we were saying: \u201cDo you think she can possibly be as good as she is on her albums live?\u201d But within the first few minutes, we knew we were in the presence of the real thing \u2013 if anything, she\u2019s even better live. Every single moment was sung to perfection. It does your heart good to see somebody that talented. 2. Theatre The Band\u2019s Visit at Ed Mirvish theatre, Toronto I\u2019m not a big aficionado of musicals, but this was original and refreshing. It\u2019s about a police band from Egypt who go to Israel to play at a music festival, but end up in the wrong town and have to stay overnight in people\u2019s houses. The Middle Eastern music was incredible. The pace of the show was deliberately slow. When I\u2019m doing shows I\u2019m all over the cast about going faster all the time: this was an eye-opener for me, to see how bold it was with the restraint around that. It never felt needy; it just let the audience come to it. 3. Album Bob Dylan, The Bootleg Series Vol 15 Every year or so they release bootlegs of Bob Dylan outtakes and rehearsals. This is the latest: it covers 1967-9, a year after he made Blonde on Blonde and became the biggest singer in the world. He\u2019s doing his album John Wesley Harding, which is so stripped back, almost penitential and biblical, and the next one is Nashville Skyline, where he goes straight back to the basics of country music. He does a lot of rehearsals on this album with Johnny Cash, and it\u2019s amazing to hear how deferential Bob Dylan is to him. 4. Documentary Amazing Grace In 1972, Aretha Franklin went to LA and recorded two nights of gospel music with the Southern California Community Choir; the album became the biggest-selling gospel album of all time. Sydney Pollack filmed these two nights but didn\u2019t put any clapper boards on the takes, which meant they couldn\u2019t sync up the sound and the pictures. So the film lay in a vault until earlier this year. It\u2019s visceral, and moving; Aretha Franklin seems so humble \u2013 you can tell she\u2019s not doing a concert: she\u2019s in church, so she\u2019s praying with these songs, really. 5. Place D\u00fan Laoghaire East Pier, Dublin I walk this pier every day: it\u2019s about one-and-a-half kilometres long and stretches out into the sea. Walking out there is incredibly therapeutic: it always helps if you\u2019re trying to think about writing or ideas.

Film Midsommar (Ari Aster, 2019) Ari Aster has made two standout movies so far: Hereditary, which caused a big stir, and this. He\u2019s in that tradition of William Friedkin, Roman Polanski and Stanley Kubrick, who all made horror movies that were also genuinely great dramas. Midsommar is about a group of students: there\u2019s Jack Reynor and Florence Pugh \u2013 her performance is fantastic \u2013 whose character is grieving for her family.

A 2014 definition from <em>Urban Dictionary</em> notes, sadly: \u201cShe believes her experiences to be crazy, wild, and different, or somehow more special than everything that everybody else is doing, when really, almost everyone is doing or has done the exact same thing.\u201d Sales had fallen by 31% and it was official that the Ugg had become the shoe for the stalwart who didn\u2019t like change.</p> <p><em><strong>But recently something</strong></em> miraculous has been happening. In October, the <a href=\"http://lyst.co.uk\">Lyst</a> report, which analyses the shopping habits of millions of shoppers, found that Uggs had seen a 350% increase in searches over the year. And, even more shockingly, a good percentage of those searches were from men. Last year, the men\u2019s branch of the business made more than $200m, while this year the company estimate sales of their men\u2019s range will make up 13% of its total revenue.</p> <p>It\u2019s a long way from their purple patch when Uggs were exclusively worn by celebrity men \u201cgoing through some bad stuff\u201d. Who could forget the sight of a sad-looking Ben Affleck wearing them on set, Ronnie Wood stepping out in a black pair looking like an ASBO teen, or Leonardo DiCaprio wearing them with a purple velour onesie like some regional Prince tribute act? At that time, the many memes that existed (one simply stating: \u201cUggs for men. No\u201d) pivoted around ideas of masculinity.</p> <p>Their resurgence has been surprising, because in a world of sturdy Red Wing boots or Colorado tan Caterpillars, there\u2019s something flat about Uggs. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction against the structured boot that\u2019s become a staple of a man\u2019s winter wardrobe,\u201d thinks <em>GQ</em> columnist <a href=\"https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/profile/the-guyliner\" title=\"\">Justin Myers</a>, aka The Guyliner.</p> <p>In the years since the Ugg was at its peak, the silhouette in men\u2019s fashion has gone from pencil thin and tight to David Byrne-wide and expansive, and so it would make sense that as your trousers and coat get bigger, so too do your shoes. \u201cFashion is heading slouchier,\u201d explains Myers, \u201cand if wearing a boot that shares DNA with a bean bag is how to achieve that, who am I to argue?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cafcec4e96f728e08b12b50455b853c7063e368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cafcec4e96f728e08b12b50455b853c7063e368/0_63_2379_2974/800.jpg\" alt=\"Best foot forward: Britney Spears and niece Lexie in 2015.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best foot forward: Britney Spears and niece Lexie in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GoffPhotos.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, the aesthetic appeal (or non-appeal) of the Ugg is something that astounds him. \u201cI\u2019m surprised anyone would be desperate to seek out something so wilfully ugly,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that Ugg\u2019s sheepskin boots and slip-ons are having a bit of a men\u2019s moment, which seems to be driven by an \u2018anything goes\u2019 style,\u201d agrees <em>Esquire</em>\u2019s style director, <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/author/5809/jonathan-evans/\" title=\"\">Jonathan Evans</a>.</p> <p>In a world where the Croc and Birkenstock have gone haute, <a href=\"https://www.maisonmargiela.com/gb/maison-margiela/women/tabi\" title=\"\">Margiela\u2019s cloven-hooved shoes</a> exist and the heeled flip-flop is worn by Kim Kardashian, Katie Holmes and Rihanna, perhaps the return of the Ugg isn\u2019t so weird after all.</p> <p>It also helps that the shoe is firmly associated with a time, about 15 years ago, when pumpkin spiced latte was considered edgy. Nostalgia is at a premium at the moment (hiya, J-Lo at the Versace show wearing her old dress, or Marc Jacobs, Celine and Balmain referencing their own halcyonic eras).</p> <p>\u201cNostalgic fashion is so popular \u2013 especially now \u2013 because it\u2019s more than just a piece of clothing,\u201d says fashion writer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kbousq/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kristen Bousquet</a>. \u201cMany of these pieces may remind you of something from your childhood or a photo of your mum that you loved from the 60s.\u201d Myers isn\u2019t convinced that this embrace of nostalgic fashion is welcomed equally by both genders. \u201cMen take more convincing; need easing in gently,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are reluctant to look in their mirror and see their father staring back at them.\u201d</p> <p>The Ugg comeback for both sexes has been coming for a while. They drafted in Jeff Daniels and Mr Gisele, Tom Brady, in 2016 for an ad featuring The Dude strumming a guitar while Brady napped on a sofa, both wearing Uggs. It was luxe lounging for the whisky and Bon Iver crowd. A year later, in 2017, Cardi B announced that it was \u201cofficially Ugg season\u201d on Instagram and Heron Preston, a mate of Virgil Abloh, captioned his Ugg boot-wearing Instagram with: \u201cWe not playing games no more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0b8929d472697f40190d0573c0db414b7fed5670\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b8929d472697f40190d0573c0db414b7fed5670/0_449_5917_7392/800.jpg\" alt=\"Uggwardly mobile: Priya Elan.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Uggwardly mobile: Priya Elan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walking through a railway station one morning, I\u2019m struck by some huge, brightly coloured posters for the latest Ugg campaign (shockingly subtitled: \u201cUgglife\u201d); there\u2019s Slick Woods breastfeeding her baby and Ama Elsesser cradling her sister, Paloma. I go online and see the other stars of their ad campaign: Luka Sabbat and his dad, Kim Gordon and daughter Coco together. They\u2019re slick and well shot.</p> <p>\u201cI think part of the resurgence has to be partnerships,\u201d says <em>Esquire</em>\u2019s Evans, \u201cwhether that\u2019s a collaboration like the one the brand did with Bape this year, or on the marketing side with someone like Lil Wayne, who modelled that collection.\u201d</p> <p>I notice the men\u2019s shoes. They don\u2019t look like old sacks; in fact, they don\u2019t look like the traditional Uggs. So the success story behind Uggs for men is making shoes that don\u2019t look like Uggs at all. Despite being called \u201cthe male version of the classic Ugg\u201d by VP of marketing Ian Stewart, their most popular men\u2019s shoe, <a href=\"https://www.ugg.com/uk/mens-neumel-lace-up-casual-shoes/3236.html\" title=\"\">the Neumel</a>, looks more like a chunky desert boot. He says they have been targeting the hip-hop and sports communities, so shifting the association with yoga pants for ever.</p> <p>I ask him what he\u2019d say to a potential male buyer. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t experienced them before, I say, \u2018When you put them on it\u2019s not like anything you\u2019ve felt before\u2026 in footwear,\u201d he says breathlessly. I feel slightly uncomfortable with his level of evangelical spiel about the Ugg, but I also feel like, perhaps I should forgive them for being crap in the noughties. Would I ever buy a pair I wonder? \u201cGo Ugg yourself,\u201d I say to myself silently.</p>",

At that time, the many memes that existed (one simply stating: \u201cUggs for men. No\u201d) pivoted around ideas of masculinity. Their resurgence has been surprising, because in a world of sturdy Red Wing boots or Colorado tan Caterpillars, there\u2019s something flat about Uggs. \u201cIt\u2019s a reaction against the structured boot that\u2019s become a staple of a man\u2019s winter wardrobe,\u201d thinks GQ columnist Justin Myers, aka The Guyliner. In the years since the Ugg was at its peak, the silhouette in men\u2019s fashion has gone from pencil thin and tight to David Byrne-wide and expansive, and so it would make sense that as your trousers and coat get bigger, so too do your shoes. \u201cFashion is heading slouchier,\u201d explains Myers, \u201cand if wearing a boot that shares DNA with a bean bag is how to achieve that, who am I to argue?\u201d Still, the aesthetic appeal (or non-appeal) of the Ugg is something that astounds him. \u201cI\u2019m surprised anyone would be desperate to seek out something so wilfully ugly,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that Ugg\u2019s sheepskin boots and slip-ons are having a bit of a men\u2019s moment, which seems to be driven by an \u2018anything goes\u2019 style,\u201d agrees Esquire\u2019s style director, Jonathan Evans. In a world where the Croc and Birkenstock have gone haute, Margiela\u2019s cloven-hooved shoes exist and the heeled flip-flop is worn by Kim Kardashian, Katie Holmes and Rihanna, perhaps the return of the Ugg isn\u2019t so weird after all. It also helps that the shoe is firmly associated with a time, about 15 years ago, when pumpkin spiced latte was considered edgy. Nostalgia is at a premium at the moment (hiya, J-Lo at the Versace show wearing her old dress, or Marc Jacobs, Celine and Balmain referencing their own halcyonic eras). \u201cNostalgic fashion is so popular \u2013 especially now \u2013 because it\u2019s more than just a piece of clothing,\u201d says fashion writer Kristen Bousquet. \u201cMany of these pieces may remind you of something from your childhood or a photo of your mum that you loved from the 60s.\u201d Myers isn\u2019t convinced that this embrace of nostalgic fashion is welcomed equally by both genders. \u201cMen take more convincing; need easing in gently,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are reluctant to look in their mirror and see their father staring back at them.\u201d The Ugg comeback for both sexes has been coming for a while. They drafted in Jeff Daniels and Mr Gisele, Tom Brady, in 2016 for an ad featuring The Dude strumming a guitar while Brady napped on a sofa, both wearing Uggs. It was luxe lounging for the whisky and Bon Iver crowd. A year later, in 2017, Cardi B announced that it was \u201cofficially Ugg season\u201d on Instagram and Heron Preston, a mate of Virgil Abloh, captioned his Ugg boot-wearing Instagram with: \u201cWe not playing games no more.\u201d Walking through a railway station one morning, I\u2019m struck by some huge, brightly coloured posters for the latest Ugg campaign (shockingly subtitled: \u201cUgglife\u201d); there\u2019s Slick Woods breastfeeding her baby and Ama Elsesser cradling her sister, Paloma. I go online and see the other stars of their ad campaign: Luka Sabbat and his dad, Kim Gordon and daughter Coco together. They\u2019re slick and well shot. \u201cI think part of the resurgence has to be partnerships,\u201d says Esquire\u2019s Evans, \u201cwhether that\u2019s a collaboration like the one the brand did with Bape this year, or on the marketing side with someone like Lil Wayne, who modelled that collection.\u201d I notice the men\u2019s shoes. They don\u2019t look like old sacks; in fact, they don\u2019t look like the traditional Uggs. So the success story behind Uggs for men is making shoes that don\u2019t look like Uggs at all. Despite being called \u201cthe male version of the classic Ugg\u201d by VP of marketing Ian Stewart, their most popular men\u2019s shoe, the Neumel, looks more like a chunky desert boot. He says they have been targeting the hip-hop and sports communities, so shifting the association with yoga pants for ever. I ask him what he\u2019d say to a potential male buyer. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t experienced them before, I say, \u2018When you put them on it\u2019s not like anything you\u2019ve felt before\u2026 in footwear,\u201d he says breathlessly. I feel slightly uncomfortable with his level of evangelical spiel about the Ugg, but I also feel like, perhaps I should forgive them for being crap in the noughties. Would I ever buy a pair I wonder? \u201cGo Ugg yourself,\u201d I say to myself silently.",

The defensive organisation is key. We\u2019d love to be a bit more fancy going the other way, but for what we\u2019ve got at the moment, it suits us. The front three, even though they don\u2019t score, they carry a threat. We have to be better and more clinical, but we\u2019ve scored a couple of wonderful goals. We\u2019ve now got a big game against Sheffield United, so we\u2019ll get ready for that.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5de27c838f087410d9875b53\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-30T14:32:08.438Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newcastle move up to 12th place, on 16 points, and are now six unbeaten at St James\u2019 Park. </strong>Whisper it, but the initially unpopular Steve Bruce is doing a fine job.

But they\u2019ll be back down to third tomorrow if Leicester City avoid defeat at home to Everton ... and more importantly, they only managed to close the gap on leaders Liverpool by one point. Should Liverpool beat Brighton at Anfield later this afternoon, that gap will be 11 points.

And thanks for reading this MBM. Steve Bruce talks to BT Sport. \u201cWe were terrific in their work and attitude. It\u2019s always going to be difficult. And you need your keeper to make a few saves. And then you need that resilience, because the way they move the ball, they\u2019re a fantastic team. The defensive organisation is key. We\u2019d love to be a bit more fancy going the other way, but for what we\u2019ve got at the moment, it suits us. The front three, even though they don\u2019t score, they carry a threat. We have to be better and more clinical, but we\u2019ve scored a couple of wonderful goals. We\u2019ve now got a big game against Sheffield United, so we\u2019ll get ready for that.\u201d Newcastle move up to 12th place, on 16 points, and are now six unbeaten at St James\u2019 Park. Whisper it, but the initially unpopular Steve Bruce is doing a fine job. He\u2019ll be winning the Toon Army over at this rate. City meanwhile move into second, ahead of Leicester on goal difference. But they\u2019ll be back down to third tomorrow if Leicester City avoid defeat at home to Everton ... and more importantly, they only managed to close the gap on leaders Liverpool by one point. Should Liverpool beat Brighton at Anfield later this afternoon, that gap will be 11 points. No wonder Pep Guardiola disappeared down the tunnel quicksmart, with a look of concern on his face. Jonjo Shelvey, who has just done his old club a favour, speaks to BT Sport: \u201cWe thought we deserved a point. They keep the ball so well and move it about, but a point is probably a fair result in the end. Against them, it\u2019s always going to be difficult. We needed to bounce back after Monday night, and to give a good account of ourselves shows we\u2019ve got a bit of spirit about us. I might be a hero in Liverpool right now! But no, this is about us, and we need to get as many points on the board as possible to guarantee safety at this football club.\u201d Newcastle hang on! And what a finish that was! Kevin De Bruyne looked to have won all three points for the champions with a wonder strike ... only for Jonjo Shelvey to equalise with a sensational effort of his own. And so City move into second place, eight behind Liverpool ... but the leaders can build on their lead this afternoon if they beat Brighton. Not that anything in this league is certain. 90 min +4: De Bruyne nearly breaks clear down the left, but Fernandez holds firm. Newcastle are hanging on. 90 min +3: City can\u2019t get anything going, and time is running out. 90 min +2: De Bruyne glides in from the left and curls a glorious cross towards Sterling, in space just to the right of goal in the box. Sterling shoots, but doesn\u2019t really catch it. Dubravka gathers brilliantly, with Silva waiting to tap anything loose into the net. What a chance! 90 min +1: The first of four added minutes goes by without incident. 90 min: Two sensational goals. City need to go again for a winner. De Bruyne hooks a free kick into the box from the left. It\u2019s sent out for a throw on the right. In the stand, a Newcastle fan in a Peaky Blinders cap refuses to hand the ball back to City in the pantomime style. Eventually he flings it back into the field of play, and sits down looking extremely pleased with his afternoon\u2019s work. No, Newcastle aren\u2019t spent at all! And anything Kevin De Bruyne can do, Jonjo Shelvey can match! Atsu pulls the free kick back to Shelvey, 25 yards out, just to the right of centre. Shelvey keeps his head down, and launches a stunning first-time shot into the top left! Ederson had no chance whatsoever! 87 min: Or do they? Manquillo romps down the right and is cynically barged to the floor by Fernandinho, already on a yellow. No second card, but it is a free kick, just to the right of the area. 86 min: Mendy wins a corner off Manquillo down the left. De Bruyne takes. The ball drops to Fernandinho, on the edge of the area. He whistles a volley inches over the bar. Newcastle, having fought so hard for so long, suddenly look spent. 84 min: Pep immediately goes into keep-what-we-have mode. Rodri comes on for Jesus. 83 min: Newcastle will argue that Gayle was shoved to the floor by Bernardo Silva in the build-up. They might have a point; they might not. One of those, really. Either way, take nothing from the strike. What a goal by De Bruyne! City\u2019s star man stepping up to the plate, just when things were getting a little desperate. Seems it\u2019s not only Liverpool who can pop up with the important late goals! What a goal this is! De Bruyne chests down a clearing header, lets the ball drop, and launches a heatseeker into the top left from the edge of the box! That was an absolute stunner! Kompanyesque! 81 min: Saint-Maximin has hurt himself with that gymnastic display. He\u2019s replaced by Atsu. 79 min: Shelvey loops a long ball down the inside left. Saint-Maximin goes haring after it. He\u2019s in a footrace with Walker, who heads back to Ederson and shoulder-charges Saint-Maximin off the ball. Saint-Maximin executes an Olympic-standard quadruple roll, but he\u2019s not getting the penalty he wants. 77 min: Foden tees up De Bruyne, 25 yards out. De Bruyne drops a shoulder and shoots, but Clark throws his body in the road and that\u2019s a corner. Stones meets the corner but stumbles in doing so, the ball harmlessly clanking out for a goal kick. 75 min: Almiron knocks the ball past Mendy and tears off after it. He\u2019s cynically charged out of play by Mendy, who isn\u2019t looking at the ball at all. But Newcastle don\u2019t get the decision, and soon Sterling is running at them down the left. He wins a corner, which thankfully for those who get easily bored by confected controversy, comes to nothing. 73 min: Manquillo is booked for taking his own sweet time over a throw. 72 min: Walker storms down the right and hooks into the box for Foden, who mistimes a downward header from eight yards. Newcastle hack clear. City come again, and after some bagatelle on the edge of the box, the ball breaks to Bernardo Silva, free on the penalty spot! Silva drags his first-time shot wide right, a dismal effort. 70 min: Pep has seen enough. He makes a double sub, taking off Riyad Mahrez and David Silva and sending on Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden. Newcastle meanwhile swap Joelinton for Dwight Gayle. 68 min: They\u2019re stepping it up now. A few passes pinged around. Silva suddenly slips a pass down the inside left to release Jesus into the box. Jesus should score, but Dubravka shapes like a star and blocks brilliantly. De Bruyne follows up, smashing the rebound goalwards, but that one\u2019s stopped by the keeper too! The resulting corner comes to nothing, and Newcastle breathe again. 67 min: Much better from City, as Walker finds De Bruyne down the right. He storms towards the byline and bashes across the face of goal, where Jesus lurks. But Dubravka kicks clear. The closest the champions have come to opening Newcastle up in quite a while. 66 min: Saint-Maximin drops a shoulder and makes his way past Walker on the left. He crosses low, hoping to find Joelinton, but Fernandinho is well placed and not having it. 65 min: Jesus and Sterling one-two cutely down the middle, and nearly open up Newcastle just inside the box. But Manquillo slides in to block, and the ball rolls harmlessly through to Dubravka. 64 min: Mendy, out on the left, blooters a cross out of play on the right, with plenty of City players standing in threatening positions in the box. On the touchline, Guardiola prowls around, a frown creasing his brow. Plenty to think about here. Dubravka hasn\u2019t had too many saves to make today. 62 min: Manquillo drives down a cul-de-sac on the right. It had been a promising attack, with Almiron in close attendance, but City close it down. Newcastle are predominantly a defensive concern today, but they\u2019re looking to attack wherever possible. 60 min: \u201cCome on City,\u201d their fans chant. They know their side, already trailing Liverpool by nine points, can\u2019t afford to drop a couple more today. 58 min: Almiron drives in from the right and tries a curler towards the top left. Miles off. A desperate attempt, in more ways than one. He\u2019s yet to score for Newcastle; there\u2019s a big weight on his shoulders. 57 min: Silva dribbles down the inside left, reaches the byline, and stands one up to the far post. Jesus tries to bundle it in, but he can\u2019t quite reach it. Goal kick, though Dubravka was worried for a second there. 56 min: Sterling dribbles down the left with great panache, but he\u2019s crowded out, and the ball squirts through to Dubravka. 55 min: De Bruyne eases infield from the left, and batters a rising shot towards the top right. Had it been on target, the net was coming off the frame of the goal, and the goal of the season competition would be over. As it was, a fine effort jets high and wide, but not by much at all. 54 min: Shelvey drags an overly ambitious free kick wide left. Ederson yawns. 53 min: Fernandez channels his inner Franz, stepping up from the back in an extremely statesmanlike style. A sensational Beckenbaueresque run, and suddenly Newcastle are on the break! Fernandez makes it past a few challenges, enters the City half, and rolls a ball down the middle for Joelinton, who is cynically brought down by Fernandinho before he can power towards goal. Fernandinho is booked, and it\u2019s a free kick in a central position, 30 yards out. 51 min: De Bruyne glides down the right and nearly finds Jesus in the middle. Just a corner. From the set piece, Mendy crashes a shot goalwards. It pinballs around, and slaps a Newcastle player on the arm. City claim for a penalty but they\u2019re never getting one for that. 50 min: Saint-Maximin raises the volume again, skipping down the left in a very elegant fashion. He crosses to nobody in particular. Mercurial doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. 49 min: Walker slides a pass down the right channel for Jesus, who threatens to spin Dummett on the edge of the box. But before he can execute the skill, the flag goes up. He\u2019d come back from an offside position. 47 min: Newcastle appear to be similarly minded, though. Almiron busies himself down the right, flicking the ball from a tight spot to Joelinton with no little skill. The move peters out and that\u2019ll be a goal kick, but the hosts have now made a statement of intent too. City - kept waiting on the pitch awhile by the hosts - finally get the second half underway. Neither side have made a half-time change. While City were left hanging around, Pep took the opportunity to remind David Silva to raise the tempo. City were uncharacteristically ponderous in the first half. And Mendy\u2019s on the charge immediately, racing down the left and whipping in a cross. No success this time, but there\u2019s a statement of intent. Half-time entertainment ... courtesy of Sunderland\u2019s favourite son. You\u2019re welcome. De Bruyne shoots from the edge of the box. The ball\u2019s blocked, and loops into the air. Dubravka plucks it from the sky, and that\u2019s your lot for the first half. The hosts troop off, pleased with their work. City look a little pensive. No doubt they\u2019ll come out flying in 15 minutes. 45 min: Hayden crosses from a deep position on the right. Stones\u2019 clearing header is dreadful, falling straight to Almiron, just inside the box on the left. Almiron, yet to score for his new club, drops a shoulder, shifts the ball to the right ... but instead of shooting, loses control haplessly. Confidence in short supply. 43 min: Shelvey wins a 50-50 ball in the centre circle and feeds Joelinton, who hooks wide left for Almiron. A lot of grass ahead of him. Almiron looks up, sees there\u2019s nobody in the box for him to find, and sends the ball in there anyway. A waste of a decent position. Very poor. 42 min: Mahrez makes himself a bit of space on the right, but his chipped cross has way too much weight, and sails over the heads of everyone in the box. In the dugout, Pep looks pained as he gulps enigmatically on a bottle of water. 40 min: It\u2019s attack versus defence again. Sterling sails down the left, cuts infield and crosses. Clark clears with a textbook diving header. Keith Houchen would be proud. But Joelinton, the only Newcastle player upfield, can\u2019t hold the ball up to bring a team-mate into play. The ball\u2019s coming straight back at the hosts, again and again. 38 min: Gundogan attempts to release Jesus down the inside-right channel with an incisive diagonal pass. But the ball\u2019s too heavy, and sails out for a goal kick. Gundogan claims for a deflection and a corner, but the flag\u2019s gone up for offside anyway. A little bit of City frustration leaking out. 36 min: Saint-Maximin zips down the right wing. A few tricks in the hope of getting past Mendy and Fernandinho. They don\u2019t quite come off, but the Toon Army were off their seats there. He\u2019s a born entertainer. 35 min: City are pressing Newcastle back again. Sterling, Mendy, Jesus and Silva are causing all manner of bother down the left channel. Newcastle hold their shape, just about, but some last-ditch clearances are being made as City ping it around in the assured style. 33 min: Mendy races down the left and gives the ball to Sterling, who shimmies along the edge of the box, left to right, before launching a shot goalwards. Dubravka parries and, after a fan-worrying fashion, smothers. 31 min: Silva has a shot from the edge of the box. Blocked. Newcastle stream up the other end, Saint-Maximin leading the charge. He feeds Almiron, who can\u2019t pick a pass. The move breaks down. City are still on top, and look the more likely to score next. But Newcastle are playing with verve and confidence on the occasions they go forward, too. 29 min: City attempt to reassert their authority, Jesus scuttling down the right and fizzing a low cross into the mixer. There\u2019s nobody in blue waiting to prod home, though, and Clark is able to clear. 27 min: Shelvey swings a cross in from the right. Hayden challenges for the ball, forcing Stones to slash it out hysterically for a corner. Nothing comes from the set piece, but Newcastle have their tails up now. This is a lovely goal. Willems rolls a pass down the inside-left channel for Almiron, who flicks it back to the left-back. Willems takes a touch inside, and threads a lovely curling shot into the bottom right! Ederson, at full stretch, had no chance. And that\u2019s Almiron\u2019s first assist in a Toon shirt! 24 min: Saint-Maximin bursts past a couple of City shirts and is cynically clipped by Gundogan. The midfielder is booked, his fifth yellow card of the season, and he\u2019ll be suspended for the visit to Burnley. The pressure on Newcastle finally tells. A bit of pinball in the box, instigated by Sterling and Silva bustling down the inside left. Silva falls, but manages to guide the ball to Sterling with a cute flick of his heel, some class amid the melee. Sterling is suddenly free in a pocket of space on the penalty spot, and slams an unstoppable effort into the bottom right. 20 min: Newcastle load the box. Shelvey tries to catch Ederson off guard, whipping a low curler towards the bottom left. It\u2019s always heading wide, and the keeper would have had it covered anyway. 19 min: Dummett hoicks a pass down the left for Saint-Maximin. Ederson comes haring out of his box and heads out for a throw. He only just made it before the Newcastle man. Perfectly timed, but there would have been a few City hearts in mouths there. From the throw, De Bruyne clips Saint-Maximin, and this will be a free kick in a dangerous position, just to the left of the box. Shelvey\u2019s eyes light up. 18 min: De Bruyne slips a ball down the inside-right channel and into the box. Jesus reaches it, to the right of the goal, and backflicks in the hope of teeing up Mahrez. Not quite, but it\u2019s a corner. And that corner leads to another, which leads to Fernandinho heading over the bar. A good chance that, and not too far away. 16 min: Almiron strides out of defence with purpose, channelling his inner Beckenbauer as he sways up the middle, ignoring challenges, into a pocket of space. City are light at the back, but get away with it as Almiron asks too much of Joelinton with a pass down the right. Fernandinho refuses to be beaten for pace. 14 min: City ping it about metronomically, almost lulling Newcastle into a false sense of security as they make no attempt to go anywhere. But suddenly they turn it up a bit, De Bruyne striding down the right and whipping a low ball along the corridor of uncertainty. Dummett is forced to hack behind for a corner. Stones heads the set piece weakly wide right. 12 min: Newcastle have only enjoyed 18 percent possession so far. It could be a long day ... although they haven\u2019t been tested seriously at the back yet, and they\u2019ve had a couple of sorties upfield. Steve Bruce will be happy enough with this start. 10 min: Saint-Maximin sashays down the left at great speed, gliding infield and teeing up Almiron, 25 yards out. Almiron considers a shot, but instead switches to Manquillo on the right wing. Bad choice, as it turns out, because Manquillo blams a lumpen cross through the box and away from danger. 8 min: Joelinton nicks the ball off a dawdling Fernandinho, out on the right. He looks to scoop a pass across to Saint-Maximin, but Mendy gets in the road. Just as well, because Newcastle would have been off there. This is much better from the hosts. 7 min: The volume in St James\u2019 Park suddenly cranks up to 11, as Saint-Maximin is sent scampering into some space down the left. He\u2019s exciting to watch. He drifts infield and takes Newcastle\u2019s first shot in anger. Actually it\u2019s not so much angry as a bit miffed; he sends a pea-roller towards the bottom left, and it\u2019s easily gathered by Ederson. 6 min: Silva and Jesus nearly open up Newcastle down the inside-left channel, but Clark intervenes to hook clear. 5 min: Gundogan takes a speculative whack from 25 yards. It bobbles through to Dubravka. City aren\u2019t exactly rampant ... yet ... but they are well on top. 4 min: Newcastle have hardly touched the ball. Mahrez drops a shoulder and nearly skates past Willems, but the defender stands firm. Saint-Maximin tries to dribble away from Newcastle\u2019s final third but is abruptly stripped of possession. It\u2019s tough for the hosts right now. 2 min: De Bruyne sprays an outside-of-the-boot pass towards Mendy on the left touchline. Glorious ... or nearly glorious. Mendy can\u2019t quite keep it in play. Had he done so, he\u2019d have been haring off into acres of space. And we\u2019re off! Newcastle get the ball rolling on a cold day in the north. The ball\u2019s launched long. Saint-Maximin can\u2019t get on the end of it, and City are in possession almost immediately. A long ball for Mahrez, but he\u2019s offside. The clock ticks past 24 seconds without a goal being scored this time. Howay the lads / here come the teams. Newcastle are in their famous black and white stripes, while City sport their equally storied sky blue. Everyone very pretty. A quick blast of the theme to the greatest movie ever made (hey, it\u2019s St Andrew\u2019s Day after all) and we\u2019ll be off in a minute. A relaxed and cheery Pep Guardiola speaks to BT Sport. \u201cEveryone remembers last season!\u201d he laughs. \u201cYou have to remember the days we won! The year before we won 1-0, last year we lost, so... it\u2019s a mythic English stadium with history. We know it.\u201d As for the continued absence of Sergio Aguero, will Gabriel Jesus step up to the plate? \u201cSure. He will be judged for the goals, but we know him, it\u2019s three seasons we\u2019ve had together, we don\u2019t have any doubt about him.\u201d Pre-match pint, anyone? We can nip across the road to The Strawberry. There\u2019s time. Steve Bruce speaks, ahead of his very first encounter with a Pep Guardiola team. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable what Manchester City have done,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cAt the head of it, Pep is someone we all strive to be. We played very well at West Ham and against Bournemouth at home, and we were a touch disappointed with how we played against Aston Villa. But we\u2019re at home, and our home form, very quietly, has stacked up. So let\u2019s hope we can play well on the day. We\u2019re going to have to. And defend well, against one of the great teams. A lot\u2019s been said about our investing a lot of money in our top three. But they are young, and coming to terms with playing in England. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll turn it round. But for me it\u2019s all about the team, so whoever scores, great if a defender scores. But there are times you want your strikers to take an opportunity, so let\u2019s hope today is one of those days.\u201d Newcastle make just the one change to the XI named for the 2-0 loss at Aston Villa last Monday. DeAndre Yedlin succumbs to a hip injury and is replaced by Javier Manquillo. Manchester City swap five players out of the team that drew 1-1 with Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday evening. Angelino, Nicolas Otamendi, Joao Cancelo, Rodri and Bernardo Silva drop to the bench, to be replaced by Kyle Walker, John Stones, Benjamin Mendy, David Silva and Riyad Mahrez. Newcastle United: Dubravka, Manquillo, Fernandez, Clark, Dummett, Willems, Almiron, Shelvey, Hayden, Saint-Maximin, Joelinton. Subs: Schar, Gayle, Krafth, Darlow, Atsu, Sean Longstaff, Matthew Longstaff. Manchester City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Silva, Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Jose Angelino, Rodri, Bernardo Silva, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Foden. Referee: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Welcome to the rerun of the 1955 FA Cup and 1976 League Cup finals. That\u2019s what this is all about, kids, yes? There is the small matter of the corresponding fixture last season, of course. Newcastle conceded a goal after just 24 seconds, yet bounced back in the second half to register a surprise 2-1 victory that nearly cost City the title. Nearly. Nearly ... but not quite. Just like last time, City are strong favourites to take away all three points from St James\u2019 Park. You\u2019d expect the reigning treble champions to swat aside a team for whom mid-table safety is the long and short of it. But you never know in football. Newcastle\u2019s form has been decent enough since being spanked 5-0 at Leicester: wins over Manchester United, West Ham and Bournemouth, plus a close defeat at Chelsea. City aren\u2019t quite their imperious best at the minute, either, having only won one of their last four in all competitions. Most strange. So can City close the gap on the leaders Liverpool? Or will Newcastle shock them again? We\u2019ll see what develops soon enough. Just give it a bit longer than 24 seconds. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT.",

      "body": "<p>An unbroken cobalt-blue sky signalled a perfect, gloriously crisp winter\u2019s day but, for Pep Guardiola, rain clouds might as well have lurked at every turn.

      "bodyText": "An unbroken cobalt-blue sky signalled a perfect, gloriously crisp winter\u2019s day but, for Pep Guardiola, rain clouds might as well have lurked at every turn. As a jubilant, critic-confounding, former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey celebrated his late equaliser for Newcastle United in front of the Manchester City manager\u2019s technical area, Guardiola\u2019s hopes of retaining the Premier League title seemed as weak as the low, late November sun. England\u2019s biggest domestic honour already seems the Anfield club\u2019s to lose and even before J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side opened up an 11-point lead at the top of the table the City manager was hardly in the best of humours. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to think about how many points we need; we have to win games,\u201d said Guardiola as Shelvey joked that he was probably more popular on Merseyside than he had ever been as a Liverpool player. \u201cI might be a hero there now,\u201d said the midfielder, leaving City\u2019s manager to lament bad luck and \u201cvery deep\u201d Newcastle defending. Yet, although Guardiola maintained \u201cour performance was good\u201d, his players lacked the sheer, opponent flattening intensity of last season while their hosts\u2019 exhilarating attacking pace diminished the value of considerable visiting ball monopoly. Several individual performances were poor with Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus blunt in attack and Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy, the latter in particular, struggling at full-back. It was the first time Guardiola and Steve Bruce had locked managerial horns but, if Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor could not quite reprise the victory Newcastle enjoyed against City here last season, they showed commendable spirit in twice answering back after first Raheem Sterling and then Kevin De Bruyne had put the visitors ahead. Low, very low, on possession, Bruce\u2019s team initially sat back and watched De Bruyne control midfield during a first half in which City\u2019s dominance was occasionally disrupted by rapid bursts of acceleration from Newcastle\u2019s \u00a377m attacking trident of Miguel Alm\u00edron, Joelinton and, especially, the ever entertaining Allan Saint-Maximin. Such cameos apart, there was a sense of inevitability when David Silva and Sterling combined to score with the Spaniard\u2019s back-heeled flick finding Sterling unmarked and set to lash the ball beyond Martin Dubravka. So far, so apparently straightforward for Guardiola\u2019s players but their apparent vulnerability to the pace of Saint-Maximin and Alm\u00edron offered Bruce a degree of hope. While Walker looked distinctly uneasy whenever the former Nice winger accelerated down the home left and Jetro Willems overlapped, Alm\u00edron persistently fazed Mendy. Newcastle\u2019s manager had resisted a growing clamour to rest the Paraguay playmaker and such faith was vindicated when his exchange of passes with Willems created an equaliser for the Netherlands left wing-back. Generous space had opened up in front of Willems and, after taking a steadying touch, he evaded Ederson\u2019s reach with a powerfully swerving shot, delivered with his supposedly weaker right foot. Remarkably it was Alm\u00edron\u2019s first assist since joining Newcastle for \u00a321m from MLS Atlanta in January. He is still waiting for a debut goal and his penalty-area confidence has drained accordingly but, damning as those bald statistics seem, they neglect to tell the whole story. There have been several games in which the unselfish Alm\u00edron has effectively switched the lights on for Newcastle and his habit of alternating flanks with Saint-Maximin as they sporadically swept Bruce\u2019s side high up the pitch ensured City could never properly relax. With tight marking restricting De Bruyne\u2019s room for manoeuvre City briefly looked out of ideas but, after Shelvey wasted a free-kick in a menacing position, they finally galvanised themselves, began sucking Newcastle markers out of position and tested their hosts\u2019 collective powers of concentration. The time had come for Dubravka to shine in the home goal and he did not disappoint. Most notably, the Slovakian made a stunning double save from first Jesus and then De Bruyne. There was barely a hint of a breeze but suddenly Bruce\u2019s players were in the eye of an attacking storm.

      "bodyText": "The archbishop of Canterbury has written to the US ambassador in London demanding that the wife of an American diplomat be extradited to the UK for police questioning over the death of Harry Dunn. Justin Welby has intervened in the long-running dispute over diplomatic immunity after Dunn, 19, was killed when his motorbike was involved in a head-on collision with a car. Anne Sacoolas, the motorist suspected of driving the Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August, admitted she had been driving on the wrong side of the road outside RAF Croughton during the crash but claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to Maryland. A letter was sent on 8 October from the archbishop\u2019s official residence at Lambeth Palace in London, although he has yet to receive a reply. The archbishop said Sacoolas, 42, should be extradited to the UK to allow a \u201cfull and proper investigation\u201d. A spokesman for Welby, 63, told the Daily Mail: \u201cThe archbishop has written to the US ambassador Robert Wood Johnson asking him to reconsider the diplomatic immunity. \u201cHe would like Mrs Sacoolas to return so a full and proper investigation can be carried out.\u201d Welby\u2019s daughter, Johanna, was killed aged seven months old in France in 1983 after a road traffic accident. The archbishop and his wife Caroline mark each anniversary of their baby daughter\u2019s death. Dunn\u2019s parents are taking legal action against the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and have submitted a judicial review accusing him of misusing or abusing his power by granting Sacoolas diplomatic immunity, after which she left the country. They say secret treaties between the UK and US that give intelligence staff at the base legal protection have been disclosed to them and that the documents make no reference about immunity for family members. The family\u2019s spokesman, Radd Seiger, said the case was \u201clikely to be appealed\u201d by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and if it goes to the supreme court, would cost them upwards of \u00a350,000. The FCOhas said it would \u201coppose and seek costs\u201d for any judicial review, and that claims of any misuse or abuse of power by Raab were \u201centirely without foundation\u201d. The FCO has said Sacoolas no longer has immunity from prosecution having returned home to Maryland. Last month she met Northamptonshire police officers who travelled to the US to take further statements. Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles, Harry\u2019s parents, travelled to the White House in October to meet Donald Trump, who expressed sympathy but refused to force Sacoolas to return to the UK. Sacoolas was waiting in a side room and prepared to meet the family at the White House, however the Dunns rejected the offer and said they had felt \u201ca little ambushed\u201d by the suggestion.",

Where is the law? Where is morality?\u201d Small-scale protests against projects such as incinerators, chemical plants or crematoriums are not uncommon in China\u2019s more rural areas. But the Wenlou demonstrations come at a time when authorities are especially sensitive to the possibility of protests spreading from nearby Hong Kong, where anti-government protests are now in their sixth month. While many Chinese in the mainland oppose those protests, the risk may be higher in Guangdong province where many have family or personal connections with Hong Kong. Residents in Wenlou expressed sentiments similar to those in Hong Kong: anger at what they perceived to be police brutality and a sense they had been forced into the streets after being misled by local officials. \u201cIf not pushed to a dead end, who would choose to hit their heads against a rock,\u201d said another resident from Wenlou. She said police had sealed off all the roads and she was unable to share videos from the scene. Posts related to the Wenlou protests appear to have been removed from the Chinese microblogging website Weibo, but some footage was reposted to Twitter and other social media sites. One Weibo user who had posted several videos wrote on Friday: \u201cThe people of Wenlou are pledging their lives to resist, but they have been met with suppression by the police, randomly arresting and hitting people. My last few posts have been deleted. Please save our town.\u201d According to the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong, police in Wenlou raided homes early on Friday, arresting those believed to had participated in protests on Thursday when hundreds of people attempted to march on the local government offices. Residents told the paper that about 50 people had been detained.",

While the data on that remains unclear, what we do know is that the patterns of use make it a very different type of addiction, with anecdotal reports of teenagers using vapes multiple times an hour, suggesting that it\u2019s far harder to keep track of just how much you\u2019re vaping.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have pointed out that when you finish a cigarette, that\u2019s a sort of stop cycle,\u201d says Levy. \u201cBut with a Juul you\u2019d have to go through a whole pod, which is equivalent to a whole pack of cigarettes. So, the stop signal is much further away.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Risks of long-term addiction</strong></h2> <p>One of the reasons scientists are particularly concerned about the rampant levels of teenage vaping in the US is because <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615117/\" title=\"\">studies have repeatedly shown</a> that the earlier nicotine use begins, the greater the risk of nicotine dependence in later life. While e-cigarettes were initially marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking, the data shows that teenagers who become addicted to vaping are actually much more likely to progress to smoking cigarettes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7573c1ffa690724d439ad56f6b7405d7260242f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7573c1ffa690724d439ad56f6b7405d7260242f5/0_0_3640_5474/665.jpg\" alt=\"An advert for Blu vapes on a London bus.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An advert for Blu vapes on a London bus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs an example, there was an analysis published two years ago which found that kids who used e-cigarettes had about three to four times the likelihood of subsequently initiating combustible cigarettes compared to their peers,\u201d says Jessica Barrington-Trimis, assistant professor at the University of Southern California Institute for Addiction Science. \u201cThis is because the earlier kids start using nicotine, the bigger the impact on the developing brain. The brain adapts to accommodate the nicotine, and the development of nicotine dependence is much more pronounced.\u201d</p> <p>Teenage exposure to high levels of nicotine may have long-lasting effects. Levy has already observed signs of what she describes as \u201ccomplete behavioural dysregulation\u201d, with hooked teens describing problems with attention, concentration \u2013 some even dropping out of school as a result.</p> <p>\u201cThe areas of the brain involved in higher cognitive processes such as planning or impulse control take until the age of 20 or beyond to complete development, and exposure to nicotine will interfere with that,\u201d says Huib Mansvelder, professor of neurophysiology at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. \u201cIn both lab animals and humans, studies have shown that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30115770\" title=\"\">early nicotine exposure</a> can affect the ability to concentrate and focus for years or even decades after.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, while nicotine has long been considered one of the more benign components of cigarettes when it comes to their carcinogenicity, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107268\" title=\"\">genetic data suggests</a> that it may play a greater role in the development of cancers than previously thought. \u201cFrom population genetics, we know that if you have certain genetic variants, exposure to nicotine seems to increase the likelihood that you will develop lung cancer,\u201d says Mansvelder. \u201cIt\u2019s still far too early to conclude that e-cigarettes definitely are carcinogenic, but from what we know, being exposed to nicotine vapours seems to be a bad idea, for adults as well as teenagers.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tackling the \u2018perfect storm\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Scientists believe that the main reason that the teenage vaping crisis has been more prevalent in the US than in the UK or Europe is because of a lack of regulation around both the marketplace and advertising. So far, Juul have been able to sell their products without FDA approval regarding their safety, while e-cigarette manufacturers have been allowed to target younger age groups through social media platforms and YouTube, as well as conducting large-scale campaigns through TV, radio and billboards.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are standardised procedures for helping people quit smoking \u2013 but no one knows if they\u2019ll work for vaping</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat was unique about Juul was the social marketing campaign which was really attractive to kids, and the lack of regulatory oversight,\u201d says Judith Prochaska, associate professor of medicine at the Prevention Research Center of Stanford University, California. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had this kind of advertising for tobacco since the 1970s. The FDA has been very hands-off with the e-cigarette marketplace, and while retailers are not supposed to sell these products to kids under 18, there\u2019s a lot of evidence to show that\u2019s not upheld. It was the perfect storm.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past year, Juul has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/17/juul-youth-vaping-advertising-agreement-settlement\" title=\"\">closed down its social media accounts</a> and the FDA has now demanded it submit safety and efficacy data on vaping products by spring next year. However, <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2019-11-23/vaping-giant-juul-pushes-for-more-addictive-e-cigarettes\" title=\"\">new investigations</a> have revealed that the company is lobbying for stronger and more addictive products to be sold in the UK \u2013 where, because of EU regulations, vapes currently cannot have a higher nicotine concentration than 2% \u2013 following Brexit, as well as a lift on advertising restrictions.</p> <p>In the meantime, for the many teenagers addicted to vaping, the future is uncertain. For while there are standardised procedures for helping people quit smoking \u2013 ranging from nicotine replacement therapy to last-resort drugs such as bupropion or varenicline \u2013 no one knows whether the same methods will work for vaping addiction.</p> <p>Levy suggests that for teens who have already begun to experience cognitive and behavioural dysfunction as a result of excessive vaping, longer-term ancillary support may be required to help them resume their education and deal with these problems. However in many states, few such programmes exist.</p> <p>One major problem is trying to convince addicted teenagers to actually commit to quitting nicotine in the first place. But unless this happens, science suggests that many of these vapers will ultimately end up using both e-cigarettes and cigarettes, with potentially grave health consequences.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt that the future will just be a generation of people vaping,\u201d says Prochaska. \u201cThere\u2019s a study called Path which shows that adults and kids move between products. A lot of these vapers aren\u2019t just going to stay with one type of tobacco product; they end up switching, and so you end up with a new generation of addicted smokers.\u201d</p>",

A lot of these vapers aren\u2019t just going to stay with one type of tobacco product; they end up switching, and so you end up with a new generation of addicted smokers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Two women who killed their partners will appeal their convictions this month, in the first cases of their kind to be heard since Sally Challen successfully challenged her murder conviction on the grounds of having suffered years of domestic abuse. Women\u2019s justice campaigners will be watching the cases of Farieissia Martin and Emma-Jayne Magson closely when they go before the Court of Appeal to see whether the Challen case has had any impact on the criminal justice system. Earlier this year, Challen\u2019s conviction for murdering her husband, Richard, was replaced with one for manslaughter. Her lawyers said she had been abused and subjected to decades of coercive control throughout her marriage, factors that they said had not been considered adequately at her original trial. The campaign group Justice for Women, which backed Challen\u2019s appeal, say that many women who have killed their violent partners are wrongly convicted of murder because the criminal justice system has failed to recognise such factors. Martin, whose appeal will be heard on Tuesday, was 22 and a mother of two small children, when she was convicted of the murder of her partner, Kyle Farrell, in 2015 after stabbing him with a kitchen knife, allegedly during a heated argument in which he attempted to strangle her. Martin\u2019s supporters say she had experienced years of violence and coercive behaviour at Farrell\u2019s hands, but her defence team had failed to obtain evidence of its impact on her mental state at her original trial. Magson, whose appeal will be heard on 10 December, was 23 when she was convicted of murdering her partner, James Knight, with a single stab wound. Her lawyers claim she was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) stemming from her childhood exposure to domestic abuse in the family home, parental neglect, bullying and the death of her sister. They also claim that evidence she had witnessed domestic abuse as a child and had been a victim of it as an adult was not heard by the jury because she did not fully participate in the trial due to neuro-developmental difficulties. Harriet Wistrich, Challen\u2019s lawyer during her appeal, said the two cases would show whether the criminal justice system now recognised that a range of factors needed to be considered when handing down murder convictions. \u201cWe hope the growing understanding of how domestic violence and coercive and controlling behaviour can trap women in very abusive relationships will assist the appeals of two women who, at most, should have been convicted of manslaughter not murder,\u201d Wistrich said. \u201cBoth vulnerable women killed in desperate circumstances, yet at trial the context for their actions was not properly understood or explained, resulting in serious miscarriages of justice.\u201d It is understood that members of both women\u2019s families will attend court when their appeals are heard.",

We were once racing bar stools across the student union in Southampton, and I was particularly good at it. Every time I won, I had a shot of J\u00e4germeister. I was found, very happy, asleep in a bush at 1am. I don\u2019t go for it before a show like I used to, but I\u2019ve still not walked the boards without a drink, else my voice would vibrate like a chipmunk. I\u2019ve always wanted to be on stage and to show off. I\u2019m not a naturally gifted songwriter. I have to work very hard at it. Somewhere in the mid-90s the words became the most important thing. You couldn\u2019t really live on the money you\u2019d make from an album these days. It\u2019s lucky there are so many festivals. If you like Cajun and Zydeco music, you\u2019ll probably still find five or six festivals. Festivals are something we should be proud of as a country \u2013 we do them so well. The way people listen to music these days means there\u2019s no such thing as a contemporary sound. There\u2019s never been a better time for music in that respect. There\u2019s no genre to fulfil. You can pull it in from anywhere and mix it up. It\u2019s fantastic when you find out that people you really admire are into your music. Paul McCartney wrote us an email after hearing Magnificent. He said he\u2019d been dropping off his grandkids at school and had to sit in the car until it finished to find out who it was. That\u2019s like: \u201cMy work here is done,\u201d and Elbow disappearing in a puff of purple smoke. Elbow\u2019s Giants of All Sizes is out now. The band tours the UK in April 2020",

      "bodyText": "Was Usman Khan still serving a prison sentence? Khan was convicted in 2012 of being part of a group of al-Qaida-inspired plotters who intended to carry out attacks in the UK \u2013 including on the London Stock Exchange \u2013 and set up a terrorist camp in Pakistan. Khan was released from prison on licence last year and at the time of the attack he was wearing an electronic tag and subject to low-level monitoring. While he was known to the security services, he was considered a low- to medium-priority threat. What sort of sentence was it? Khan was jailed after receiving a controversial sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) in 2012. This allowed him to be held in prison indefinitely, with no minimum term, until a parole board agreed he was no longer a threat to the public. IPPs were introduced under Labour, but abolished by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in December 2012 (although, importantly, not retrospectively), amid complaints they had been misused to keep some individuals incarcerated without a proper timetable to be considered for release. IPPs were replaced by extended sentences, which carry a minimum term or tariff to ensure that cases would be reviewed. Against that backdrop, Khan and two others successfully appealed against their IPP sentences. In 2013, the court of appeal revised Khan\u2019s sentence to a term of 16 years, and told him he would have to spend a minimum of eight years behind bars. Who decided to let him out after eight years? This is where it appears something went wrong. At the time, Lord Justice Leveson at the court of appeal indicated that he expected the Parole Board to review Khan\u2019s case at the end of the eight-year minimum term, describing anybody who had committed such terrorism offences as dangerous. \u201cThere is an argument for concluding that anyone convicted of such an offence should be incentivised to demonstrate that he can safely be released; such a decision is then better left to the Parole Board for consideration proximate in time to the date when release becomes possible,\u201d Leveson said. But on Saturday morning, the Parole Board put out a statement saying it had not reviewed Khan\u2019s case at all \u2013 and that the London Bridge terrorist had been released without its involvement \u2013 suggesting the law had been misunderstood or misapplied. It said: \u201cThe Parole Board can confirm it had no involvement with the release of the individual identified as the attacker, who appears to have been released automatically on licence (as required by law), without ever being referred to the Board.\u201d Are there more cases like this? An analysis conducted by the Guardian a little over a year ago showed that a growing number of people previously convicted for terror offences are eligible for release. These are typically sentences handed down to people found guilty of attack planning or funding terrorism \u2013 rather than those found guilty of violent acts. The figures showed that more than 80 of the 193 terms issued for these types terror offences between 2007 and 2016 ran out by the end of 2018. The figures exclude those with life or indeterminate sentences, but as in Khan\u2019s case, many will have shown a strong intention to attack at the time. Such individuals will rarely be placed under active scrutiny by intelligence agencies, leaving them largely in the day-to-day monitoring of the probation service.",

      "bodyText": "It is early morning in the heart of Provence, and somewhere behind the tall black pine trees a rousing dawn chorus begins. We are crouching out of sight among the rosemary bushes and wild asparagus listening to the melodic musical phrases of song thrushes and blackbirds. This is Marcel Pagnol country, rich in flora and fauna and of exceptional natural beauty; but there is no sign of the singing birds anywhere in the rustling foliage, trees or sky. Yves Verilhac, of France\u2019s Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux (LPO), knows why. \u201cThe singing you can hear is from caged thrushes and blackbirds who are appellants (callers). They\u2019re caught and kept in the dark for months so when they\u2019re taken out into daylight they sing their hearts out and attract other birds.\u201d He points above the treetops where clusters of sticks attached to vertical poles glisten in the nascent sunlight. \u201cThose are verguettes: sticks covered in glue. The callers call, other birds come, land on a verguette, and they\u2019re stuck. The more they struggle to get away, the more they become stuck.\u201d The trilling Proven\u00e7al songbirds are unwitting decoys to lure more birds into a death trap, he says. Once enticed, the birds are either blasted out of the sky by hunters hidden in camouflaged cabins, or find themselves stuck on the sticks. It is a scene with which readers of Roald Dahl\u2019s The Twits \u2013 in which the Twits coat branches with glue to catch birds to bake in a pie \u2013 will be familiar. La chasse \u00e0 la glu \u2013 glue-trapping \u2013 was banned in the EU by a 1979 bird directive, except in special circumstances where it is \u201ccontrolled, selective and in limited quantities\u201d. Since 1989, France has invoked these circumstances to permit glue-trapping in five south-east departments on the grounds that it is \u201ctraditional\u201d. Bird campaigners, who say the practice is unspeakably cruel, have secretly shot photographs and film that they say proves it is not selective and, worse, poses a threat to endangered species. They have brought numerous legal cases in national and European courts over the past 30 years. All have failed. \u201cWe\u2019ve concrete evidence that sometimes the bird is struggling for 20\u201330 minutes. To remove them from the sticks, they spray them with petrol or acetone, which is toxic, and if it\u2019s not a species they\u2019re allowed to trap they often throw the bird away like a stone,\u201d Verilhac says. He stabs at his mobile phone to bring up a photograph of a dead robin, with its unmistakable red breast, stuck by its wing, legs and beak to a glue stick. \u201cThis is what they call \u2018tradition\u2019, but it\u2019s a practice from the middle ages and barbaric,\u201d he says. The LPO claims French hunters kill an estimated 17 million birds every year \u2013 more than any other country \u2013 from 64 species. Of these birds, many of which are migratory, 20 are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list of endangered species in Europe, including the turtle dove, rock ptarmigan, violet thrush and curlew. About 1.4m song thrushes and more than 2m partridges are killed annually. Glue-trappers have permission to catch 42,500 song thrushes and blackbirds this year, half last year\u2019s quota. Last year the French president, Emmanuel Macron, gave in to pressure from the powerful hunting lobby and halved the cost of a hunting licence. The hunters claim glue-trapping dates back at least several family generations, and reject accusations of cruelty. They insist they are quick to remove any stuck birds and release those they are not permitted to trap \u2013 such as robins, blue tits and warblers \u2013 back into the wild. This is the official quid pro quo for being allowed to hunt with glue. There are an estimated 6,000 licensed glue-trappers of songbirds in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d\u2019Azur region who are allowed to hunt between 1 October and 15 December, from one hour before sunrise to 11am every day.

Tasty tasty times if you\u2019re a devotee of Australian cricket. Smith knocks away a single first ball to give Warner back the strike with three balls to come. Warner works it through square leg and will get... two, with the aid of a misfield. Thought of the third, couldn\u2019t quite risk it, and he walks away to square leg to clear his head on 199. </p> <p>Two balls left in the over. Blocked to the off side. No run.</p> <p>One ball left. <strong>And he gets it! Knocks it to square leg, takes the single, and that is David Warner\u2019s second double century in Test cricket!</strong> What a remarkable force o concentration and discipline he has been this summer.

Sorry if you didn\u2019t get the note. That costume looks great though, Keith. And the Toyota badging is a nice touch. We\u2019re all just playing it by ear, trying to work out something new. Which is what David will be doing, too. See, Davey used to have a particular style. Score big, score fast, put his feet up. For a long time his highest score was that 180 he made in about 15 minutes when he pogoed India all around the WACA. He never batted through a Test day until 2016 at the same ground, when he made 250 against New Zealand. But he got out first thing the next morning. Then last week at the Gabba he went through the day again, and got out without adding much the next morning too. Now in Adelaide he\u2019s had his third bat-through day, and his third chance to go on the next day to a truly huge score. Will it help that the next day is starting in the afternoon, not the morning? Maybe he\u2019s a post-prandial guy. We\u2019ll find out. Because it would be interesting to see what D. Warner can do if he really goes on with an innings. Two days of pain, that sort of thing.</p> <p>Pakistan are sore, sorry, and have once again bowled through a Test day for only the wicket of Joe Burns. Hopefully they rested well and did justice to the breakfast buffet. <strong>Australia: 302 for 1 </strong>after the first day.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-30T02:31:26.901Z\">at 2.31am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "35th over: Pakistan 96-6 (Babar 43, Yasir 4) Yasir plays out the last over from Cummins, and that\u2019s the end of a spectacular day\u2019s play. David Warner laced an awesome 335 not out, the highest Test score on this ground, and then Australia\u2019s ruthless pace attack went to work under the lights. Barring an apocalypse, or even the apocalypse, Australia will win this game at a canter. Thanks for your company and emails - goodnight. 34th over: Pakistan 91-6 (Babar 42, Yasir 0) Yasir somehow survives Starc\u2019s over, although he could have been out to at least four of the six deliveries. There will time for one more over before stumps. Yasir is not out! Australia lose their last review. Starc bowled around the wicket to Yasir, who pushed at a short ball as it flew down the leg side. There was a noise, which is why everyone thought it was out, but replays showed the ball hit Yasir on the hip. Excellent umpiring from Michael Gough. Australia review for caught behind against Yasir! I reckon this will be out. 33rd over: Pakistan 91-6 (Babar 42, Yasir 0) Babar is beaten by a cracker from Cummins, which pitches just outside off and straightens sharply. \u201cTrying to get my head round the state of play,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cAny news from the WinViz predictor?\u201d It\u2019s been given the rest of the weekend off. 32nd over: Pakistan 89-6 (Babar 40, Yasir 0) A double-wicket maiden for Mitchell Starc, whose figures are 14-4-22-4. It\u2019s probably fair to opine that he is back in form. Starc has his fourth wicket! He has been electric this evening. Mohammad Rizwan, who played so well at Brisbane, chased a wide one and was caught behind for a third-ball duck. Babar Azam is all alone on the burning deck. Brilliant catch from Tim Paine! Iftikhar plays his latest and last loose stroke outside off stump, flashing at a short one from Starc, and Paine dives in front of first slip to take a one-handed blinder. 31st over: Pakistan 89-4 (Babar 40, Iftikhar 10) Babar squirts Cummins through backward point for a couple. The commentators aren\u2019t happy with Australia\u2019s passive-aggressive fields, with a deep point and only one slip for Babar. I\u2019ll leave with you: I can see both sides. 30th over: Pakistan 87-4 (Babar 38, Iftikhar 10) Australia\u2019s bowlers have been very chirpy towards Iftikhar in particular. Perhaps they\u2019re reminding him that this 10 not out is the highest score of his burgeoning Test career. 29th over: Pakistan 84-4 (Babar 36, Iftikhar 9) Cummins replaces Hazlewood (8-2-29-1) and is cuffed through the covers for four by Iftikhar. He doesn\u2019t look convincing, but at least he\u2019s trying to put some pressure on the Australian bowlers. \u201cDo you think if you keep saying \u2018supracaudal gland\u2019 you might get some anatomy-related commissions?\u201d says Eamonn Maloney. \u201cEver MBMed a surgical procedure?\u201d I have, actually: Glenn McGrath\u2019s spell on the first day of the 2005 Ashes. 28th over: Pakistan 80-4 (Babar 36, Iftikhar 5) Pakistan have just under 40 minutes to survive until the close. Iftikhar has the windiest of woofs at Starc and is beaten again; he is struggling. 27th over: Pakistan 79-4 (Babar 36, Iftikhar 4) A quiet over from Hazlewood - two from it. 26th over: Pakistan 77-4 (Babar 34, Iftikhar 4) Iftikhar tries to uppercut a wide one from Starc and is beaten. He edges a fuller, follow-up delivery on the bounce to second slip. The Pakistan batsmen, Babar and Masood excepted, have been very loose this evening. In their defence, the Australian fast bowling has been relentless. 25th over: Pakistan 76-4 (Babar 33, Iftikhar 4) Babar drives Hazlewood down the ground for three. It was in the air but Hazlewood was unable to reach it in his follow through. Iftikhar then gets off the mark with a punchy drive for four. 24th over: Pakistan 69-4 (Babar 30, Iftikhar 0) Starc\u2019s figures reflect an excellent performance: 8-3-17-2. Asad Shafiq\u2019s miserable struggle is over. The ball after edging Starc for four, he snicked a good delivery through to the keeper. Australia are into the supracaudal gland. 23rd over: Pakistan 65-3 (Babar 30, Shafiq 5) Babar is beaten, playing an unbecoming stroke at Hazlewood. He upbraids himself internally and then flicks imperiously to the midwicket boundary. A lively over concludes when Babar plays a defensive stroke that kicks up to hit him on the chin. He\u2019s fine. 22nd over: Pakistan 61-3 (Babar 26, Shafiq 5) Starc replaces Cummins. His second ball beats Asad, who continues to flirt fecklessly outside off stump. There are 19 overs remaining today, and it\u2019s time for drinks. 21st over: Pakistan 59-3 (Babar 25, Shafiq 4) Babar times consecutive boundaries off Hazlewood, an elegant cover drive followed by a clip through square leg. He\u2019s playing on a different pitch - or, rather, in a different twilight - to all the other Pakistan batsmen. He bats with such grace and serenity, and to hell with the fact his team are getting stuffed. \u201cAs a fan of proper cricket got to say I\u2019m disappointed by Warner\u2019s lack of runs in the V,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cShould be straight in the nets after play and concentrate on keeping that elbow pointing skywards. Plenty of room for improvement.\u201d Deserves another 12-month ban for mine. 20th over: Pakistan 51-3 (Babar 17, Shafiq 4) Babar Azam is Pakistan\u2019s best player, by a distance. His overall Test record (1345 runs at 36.59) doesn\u2019t do him justice, but he averages 52 in the last couple of years. He looks comfortable at the crease. Shafiq does not, at least not yet, and he edges Cummins\u2019 last delivery a fraction short of Wade in the slips. 19th over: Pakistan 48-3 (Babar 14, Shafiq 4) Babar drives Hazlewood majestically through mid-off for four. I was going to say he\u2019s a beautiful player, but I was always taught not to state the bleedin\u2019 obvious. 18th over: Pakistan 43-3 (Babar 9, Shafiq 4) These two are Pakistan\u2019s best players, so Australia will feel they are one wicket away, if not from the tail then at least the supracaudal gland. They almost get it when Shafiq edges his second ball just wide of the diving Labuschagne at third slip. 17th over: Pakistan 38-3 (Babar 8, Shafiq 0) This could get pretty messy for Pakistan. Shan Masood has gone, caught behind off Josh Hazlewood. Having left the ball beautifully throughout his innings, Masood felt for a good delivery outside off stump that straightened just enough to take a thin outside edge on its way through to Tim Paine. 16th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Masood 19, Babar 8) Babar Azam is beaten, fencing at another good delivery from Cummins. This is a nice contest between two of the world\u2019s best cricketers. When Cummins slips one full and wide, Babar clatters it to the cover boundary. 15th over: Pakistan 34-2 (Masood 19, Babar 4) Masood plays a defensive stroke off Hazlewood, with the ball getting stuck behind the flap of his pad. Warner grabs the ball and launches into a mock-appeal. The next ball, the last of the over, zips past the edge. The pink ball is starting to talk under the lights. 14th over: Pakistan 34-2 (Masood 19, Babar 4) A half-volley from Cummins is flicked sweetly to the square-leg boundary by Masood, who is playing with calm authority. Babar Azam drives classily for four to get off the mark; Cummins responds with a peach that squares Babar up and goes past the edge. 13th over: Pakistan 25-2 (Masood 14, Babar 0) Josh Hazlewood replaces Mitchell Starc, who bowled a good opening spell of 6-3-11-1. A quiet over to start. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cThat Warner scoring sequence could perhaps also be captured algebraically in the expression: 2 x K &gt;&gt; 10 x D (although it should be noted that this does not apply to freaks of nature like Steve Smith for whom 8 x D is greater than England\u2019s entire team).\u201d Smith is so good that he even goes in our estimation when he fails. I love that he can\u2019t be bothered to get big runs when he comes in at 400 for two. But when they\u2019re 122 for eight in the Ashes... 12th over: Pakistan 22-2 (Masood 11, Babar 0) Babar Azam has been promoted to No4. Steve Smith takes a splendid catch to get rid of the Pakistan captain Azhar Ali. He edged a fullish delivery from Cummins low to second slip, where Smith moved smartly to grab the ball with both hands just below the ground. The umpires went upstairs to confirm it had carried, and replays confirmed it was a clean take. And a darned good one. 11th over: Pakistan 21-1 (Masood 10, Azhar 9) Azhar Ali has a fine record against the Aussies, with an average of 55. That includes an unbeaten double hundred at the MCG three years ago. He digs out a yorker from Starc, and that\u2019s all she wrote. 10th over: Pakistan 20-1 (Masood 9, Azhar 9) Cummins is too straight to Azhar Ali, who times him crisply through midwicket for the first boundary of the innings. These two, probably Pakistan\u2019s most patient batsmen, are playing nicely. 9th over: Pakistan 15-1 (Masood 8, Azhar 5) Masood works a short one from Starc off the breast for a couple and then drives pleasantly for three. There hasn\u2019t been much movement for the quicks, although that may change when we enter the twilight zone. 8th over: Pakistan 9-1 (Masood 3, Azhar 4) Shan Masood continues to leave well against Cummins, although he needs to be careful with the angle from around the wicket. He waves a slightly unconvincing drive into the covers for two off the fifth delivery of the over. 7th over: Pakistan 7-1 (Masood 1, Azhar 4) Starc resumes after dinner, and concedes his first runs of the innings when Azhar drives through mid-off for a couple. And why not? \u201cWas that declaration by Tim Paine really necessary?\u201d says Kaushik Sarvadey. \u201cI suppose the urgency was not required because the Aussies had plenty of time.\u201d It\u2019s the Australian way, I suppose. And the weather forecast isn\u2019t great for the next couple of days. \u201cMorning/evening, Rob,\u201d says David Horn. \u201cImpressive though your Countdown ability is, Warner\u2019s scores post-reintegration are more reminiscent of Numberwang.\u201d 6th over: Pakistan 3-1 (Masood 1, Azhar 0) Masood continues to leave as much as possible, mainly on line. Cummins moves around the wicket as a result and has a huge shout for LBW turned down by Michael Gough. That looked very close, but Australia only have one review remaining and Tim Paine decides not to risk it. That was the last ball of the session. It\u2019s been an agreeable day for Australia: David Warner made 335 not out, the highest Test score at the Adelaide Oval, before Mitchell Starc ripped out Imam-ul-Haq. See you in 40 minutes for the twilight session. 5th over: Pakistan 3-1 (Masood 1, Azhar 0) A wicket maiden from Starc, whose figures are 3-3-0-1. That\u2019ll do. Imam, softened up by a nasty short ball, edges a good one from Starc straight to Warner in the gully. Australia\u2019s bowlers have started ruthlessly, and that wicket comes as no surprise. 4th over: Pakistan 3-0 (Masood 1, Imam 2) Masood gets off the mark from his 10th delivery, flicking Cummins for a single. He and Imam are constructing their innings on a need-to-play basis, with a clear plan to leave anything even slightly outside off stump. 3rd over: Pakistan 1-0 (Masood 0, Imam 1) Starc is already close to 150kph, and bowls a second maiden - this time to the strokeless Imam-ul-Haq. Pakistan\u2019s openers are ready for their supper. 2nd over: Pakistan 1-0 (Masood 0, Imam 1) Imam gets off the mark with a dodgy single off Cummins. Shan Masood, who was slow to respond, would have been out with a direct hit from Head in the covers. Cummins ends an excellent over by ripping one past Masood\u2019s outside edge. This has been a ferocious start from the Australian bowlers. \u201cI think the equation could be simplified,\u201d says Rowan Sweeney. \u201cWarner - Stuart Broad = 335.\u201d IMAM IS NOT OUT! Australia lose a review. It was a good delivery from Cummins, bowling over the wicket to Imam. It would certainly have hit the stumps - but replays showed it pitched outside leg. AUSTRALIA REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST IMAM! I think this pitched outside leg. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Masood 0, Imam 0) \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cLooking at Warner\u2019s scores since his return to Test cricket made me wish they\u2019d had a numbers round in Extreme Countdown...\u201d Arf. I think you can get 335 by using all his Ashes scores: 61 x 5 + 11 + 3 + (8x2) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 335. Shan Masood is given out LBW - but the decision is overturned on review. There was a faint inside-edge, although strangely Masood only reviewed after 13 or 14 seconds. Mitchell Starc will open the bowling. There\u2019s just under half an hour before the dinner break. Warner\u2019s innings in full 335* from 418 balls, with 39 fours, one six - and, as Damien McLean pointed out a few overs ago, umpteen quick singles. Warner? Phwoarner more like! Okay, that doesn\u2019t work. So, what did you do at the weekend? David Warner made 335 not out. Warner\u2019s scores since his return to Test cricket looks like the kind of maths puzzle even Max Fischer couldn\u2019t solve: 2, 8, 3, 5, 61, 0, 0, 0, 5, 11, 154, 335*. 127th over: Australia 589-3 declared (Warner 335, Wade 38) Warner waves Iftikhar for a single to move to 335, the second highest score in Australian Test history, and Tim Paine decides to leave it at that. Warner walks off to a standing ovation from the crowd and a guard of honour from his team-mates. After all he\u2019s been through in the last couple of years, that is a thoroughly lovely moment. 126th over: Australia 582-3 (Warner 330, Wade 36) No sign of a declaration, which suggests Australia will bat on after tea. The 400 might actually be on. For now, Warner is five away from the second highest Test score for Australia - Don Bradman and Mark Taylor, famously, both made 334. \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, it\u2019s been a privilege to watch this whole knock live,\u201d says Damien McLean. \u201cSay what you will about this Pakistani attack, but you still have to make the runs. This hasn\u2019t been the Warner I\u2019ve watched in the past, who used to make a hundred then just try and hit the bowlers out of the park. Great to see what he can do when he puts his mind to playing long. The running between the wickets has been the highlight for me; running as hard now as early yesterday.\u201d As an England fan, the sheer ruthlessness of Australian batsmen never ceases to amaze/fascinate/depress me. 125th over: Australia 579-3 (Warner 329, Wade 34) \u201cGood morning,\u201d says Matt. \u201cSo I am following the match, still learning about the sport, and my question is how many days long is a match?\u201d A Test match is usually scheduled to last five days, but sometimes it\u2019s four. And some of them finish in three or even days. There are also one-day matches, but they occasionally go to a second day. Confused? Splendid. Now lie down on the couch and tell me about your schooldays. 124th over: Australia 574-3 (Warner 325, Wade 33) Musa Khan returns to the attack, the poor sod. Five from the over. 123rd over: Australia 569-3 (Warner 323, Wade 30) Warner cuffs Iftikhar for four more. His Test average in Australia has gone past 67, which is a record for an opener in home Tests (minimum 10 innings). He has had his moments away from home, most notably those storming hundreds in South Africa in 2013-14, but he will be remembered as a devastating player in home conditions. \u201cGood work,\u201d says Michael Barker. \u201cBut when will they declare, Rob?\u201d I suspect it will be in the next 10-15 minutes, though Tim Paine must be tempted to give Warner a chance of making 400. They would still have time for an hour\u2019s bowling tonight. 122nd over: Australia 560-3 (Warner 315, Wade 29) Wade runs down the wicket and launches Abbas miles in the air. The ball teases midwicket and deep square leg before plopping safely. It was in the air so long that the batsmen were able to turn for the third. Warner then shows Wade how to do it with a blistering pull into the crowd. That\u2019s his first six of the innings. He heaves violently at the next ball, slicing it over the solitary slip for four more. Warner is trying to get as many as possible before the declaration. He is 315 not out. 121st over: Australia 543-3 (Warner 301, Wade 26) Thanks Geoff, evening everyone. Wade slaps Iftikhar square on the off side for four to continue this orgy of runs in Adelaide. The most euphoric moment may be yet to come: David Warner is 99 away from you know what. 120th over: Australia 537-3 (Warner 300, Wade 21) He\u2019s done it! Warner plays an on-drive, rolling towards the rope. It teases the fielders, teases the crowd, then runs into the rope. Three hundred for Warner! What a return to form. He\u2019s been prolific, but this would have been beyond even his dreams. Batting long, going huge, those have never been big parts of his batting career. But here, he has. The luck has been there, the skill has been there, and the fortitude has been there. David Warner joins the slender ranks of those with Test triples. And as if to prove that he\u2019s not done yet, Warner sets up again to leave and defend the next five balls of the Abbas over. And with that, what better time to hand over to that famed lover of all things Warner, Rob Smyth. 119th over: Australia 533-3 (Warner 296, Wade 21) Warner moves quickly towards his triple, clobbering Iftihkar for four through square leg, then adding two more through cover. 118th over: Australia 526-3 (Warner 289, Wade 21) Abbas comes back into the attack. By now it\u2019s less an attack than a gentle request. Wade doesn\u2019t care for the parsimony of Abbas, so he whacks a couple through point and four through the covers. 117th over: Australia 519-3 (Warner 288, Wade 15) Yasir\u2019s horror run continues, as Wade decides that he\u2019s going to channel 2012 Warner. Gets into position early, feet apart, weight down, ready to heave, and launches a pull-slog into the stands. High and long, no finesse about that but plenty of contact. Yasir is about to bring up his own double-century. 116th over: Australia 510-3 (Warner 286, Wade 8) Warner\u2019s placement through cover has been a real feature of this innings. Again he leans forward and drives, again he finds the finest of gaps to stream to the boundary. Shaheen can do nothing. 115th over: Australia 505-3 (Warner 281, Wade 8) Yasir is having a miserable old time at the Adelaide Oval, much as Imran Tahir had at the hands of Warner back in 2012. That was more gung-ho, this is more relentless. Less relentful? You get the idea. Warner sweeps another boundary, ticks another single. Wade slogs a couple of runs. Yasir keeps going at worse than 6 runs per over. 114th over: Australia 496-3 (Warner 275, Wade 5) Shaheen is right on the spot to Wade, landing his length really well. The over is quiet until Wade edges along the ground for a boundary. 113th over: Australia 492-3 (Warner 275, Wade 1) Suddenly things quiet down, with just a couple of singles from the Yasir over. Wade is immediately sweeping, as is his wont. 112th over: Australia 490-3 (Warner 274, Wade 0) Matthew Wade is next in, after some decent runs at Brisbane last week. He\u2019s immediately the subject of a DRS challenge, having pushed at Shaheen outside off, but there\u2019s no contact between bat and ball on the forensics. Shaheen has 3 for 79, and has tried hard. What\u2019s this? Another modest score from Smith! He\u2019s made 40 in the series while his teammates have rattled up about a thousand between them. And this was to another yahoo shot. He doesn\u2019t seem at his best when Australia is right on top and he\u2019s supposed to cash in. He aims a huge swipe at Shaheen, apparently aiming somewhere over wide long-on, and gets a faint inside edge having completely lost his shape. Shaheen does the big Starman celebration pose. Maybe save it for when the oppo isn\u2019t 500 ahead, champ. 111th over: Australia 490-2 (Warner 274, Smith 36) That was less conventional from Warner. Gets a ball spinning into his pads from Yasir, and whips across the line at it, all wrists after reaching around his front pad, and somehow middles it for four. That\u2019s a fairly high-risk stroke though. Safer when Yasir drops short and Warner cuts a couple. Two more through cover. 110th over: Australia 481-2 (Warner 266, Smith 35) Warner is happy to continue against Shaheen in his safety-conscious style. Nothing extravagant, leaves and defends a few, then seizes on the overpitched delivery to off-drive it for four. 109th over: Australia 477-2 (Warner 262, Smith 35) The break has ended, and Yasir has the ball. There\u2019s a big appeal from him and Rizwan in concert, though no one else joins in, when the ball beats Smith\u2019s bat and flicks the flap of his pad. But I fancy it hit him outside off and was turning away. A couple of singles are added. An extraordinary start to the day for Australia. Warner and Labuschagne were flying through the first overs, and with Smith ended up piling on 173 runs in a session extended by half an hour. Pakistan had a moment of happiness when Shaheen castled Marnus with a lovely ball that swung into him, but one wicket did not yield anything further. Warner this international summer has 702 runs for two dismissals. He\u2019ll continue in a moment, and so will we. 108th over: Australia 475-2 (Warner 261, Smith 34) Last over before the short tea break, which comes first in day-night matches, and Warner is happy to see off Shaheen after Smith takes a single first ball. 107th over: Australia 474-2 (Warner 261, Smith 33) Warner nearly run out, but he\u2019s fast and he dives just as he does so often in T20 cricket. Two more runs to his total after once more helping Yasir through fine leg. He goes further into one-day mode, playing the reverse-sweep to Yasir\u2019s over-the-wicket line. Knowing there\u2019s a large gap behind point, Warner makes the most of it for four. 106th over: Australia 468-2 (Warner 255, Smith 33) Shaheen is bowling decently, again excited as a ball moves back towards Smith\u2019s off stump, but again it\u2019s a ball that looks good but isn\u2019t really threatening. Just a Warner single from the over. 105th over: Australia 467-2 (Warner 254, Smith 33) Three for Smith and then three for Warner off Yasir, both of them working the leggie away through fine leg. The TV replay picks up that Warner didn\u2019t actually ground his heel for the third run, but the umpire didn\u2019t notice. In the book, he has now made a new highest Test score, passing his 253 against NZ at the WACA four years ago. 104th over: Australia 461-2 (Warner 251, Smith 30) Another edge for Warner, this one seemed more deliberate: soft hands, played down, along the ground into the gap. So softly played that the ball rolls to a stop just inside the rope and only profits Warner by two runs, but that\u2019s enough to raise another milestone. Shaheen is not impressed. 103rd over: Australia 459-2 (Warner 249, Smith 30) Smith just does what Smith does. Waits back, steps across, plays anything through midwicket that can be played through midwicket. Twice Yasir lets him work the ball for doubles. Dismissal number eight for Yasir doesn\u2019t appear to be imminent. 102nd over: Australia 455-2 (Warner 249, Smith 26) Musa is taken off to go and listen to some Fall Out Boy or whatever teenagers do to deal with angst. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m ancient. Shaheen has Warner defend one ball, then slash another over the cordon. That was much more about luck than control for Petit Davide. Wide and chased. As is another ball, fuller, that leaves Warner on one knee outside off as he misses. It\u2019s a good over from Shaheen, bowling to his heavily off-side field. 101st over: Australia 451-2 (Warner 245, Smith 26) That\u2019s lovely, Steven. Waits for the leg-break that Yasir tosses up. Watches it dip. Shimmies slightly to be in position, then whips the drive off his toes through midwicket for three. You won\u2019t see many right-handers play leg-spin better than that. In two hours they\u2019ve added 148 today. 100th over: Australia 446-2 (Warner 243, Smith 23) Musa, the frustration continues. Yet another no-ball, pitching full to Warner from around the wicket. Then an edge from Warner that rolls away for four. The bowler\u2019s pace is still good, mid-140s, but he can\u2019t get the rest of his game together. Warner gets off strike, then Smith pulls a short ball for his 7000th Test run, raised in his 126th innings. That\u2019s four more runs than Bradman ever got. And so it makes Smith, by my reckoning, the fastest to the milestone in terms of innings faced. Can confirm that: Wally Hammond took 131 innings. Sehwag 134, Tendulkar 136, Sobers, Sangakkara and Kohli 138. 99th over: Australia 438-2 (Warner 237, Smith 22) Smith is getting his on-side game working to Yasir, moving across to knock the leg-spinner square. But it\u2019s not without its risk, as he finds when he gets squared up trying the same shot, gets a thick outside edge and sees it bounce into the gully. 98th over: Australia 434-2 (Warner 236, Smith 19) Another no-ball from Musa, and nearly got Warner with that one at all. Seam movement, beat the edge by a fraction, and costs Pakistan a penalty run. What is it with Warner and no-balls? It seems that on good batting days, the bowler\u2019s best delivery to him is always an overstep. Did he once visit a shaman with a photo of Mohammad Amir, or what? 97th over: Australia 433-2 (Warner 236, Smith 19) Yasir to Smith, but the batsman gets the upper hand in this over. Whips a boundary through midwicket, then gets off strike to cover. Nyah-nyah. 96th over: Australia 426-2 (Warner 234, Smith 14) You\u2019ll never guess what happens next... David Warner is caught off a no-ball! It was the young Naseem on debut in Brisbane, here it\u2019s Musa. Fortunately he doesn\u2019t have the ecstasy / agony bit of finding out via a wait and a replay, because the umpire calls the no-ball in live action. So there\u2019s no celebration as Warner drives away from his body and sends a thick edge straight to gully. Instead, Babar throws his head back, and Musa puts his head in his hands. Should have had Warner, but that basic error costs Pakistan again. Warner celebrates in his own style, seeing a bouncer, playing a wristy uppercut from well above his head over first slip for four. Then tucks away a single. Flourish and humility, one after the other. Ten runs from an over that should have brought a wicket instead. 95th over: Australia 416-2 (Warner 226, Smith 13) Right, it will be Yasir Shah changing to the Riverbank End. Bowling to Steven Smith with a slip and a short leg. A short cover as well, 15 paces from the bat. Backward point, deep point, regulation cover, mid-off, id-on, midwicket. No one deep on the leg side. Don\u2019t bowl short... Yasir doesn\u2019t, flighting the ball and landing it full, around the off stump. Smith keeps stretching forward to defend. This shapes as a good battle already, there\u2019s a bit of extra fizz in the air. Smith walks across and hits hard on the bounce into the short leg fielder, presumably Masood under the scone-box. Line of fire. He ensures the over is a maiden. 94th over: Australia 416-2 (Warner 226, Smith 13) No he wont, because Muhammad Musa Khan has come back on. This is a weird move from Azhar Ali. Unless Yasir wants to switch ends and replace Abbas after a lengthy spell. Smith lashes through point but sees his shot saved, then drives through cover and gets three. Warner ducks a bouncer. Then drives to deep cover, where Shan Masood saves well after being wrong-footed. Two runs. 93rd over: Australia 411-2 (Warner 224, Smith 10) Another good over from Abbas, using the seam and trying to cut the ball into Warner, with a fairly close fielder square on the leg side looking for a catch I fancy. Warner gets a couple of leg byes and can\u2019t lay bat on ball throughout. Smith will face Yasir in the next over. 92nd over: Australia 409-2 (Warner 224, Smith 10) Ok, so Azhar brings Yasir Shah on try getting an edge over Smith. Except that Yasir bowls the full over to Warner. And Warner pulverises a long-hop for four, punches two more through cover, and survives the one threatening ball as Yasir zips a straight one through that beats the edge when Warner is expecting turn. 91st over: Australia 402-2 (Warner 217, Smith 10) Abbas draws an edge from Warner, but the left-hander plays it softly enough that he grounds the ball for three runs rather than edging it in the air. He bowls nicely to Smith as well, seaming the ball a couple of times. Smith gets tangled up while trying to play to the leg side, and in the end the ball beats his outside edge even as he tries to play across the line, and thunks him on the thigh pad. That\u2019s the best over that Abbas has bowled in the Test. He was forthright in the press conference last night, saying that he was upset at missing the Brisbane Test, but that he couldn\u2019t get into rhythm with no Tests for nearly a year. Drinks break. 90th over: Australia 399-2 (Warner 214, Smith 10) It\u2019s easier to score off Shaheen than Abbas, with his pace on the ball and his higher likelihood of mistakes. He gives Warner width and Warner gives him the treatment. Cut for four. Shaheen predictably responds with a bouncer, but Warner just ducks, then cuts the next ball into the point gap for one. 89th over: Australia 394-2 (Warner 209, Smith 10) Abbas has bowled very economically: 24 overs now, 69 runs. But he hasn\u2019t threatened a great deal with the ball. Smith is watchful against him, guards against seam movement with the new ball, takes another single with his default scoring shot. Warner prefers the off side, scores one to point. 88th over: Australia 392-2 (Warner 208, Smith 9) And Smith doubles his score again! The fine leg merchant, walking across to Shaheen this time and diverting the path of the ball away for a boundary. Smith has gone 1, 2, 4, 8. Can he score 16 from his next ball? I wouldn\u2019t rule it out. Nope, he ruins the sequence with a single. Warner thanks him for the strike by driving perfectly through extra cover for four, splitting a tiny gap in the field. In just over an hour the Australians have added 90 runs. 87th over: Australia 383-2 (Warner 204, Smith 4) Smith doing what Smith does. Walking across, making space on the leg side. Abbas bowling a bit too short as well. Glanced for two, deflected off the pad for three. Smith doubles his score again. 86th over: Australia 378-2 (Warner 204, Smith 2) A decent start from Shaheen, who gets some seam movement to beat Smith\u2019s edge. Smith was pulling inside the line though, and Shaheen started too short to take the edge. That ball was Joey in Friends: looked good, didn\u2019t achieve much. Smith doubles his score with a single to mid-on. 85th over: Australia 377-2 (Warner 204, Smith 1) Smith is practicing all of his shots and leaves and nudges at the non-striker\u2019s end, as Warner plays a for-real cover drive against Abbas, almost on the back foot and then coming forward suddenly through the ball, on the up. You have to be seeing them well to do that. The Pakistanis are excited when Abbas nearly gets pad, but there was plenty of bat involved as well. 84th over: Australia 373-2 (Warner 200, Smith 1) A wicket, sure, but David Warner on the cusp of a double, and Steve Smith walking to the middle. Tasty tasty times if you\u2019re a devotee of Australian cricket. Smith knocks away a single first ball to give Warner back the strike with three balls to come. Warner works it through square leg and will get... two, with the aid of a misfield. Thought of the third, couldn\u2019t quite risk it, and he walks away to square leg to clear his head on 199. Two balls left in the over. Blocked to the off side. No run. One ball left. And he gets it! Knocks it to square leg, takes the single, and that is David Warner\u2019s second double century in Test cricket! What a remarkable force o concentration and discipline he has been this summer. The runs keep coming. Shaheen, the pick of Pakistan\u2019s attack yesterday, shares the new ball and he strikes after just two deliveries, castling Labuschagne with a beautiful in-swinging delivery that did for the middle of off stump. A superb delivery to end a superb innings. 83rd over: Australia 369-1 (Warner 197, Labuschagne 162) The new ball IS now taken and Abbas, after that over of looseners, takes it from the river end. It\u2019s a very Abbas over; moderately paced, on a decent line and length, and utterly unthreatening. Warner displays the patience of a man who knows a score of unimaginable magnitude is on offer today, leaving or dead-batting five deliveries then pushing firmly through the covers for two. 82nd over: Australia 367-1 (Warner 195, Labuschagne 162) Turns out we were misled and Pakistan did not take the second new ball after all. Quite why they didn\u2019t, nobody seems able to fathom. The outcome is another pointless over from Yasir that\u2019s too fast, too flat, too short, and too full of runs. \u201cThis is rubbish bowling,\u201d says Ricky Ponting on TV, \u201cabsolute rubbish\u201d. Labuschagne doesn\u2019t mind, bringing up the 350 partnership with a brace of cut boundaries. This ceased to be a contest many hours ago and Azhar Ali doesn\u2019t seem remotely concerned. 81st over: Australia 357-1 (Warner 194, Labuschagne 153) The new ball is taken immediately and the game enters its next phase, hopefully one more competitive than the last few hours of one-sided drubbing. Abbas takes the new pink Kookaburra and settles into his groove on a length around that fourth or fifth stump line but Labuschagne is ready for it, standing tall on his toes and controlling drives into the off-side. A couple hit the field, one pierces the gap for two runs. 80th over: Australia 354-1 (Warner 194, Labuschagne 150) Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s introduction to Test cricket may have arrived in unconventional circumstances but he is to the manor born. The Queenslander brings up his 150 with a nudge off Yasir, a milestone celebrated by Warner by dispatching the Pakistan leggy over cow corner for six of the most contemptuous runs you could find. That\u2019s followed soon afterwards by a rank long-hop being pummelled to the square leg fence for four. If this was a title fight the referee would be giving Pakistan a standing count. 79th over: Australia 342-1 (Warner 183, Labuschagne 149) Both teams are rattling through their work this morning, Iftikhar with a nondescript over, Australia tipping and running to keep the circulation flowing. The tourists are nearly into the new ball. 78th over: Australia 339-1 (Warner 181, Labuschagne 148) Another one for Marnus! The runs keep flowing. Gallops down and plonks Yasir over mid-on for four. They\u2019re going to have some fun today. 77th over: Australia 333-1 (Warner 180, Labuschagne 143) They are not hanging around this morning. Warner creams Iftikhar\u2019s short ball away with a pull shot. The off-spinner replaced the young pace bowler after one over. Curious. Two more runs to fine leg for Marnus. The scoreboard is whirring. 76th over: Australia 325-1 (Warner 175, Labuschagne 140) Yasir starts the over well, just conceding a couple of singles, but Labuschagne finishes it well by carting him over midwicket for four. No hanging around for Australia with the sun shining for the moment in Adelaide. 75th over: Australia 318-1 (Warner 173, Labuschagne 135) If Warner starts fast, Labuschagne starts faster. A four, a two, and a three, all worked through the off side. The boundary was edgy, but the rest were controlled. 11 runs from Musa\u2019s first over. 74th over: Australia 307-1 (Warner 171, Labuschagne 126) Warner started slowly on the second morning in Brisbane. No such approach here, as he gets a gift from Yasir Shah in the form of a short ball, and whacks it to the boundary. Here is the wires report on the action yesterday, if you want the detail. Today is David Warner Day. Sorry if you didn\u2019t get the note. That costume looks great though, Keith. And the Toyota badging is a nice touch. We\u2019re all just playing it by ear, trying to work out something new. Which is what David will be doing, too. See, Davey used to have a particular style. Score big, score fast, put his feet up. For a long time his highest score was that 180 he made in about 15 minutes when he pogoed India all around the WACA. He never batted through a Test day until 2016 at the same ground, when he made 250 against New Zealand. But he got out first thing the next morning. Then last week at the Gabba he went through the day again, and got out without adding much the next morning too. Now in Adelaide he\u2019s had his third bat-through day, and his third chance to go on the next day to a truly huge score. Will it help that the next day is starting in the afternoon, not the morning? Maybe he\u2019s a post-prandial guy. We\u2019ll find out. Because it would be interesting to see what D. Warner can do if he really goes on with an innings. Two days of pain, that sort of thing. Pakistan are sore, sorry, and have once again bowled through a Test day for only the wicket of Joe Burns. Hopefully they rested well and did justice to the breakfast buffet. Australia: 302 for 1 after the first day.",

      "body": "<p>If time makes fools of us all, you couldn\u2019t blame Andr\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Raffray for taking it more personally than most. In 1965, Raffray, a lawyer in the southern French city of Arles, thought he had hit on the real-estate version of a sure thing. The 47-year-old had signed a contract to buy an apartment from one of his clients \u201cen viager\u201d: a form of property sale by which the buyer makes a monthly payment until the seller\u2019s death, when the property becomes theirs. His client, Jeanne Calment, was 90 and sprightly for her age; she liked to surprise people by leaping from her chair at the hairdresser. But still, it couldn\u2019t be long: Raffray just had to shell out 2,500 francs a month and wait it out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jeanne said she had met Van Gogh in her teens. He was ugly and dishevelled, she said; they called him \u2018the dingo\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He never got to live there. Raffray died in 1995, aged 77, by which time Calment was 120 and one of the most famous women in France. She hadn\u2019t lived in the rooms she owned above the Maison Calment, the drapery shop once run by her husband in the heart of Arles, for a decade. Instead, as each birthday thrust her further into the realm of the improbable, Calment held court at La Maison du Lac, the retirement home next to the city hospital. She had no immediate family \u2013 her husband, daughter and grandson were long dead \u2013 but journalists and local notables would regularly visit for an audience. \u201cI waited 110 years to be famous. I mean to make the most of it,\u201d she was reported to have said. One party piece was recounting how, as a teenager, she had met Vincent van Gogh; he was ugly and dishevelled, she said, and locals called him \u201cthe dingo\u201d.</p> <p>The pensioner appeared blessed with the stamina of Methuselah. Still cycling at 100, she only gave up smoking at 117; her doctors concluded that she had a mental capacity equivalent to most octogenarians. Enough, at any rate, to coin the odd zinger: \u201cI wait for death\u2026 and journalists,\u201d she once told a reporter. Aged 121, she recorded a rap CD, Mistress of Time. But even this \u201cMichael Jordan of ageing\u201d, as one geriatrician put it, had only so much road to run. By 1996, she was in steep decline. Using a wheelchair, largely blind and deaf, she finally succumbed on 4 August 1997. At 122, hers was the oldest validated human lifespan in history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2a2b66326fb3d683a8194e0a6f7e787ab8a4bc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2a2b66326fb3d683a8194e0a6f7e787ab8a4bc9/0_222_4576_2745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At 121, Jeanne Calment released a rap CD, Mistress Of Time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At 121, Jeanne Calment released a rap CD, Mistress Of Time: \u2018I waited 110 years to be famous.

Last year, a Russian mathematician called Nikolay Zak made an astonishing claim: that it was not Jeanne Calment who died in 1997, but her daughter, Yvonne. Sceptical about the degree to which Calment had surpassed previous record-holders (the nearest verified claim at the time was 117), Zak had dug into her biography and uncovered a host of inconsistencies. First published on Researchgate, a scientific social networking site, then picked up by bloggers and the Associated Press news agency, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329773795_Jeanne_Calment_the_secret_of_longevity\" title=\"\">Zak\u2019s paper</a> claimed that Jeanne Calment had actually died in 1934; according to official records, this was when Yvonne had lost her life, aged 36, to pleurisy. At this point, Zak alleged, her daughter had assumed her identity \u2013 they looked similar \u2013 and she kept up the pretence for more than 60 years.</p> <p>When the paper went viral, the French press exploded. How dare someone slur a national treasure, the woman dubbed \u201c<em>la doyenne de l\u2019humanit\u00e9</em>\u201d? And who was this upstart Russian anyway? Zak wasn\u2019t even a gerontologist, a specialist in ageing, but a 36-year-old mathematics graduate who worked as a glassblower at Moscow State University and hadn\u2019t published a paper in 10 years.</p> <p>Zak doubled down in response. He published an expanded paper in the US-based journal Rejuvenation Research, in January this year. It compiled a dossier of 17 pieces of biographical evidence supporting the \u201cswitch\u201d theory, including inexplicable physical differences between the young and old Jeanne (a change in eye colour from \u201cdark\u201d to green) and discrepancies in the verbal testimonies she gave while in the retirement home: she claimed to have met Van Gogh in her father\u2019s shop, when Jeanne\u2019s father had been a shipbuilder. He also claimed there had been no public celebration of Jeanne\u2019s 100th birthday, a key reference point in old-age validations.</p> <p>As Zak admitted, there was no smoking gun; but together these pieces of circumstantial evidence did emit a fair amount of smoke. Crucially, he suggested a plausible motive: that Yvonne had taken her mother\u2019s place in order to avoid punitive inheritance taxes, which during the interwar period ran as high as 35%. </p> <p>The debate spread through the French press and international gerontological circles, becoming increasingly heated. Many dismissed Zak\u2019s switch theory as Russian-sponsored \u201cfake news\u201d, as the newspaper Le Parisien put it. Certainly, it seemed to be an attack on western science. As well as Calment, Zak expressed doubts about the validation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Knauss\" title=\"\">Sarah Knauss</a>, a Pennsylvanian insurance office manager who had died in 1999, aged 119, putting her in the silver-medal position behind Calment. Was the Russian trying to sow doubt, so that his countrymen could take the lead in the gerontology field?</p> <p>For the people of Arles, it was a matter of local pride. They quickly rallied behind Calment and formed a Facebook group, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/763398500702857/?ref=bookmarks\" title=\"\">Counter-Investigation into the Jeanne Calment Investigation</a>, to dismantle Zak\u2019s claims. Their members included Calment\u2019s distant relatives, and others who had known her; although some said she had been haughty and waspish, they didn\u2019t want her reputation sullied. They had easy access to the city\u2019s archives, while Zak had never been to Arles: what could he know? He shot back, on their open counter-investigation forum: perhaps the \u201cArl\u00e9siens\u201d were just blinded by their allegiances. \u201cNote that from a distance it is obvious that the Earth is not flat,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Both camps were equally adamant. One, that the woman who died in the Maison du Lac was the longest-lived human being. The other, that she was a gifted and almost inconceivably determined con artist. Which was the real Madame Calment?</p> <p>***</p> <p>An age of 122 seems to defy the limits of the possible. Even two decades later, with average lifespans still rising, no one has come within touching distance of Jeanne Calment. In the supercentenarian league \u2013 110 and above \u2013 the three-year gap between her and Knauss might as well be an aeon.</p> <p>In 1825, the British actuary Benjamin Gompertz came up with a prediction model for human mortality, one which estimated that the risk of death increased exponentially with age, doubling every eight years. His <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function\" title=\"\">\u201cGompertz curve\u201d</a> was quickly taken up by the insurance industry. In the year after a 100th birthday, the chance of death is roughly 50%. Knowing this, Calment\u2019s record looks even more of a statistical long shot.</p> <p>In Arles\u2019s Trinquetaille cemetery, there is little to mark out the person with the world\u2019s longest lucky streak, apart from the small book-shaped plinth engraved <em>\u201c</em><em>La doyenne de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\u201d</em> on her tomb. When I visit in the last days of August, summer has checked out early; the sky is overcast, the first autumn leaves are on the ground. On the mottled, dark-grey marble of Calment\u2019s family tomb stands a pot of fake chrysanthemums and a yellowing succulent. Curiously, Joseph Billot, Jeanne\u2019s son-in-law and Yvonne\u2019s husband, and her grandson Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Billot are marked, but her daughter is not. Yet the cemetery guardian, in a hut a few metres away, assures me that Yvonne is buried with her mother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7eabe11d56002e473192a84d3cfd86faf52c10a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eabe11d56002e473192a84d3cfd86faf52c10a1/0_1193_11773_7060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colette Barb\u00e9, Brigitte Jajcaj and C\u00e9cile Pellegrini.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tintype portraits of Calment\u2019s supporters, who all dispute the fraud theory, from left. Colette Barb\u00e9, Brigitte Jajcaj and C\u00e9cile Pellegrini.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Pierredon/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a hotel garden next to Arles\u2019s Roman amphitheatre, I meet three members of the counter-investigation Facebook group: Colette Barb\u00e9, C\u00e9cile Pellegrini and Brigitte Jajcaj. I mention that it seems odd that Jeanne did not put her own daughter\u2019s name on the family tomb; was it Yvonne who decided not to, trying to tell us she was still alive? \u201cOh, so you followed her all the way to the cemetery, then?\u201d jokes Barb\u00e9. Don\u2019t overthink it, the women say. The grave wasn\u2019t renovated until the 1960s, shortly after Calment\u2019s son-in-law and grandson died (the latter in a car crash); by then, Yvonne had been dead for 30 years, and Jeanne only had the most recent deaths engraved.</p> <p>They are an incongruous trio of detectives: Pellegrini, the group administrator, is a quick, ironic speaker whose half-Vietnamese grandfather opened the city\u2019s first Asian restaurant; Jajcaj has swept-back grey hair, a rose shoulder tattoo and a black-tasselled padlock on a chain around her neck; Barb\u00e9 is a strong-minded bourgeoise, vibrantly attired and draped in jewellery. The counter-investigation has 1,500 members, drawn from all over the globe, although the core group is made up of proud locals. \u201c[Calment] was this elegant lady, even with a cane \u2013 an emblem of Arles,\u201d says Jajcaj. \u201cShe held herself perfectly upright at 102, which was beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after Zak\u2019s paper was published, the group began to scour local archives for evidence that undermined his theory. Distant members of the Calment and Billot families opened up their photo albums and personal papers. In the spirit of open debate, Zak was also accepted on to the forum, where he kept up a running commentary on the new findings. He was collegiate on the surface, acknowledging that he and the counter-investigation had a shared goal: the truth. But over time they felt his attitude \u2013 demanding people chase after evidence on his behalf, unfailingly using it to back up his own theory \u2013 begin to rankle. \u201cSometimes I get the impression that he thinks he understands our way of life and history better than us,\u201d says Barb\u00e9.</p> <p>But digging into the past began to pay dividends. One new photograph donated by a family member showed Yvonne posing on a balcony with a parasol against a mountain backdrop. Clever sleuthing with postcards and Google Maps revealed it to be part of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re sanatorium in Leysin, Switzerland \u2013 consistent with Yvonne\u2019s diagnosis of pleurisy, often a symptom of tuberculosis. Another document seemed to confirm the gravity of her condition: her husband, Joseph, an army colonel, was granted five years of compassionate leave in June 1928 to look after her. Unfortunately, the sanatorium closed in 1960, and its records haven\u2019t survived.</p> <p>If the switch did take place, maintaining this fiction in plain sight would have required an extraordinary and queasy level of deception. Yvonne would have had to share a house with Jeanne\u2019s widower, Fernand, her own father, until his death in 1942; Fernand would have had to pass his daughter off as his wife. Yvonne would have had to force her son Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, seven when \u201cJeanne\u201d died, to stop calling her \u201cMaman\u201d.</p> <p>Many others would need to have been complicit. If Zak knew either the people of Arles or Jeanne Calment, the group argued, he would realise how improbable this was. A conspiracy would have been difficult to maintain in a close-knit population of 20,000, and unlikely given Mme Calment\u2019s reputation as a \u201cdragon\u201d, says Pellegrini. \u201cIf people had known about the fraud, they wouldn\u2019t have protected her,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important blow from the counter-investigation group \u2013 not quite a mortal one, but close \u2013 was attacking Zak\u2019s idea of a financial motive. The Russian had claimed Yvonne was trying to escape a 35% inheritance tax, but the group\u2019s research led them to believe it would have been more like 6-7% \u2013 a rate the family could have managed, with Fernand Calment\u2019s considerable assets.</p> <p>But Zak refused to budge. Only a DNA test, either from Trinquetaille cemetery or a sample of Calment\u2019s blood, rumoured to be stored in a Paris research institute, would settle the matter, he argued. But the women from the counter-investigation group believe he has gone too far down the rabbit hole to consider any theory but his own. \u201cEven if [a DNA test] proves it was Jeanne, he\u2019ll never accept it,\u201d says Pellegrini. \u201cHe\u2019ll say the tests were rigged.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>There is some debate about what happens to rates of mortality in extreme old age. Some researchers believe they continue to rise with the Gompertz curve, until the risk of death in a given year is absolute \u2013 with an effective ceiling to human life somewhere between 119 and 129. Others believe there is no such ceiling, thanks to a phenomenon known as \u201cmortality deceleration\u201d: the plateauing of the death rate after 105. But there are doubts about this plateau, too, due to the frequent misreporting of supercentenarians (mostly due to clerical error, rather than fraud). With such a small dataset even a few errors can skew our understanding of human limits (the <a href=\"http://www.grg.org/\" title=\"\">Gerontology Research Group</a>, based in Los Angeles, estimates that there are about 1,000 living supercentenarians).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A switch would require a queasy level of deception. Yvonne would have had to live as her father\u2019s wife</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The validation of Jeanne Calment\u2019s age, though, is regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d by Jean-Marie Robine, the man who helped carry it out. I meet him at his home in the village of Pignan, just west of Montpellier. Long legs stretched out in aquamarine board shorts under his kitchen table, the researcher still has matinee-idol looks at 68. His work with Calment, carried out as a demographer for the French state organisation Inserm (L\u2019Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale), \u201cnever had validating her age as a mandate,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was to validate the quality of the administrative documents that attested to her age. And from what we had at our disposal, there was nothing dubious.\u201d He points at the unbroken chain of 30 censuses \u2013 every five years up until 1946, then every seven to eight \u2013 that chronicle Jeanne Calment\u2019s life in Arles.</p> <p>Only one \u2013 the 1931 census \u2013 was puzzling. <a href=\"https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm\" title=\"\">Yvonne </a><a href=\"https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm\" title=\"\">is not listed</a> as resident in the family\u2019s Arles apartment, which Zak takes to mean that she was already living semi-secluded in the family\u2019s country house, 10 miles away in the village of Paradou. He argues that she would masquerade as her mother, in order that Jeanne, the one who was really suffering from tuberculosis, could avoid the disease\u2019s social stigma. Robine has a simpler explanation: that Yvonne was at the sanatorium at Leysin.</p> <p>He is scathing about the Russian theory, flatly dismissing it as \u201cpseudo-science\u201d. But he and his co-validator, Michel Allard, have been criticised by Zak, and by some on the counter-investigation forum, for not being more thorough in their own corroborations. They did, however, conduct a series of nearly 40 interviews with Calment at the Maison du Lac, asking for details of her life that only she would know. She made some slips, unsurprisingly for her age, often mixing up her father and husband. (Zak jumped on such mistakes in excerpts of the transcripts later published in a book.) But many other details, such as the names of maids and teachers, largely tallied with the information recorded in censuses and school registers.</p> <p>Robine is softly spoken, but it is hard to get a word in edgeways as he builds his argument. I mention the idea that a DNA test on Calment\u2019s blood could settle the debate. Jeanne\u2019s husband Fernand was her distant cousin, so Yvonne had more ancestors common to both sides of her family than her mother \u2013 something that would be visible in her DNA. Robine can barely hold back his indignation at the suggestion of DNA testing. \u201cWhat are we going to do \u2013 just hand it over to the Russians? To an international committee? To do what? These people are caught up in magical thinking \u2013 that the secret of longevity is in her genes.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>By August 2019, <em>l\u2019affaire Calment</em> had settled into a stalemate. When I speak to Zak over Skype at his dacha on the Ukrainian border, he seems more determined than ever: \u201cWith so much opposition, I want to prove that I am right,\u201d he says. There is a flash of intellectual pride behind his poker-face. Boyish in a blue polo shirt with tousled hair, a slight smile occasionally breaks his composure. \u201cSome people don\u2019t care about facts. So they just hate those who disagree with them,\u201d he shrugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c03dfd4ac9d9ceb6243dcdd53ccaf8f2c4e90056\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c03dfd4ac9d9ceb6243dcdd53ccaf8f2c4e90056/0_0_3823_4744/806.jpg\" alt=\"Russian mathematician Nikolay Zak at Moscow University, Nov 2019\" width=\"806\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian mathematician Nikolay Zak at Moscow University, Nov 2019.

He was interested in the ageing process of the naked mole-rat, an animal with an improbably long lifespan of about 30 years. But he became caught up in the Calment case after making contact on Facebook with Valery Novoselov, head of gerontology at the Moscow Society of Naturalists (MOIP), who had longstanding suspicions about her. Novoselov\u2019s case had been based largely on photographic analysis; he encouraged Zak, who spoke some French, to delve into other aspects, such as biographical and archival evidence. Zak says he had no intention of publishing anything \u2013 until he contacted Jean-Marie Robine about the \u201cproblems\u201d he had found. \u201cHe always had some excuse about why he couldn\u2019t reply, which I thought was strange,\u201d says Zak. \u201cIt was this that made me carry on.\u201d (Robine disputes that he was evasive, saying he corresponded extensively with Zak in October 2018.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, others were beginning to have doubts about Zak and Novoselov. Robert Young, who validates supercentenarians for Guinness World Records, believes the attack on Jeanne Calment is a deliberate attempt to sow doubt about western scientific methods, amounting to \u201cacademic fraud\u201d. He points to what he sees as Zak\u2019s obstinate refusal to consider any scenario other than the switch theory. \u201cPart of the scientific testing method is that we need to be open to multiple possibilities, including that one\u2019s own position may be wrong,\u201d Young says. \u201cYet he self-declares his position to be 99.9% certain.\u201d Zak counters that he has fully analysed the opposite scenario \u2013 that Jeanne was Jeanne \u2013 in follow-up work this year, and rejects accusations of fraud.</p> <p>As well as the lack of academic rigour in the original paper, Young believes its disproportionately high number of reads (70,000, when the revised version only got 1,400) might have been inflated by bots, or human intervention. Zak also manipulated a photograph of a young Yvonne Calment to emphasise what he believed (others dispute it is visible at all) to be a growth on her nose later possessed by her mother. Young alleges that such sleights of hand indicate that Zak, or people working with him, had an ulterior agenda.</p> <p>Still, the switch camp had arguments that couldn\u2019t easily be dismissed. There was Calment\u2019s odd request, when Arles\u2019s archives asked for them, that her personal papers be burned; and a 2006 account in a French industry newspaper of a dinner at which a guest intimated that Calment\u2019s insurers had known of the identity switch, but no action had been taken because she was already too famous. In mid-September, Inserm released an official rebuttal paper, co-authored by Robine, Allard and two others. While it didn\u2019t address every aspect of the Russian case, it was a cool riposte, summarising many of the counter-investigation\u2019s discoveries, and calling for the formal retraction of Zak\u2019s paper.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zak has called for the testing of Calment\u2019s DNA:\u00a0\u2018The potential benefits for\u00a0science are\u00a0huge\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Zak upped the ante. In an open letter sent to prominent gerontologists, longevity researchers and journalists \u2013 with Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and the White House CCed \u2013 he called again for the testing of Calment\u2019s DNA. \u201cI don\u2019t think such a study would be harmful to anybody,\u201d he argued, \u201cwhile the potential benefits for science are huge.\u201d Many people thought Zak had gone too far. One member of the board of Rejuvenation Research, which had published his revised paper, resigned, saying it had \u201cdisgraced the field of gerontology in both Russia and internationally\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Arles, the counter-investigation group were also wondering about the peculiar behaviour of their \u201cRussian friend\u201d. He had been helpful at first, but in the depths of long comment threads he could often be provocative, even goading. One member succeeded in getting Zak temporarily blocked from the forum on 5 March for a slanging match that culminated in the Russian calling him a \u201ccrook\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very unpredictable,\u201d says C\u00e9cile Pellegrini. \u201cSometimes he has a sense of humour, other times he\u2019s odious, and we\u2019re forced to block him for a few days.\u201d They speculate that more than one person might be using his account, and that Zak or the Zaks might be paid trolls. (Zak denies receiving any payment or support from others.) But if Zak is a frontman, who might he be fronting for?</p> <p>***</p> <p>The theory that the Calment attack has been politically directed is dismissed by Novoselov, the gerontologist who tasked Zak with investigating her. \u201cLook, no one in Russia cares at all about this story,\u201d he says. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t care less. There have been two articles in the media, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Novoselov says he is simply following his scientific instincts, and compares the French attachment to Calment to the national cult of Joan of Arc. \u201cTheir ability to believe in such fairytales is one of the fundamental reasons behind the creation of this [longevity] record.\u201d</p> <p>The straight-talking 57-year-old is speaking in the canteen at the Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology in Moscow, where he has just given a lecture on Calment. Having previously argued that Lenin died of syphilis rather than a stroke, Novoselov is used to courting controversy. In January, he declared that his goal was to get Calment struck off the supercentenarians register. Wasn\u2019t it cavalier to do so before there was conclusive evidence? \u201cWhat\u2019s conclusive evidence if there is no material from the patient?\u201d he counters. \u201cIf they showed us her medical records, then maybe we would be convinced.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7eba505b9481640a085ba4a6cbc4c9d83a6a39f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7eba505b9481640a085ba4a6cbc4c9d83a6a39f/0_1584_6290_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aubrey de Grey in Mountain View, California, 12 April 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"843\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aubrey De Grey, in California.

The American took it, says Novoselov, as \u201ca display of aggression by Russia against everything civilised\u201d; after a cordial initial response by email, Young later characterised his work as a conspiracy directed from on high by \u201csomeone important\u201d. But it\u2019s not surprising that Novoselov\u2019s abrasive tactics have raised eyebrows; he has threatened Young, as well as Calment\u2019s validators, with investigation by Sledkom, the Russian FBI.</p> <p>The evidence for a Russian disinformation campaign is thin, but Zak\u2019s paper did have a second sponsor. The peer-reviewed version was published in Rejuvenation Research, the journal devoted to life-extension research edited by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/aubrey-de-grey\" title=\"\">Aubrey de Grey</a>, the controversial gerontologist and life-extension advocate who has claimed that, by 2100, the human lifespan could reach 5,000 years. Even if Zak doesn\u2019t believe it, the possibility that Calment did reach 122 is tantalising for De Grey. \u201cAnyone who is the world record holder of longevity is of interest to those of us studying the biology of ageing,\u201d he tells me.</p> <p>Speaking on the phone from London, where he is on a stopover between Berlin and his home in California, De Grey is evasive about whether his strategy is to force the release of Calment\u2019s blood sample. But he does think it should be made available for science: \u201cIn the interests of saving lives, finding out more about ageing to eventually postpone ageing \u2013 then that\u2019s actually quite important.\u201d Would he want his own research foundation, Sens, to do the DNA testing? Not necessarily, he says, \u201cbut I would certainly know the right kind of researchers to recommend\u201d.</p> <p>That analysis seems unlikely to happen any time soon. The Fondation Jean Dausset, a private genetic research centre in Paris, refuses even to confirm that it is keeping Jeanne Calment\u2019s blood; just that it has a collection of biosamples it alone can use for research under anonymised conditions. But Fran\u00e7ois Sch\u00e4chter, the scientist who in the 1990s founded its Chronos Project, the first genetic survey of centenarians in the world, has confirmed that her blood was taken and her DNA extracted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The life-extension field is beginning to attract serious investment. Google has put $1.5bn towards \u2018solving death\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Twenty years ago, the life-extension field promoted by mavericks like De Grey was outlaw science. Now, the landscape has changed: the technical means for \u201chacking\u201d the human lifespan have come into being, and the sector is beginning to attract serious investment. In 2013, Google invested $1.5bn in an entire division, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/22/silicon-valley-immortality-blood-infusion-gene-therapy\" title=\"\">Calico, devoted to \u201csolving death\u201d</a>. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has given millions of dollars to Sens.</p> <p>But Sens, according to its annual reports, has been running at heavy losses. De Grey says it has been spending the $13m he put into the foundation in 2011 on research for anti-ageing therapies that will save \u201cseveral million\u201d lives. But it must start to pay its way; wouldn\u2019t securing the DNA of the oldest woman in the world be a great publicity coup, as death-dodging tech billionaires pile into the sector? De Grey bats off this idea. \u201cI get enough media attention as it is.\u201d</p> <p>If he could study Calment\u2019s DNA, what might he expect to learn? De Grey points out that supercentenarians\u2019 genetic material contains a high ratio of useful information, \u201cbecause they have to get more things right in order to get to the age they do\u201d. One obvious area of interest is how Calment bypassed cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other late-life killers.</p> <p>Several scientists I spoke to believe that Calment\u2019s genome should be made available for study; but they don\u2019t approve of the way Zak and De Grey have seemingly attempted to force the foundation\u2019s hand. One consequence of promoting the switch theory, they point out, is that they have alienated family members whose own DNA might be crucial in understanding Calment\u2019s.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a Russian news agency announced that a woman who was purportedly 123 had died in the Astrakhan region of southern Russia. This is almost certainly impossible \u2013 even Novoselov thinks so; given her children\u2019s ages, she would have given birth three times in her 50s. But the story underlines the need for gerontology to keep its house in order.</p> <p>At the time of going to press, scientists from around the world were due to discuss the impact of the Calment affair on gerontology at a special meeting in Paris. As for her mortal remains, some think the Fondation Jean Dausset might be more open to collaboration as anti-ageing science evolves \u2013 but it is unlikely to be with De Grey. Despite telling me that Jeanne Calment does not figure high on his priorities, he plans to devote another issue of Rejuvenation Research to age validation and Calment next year.</p> <p>In Arles, despite everything, the counter-investigation group are tickled by the idea that Jeanne Calment might have been a master fraudster. \u201cI would really like the switch story to be true, like in the novels I love reading,\u201d says C\u00e9cile Pellegrini. \u201cI find that kind of thing super-exciting. If it\u2019s actually true, she was really something!\u201d But perhaps the doyenne has something else to teach the would-be immortals of Silicon Valley: what extra trouble would 5,000 years of existence bring, if we can\u2019t get the record straight on a single ordinary lifetime?</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Marc Bennetts</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2019 to correct the spelling of C\u00e9cile Pellegrini\u2019s surname in a photo caption; on 3 December to clarify the interactions between Novoselov and Young; and on 10 December to further clarify Novoselov and Young\u2019s exchange and the circumstances of Nikolay Zak\u2019s photo-editing.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "If time makes fools of us all, you couldn\u2019t blame Andr\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois Raffray for taking it more personally than most. In 1965, Raffray, a lawyer in the southern French city of Arles, thought he had hit on the real-estate version of a sure thing. The 47-year-old had signed a contract to buy an apartment from one of his clients \u201cen viager\u201d: a form of property sale by which the buyer makes a monthly payment until the seller\u2019s death, when the property becomes theirs. His client, Jeanne Calment, was 90 and sprightly for her age; she liked to surprise people by leaping from her chair at the hairdresser. But still, it couldn\u2019t be long: Raffray just had to shell out 2,500 francs a month and wait it out. He never got to live there. Raffray died in 1995, aged 77, by which time Calment was 120 and one of the most famous women in France. She hadn\u2019t lived in the rooms she owned above the Maison Calment, the drapery shop once run by her husband in the heart of Arles, for a decade. Instead, as each birthday thrust her further into the realm of the improbable, Calment held court at La Maison du Lac, the retirement home next to the city hospital. She had no immediate family \u2013 her husband, daughter and grandson were long dead \u2013 but journalists and local notables would regularly visit for an audience. \u201cI waited 110 years to be famous. I mean to make the most of it,\u201d she was reported to have said. One party piece was recounting how, as a teenager, she had met Vincent van Gogh; he was ugly and dishevelled, she said, and locals called him \u201cthe dingo\u201d. The pensioner appeared blessed with the stamina of Methuselah. Still cycling at 100, she only gave up smoking at 117; her doctors concluded that she had a mental capacity equivalent to most octogenarians. Enough, at any rate, to coin the odd zinger: \u201cI wait for death\u2026 and journalists,\u201d she once told a reporter. Aged 121, she recorded a rap CD, Mistress of Time. But even this \u201cMichael Jordan of ageing\u201d, as one geriatrician put it, had only so much road to run. By 1996, she was in steep decline. Using a wheelchair, largely blind and deaf, she finally succumbed on 4 August 1997. At 122, hers was the oldest validated human lifespan in history. Some, though, believe it\u2019s not just time that makes fools of us all. Last year, a Russian mathematician called Nikolay Zak made an astonishing claim: that it was not Jeanne Calment who died in 1997, but her daughter, Yvonne. Sceptical about the degree to which Calment had surpassed previous record-holders (the nearest verified claim at the time was 117), Zak had dug into her biography and uncovered a host of inconsistencies. First published on Researchgate, a scientific social networking site, then picked up by bloggers and the Associated Press news agency, Zak\u2019s paper claimed that Jeanne Calment had actually died in 1934; according to official records, this was when Yvonne had lost her life, aged 36, to pleurisy. At this point, Zak alleged, her daughter had assumed her identity \u2013 they looked similar \u2013 and she kept up the pretence for more than 60 years. When the paper went viral, the French press exploded. How dare someone slur a national treasure, the woman dubbed \u201cla doyenne de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\u201d? And who was this upstart Russian anyway? Zak wasn\u2019t even a gerontologist, a specialist in ageing, but a 36-year-old mathematics graduate who worked as a glassblower at Moscow State University and hadn\u2019t published a paper in 10 years. Zak doubled down in response. He published an expanded paper in the US-based journal Rejuvenation Research, in January this year. It compiled a dossier of 17 pieces of biographical evidence supporting the \u201cswitch\u201d theory, including inexplicable physical differences between the young and old Jeanne (a change in eye colour from \u201cdark\u201d to green) and discrepancies in the verbal testimonies she gave while in the retirement home: she claimed to have met Van Gogh in her father\u2019s shop, when Jeanne\u2019s father had been a shipbuilder. He also claimed there had been no public celebration of Jeanne\u2019s 100th birthday, a key reference point in old-age validations. As Zak admitted, there was no smoking gun; but together these pieces of circumstantial evidence did emit a fair amount of smoke. Crucially, he suggested a plausible motive: that Yvonne had taken her mother\u2019s place in order to avoid punitive inheritance taxes, which during the interwar period ran as high as 35%. The debate spread through the French press and international gerontological circles, becoming increasingly heated. Many dismissed Zak\u2019s switch theory as Russian-sponsored \u201cfake news\u201d, as the newspaper Le Parisien put it. Certainly, it seemed to be an attack on western science. As well as Calment, Zak expressed doubts about the validation of Sarah Knauss, a Pennsylvanian insurance office manager who had died in 1999, aged 119, putting her in the silver-medal position behind Calment. Was the Russian trying to sow doubt, so that his countrymen could take the lead in the gerontology field? For the people of Arles, it was a matter of local pride. They quickly rallied behind Calment and formed a Facebook group, the Counter-Investigation into the Jeanne Calment Investigation, to dismantle Zak\u2019s claims. Their members included Calment\u2019s distant relatives, and others who had known her; although some said she had been haughty and waspish, they didn\u2019t want her reputation sullied. They had easy access to the city\u2019s archives, while Zak had never been to Arles: what could he know? He shot back, on their open counter-investigation forum: perhaps the \u201cArl\u00e9siens\u201d were just blinded by their allegiances. \u201cNote that from a distance it is obvious that the Earth is not flat,\u201d he wrote. Both camps were equally adamant. One, that the woman who died in the Maison du Lac was the longest-lived human being. The other, that she was a gifted and almost inconceivably determined con artist. Which was the real Madame Calment? *** An age of 122 seems to defy the limits of the possible. Even two decades later, with average lifespans still rising, no one has come within touching distance of Jeanne Calment. In the supercentenarian league \u2013 110 and above \u2013 the three-year gap between her and Knauss might as well be an aeon. In 1825, the British actuary Benjamin Gompertz came up with a prediction model for human mortality, one which estimated that the risk of death increased exponentially with age, doubling every eight years. His \u201cGompertz curve\u201d was quickly taken up by the insurance industry. In the year after a 100th birthday, the chance of death is roughly 50%. Knowing this, Calment\u2019s record looks even more of a statistical long shot. In Arles\u2019s Trinquetaille cemetery, there is little to mark out the person with the world\u2019s longest lucky streak, apart from the small book-shaped plinth engraved \u201cLa doyenne de l\u2019humanit\u00e9\u201d on her tomb. When I visit in the last days of August, summer has checked out early; the sky is overcast, the first autumn leaves are on the ground. On the mottled, dark-grey marble of Calment\u2019s family tomb stands a pot of fake chrysanthemums and a yellowing succulent. Curiously, Joseph Billot, Jeanne\u2019s son-in-law and Yvonne\u2019s husband, and her grandson Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Billot are marked, but her daughter is not. Yet the cemetery guardian, in a hut a few metres away, assures me that Yvonne is buried with her mother. In a hotel garden next to Arles\u2019s Roman amphitheatre, I meet three members of the counter-investigation Facebook group: Colette Barb\u00e9, C\u00e9cile Pellegrini and Brigitte Jajcaj. I mention that it seems odd that Jeanne did not put her own daughter\u2019s name on the family tomb; was it Yvonne who decided not to, trying to tell us she was still alive? \u201cOh, so you followed her all the way to the cemetery, then?\u201d jokes Barb\u00e9. Don\u2019t overthink it, the women say. The grave wasn\u2019t renovated until the 1960s, shortly after Calment\u2019s son-in-law and grandson died (the latter in a car crash); by then, Yvonne had been dead for 30 years, and Jeanne only had the most recent deaths engraved. They are an incongruous trio of detectives: Pellegrini, the group administrator, is a quick, ironic speaker whose half-Vietnamese grandfather opened the city\u2019s first Asian restaurant; Jajcaj has swept-back grey hair, a rose shoulder tattoo and a black-tasselled padlock on a chain around her neck; Barb\u00e9 is a strong-minded bourgeoise, vibrantly attired and draped in jewellery. The counter-investigation has 1,500 members, drawn from all over the globe, although the core group is made up of proud locals. \u201c[Calment] was this elegant lady, even with a cane \u2013 an emblem of Arles,\u201d says Jajcaj. \u201cShe held herself perfectly upright at 102, which was beautiful.\u201d Soon after Zak\u2019s paper was published, the group began to scour local archives for evidence that undermined his theory. Distant members of the Calment and Billot families opened up their photo albums and personal papers. In the spirit of open debate, Zak was also accepted on to the forum, where he kept up a running commentary on the new findings. He was collegiate on the surface, acknowledging that he and the counter-investigation had a shared goal: the truth. But over time they felt his attitude \u2013 demanding people chase after evidence on his behalf, unfailingly using it to back up his own theory \u2013 begin to rankle. \u201cSometimes I get the impression that he thinks he understands our way of life and history better than us,\u201d says Barb\u00e9. But digging into the past began to pay dividends. One new photograph donated by a family member showed Yvonne posing on a balcony with a parasol against a mountain backdrop. Clever sleuthing with postcards and Google Maps revealed it to be part of the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re sanatorium in Leysin, Switzerland \u2013 consistent with Yvonne\u2019s diagnosis of pleurisy, often a symptom of tuberculosis. Another document seemed to confirm the gravity of her condition: her husband, Joseph, an army colonel, was granted five years of compassionate leave in June 1928 to look after her. Unfortunately, the sanatorium closed in 1960, and its records haven\u2019t survived. If the switch did take place, maintaining this fiction in plain sight would have required an extraordinary and queasy level of deception. Yvonne would have had to share a house with Jeanne\u2019s widower, Fernand, her own father, until his death in 1942; Fernand would have had to pass his daughter off as his wife. Yvonne would have had to force her son Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, seven when \u201cJeanne\u201d died, to stop calling her \u201cMaman\u201d. Many others would need to have been complicit. If Zak knew either the people of Arles or Jeanne Calment, the group argued, he would realise how improbable this was. A conspiracy would have been difficult to maintain in a close-knit population of 20,000, and unlikely given Mme Calment\u2019s reputation as a \u201cdragon\u201d, says Pellegrini. \u201cIf people had known about the fraud, they wouldn\u2019t have protected her,\u201d she says. Perhaps the most important blow from the counter-investigation group \u2013 not quite a mortal one, but close \u2013 was attacking Zak\u2019s idea of a financial motive. The Russian had claimed Yvonne was trying to escape a 35% inheritance tax, but the group\u2019s research led them to believe it would have been more like 6-7% \u2013 a rate the family could have managed, with Fernand Calment\u2019s considerable assets. But Zak refused to budge. Only a DNA test, either from Trinquetaille cemetery or a sample of Calment\u2019s blood, rumoured to be stored in a Paris research institute, would settle the matter, he argued. But the women from the counter-investigation group believe he has gone too far down the rabbit hole to consider any theory but his own. \u201cEven if [a DNA test] proves it was Jeanne, he\u2019ll never accept it,\u201d says Pellegrini. \u201cHe\u2019ll say the tests were rigged.\u201d *** There is some debate about what happens to rates of mortality in extreme old age. Some researchers believe they continue to rise with the Gompertz curve, until the risk of death in a given year is absolute \u2013 with an effective ceiling to human life somewhere between 119 and 129. Others believe there is no such ceiling, thanks to a phenomenon known as \u201cmortality deceleration\u201d: the plateauing of the death rate after 105. But there are doubts about this plateau, too, due to the frequent misreporting of supercentenarians (mostly due to clerical error, rather than fraud). With such a small dataset even a few errors can skew our understanding of human limits (the Gerontology Research Group, based in Los Angeles, estimates that there are about 1,000 living supercentenarians). The validation of Jeanne Calment\u2019s age, though, is regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d by Jean-Marie Robine, the man who helped carry it out. I meet him at his home in the village of Pignan, just west of Montpellier. Long legs stretched out in aquamarine board shorts under his kitchen table, the researcher still has matinee-idol looks at 68. His work with Calment, carried out as a demographer for the French state organisation Inserm (L\u2019Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale), \u201cnever had validating her age as a mandate,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt was to validate the quality of the administrative documents that attested to her age. And from what we had at our disposal, there was nothing dubious.\u201d He points at the unbroken chain of 30 censuses \u2013 every five years up until 1946, then every seven to eight \u2013 that chronicle Jeanne Calment\u2019s life in Arles. Only one \u2013 the 1931 census \u2013 was puzzling. Yvonne is not listed as resident in the family\u2019s Arles apartment, which Zak takes to mean that she was already living semi-secluded in the family\u2019s country house, 10 miles away in the village of Paradou. He argues that she would masquerade as her mother, in order that Jeanne, the one who was really suffering from tuberculosis, could avoid the disease\u2019s social stigma. Robine has a simpler explanation: that Yvonne was at the sanatorium at Leysin. He is scathing about the Russian theory, flatly dismissing it as \u201cpseudo-science\u201d. But he and his co-validator, Michel Allard, have been criticised by Zak, and by some on the counter-investigation forum, for not being more thorough in their own corroborations. They did, however, conduct a series of nearly 40 interviews with Calment at the Maison du Lac, asking for details of her life that only she would know. She made some slips, unsurprisingly for her age, often mixing up her father and husband. (Zak jumped on such mistakes in excerpts of the transcripts later published in a book.) But many other details, such as the names of maids and teachers, largely tallied with the information recorded in censuses and school registers. Robine is softly spoken, but it is hard to get a word in edgeways as he builds his argument. I mention the idea that a DNA test on Calment\u2019s blood could settle the debate. Jeanne\u2019s husband Fernand was her distant cousin, so Yvonne had more ancestors common to both sides of her family than her mother \u2013 something that would be visible in her DNA. Robine can barely hold back his indignation at the suggestion of DNA testing. \u201cWhat are we going to do \u2013 just hand it over to the Russians? To an international committee? To do what? These people are caught up in magical thinking \u2013 that the secret of longevity is in her genes.\u201d *** By August 2019, l\u2019affaire Calment had settled into a stalemate. When I speak to Zak over Skype at his dacha on the Ukrainian border, he seems more determined than ever: \u201cWith so much opposition, I want to prove that I am right,\u201d he says. There is a flash of intellectual pride behind his poker-face. Boyish in a blue polo shirt with tousled hair, a slight smile occasionally breaks his composure. \u201cSome people don\u2019t care about facts. So they just hate those who disagree with them,\u201d he shrugs. Gerontology had originally been a hobby for Zak. He was interested in the ageing process of the naked mole-rat, an animal with an improbably long lifespan of about 30 years. But he became caught up in the Calment case after making contact on Facebook with Valery Novoselov, head of gerontology at the Moscow Society of Naturalists (MOIP), who had longstanding suspicions about her. Novoselov\u2019s case had been based largely on photographic analysis; he encouraged Zak, who spoke some French, to delve into other aspects, such as biographical and archival evidence. Zak says he had no intention of publishing anything \u2013 until he contacted Jean-Marie Robine about the \u201cproblems\u201d he had found. \u201cHe always had some excuse about why he couldn\u2019t reply, which I thought was strange,\u201d says Zak. \u201cIt was this that made me carry on.\u201d (Robine disputes that he was evasive, saying he corresponded extensively with Zak in October 2018.) Meanwhile, others were beginning to have doubts about Zak and Novoselov. Robert Young, who validates supercentenarians for Guinness World Records, believes the attack on Jeanne Calment is a deliberate attempt to sow doubt about western scientific methods, amounting to \u201cacademic fraud\u201d. He points to what he sees as Zak\u2019s obstinate refusal to consider any scenario other than the switch theory. \u201cPart of the scientific testing method is that we need to be open to multiple possibilities, including that one\u2019s own position may be wrong,\u201d Young says. \u201cYet he self-declares his position to be 99.9% certain.\u201d Zak counters that he has fully analysed the opposite scenario \u2013 that Jeanne was Jeanne \u2013 in follow-up work this year, and rejects accusations of fraud. As well as the lack of academic rigour in the original paper, Young believes its disproportionately high number of reads (70,000, when the revised version only got 1,400) might have been inflated by bots, or human intervention. Zak also manipulated a photograph of a young Yvonne Calment to emphasise what he believed (others dispute it is visible at all) to be a growth on her nose later possessed by her mother. Young alleges that such sleights of hand indicate that Zak, or people working with him, had an ulterior agenda. Still, the switch camp had arguments that couldn\u2019t easily be dismissed. There was Calment\u2019s odd request, when Arles\u2019s archives asked for them, that her personal papers be burned; and a 2006 account in a French industry newspaper of a dinner at which a guest intimated that Calment\u2019s insurers had known of the identity switch, but no action had been taken because she was already too famous. In mid-September, Inserm released an official rebuttal paper, co-authored by Robine, Allard and two others. While it didn\u2019t address every aspect of the Russian case, it was a cool riposte, summarising many of the counter-investigation\u2019s discoveries, and calling for the formal retraction of Zak\u2019s paper. Zak upped the ante. In an open letter sent to prominent gerontologists, longevity researchers and journalists \u2013 with Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and the White House CCed \u2013 he called again for the testing of Calment\u2019s DNA. \u201cI don\u2019t think such a study would be harmful to anybody,\u201d he argued, \u201cwhile the potential benefits for science are huge.\u201d Many people thought Zak had gone too far. One member of the board of Rejuvenation Research, which had published his revised paper, resigned, saying it had \u201cdisgraced the field of gerontology in both Russia and internationally\u201d. Back in Arles, the counter-investigation group were also wondering about the peculiar behaviour of their \u201cRussian friend\u201d. He had been helpful at first, but in the depths of long comment threads he could often be provocative, even goading. One member succeeded in getting Zak temporarily blocked from the forum on 5 March for a slanging match that culminated in the Russian calling him a \u201ccrook\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very unpredictable,\u201d says C\u00e9cile Pellegrini. \u201cSometimes he has a sense of humour, other times he\u2019s odious, and we\u2019re forced to block him for a few days.\u201d They speculate that more than one person might be using his account, and that Zak or the Zaks might be paid trolls. (Zak denies receiving any payment or support from others.) But if Zak is a frontman, who might he be fronting for? *** The theory that the Calment attack has been politically directed is dismissed by Novoselov, the gerontologist who tasked Zak with investigating her. \u201cLook, no one in Russia cares at all about this story,\u201d he says. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t care less. There have been two articles in the media, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Novoselov says he is simply following his scientific instincts, and compares the French attachment to Calment to the national cult of Joan of Arc. \u201cTheir ability to believe in such fairytales is one of the fundamental reasons behind the creation of this [longevity] record.\u201d The straight-talking 57-year-old is speaking in the canteen at the Research Center for Obstetrics, Gynecology and Perinatology in Moscow, where he has just given a lecture on Calment. Having previously argued that Lenin died of syphilis rather than a stroke, Novoselov is used to courting controversy. In January, he declared that his goal was to get Calment struck off the supercentenarians register. Wasn\u2019t it cavalier to do so before there was conclusive evidence? \u201cWhat\u2019s conclusive evidence if there is no material from the patient?\u201d he counters. \u201cIf they showed us her medical records, then maybe we would be convinced.\u201d Novoselov wrote to Young about Calment in October 2018, \u201casking him to look attentively at the issues we raised\u201d. The American took it, says Novoselov, as \u201ca display of aggression by Russia against everything civilised\u201d; after a cordial initial response by email, Young later characterised his work as a conspiracy directed from on high by \u201csomeone important\u201d. But it\u2019s not surprising that Novoselov\u2019s abrasive tactics have raised eyebrows; he has threatened Young, as well as Calment\u2019s validators, with investigation by Sledkom, the Russian FBI. The evidence for a Russian disinformation campaign is thin, but Zak\u2019s paper did have a second sponsor. The peer-reviewed version was published in Rejuvenation Research, the journal devoted to life-extension research edited by Aubrey de Grey, the controversial gerontologist and life-extension advocate who has claimed that, by 2100, the human lifespan could reach 5,000 years. Even if Zak doesn\u2019t believe it, the possibility that Calment did reach 122 is tantalising for De Grey. \u201cAnyone who is the world record holder of longevity is of interest to those of us studying the biology of ageing,\u201d he tells me. Speaking on the phone from London, where he is on a stopover between Berlin and his home in California, De Grey is evasive about whether his strategy is to force the release of Calment\u2019s blood sample. But he does think it should be made available for science: \u201cIn the interests of saving lives, finding out more about ageing to eventually postpone ageing \u2013 then that\u2019s actually quite important.\u201d Would he want his own research foundation, Sens, to do the DNA testing? Not necessarily, he says, \u201cbut I would certainly know the right kind of researchers to recommend\u201d. That analysis seems unlikely to happen any time soon. The Fondation Jean Dausset, a private genetic research centre in Paris, refuses even to confirm that it is keeping Jeanne Calment\u2019s blood; just that it has a collection of biosamples it alone can use for research under anonymised conditions. But Fran\u00e7ois Sch\u00e4chter, the scientist who in the 1990s founded its Chronos Project, the first genetic survey of centenarians in the world, has confirmed that her blood was taken and her DNA extracted. Twenty years ago, the life-extension field promoted by mavericks like De Grey was outlaw science. Now, the landscape has changed: the technical means for \u201chacking\u201d the human lifespan have come into being, and the sector is beginning to attract serious investment. In 2013, Google invested $1.5bn in an entire division, Calico, devoted to \u201csolving death\u201d. PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has given millions of dollars to Sens. But Sens, according to its annual reports, has been running at heavy losses. De Grey says it has been spending the $13m he put into the foundation in 2011 on research for anti-ageing therapies that will save \u201cseveral million\u201d lives. But it must start to pay its way; wouldn\u2019t securing the DNA of the oldest woman in the world be a great publicity coup, as death-dodging tech billionaires pile into the sector? De Grey bats off this idea. \u201cI get enough media attention as it is.\u201d If he could study Calment\u2019s DNA, what might he expect to learn? De Grey points out that supercentenarians\u2019 genetic material contains a high ratio of useful information, \u201cbecause they have to get more things right in order to get to the age they do\u201d. One obvious area of interest is how Calment bypassed cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other late-life killers. Several scientists I spoke to believe that Calment\u2019s genome should be made available for study; but they don\u2019t approve of the way Zak and De Grey have seemingly attempted to force the foundation\u2019s hand. One consequence of promoting the switch theory, they point out, is that they have alienated family members whose own DNA might be crucial in understanding Calment\u2019s. Earlier this month, a Russian news agency announced that a woman who was purportedly 123 had died in the Astrakhan region of southern Russia. This is almost certainly impossible \u2013 even Novoselov thinks so; given her children\u2019s ages, she would have given birth three times in her 50s. But the story underlines the need for gerontology to keep its house in order. At the time of going to press, scientists from around the world were due to discuss the impact of the Calment affair on gerontology at a special meeting in Paris. As for her mortal remains, some think the Fondation Jean Dausset might be more open to collaboration as anti-ageing science evolves \u2013 but it is unlikely to be with De Grey. Despite telling me that Jeanne Calment does not figure high on his priorities, he plans to devote another issue of Rejuvenation Research to age validation and Calment next year. In Arles, despite everything, the counter-investigation group are tickled by the idea that Jeanne Calment might have been a master fraudster. \u201cI would really like the switch story to be true, like in the novels I love reading,\u201d says C\u00e9cile Pellegrini. \u201cI find that kind of thing super-exciting. If it\u2019s actually true, she was really something!\u201d But perhaps the doyenne has something else to teach the would-be immortals of Silicon Valley: what extra trouble would 5,000 years of existence bring, if we can\u2019t get the record straight on a single ordinary lifetime? \u2022 Additional reporting by Marc Bennetts \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2019 to correct the spelling of C\u00e9cile Pellegrini\u2019s surname in a photo caption; on 3 December to clarify the interactions between Novoselov and Young; and on 10 December to further clarify Novoselov and Young\u2019s exchange and the circumstances of Nikolay Zak\u2019s photo-editing. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

A new addition for the 50th anniversary is a picnic viewpoint at the top of the Comborci\u00e8re lift at 2,307 metres, a beautiful spot of wooden terraces, sunloungers and views of Mont Blanc. The Snowpark had me in stitches as I watched people attempt \u2013 and fail \u2013 to tackle the waterslide, a 30-metre run-up to a jump over a 15-metre pool. All around was the same laid-back, friendly atmosphere \u2013 a resort that is, as the French say, bien dans sa peau (happy in its own skin). Even though I\u2019m still a sucker for the chocolate-box look, I had to applaud Perriand\u2019s humanist approach to capturing the magic of the mountains. \u2022 The trip was provided by Erna Low, which has seven nights\u2019 self-catering at Arc 1950 Le Village from \u20ac1,038pp, including Eurotunnel crossing. Les Arcs tourist office runs archi-ski tours for \u20ac7, and free walking tours. A Charlotte Perriand exhibition, Inventing a New World, is at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris until 24 February 2020 (\u20ac16 adult, under 26s \u20ac10, under 18s \u20ac5) Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The poles are the perfect realms in which to find the sublime. Francis Spufford\u2019s first book, <strong>I May Be Some Time</strong>, traces the history of polar exploration and its place in the cultural imagination, in particular the attempts by explorers such as William Parry, John Franklin and Robert Falcon Scott to capture their experience. The book moves towards a vivid and chilling re-creation of that fateful expedition and those famous last words.</p> <p>Joanna Kavenna\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview1\" title=\"\">The Ice Museum</a></strong> is another work of non-fiction that pursues the idea of a remote, half-imagined north. Kavenna writes brilliantly about bleak, inhospitable places, and about the dangerous ideologies that can be written on the seeming blank page of a lost northern land \u2013 Thule has a place in Nazi mythology as the home of the Aryan race. She meets people who are struggling at the edges of the ice: displaced Inuit in Greenland, and environmental scientists on Svalbard, who measure the melting ice.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/07/barry-lopez-horizons-environment-climate-change\" title=\"\">Barry Lopez</a>\u2019s seminal work of nature writing <strong>Arctic Dreams</strong> finds his exacting, luminous prose focusing on the landscape of the north, the animals that live there and the peoples who populate it, on the complex beauty of the ways that life and landscape co-exist, and the fragility of that compact. The magnificent chapter \u201cIce and Light\u201d is a study of the formation, appearance and varieties of Arctic ice. Written in the 1980s, this is a gorgeous yet austere, unsentimental book, which offers a prescient warning about human complacency towards Earth\u2019s remaining wilderness.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/05/painter-to-the-king-by-amy-sackville-review-a-virtuoso-portrait-of-velazquez\" title=\"\">Painter to the King</a> by Amy Sackville is published by Granta.</em></p>",

It is set in a world of nameless, ruined cities, freezing seas and dark forests, in which some obscure disaster has precipitated environmental collapse. Communication is failing, the media can\u2019t be trusted, conflict is rife, and ice is closing in, destroying everything in its path. The book falls somewhere between compelling spy thriller and cold war Kafka \u2013 there are overcoats, paranoia, police states and a white-haired girl that the narrator is senselessly pursuing \u2026 Accounts of polar expeditions are typically preoccupied by the impossible task of describing the infinite forms and variety, as well as the overwhelming magnitude, of the ice. The poles are the perfect realms in which to find the sublime. Francis Spufford\u2019s first book, I May Be Some Time, traces the history of polar exploration and its place in the cultural imagination, in particular the attempts by explorers such as William Parry, John Franklin and Robert Falcon Scott to capture their experience. The book moves towards a vivid and chilling re-creation of that fateful expedition and those famous last words. Joanna Kavenna\u2019s The Ice Museum is another work of non-fiction that pursues the idea of a remote, half-imagined north. Kavenna writes brilliantly about bleak, inhospitable places, and about the dangerous ideologies that can be written on the seeming blank page of a lost northern land \u2013 Thule has a place in Nazi mythology as the home of the Aryan race. She meets people who are struggling at the edges of the ice: displaced Inuit in Greenland, and environmental scientists on Svalbard, who measure the melting ice. Barry Lopez\u2019s seminal work of nature writing Arctic Dreams finds his exacting, luminous prose focusing on the landscape of the north, the animals that live there and the peoples who populate it, on the complex beauty of the ways that life and landscape co-exist, and the fragility of that compact. The magnificent chapter \u201cIce and Light\u201d is a study of the formation, appearance and varieties of Arctic ice. Written in the 1980s, this is a gorgeous yet austere, unsentimental book, which offers a prescient warning about human complacency towards Earth\u2019s remaining wilderness. \u2022 Painter to the King by Amy Sackville is published by Granta.",

The film moved fan favourite Rey to the fore and raised some tough questions about her parentage, drawing the ire of a small but vocal contingent of franchise purists. These diehards set up petitions to have the movie wiped from existence, deluged Rotten Tomatoes with negative reviews, and flooded Johnson\u2019s Twitter account with bile.</p> <p>Yet Johnson is sanguine about the onslaught he has received online. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s online is going to encounter some degree of trolling.

The country\u2019s introduction of the TLD regimen is likely to have a far-reaching impact on HIV incidence in South Africa as well as the global response, said Dr Michelle Moorhouse, of Ezintsha, Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg. \u201cWe are likely to see a dramatic impact on the rate of new infections,\u201d said Moorhouse. \u201cIn fact, moving to DTG could halve the number of new infections in South Africa between now and 2038, especially if we get people on treatment more quickly. And as HIV in South Africa accounts for about 20% of infections globally, this impacts the global infection rate.\u201d Just 24.5 million of the estimated 37.9 million people living worldwide with HIV are currently on ARVs, said Matiru. \u201cOnce South Africa scales up its response to include the 3 million who aren\u2019t currently on treatment, that will help close the global gap.\u201d Although global HIV infections among adults have dropped by 17% since 2010, the decline is far short of the 60% drop required in 2018 to meet global HIV prevention targets, according to the Global HIV Prevention Coalition. Just 28 countries account for 75% of all new HIV infections globally, according to a report published by the coalition in October \u2013 and some of them, including Nigeria and Pakistan, have shown a troubling increase in infections. A dozen countries have reduced new adult HIV infections by 26% or more since 2010, including South Africa (39%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (37%), Uganda (36%), and Zimbabwe (28%). However, in Nigeria, new adult HIV infections increased by 8% from 2010, while in Pakistan new adult HIV infections rose by a staggering 56%. Tabitha Ha, advocacy manager at StopAids, said: \u201cDespite progress over the past few decades, HIV infection rates are still increasing at alarming rates in places such as Pakistan and South Sudan, and in regions such as eastern Europe. \u201cThis means we are off track in meeting our global goal target to end Aids by 2030. While some countries are stepping up the fight, others are lagging way behind. \u201cGlobal prevention efforts need to be ramped up urgently in order to get us back on track and offer us the opportunity to turn the tide. We must collectively increase our financial investment in prevention tools, break down stigma and discrimination, as well as remove the legal and structural barriers that prevent people most likely to be affected with HIV from accessing healthcare.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Picture books Jackie Morris\u2019s The Secret of the Tattered Shoes (Tiny Owl) is an atmospheric retelling of the story of \u201cThe Twelve Dancing Princesses\u201d, in which the hero ultimately refuses to marry one of the callous princesses, choosing instead to search for the mysterious forest woman who helped him. Ehsan Abdollahi\u2019s marionette-like collaged illustrations transport the reader deep into the heart of the tale, where gilded tree branches glisten and opalescent fruit begs to be plucked. Also in fairytale vein is Oliver Jeffers, whose story The Fate of Fausto (HarperCollins) warns quietly against hubris. Arrogant Fausto believes he owns the world; everywhere he goes, his \u201csubjects\u201d bow to him, from trees to mountains \u2013 until he attempts to demand homage from the sea. Spacious, luminous lithographic illustrations combine with stark hand-set text in this powerful, beautiful fable. Bouncy and mischievous, Sally Nicholls\u2019s The Button Book (Andersen) is illustrated with giddy, infectious energy by Bethan Woollvin. What happens when the book\u2019s different \u201cbuttons\u201d are pressed? Some prompt tickles, some hugs \u2013 and one a very rude noise indeed \u2013 but all contribute to a rising tide of giggles, ebbing calmly away to a wind-down bedtime message; the best sort of interactive, read-aloud fun. Five to eight years Slightly older fairytale fans, especially those who enjoy Rebel Girls-style empowerment, will relish the interconnected stories in Eight Princesses and a Magic Mirror (Zephyr) by Natasha Farrant, enriched by Lydia Corry\u2019s delicious full-colour pictures. When an enchantress flings her magic mirror into our world, the girls it reflects are bold, courageous and determined \u2013 from the desert princess who protects her people from war to the tower-block princess who saves a community garden. From award-winning writer David Long, and brought deftly to life by Sarah McMenemy\u2019s intricate images, The Story of the London Underground (Bloomsbury) plots the development of the tube from the fume-filled, steam-powered London Metropolitan Railway to the present-day network with its millions of passengers, via fascinating facts about ghost stations, bizarre lost property and carriages divided by class. Meticulous and fascinating, it will appeal to readers with a taste for the secret quirks of history. For wildlife aficionados, Ben Rothery\u2019s oversized Hidden Planet (Ladybird) is filled with stunning illustrations: a komodo dragon on whose skin every scale is visible, two pages of milling, dazzling zebras, a meditative octopus and a poised satanic leaf-tailed gecko. The engaging text is full of intriguing detail, such as orderly queues of hermit crabs waiting for the right-sized shell to be vacated, or the barn owl\u2019s heart-shaped face, which acts like a radar dish to guide sounds into its ears. Eight to 12 years Handsomely slip-cased in psychedelic colours, James Rhodes\u2019s Playlist (Wren &amp; Rook) is the classical pianist\u2019s introduction to seven notable composers, complete with irreverent biographical detail (Beethoven peeing into a chamber pot under the piano), accessible and intriguing analysis, helpful definitions of terms such as \u00e9tude, and a Spotify playlist of introductory teasers from pieces such as Mozart\u2019s Requiem and Chopin\u2019s \u201cNocturne No 2\u201d. Subtitled \u201cThe Rebels and Revolutionaries of Sound\u201d, at its heart is Rhodes\u2019 passionate determination to demonstrate classical music\u2019s iconoclastic and emotional power.

This fast-paced, thrilling story has it all \u2013 a charismatic 1920s New York setting, a sensationally sinister villain, a determined, likable heroine and feats of daring couched in engaging prose. Nicola Skinner\u2019s debut Bloom (HarperCollins) is illustrated with vine-wreathed charm by Flavia Sorrentino.

Hardinge\u2019s surreal powers of world-building combine with her astute understanding of human relationships to create a weird, wonderful, beguiling novel. YA Malorie Blackman returns to the world of Noughts &amp; Crosses (where the black Crosses dominate society, and white Noughts are seen as inferior) in Crossfire (Penguin), and the political stakes are high.

      "body": "<p>It has been a year of doubles: two Nobel laureates, two Booker winners, even two Ian McEwan novels (his Kafka-lite satire <em>The Cockroach</em> was yet more fallout from Brexit). Having promised to look beyond Europe after skipping the award in 2018, the Nobel committee honoured two Europeans: the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk and, more controversially, Austrian Milo\u0161evi\u0107-supporter Peter Handke. Closer to home, the UK\u2019s general air of indecision infected the Booker prize, which split the award in two, thus missing the chance to crown Bernardine Evaristo outright as the first ever black female winner for her innovative and life-affirming <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\">Girl, Woman, Other</a></strong> (Hamish Hamilton), interlinked stories of black British women which brim with heart and humour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6bb66f83866ba251f52ffd91a7a6b7e0accb2ca1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb66f83866ba251f52ffd91a7a6b7e0accb2ca1/0_0_640_1030/621.jpg\" alt=\"Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo\" width=\"621\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Evaristo shared the prize with the year\u2019s biggest book by far: Margaret Atwood\u2019s <em>Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> sequel <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-testaments-9781784742324.html\" title=\"\">The Testaments </a></strong>(Chatto), which combines Aunt Lydia\u2019s sly perspective on the theocratic regime \u2013 its brutal birth and her ambiguous role at the heart of it \u2013 with more action-adventure strands about the two young women seeking to bring it down. Fan-pleaser, literary curio, a fascinating example of the interplay between written fiction and TV: the book is all three, with Atwood\u2019s musings on power and the patterns of history as incisive as ever.</p> <p>If history felt like a hall of mirrors in 2019, and current affairs a car crash, then Deborah Levy\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-man-who-saw-everything-9780241268025.html\" title=\"\">The Man Who Saw Everything</a></strong> (Hamish Hamilton) \u2013 the riddling story of one man, two time zones and two car accidents \u2013 was the novel to read. In the late 80s, Saul goes to East Berlin to study; in the recent past, he faces up to the rest of his life. Skewering different forms of totalitarianism \u2013 from the state, to the family, to the strictures of the male gaze \u2013 Levy explodes conventional narrative to explore the individual\u2019s place and culpability within history. It\u2019s one of the most unusual and rewarding novels of this or any year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"437c75ba7d259eb133fd064aab10798ca2061f0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/437c75ba7d259eb133fd064aab10798ca2061f0f/0_0_1614_2560/630.jpg\" alt=\"The Heavens by Sandra Newman\" width=\"630\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The timelines of history are similarly unstable in Sandra Newman\u2019s high-concept <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-heavens-9781783784844.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Heavens</a> </strong>(Granta), in which a woman leads a double existence, waking up sometimes as Shakespeare\u2019s Dark Lady in Renaissance England and sometimes in a 21st-century New York that is getting progressively worse. Can her actions really be influencing world events hundreds of years later? How far do we make our own reality? This is a dazzling exploration of creativity and madness in the poignant, panic-tinged end times.</p> <p>The power of myth-making drives Mark Haddon\u2019s best novel yet. <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-porpoise-9781784742829.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Porpoise</a></strong> (Chatto) begins as a propulsive thriller about abuse among the super-rich and segues into a classical-world adventure that reinvents the story of Pericles in prose of a hallucinatory vividness.

Its portrait of individual dramas unfolding against the prospect of apocalypse speaks to current fears of climate crisis and Brexit alike.</p> <p>Robert Harris also conjured a quasi-medieval world for a page-turning, thought-provoking speculation on the fragility of civilisation, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/09/the-second-sleep-robert-harris-review\">The Second Sleep</a> </strong>(Hutchinson). It\u2019s 1468, and a young priest is investigating ancient artefacts: Harris reveals his setup to be ingeniously, chillingly topical. Ali Smith reached book three of her quickfire Seasonal Quartet, which interprets news headlines through the filters of art and story.

      "bodyText": "It has been a year of doubles: two Nobel laureates, two Booker winners, even two Ian McEwan novels (his Kafka-lite satire The Cockroach was yet more fallout from Brexit). Having promised to look beyond Europe after skipping the award in 2018, the Nobel committee honoured two Europeans: the Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk and, more controversially, Austrian Milo\u0161evi\u0107-supporter Peter Handke. Closer to home, the UK\u2019s general air of indecision infected the Booker prize, which split the award in two, thus missing the chance to crown Bernardine Evaristo outright as the first ever black female winner for her innovative and life-affirming Girl, Woman, Other (Hamish Hamilton), interlinked stories of black British women which brim with heart and humour. Evaristo shared the prize with the year\u2019s biggest book by far: Margaret Atwood\u2019s Handmaid\u2019s Tale sequel The Testaments (Chatto), which combines Aunt Lydia\u2019s sly perspective on the theocratic regime \u2013 its brutal birth and her ambiguous role at the heart of it \u2013 with more action-adventure strands about the two young women seeking to bring it down. Fan-pleaser, literary curio, a fascinating example of the interplay between written fiction and TV: the book is all three, with Atwood\u2019s musings on power and the patterns of history as incisive as ever. If history felt like a hall of mirrors in 2019, and current affairs a car crash, then Deborah Levy\u2019s The Man Who Saw Everything (Hamish Hamilton) \u2013 the riddling story of one man, two time zones and two car accidents \u2013 was the novel to read. In the late 80s, Saul goes to East Berlin to study; in the recent past, he faces up to the rest of his life. Skewering different forms of totalitarianism \u2013 from the state, to the family, to the strictures of the male gaze \u2013 Levy explodes conventional narrative to explore the individual\u2019s place and culpability within history. It\u2019s one of the most unusual and rewarding novels of this or any year. The timelines of history are similarly unstable in Sandra Newman\u2019s high-concept The Heavens (Granta), in which a woman leads a double existence, waking up sometimes as Shakespeare\u2019s Dark Lady in Renaissance England and sometimes in a 21st-century New York that is getting progressively worse. Can her actions really be influencing world events hundreds of years later? How far do we make our own reality? This is a dazzling exploration of creativity and madness in the poignant, panic-tinged end times. The power of myth-making drives Mark Haddon\u2019s best novel yet. The Porpoise (Chatto) begins as a propulsive thriller about abuse among the super-rich and segues into a classical-world adventure that reinvents the story of Pericles in prose of a hallucinatory vividness. Fantasy also mingles with reality in Max Porter\u2019s light-footed second novel Lanny (Faber), as contemporary communal chatter and a spirit voice from deep time rise and fall together to tell the story of an extraordinary boy in an ordinary English village. James Meek wound the clock back to 14th-century England for a feat of scholarship and storytelling combined. Written in gleeful approximations of priestly, courtly and peasant medieval English, To Calais, in Ordinary Time (Canongate) follows a motley group of travellers in the shadow of the Black Death. Its portrait of individual dramas unfolding against the prospect of apocalypse speaks to current fears of climate crisis and Brexit alike. Robert Harris also conjured a quasi-medieval world for a page-turning, thought-provoking speculation on the fragility of civilisation, The Second Sleep (Hutchinson). It\u2019s 1468, and a young priest is investigating ancient artefacts: Harris reveals his setup to be ingeniously, chillingly topical. Ali Smith reached book three of her quickfire Seasonal Quartet, which interprets news headlines through the filters of art and story. Like Haddon, Smith was inspired by Pericles, an apt fable for an era of globalised migration. She uses it in Spring (Hamish Hamilton) as a bedrock for a typically agile story about narrowing horizons and widening inequality, which is also a furious indictment of the UK\u2019s detention of refugees. The distribution and morality of wealth is an ever more urgent subject. The TV sensation Succession tackled money\u2019s corrupting effect within a family; Sadie Jones did a similarly brilliant job in The Snakes (Chatto), a psychodrama about avarice, abuse and entitlement which is both a cautionary tale and a pitch-black race-to-the-end thriller. It was an exceptional year for US fiction, with Tayari Jones winning the Women\u2019s prize for An American Marriage (Oneworld), about black middle-class lives undone by structural racism, and Anglo-American Lucy Ellmann taking the Goldsmiths for her 1,000-page denunciation of Trump\u2019s America and the world\u2019s devaluing of motherhood, Ducks, Newburyport (Galley Beggar). Rising star Ben Lerner came into his own with the stunningly multilayered The Topeka School (Granta), exploring voice, power and masculinity in the 90s and now. T\u00e9a Obrecht\u2019s long-awaited second novel Inland (W&amp;N) is an ingenious reinvention of the western, while Colson Whitehead\u2019s follow-up to The Underground Railroad, The Nickel Boys (Fleet), lifts the lid on the racist brutality of reform schools in the Jim Crow-era south. Ann Patchett\u2019s The Dutch House (Bloomsbury) is a gloriously immersive family saga about lost inheritance, while in Olive, Again (Viking) Elizabeth Strout continues to find moments of transcendence in the trials of daily life as her obstreperous, much-loved character Olive Kitteridge moves into her 80s. Chinese-American writer Yiyun Li\u2019s Where Reasons End (Hamish Hamilton), a dialogue between a mother and the teenage son she has lost to suicide, is spare, profound and devastating. Vietnamese-American poet Ocean Vuong\u2019s autobiographical first novel On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous (Jonathan Cape) is a tender exploration of violence, migration and language, while Mexican author Valeria Luiselli\u2019s Lost Children Archive (4th Estate), her first novel to be written in English, is an extraordinary achievement. It puts the desperate children crossing the border into the US at the heart of a beautifully composed, complex investigation into family, motherhood and the fragile connections between people. Debuts to celebrate included Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s witty Queenie (Trapeze), the adventures of a young black woman negotiating dating, family and identity in a gentrifying London, and Sara Collins\u2019s The Confessions of Frannie Langton, a fantastically assured piece of historical gothic about an enslaved girl brought from a Jamaican plantation into the backbiting milieu of London society. Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u2019s Fleishman Is in Trouble (Wildfire), a dissection of sexual politics in contemporary New York, was a deliciously biting summer hit. Debuts stood out in the world of short stories, too, notably Wendy Erskine\u2019s clear-eyed tales of Belfast life in Sweet Home and Julia Armfield\u2019s haunting Salt Slow (both Picador). All eyes were on Kristen \u201cCat Person\u201d Roupenian, whose first collection You Know You Want This (Cape) skewed towards urban gothic rather than dating malaise. Queen of dark short fiction Sarah Hall brought us more expertly turned tales of sex, death and danger in Sudden Traveller (Faber), while Zadie Smith\u2019s first collection, Grand Union (Hamish Hamilton), is a restlessly wide-ranging anthology covering two decades. In Deborah Eisenberg\u2019s wryly subversive Your Duck Is My Duck (Europa), we had the first collection in 12 years from a US master of the form. One of the year\u2019s gems in translation was Will and Testament by Vigdis Hjorth (Verso), translated by Charlotte Barslund. A story of abuse, inheritance and the battle for the truth among a privileged Norwegian family, it grips like a vice while interrogating national as well as individual self-conception. Other standouts included Khaled Khalifa\u2019s Death Is Hard Work (Faber), translated by Leri Price, a road trip set against the backdrop of the Syrian civil war, and Pajtim Statovci\u2019s Crossing (Pushkin), translated by David Hackston, which explores migration, gender and self-invention through the shifting character of a young Albanian.

      "bodyText": "The biggest story in graphic novels this year was the return of Chris Ware, whose Jimmy Corrigan and Building Stories have previously lifted the form to new heights. At the heart of the epically inventive Rusty Brown (Jonathan Cape) is a single day at a Nebraska school in the mid-1970s, from which Ware spins the life stories of a shy nerd, his frustrated father, the privileged class jerk and a thoughtful, banjo-playing teacher. A doll is lost, a space mission charted, a car crashed and cupcakes baked, while snow tumbles, pages turn red with trauma and panels shrink to postage-stamp proportions \u2013 this is beauty you have to squint at. Childhood and the past underpin many of the year\u2019s finest books. In Clyde Fans (Drawn &amp; Quarterly), Canadian graphic novelist cartoonist Seth offers a masterly account of the passing of time. Two brothers inherit their father\u2019s fan business, and struggle with new technologies, relationships and each other as the 20th century rumbles onwards. There\u2019s plenty of quiet desperation, but also a serene beauty in carefully drawn shopfronts, and a warmth to Seth\u2019s slow waltz through fading lives. The darkness in Jaime Hernandez\u2019s Is This How You See Me? (Fantagraphics) is mixed with friendship, joy and the shared sweat of the moshpit. Hernandez regulars Maggie and Hopey head to a punk gig with their old crew in a book that brilliantly captures the emotional charge of a reunion, and the politics and in-jokes of ageing scenesters. It\u2019s an array of scraped knees, bashed noses, irony and regret. Hair is centre stage in Ebony Flowers\u2019s debut Hot Comb (Drawn &amp; Quarterly), a sharp-edged, warm-hearted series of strips about black girls growing up in the US. It\u2019s an energetic and often very funny collection that makes serious points about identity and personal space. Other writers speak directly of their own lives. Sarah Lippett\u2019s childhood troubles started with dropped dishes and headaches.

Perky colours contrast with worried faces in an affecting warts-and-all love letter to her family and the NHS. Travis Dandro\u2019s searing, sad and funny King of King Court (Drawn &amp; Quarterly) is another fine childhood memoir. Cute, tousled-haired Travis encounters comic books, toy swords, domestic upheavals and dealers\u2019 apartments on his path to adulthood in Massachusetts as his heroin-addict father moves in and out of his life. Dandro is brilliant at keeping the reader in the moment, but also gives an impressively nuanced account of his troubled family.

      "body": "<p>Today\u2019s science fiction, the cliche runs, is tomorrow\u2019s science fact. Considering how SF tends towards the pessimistic, from cyberpunk\u2019s urban cynicism in the 80s to today\u2019s glut of post-apocalyptic dystopias, that\u2019s a worrying thought. Still, we can\u2019t ignore geopolitics, or the planet\u2019s climate emergency. SF is the literature most attuned to contemporaneity\u2019s harsh music and so remains the best predictor of our collective future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7730bbf6908371b20bbdfaab90783422cb707297\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7730bbf6908371b20bbdfaab90783422cb707297/0_0_1707_2560/667.jpg\" alt=\"Infinite Detail by Tim Maughan\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2019, authors turned a clear eye on these dark possibilities. My pick for the book of the year, Tim Maughan\u2019s <strong>Infinite Detail</strong> (MCD x FSG Originals), is a before-and-after tale of near-future social collapse after a coordinated attack takes the internet down. It\u2019s hard to believe it is a debut, so assured and evocative is Maughan\u2019s writing. As a portrait of the fragility of our current status quo it is as thought-provoking as it is terrifying; you won\u2019t ever take your wifi for granted again. Running it a close second is Vicki Jarrett\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/catalog/product/view/id/159723/s/always-north-9781912658039/\">Always North</a></strong> (Unsung), another before-and-after-the-disaster novel, about climate collapse. Protagonist Isobel is on an Arctic mapping expedition for an oil-surveying company when she encounters something strange: though there are echoes of Ballard and Joanna Russ here, Jarrett is very much her own writer, with a talent for extraordinary images.</p> <p>If I say <strong><a href=\"https://www..theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/15/science-fiction-fantasy-review-roundup\">The Migration</a></strong><a href=\"https://www..theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/15/science-fiction-fantasy-review-roundup\"> by Helen Marshall (Titan)</a> is about a plague called Juvenile Idiopathic Immunodeficiency Syndrome, whose fatalities don\u2019t stay dead, you might think it yet another zombie story. But this emotionally resonant, cleverly creepy novel has much to say about climate change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c84cf25a8582cf136116271aba0c5b87f2539c45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c84cf25a8582cf136116271aba0c5b87f2539c45/0_0_1500_2299/652.jpg\" alt=\"Doggerland by Ben Smith\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ben Smith\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/25/doggerland-review-ben-smith\">Doggerland</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/25/doggerland-review-ben-smith\"> (4th Estate)</a>, another debut, is also set in a climate-collapsed near future. An old man and a boy inhabit a North Sea wind-turbine, no longer within sight of the shore. This vision of a flooded world possesses a pared-down, Beckettian plangency.</p> <p>In Chuck Wendig\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wanderers-9781781088104.html\">Wanderers</a></strong> (Del Rey), a new plague sends crowds of people sleepwalking around the globe. This slow shuffle through a world coming to an end takes a while to build momentum, but by its conclusion the book parses societal and climate change via a satisfying SF twist. Chen Qiufan\u2019s <strong>Waste Tide</strong> (Head of Zeus) is set on Silicon Isle, a dumping ground for the world\u2019s discarded computers and tech trash.

      "bodyText": "Today\u2019s science fiction, the cliche runs, is tomorrow\u2019s science fact. Considering how SF tends towards the pessimistic, from cyberpunk\u2019s urban cynicism in the 80s to today\u2019s glut of post-apocalyptic dystopias, that\u2019s a worrying thought. Still, we can\u2019t ignore geopolitics, or the planet\u2019s climate emergency. SF is the literature most attuned to contemporaneity\u2019s harsh music and so remains the best predictor of our collective future. In 2019, authors turned a clear eye on these dark possibilities. My pick for the book of the year, Tim Maughan\u2019s Infinite Detail (MCD x FSG Originals), is a before-and-after tale of near-future social collapse after a coordinated attack takes the internet down. It\u2019s hard to believe it is a debut, so assured and evocative is Maughan\u2019s writing. As a portrait of the fragility of our current status quo it is as thought-provoking as it is terrifying; you won\u2019t ever take your wifi for granted again. Running it a close second is Vicki Jarrett\u2019s Always North (Unsung), another before-and-after-the-disaster novel, about climate collapse. Protagonist Isobel is on an Arctic mapping expedition for an oil-surveying company when she encounters something strange: though there are echoes of Ballard and Joanna Russ here, Jarrett is very much her own writer, with a talent for extraordinary images. If I say The Migration by Helen Marshall (Titan) is about a plague called Juvenile Idiopathic Immunodeficiency Syndrome, whose fatalities don\u2019t stay dead, you might think it yet another zombie story. But this emotionally resonant, cleverly creepy novel has much to say about climate change. Ben Smith\u2019s Doggerland (4th Estate), another debut, is also set in a climate-collapsed near future. An old man and a boy inhabit a North Sea wind-turbine, no longer within sight of the shore. This vision of a flooded world possesses a pared-down, Beckettian plangency. In Chuck Wendig\u2019s Wanderers (Del Rey), a new plague sends crowds of people sleepwalking around the globe. This slow shuffle through a world coming to an end takes a while to build momentum, but by its conclusion the book parses societal and climate change via a satisfying SF twist. Chen Qiufan\u2019s Waste Tide (Head of Zeus) is set on Silicon Isle, a dumping ground for the world\u2019s discarded computers and tech trash. There\u2019s an old school cyberpunk quality to the book, and though its plotting is a touch choppy, it\u2019s a compelling reflection on a world defined by its waste. Post-apocalypse wasn\u2019t the only flavour in 2019: in Claire North\u2019s The Pursuit of William Abbey (Orbit) a witness to a racial murder becomes literally haunted by the crime, but in a way that grants him the ability to \u201csee\u201d the truth of people\u2019s motivations. As ever with North\u2019s work, it\u2019s a clever and thought-provoking conceit. Arkady Martine\u2019s excellent debut A Memory Called Empire (Tor) is proper space opera, with lots of hi-tech, juicy political intrigues spread across a baroque interplanetary empire. Charlie Jane Anders\u2019s City in the Middle of the Night (Titan) has a classic Le Guinian vibe: culture clash and community on an unforgiving distant planet. Joe Abercrombie\u2019s first volume in a new fantasy trilogy, A Little Hatred (Gollancz), gives us incipient industrialisation, a refugee crisis, violence, politics and magic, all handled with darkly funny aplomb. Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone\u2019s This Is How You Lose the Time War (Jo Fletcher) is hard to categorise: we might call it an \u201cepistolary time-travel spy love story\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t really convey the book\u2019s poetic quality \u2013 it\u2019s one of a kind. Annalee Newitz\u2019s The Future of Another Timeline (Orbit) is the sharply plotted story of a murder and the spiralling consequences of trying to undo it. Ted Chiang\u2019s Exhalation (Picador) is only the short-story master\u2019s second collection, while the connected tales of Lindsey Drager\u2019s The Archive of Alternate Endings (Dzanc), each set roughly 75 years apart to coincide with the appearance of Halley\u2019s Comet, are eloquent on the centrality of storytelling to who we are. Beginning with \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d as the prototype tale, the narrative spins forward into the future of space exploration, and the whole is quietly brilliant. The Rosewater Redemption (Orbit) brings Tade Thompson\u2019s award-winning Nigerian alien-encounter trilogy to an end. Some of 2019\u2019s releases find magic in the darkness. The Starless Sea (Harvill Secker) by Erin Morgenstern features an ancient subterranean library whose books about pirates, spies and lovers bleed into reality. Booker-winner Marlon James\u2019s venture into fantasy, Black Leopard Red Wolf (Hamish Hamilton), is a dense, multi-stranded novel about (among many other things) a mercenary searching for a lost child through a fantastical Africa: stylistically ambitious, full of arresting images, and crammed with the myriad ways humans can be ghastly to one another. \u2022 Save up to 30% on the books of the year at guardianbookshop.com",

Given the argument that what the Labour leader is trying to do hasn\u2019t been achieved in a democracy in modern times, Berry and Guinan examine what has defeated radical leftwing movements in the past, and which particular hurdles this one might face. How would a relatively inexperienced frontbench team cope with the quantum leap from opposition to government? How should they respond to businesses pushing back against their economic agenda, or cope with potentially unrealistic expectations among supporters about what can be achieved? Whether you\u2019re thrilled or alarmed by the radical answers discussed, it\u2019s one of the few political books this year likely to survive contact with an unpredictable general election. By Christmas it\u2019s either going to be an invaluable primer for Corbyn\u2019s team as they move into No 10, or it will be worth scanning for retrospective clues as to why voters chose not to make that happen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b4a99dc7d78fe9bf8352f5785f3609423d5c5be7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4a99dc7d78fe9bf8352f5785f3609423d5c5be7/0_0_325_499/325.jpg\" alt=\"Engines of Privilege- Britain\u2019s Private School Problem \" width=\"325\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\">Francis Green and Philip Kynaston\u2019s </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\">Engines of Privilege</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/25/engines-of-privilege-private-school-problem-david-kynaston-francis-green-review\"> (Bloomsbury)</a> also captures some of the zeitgeist of a campaign dominated by furious debates about elitism. It\u2019s part impassioned attack on the unfair advantages conferred by private education, part analysis of why the left in power has always stopped short of tackling it head-on. Both authors were privately educated, and don\u2019t seek to demonise other parents for their choices; by the standards of Labour\u2019s last party conference, at which members voted to abolish private schools and redistribute their assets, it\u2019s positively modest in its recommendations for change.

After all those months mulling it over in his shepherd\u2019s hut, it still doesn\u2019t feel as if he understands why so many people are angry with him. He\u2019s still bullish in defence of austerity, complaining at one point in relation to opposition to his coalition government that \u201cwe were cutting just \u00a31 in every \u00a3100 spent but you\u2019d think we had reinstated the workhouse\u201d. And if, as one suspects, he has had some dark nights of the soul over Brexit, then they are very much smoothed over in an account depicting the referendum more as a sadly inevitable consequence of the trajectory Britain was on than as a personal choice that backfired catastrophically. Readers may be left hankering for something deeper, but perhaps that was always true of this particular prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"edfdfe84bced021bb021819cebf77f43d2b2d7fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edfdfe84bced021bb021819cebf77f43d2b2d7fb/0_0_1664_2560/650.jpg\" alt=\"May at 10 by Anthony Seldon\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Although if<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/10/may-at-10-anthony-seldon-review\"> Anthony Seldon\u2019s </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/10/may-at-10-anthony-seldon-review\">May at 10</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/10/may-at-10-anthony-seldon-review\"> (Biteback),</a> an account of Theresa May in power, is to be believed then what came next leaves Cameron looking positively titanic. It\u2019s hard not to wonder whether May suffers from being the only person not to give her side of things to Seldon, leaving former aides to blame anyone but themselves for what went wrong.

Written before the disastrous Prince Andrew interview and billed as a book about what happens when political interviewing goes awry \u2013 more by cockup than conspiracy, according to the <em>Newsnight</em> presenter \u2013 it\u2019s funny and subtly smart, taking the reader behind the camera to examine journalistic dilemmas, such as whether grilling far right figures on air is holding them accountable or merely feeding the trolls.</p> <p>Talking of which, after a year when too many women have been driven to the verge of quitting public life by threats and intimidation, both Yvette Cooper\u2019s <strong>She Speaks </strong>(Atlantic), an anthology of game-changing speeches by women from Greta Thunberg to Hillary Clinton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/28/jess-phillips-this-much-i-know-if-you-cut-me-i-bleed-birmingham\">and Jess Phillips\u2019s activist manual</a> <strong>Truth to Power</strong> (Monoray) feel like welcome acts of defiance.

It\u2019s a fascinating, clear-eyed examination of what really drove a handful of women, including a small group of British schoolgirls, to move to Syria and join the jihad. She takes the kneejerk assumptions that they were either naive teenagers or sociopaths undeserving of sympathy and dismantles them to reveal a far more complex, disturbing story.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Save up to 30% on the books of the year at guardianbookshop.com</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not long now until Britain finds out what Santa has brought us for a government. But whether the election delivers just what you\u2019ve always wanted, or merely the political equivalent of a stocking full of ashes, somewhere out there is a book that may help make some sense of it. Christine Berry and Joe Guinan\u2019s People Get Ready! (OR Books) isn\u2019t as well known as perhaps it should be, considering that it\u2019s one of the few books written from a sympathetic left perspective to analyse potential vulnerabilities in the Corbyn project and how they might be countered. Given the argument that what the Labour leader is trying to do hasn\u2019t been achieved in a democracy in modern times, Berry and Guinan examine what has defeated radical leftwing movements in the past, and which particular hurdles this one might face. How would a relatively inexperienced frontbench team cope with the quantum leap from opposition to government? How should they respond to businesses pushing back against their economic agenda, or cope with potentially unrealistic expectations among supporters about what can be achieved? Whether you\u2019re thrilled or alarmed by the radical answers discussed, it\u2019s one of the few political books this year likely to survive contact with an unpredictable general election. By Christmas it\u2019s either going to be an invaluable primer for Corbyn\u2019s team as they move into No 10, or it will be worth scanning for retrospective clues as to why voters chose not to make that happen. Francis Green and Philip Kynaston\u2019s Engines of Privilege (Bloomsbury) also captures some of the zeitgeist of a campaign dominated by furious debates about elitism. It\u2019s part impassioned attack on the unfair advantages conferred by private education, part analysis of why the left in power has always stopped short of tackling it head-on. Both authors were privately educated, and don\u2019t seek to demonise other parents for their choices; by the standards of Labour\u2019s last party conference, at which members voted to abolish private schools and redistribute their assets, it\u2019s positively modest in its recommendations for change. But this is a thought-provoking book, raising questions about social mobility and social justice that are likely to colour our politics whatever happens next. In a similar vein, Amelia Gentleman\u2019s moving The Windrush Betrayal (Guardian/Faber) explains how a generation of people who thought their future in Britain secure had their lives unjustly turned upside down, while also highlighting the potential risks to EU nationals living in Britain if Brexit goes ahead. Which brings us neatly to the legacy of the last two prime ministers. David Cameron\u2019s autobiography For the Record (William Collins) is an essential and readable guide for anyone still anxious to know quite how we ended up here, but it\u2019s also a frustrating one. After all those months mulling it over in his shepherd\u2019s hut, it still doesn\u2019t feel as if he understands why so many people are angry with him. He\u2019s still bullish in defence of austerity, complaining at one point in relation to opposition to his coalition government that \u201cwe were cutting just \u00a31 in every \u00a3100 spent but you\u2019d think we had reinstated the workhouse\u201d. And if, as one suspects, he has had some dark nights of the soul over Brexit, then they are very much smoothed over in an account depicting the referendum more as a sadly inevitable consequence of the trajectory Britain was on than as a personal choice that backfired catastrophically. Readers may be left hankering for something deeper, but perhaps that was always true of this particular prime minister. Although if Anthony Seldon\u2019s May at 10 (Biteback), an account of Theresa May in power, is to be believed then what came next leaves Cameron looking positively titanic. It\u2019s hard not to wonder whether May suffers from being the only person not to give her side of things to Seldon, leaving former aides to blame anyone but themselves for what went wrong. But the author has now written biographies of six British PMs and seemingly warmed to May the least, portraying her as simultaneously rigid and oddly tremulous, prone to withdrawing from the fray at critical moments. Heaven knows what he\u2019ll make of Boris Johnson when the time comes, although while you\u2019re waiting there\u2019s always John Crace\u2019s Decline and Fail (Guardian/Faber), a collection of sketches from this last surreal year in politics. Anyone who has spent this election campaign shouting at the TV needs a copy of Emily Maitlis\u2019s Airhead (Penguin) in their Christmas stocking. Written before the disastrous Prince Andrew interview and billed as a book about what happens when political interviewing goes awry \u2013 more by cockup than conspiracy, according to the Newsnight presenter \u2013 it\u2019s funny and subtly smart, taking the reader behind the camera to examine journalistic dilemmas, such as whether grilling far right figures on air is holding them accountable or merely feeding the trolls. Talking of which, after a year when too many women have been driven to the verge of quitting public life by threats and intimidation, both Yvette Cooper\u2019s She Speaks (Atlantic), an anthology of game-changing speeches by women from Greta Thunberg to Hillary Clinton, and Jess Phillips\u2019s activist manual Truth to Power (Monoray) feel like welcome acts of defiance. But the year\u2019s most intriguing take on female agency is Azadeh Moaveni\u2019s beautifully written Guest House for Young Widows (Scribe). It\u2019s a fascinating, clear-eyed examination of what really drove a handful of women, including a small group of British schoolgirls, to move to Syria and join the jihad. She takes the kneejerk assumptions that they were either naive teenagers or sociopaths undeserving of sympathy and dismantles them to reveal a far more complex, disturbing story. \u2022 Save up to 30% on the books of the year at guardianbookshop.com",

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hooper\" title=\"\">Tom Hooper</a>\u2019s forthcoming version, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jennifer-hudson\" title=\"\">Jennifer Hudson</a> plays Grizabella, the shabby outcast Cat who stops the show with her rendition of Memory, alongside a cast that plays like the kind of dream you have when you\u2019ve eaten too much cheese before bed: Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson and Idris Elba, all dancing around with digitised facial prosthetics against a not-to-scale, old\u2011timey London, the most disturbing aspect of which is not even that the female cats have furry boobs. But Hudson is at the heart of the film, bellowing her little heart out and looking as if she is about to go the full Joan Crawford and take a bite from the furniture.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the cool thing,\u201d she says with scrupulous blandness, in reference to the wild response to the trailer, \u201cbecause no one knows what to expect. It\u2019s so exciting!\u201d Hudson had no prior interest in the show \u2013 she knew the music, but that was it. Nothing about the material struck her as overblown, nor was she aware of the ringing piss-take tone that governed the commentary, in spite of having spent a lot of time in the UK for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-voice\" title=\"\">The Voice</a>. What about the cat boobs?</p> <p>\u201cWell, how else are they going to feed their kids?\u201d she says, archly.</p> <p>Why do only some of the cats have shoes?</p> <p>\u201cEach cat is different.\u201d</p> <p>Goddammit.

Especially with a character like Grizabella. I feel like she\u2019s the heart of the story.\u201d</p> <p>Hudson is sitting in a hotel library in midtown Manhattan dressed in a black beanie and dark shades, a mildly eccentric disguise she takes off to reveal a cheerful demeanour. It is 15 years since the singer\u2019s first appearance on <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">American Idol</a>, and she has grown accustomed, through the merciless drive of publicity, to saying nothing, very pleasantly and at length. In the first half of our interview, Hudson is bright and polished. For the second half of our conversation \u2013 I can\u2019t tell exactly when the transition occurs, but it\u2019s somewhere around the time the subject of her pets comes up \u2013 she is funny and relaxed and a different presence altogether. The 38-year-old has won an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe (all for Dreamgirls), and two Grammys \u2013 one for her debut album, Jennifer Hudson, and the other for her work on the soundtrack to the stage production of The Color Purple \u2013 and is at that pitch of fame wherein she has to cover her face when crossing a hotel lobby. But when she lets loose, she is pure joy. So how <em>do</em> you play a cat?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df6b8d0a7044ac511fdaf28e6954f7b63bb16620\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6b8d0a7044ac511fdaf28e6954f7b63bb16620/375_0_597_746/400.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Hudson in Cats (2019)\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Cats. \u2018The cool part about it is that each cat has a story, which maybe relates to us as humans.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe cool part about it is that each cat has a story, which maybe relates to us as humans.\u201d I suppose if Emma Thompson managed to be a teapot in Beauty And The Beast, I say. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>Hudson was still a young child when she started to notice a pattern developing. Like many in her family, she liked to sing, even though it made her tremendously nervous. In the choir at church, she would close her eyes so she didn\u2019t have to look at the crowd; at home, if there were more than a few people around to listen, she would often fail to get a note out. When she was 11, Hudson was due to sing at her grandmother\u2019s 91st birthday and, she recalls, \u201ceveryone sitting at the table laughed and said, \u2018She can\u2019t sing\u2019\u201d. This time, however, she managed to get through the song, and when she opened her eyes it was to a standing ovation. So it would be from then on \u2013 at school, at church and when she entered a talent show; every single time, singing with eyes closed, and the same outcome: \u201cOh, I won.\u201d</p> <p>Having a singing talent like Hudson\u2019s can be a liability in movie-making: producers and directors are always trying to get a song out of her, even when it doesn\u2019t belong. This is what happened, she says, during the filming of Winnie Mandela, the 2011 biopic in which Hudson played the title role. \u201cI had to say to them: \u2018Winnie doesn\u2019t sing.\u2019 They were trying to get me to sing in a choir! And I said, \u2018Winnie, she does not sing.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d33961371a34a0a990fe92e094672b85e01ce77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d33961371a34a0a990fe92e094672b85e01ce77/184_1337_4905_6125/801.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Hudson\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They are always trying to find a way to make me sing, whether it\u2019s film, commercial or theatre.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think we\u2019d have known if Mandela could sing like you. \u201cRight. And I like to stay as true to the character as possible. But they are always trying to find a way to make me sing, whether it\u2019s film, commercial or theatre.\u201d</p> <p>Hudson had accent coaching for the Mandela movie \u2013 she showcases one of the three \u201cclick\u201d sounds in the Xhosa language with impressive ease \u2013 and when Hooper requested a British accent from the actors in Cats, found herself veering madly back into South African. \u201cFirst off I was like, \u2018Me? With a British accent?\u2019\u201d She laughs. Hudson was born and raised in Chicago, but her parents were from the south \u2013 Mississippi \u2013 and she picked up some of their inflections. \u201cBut the African accent was the last thing stuck in my mind, so we had to undo that, first.\u201d</p> <p>Her base is still Chicago; Hudson lives there with her 10-year-old son, David, whose father is the wrestler David Otunga (the couple split in 2017). Going home, she says, is a blessed relief from the rigours of her schedule. For a while, she was commuting between LA and London while filming both countries\u2019 versions of The Voice: \u201cI\u2019d go from chair to chair.\u201d Those trips were long enough to bring David along, but ordinarily he stays in Chicago and when she gets home, \u201cI never have anything to do outside of just being a mom. When I\u2019m working, I have about 10 or 20 people talking to me at one time, and a dozen things going on. Then I go home and it\u2019s, like, still. Just still. I appreciate the quiet and simplicity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d893561b40eb7428cb1eb27799e1c37bdfa7b594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d893561b40eb7428cb1eb27799e1c37bdfa7b594/0_462_2079_2597/801.jpg\" alt=\"Winning her Oscar. \" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winning her Oscar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What does she do?</p> <p>\u201cI love getting up early in the morning and taking my dogs out. I have three dogs and two cats \u2013 Grizabella and Macavity. They go with me when I travel.\u201d</p> <p>Wait, what? The cats go with you?</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re here, now.\u201d In the hotel?!</p> <p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re upstairs right now.\u201d</p> <p>Why?!</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the one thing I have that\u2019s consistent, that no one can take from me.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t they freak out?</p> <p>\u201cNo. Well, Macavity is so chill, he loves being in his bag \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want the ruckus of the people. He\u2019s a sphinx. Then Grizabella, she doesn\u2019t love her bag as much, but if I sit her on my lap, she\u2019s fine. They have their litter tray. I\u2019m becoming a cat lady.\u201d</p> <p>When Hudson is home, you wouldn\u2019t know she\u2019s the type of person who travels with her cats, she insists. She has a house full of boys \u2013 her son<strong> </strong>and his friends. Her sister, Julia, lives close by. It\u2019s a life full of family and friends, during which she tends to sleep during the day, while her son is at school, then starts work, responding to emails and taking calls on her various deals, after he goes to sleep in the evening. \u201cThat\u2019s when my day starts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aec7be281bcbbef04a0b97423c90684dfea36272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aec7be281bcbbef04a0b97423c90684dfea36272/47_1159_5258_6573/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Hudson\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress, Hamel.

Hudson is constantly working. Since the release of Dreamgirls in 2006, she has appeared in more than 15 feature films and countless TV shows, while producing three studio albums and six soundtracks. She is currently filming Respect, the Aretha Franklin biopic, a huge and stressful project. \u201cI need to rest,\u201d she says, of the short periods in between. \u201cI try to balance it out more. Home is so quiet and I like it that way. Taking the dogs out in the morning, the sun just shining.\u201d She describes the dogs: \u201cOscar is the dad; Grammy is the mother, and Dreamgirl is the baby. Oscar just had a birthday, his birthday is 16 October. He\u2019s 13 years old.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1dc6bb0d0a17cce0be802bb32cdfa81ff6ef46d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dc6bb0d0a17cce0be802bb32cdfa81ff6ef46d7/706_406_1426_1783/800.jpg\" alt=\"In Dreamgirls \u2013 with Beyonc\u00e9 and Anika Noni Rose \u2013 a role that won her an Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Dreamgirls \u2013 with Beyonc\u00e9 and Anika Noni Rose \u2013 a role that won her an Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wow, I observe, you are invested in the backstory of your pets.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says Hudson, and she looks dreamy. \u201cI had a goat, too, but he passed. His name was Prancer.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>There is a guilelessness and a sunniness to Jennifer Hudson that she says comes from her mother. Darnell Donerson raised her son and two daughters to be confident, happy people. When Hudson showed promise in any direction, her mother would pounce on it. \u201cShe used to tell us: \u2018No matter what you put your mind to, you can do.\u2019 She said: \u2018I think you can act.\u2019 Or, \u2018Jenny, I think you can draw.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Whatever, Momma.\u2019\u201d As it turned out, her mother\u2019s confidence was well placed, or rather, her attitude as a parent enabled her daughter\u2019s talent without overinvesting or putting too much pressure on her. \u201cOne of my other favourite things she\u2019d say is, \u2018Whatever makes you happy. As long as you\u2019re happy, Momma\u2019s happy.\u2019 And that\u2019s how it should be. No one knows what makes you happy, and who\u2019s to say what you should and shouldn\u2019t be? You know your value. Just because you value one thing, someone else may value another thing and you should respect that. And my mother \u2013 I can just see her saying all that.\u201d</p> <p>This is said with some weight. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/11/jennifer-hudson-william-balfour-murder-guilty\" title=\"\">Just over 10 years ago, Hudson\u2019s mother, brother and nephew were shot and killed by her sister Julia\u2019s estranged husband</a>, who is currently serving three life sentences for the crimes. Her nephew, Julian King, was seven years old; her brother, Jason, was 29; her mother was 57. Hudson sat through the trial and the sentencing. Later, she set up the Julian D King Gift Foundation, an educational charity, in her nephew\u2019s honour. During an interview in 2012, she talked to Oprah Winfrey about the emotional onslaught following the murders. \u201cWho do I grieve for first?\u201d she said. \u201cWho do I start with?\u201d</p> <p>This is in the background when Hudson talks about her family. Julia is four years older, and although she can\u2019t sing \u2013 \u201cShe and I have the same exact speaking voice, but she can\u2019t sing a note\u201d \u2013 the sisters are very similar in some ways. Unlike their mother, who was quiet, they are sociable creatures. \u201cWe\u2019re very introverted in that we don\u2019t go out much and party, but we\u2019ll talk to people.\u201d And like Hudson, her sister, she says, \u201cis a workaholic\u201d.</p> <p>What does she do?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e5dee1376483ffa68e851f2f74f73a5069ab8198\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5dee1376483ffa68e851f2f74f73a5069ab8198/0_198_2040_2549/800.jpg\" alt=\"With her sister, mother and nephew in 2006.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her sister, mother and nephew in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a school bus driver.

She doesn\u2019t like to leave Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>Isn\u2019t there something mind-melting about the distance between your lifestyle and hers? Hudson smiles. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>How do you integrate those realities?</p> <p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t understand my reality. It\u2019s kind of different. Like: the other day we went to see Patti LaBelle; my sister, and a bunch of her friends, and myself. And Julia said, \u2018Are you coming Wednesday?\u2019 And I said, \u2018What\u2019s Wednesday?\u2019 And she said, \u2018My birthday!\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, Lord. I know when your birthday is; it\u2019s just my schedule is so crazy that I only like to know what\u2019s today. Don\u2019t tell me about tomorrow.\u2019 So, from my perspective, it felt like her birthday was two weeks away.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I turned 15, I went to go look for my dad.

Can\u2019t Hudson see that, from her sister\u2019s point of view, her dismissal reads as thoughtless? \u201cWell, I just bought her another house, is that thoughtless?\u201d she explodes. \u201cI\u2019ve bought her two of \u2019em.\u201d She laughs uproariously.</p> <p>The two women were raised in a largely single-parent household; Hudson\u2019s father was absent until, in a move that seems an early example of Hudson\u2019s well-adjusted and emotionally businesslike approach to most things, she went to find him and tell him it was absurd he wasn\u2019t more in their lives.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a bus driver,\u201d she says. \u201cHe drove Greyhound. When I was 14 or 15 \u2013 because he has a whole lot of kids; like, 27\u2013\u201d</p> <p>Wait, are you serious?</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Jesus Christ.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes. Eleven girls, 16 boys. I\u2019m the youngest, or at least in the last two or three. And it was always my dream \u2013 because I love family \u2013 to have a giant table with all my siblings. Just imagine the giant table! So when I turned 15, we went to go look for our dad, me and my sister.\u201d</p> <p>What did your mother say? \u201cShe said, \u2018If you want to, go ahead.\u2019 Once we found him, he moved in with us and never left us until he died. His name was Sam. He was supposed to drive me to college, but he passed before he could. That was when I was 16.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI\u2019m almost 40 now.\u201d</p> <p>Have you met all of your 26 siblings?</p> <p>\u201cNot all. But quite a few. I\u2019m trying to count. One of my brothers \u2013 half-brothers \u2013 passed recently, or was it two of them? My sister Dinah\u2019s around, she was just fussing that she didn\u2019t get to see Patti LaBelle. I said, Dinah, I didn\u2019t know you loved Patti. And they got me Macavity [the cat] for my birthday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To live in a way that honours them is what presses you forward</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is a good humour and a resilience that has obviously played a large role in Hudson\u2019s ability to come back from the unimaginable trauma of what happened in her family. She has not, she says, been twisted wholly out of shape by the murders. \u201cThank God. I think I attribute that first to God, next to [the fact that] when you experience trauma, it comes and goes. It\u2019s always there. But it\u2019s a matter of how you deal with it.\u201d For Hudson, it has been a question of honouring the lives of the people she loved, by \u201cdoing what they would have wanted me to do. It would be worse, to me, not to press forward. I\u2019m hearing my brother\u2019s voice say, \u2018Jenny, knock it off!\u2019 He would be angry at me for giving up. Or all the things that my mother instilled in us. She prepared us. She would say, \u2018You know, I\u2019m not always going to be here and I want you all to be able to make it.\u2019 She used to say, without family, you have nothing, which is why it\u2019s so important to take care of family. So if I\u2019m doing that, I know I\u2019m pleasing my mother. As for my nephew; that\u2019s where the Julian D King Gift Foundation comes from, because he was strong and very smart. So to live in a way that honours them is what presses you forward. Not to mention, thank God, that I have a child to live for.\u201d</p> <p>It has taken a presence of mind to enact these lessons and Hudson is ruthless in their execution. \u201cOf course you still get sad,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I go back to: what would my mother say? What would she do?\u201d</p> <p>These are questions she has been asking herself since the earliest days of her career, when she got her first professional singing job on a cruise ship. She nearly bolted on the first day. \u201cI\u2019m a homebody,\u201d she says. \u201cI love family, and that was my first time away from home. Talk about terrifying. And when I got to the ship, we had to do a wet drill, which I thought meant they were going to sprinkle water on us.\u201d Instead, they were made to jump into a body of water, \u201con to a life raft, flip it over, and swim. And I was like, \u2018Excuse me, do what? I\u2019m not jumping off of this.\u2019\u201d She thought of her mother, then. \u201cI told myself, this is my test: if I cannot get through a cruise ship contract for six months, then I don\u2019t need to go and audition for American Idol. This is not for me, but if I can get through this, then I will go forward. It\u2019s now or never; you jump in, or we\u2019re going home. And I jumped.\u201d Two days after she left the ship, in 2004, she turned up at the American Idol audition and her life changed.</p> <p>It\u2019s sometimes overlooked that Hudson didn\u2019t win the singing competition; she was a finalist but came seventh. Her performance was so powerful, however, that a year later, she was cast alongside Beyonc\u00e9 in the movie Dreamgirls. It was a terrifying experience. Hudson had never done a day\u2019s acting in her life \u2013 her roles on the cruise ship, as the narrator in Hercules The Musical and the soloist in The Lion King, were taken as acting credits to fudge things with Equity. And while she could obviously sing, \u201cI didn\u2019t start singing with my eyes open until I was 19. I was afraid to look into the crowd.\u201d</p> <p>She got through it with humour, a shrug, and the reminder that \u201cif I got through the last thing, I can get through this\u201d. So it has been, ever since. Between takes on Cats, Hudson would look around sometimes and gulp. \u201cIt was Ian McKellen\u2019s chair, Judi Dench\u2019s chair, and my chair! I\u2019m like: I\u2019m sitting next to Judi Dench.\u201d Hudson had heard and admired Elaine Paige\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm5w7gHEtJI\" title=\"\">original </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm5w7gHEtJI\" title=\"\">of Memory</a>, and was in awe of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWoQW-b6Ph8\" title=\"\">the Streisand </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWoQW-b6Ph8\" title=\"\">version</a>. But it struck her that the only way to approach the song without succumbing to nerves was through the drama of the material around it. \u201cA classic like that, you don\u2019t want to take it out of its context.\u201d (This is smart; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/14/catherine-zeta-jones-broadway-musical\" title=\"\">I once saw Catherine Zeta-Jones have a crack at Send </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/14/catherine-zeta-jones-broadway-musical\" title=\"\">In </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/14/catherine-zeta-jones-broadway-musical\" title=\"\">The Clowns</a> in a Broadway production of A Little Night Music, and she snapped so smartly out of role to enjoy the big moment, it broke the show\u2019s surface tension \u2013 as decisively as someone putting up hazard lights and drilling a hole in the stage.) \u201cWe have to stay true to the context of the song,\u201d Hudson says, \u201cbecause everyone knows it. But then the challenge of that is, well, what do you all want me to do with it?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI was putting the story in it and then the emotion. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a Grizabella as emotional as the one in the film.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8cbdf54309b16daf646aef7796976a5e86320187\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cbdf54309b16daf646aef7796976a5e86320187/785_1067_2399_2998/800.jpg\" alt=\"On the set of Respect, the Aretha Franklin biopic\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the set of Respect, the Aretha Franklin biopic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been bigger challenges. One day a few years ago, Hudson\u2019s phone rang and when she answered, it was Aretha Franklin. \u201cAnd she said, I\u2019ve made my choice, and I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s going to be you.\u201d Ever since Hudson won the Oscar for Dreamgirls, she had been in vague talks with Franklin\u2019s agents about playing her in a biopic, but it had taken the legendary singer 15 years to make the final decision. \u201cAnd so to know it\u2019s now happening, I think I\u2019m in shock. You all for real? It\u2019s happening now.\u201d</p> <p>If it had happened when she was 25, Hudson says, even her ability to withstand pressure might have crumbled. \u201cI\u2019d be like, are you all trying to kill me? It\u2019s all about timing and being prepared and if I was 20-anything, I would be like, I\u2019m sorry, I love you and all, but no.\u201d</p> <p>At 38, however, she is ready. She hears her mother\u2019s voice \u2013 \u201call you can do is the best you can\u201d \u2013 a phrase that, when you turn around to look at it, there isn\u2019t much to.</p> <p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s not,\u201d Hudson says.</p> <p>Why does it have such traction?

      "bodyText": "The trailer for Cats was truly the gift of the summer, one which many of us have struggled to scrub from our minds. In Tom Hooper\u2019s forthcoming version, Jennifer Hudson plays Grizabella, the shabby outcast Cat who stops the show with her rendition of Memory, alongside a cast that plays like the kind of dream you have when you\u2019ve eaten too much cheese before bed: Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson and Idris Elba, all dancing around with digitised facial prosthetics against a not-to-scale, old\u2011timey London, the most disturbing aspect of which is not even that the female cats have furry boobs. But Hudson is at the heart of the film, bellowing her little heart out and looking as if she is about to go the full Joan Crawford and take a bite from the furniture. \u201cI think that\u2019s the cool thing,\u201d she says with scrupulous blandness, in reference to the wild response to the trailer, \u201cbecause no one knows what to expect. It\u2019s so exciting!\u201d Hudson had no prior interest in the show \u2013 she knew the music, but that was it. Nothing about the material struck her as overblown, nor was she aware of the ringing piss-take tone that governed the commentary, in spite of having spent a lot of time in the UK for The Voice. What about the cat boobs? \u201cWell, how else are they going to feed their kids?\u201d she says, archly. Why do only some of the cats have shoes? \u201cEach cat is different.\u201d Goddammit. How do you go about playing a cat without succumbing to camp? \u201cYou know, that was a discovery. How do you be a cat? As a human, I sat with that for ever. Then, wait a minute, I\u2019ve got to sing Memory? Hoo! As a cat. It was the most bizarre \u2013 not in a bad way \u2013 and unique experience. I was like, what do I do? Especially with a character like Grizabella. I feel like she\u2019s the heart of the story.\u201d Hudson is sitting in a hotel library in midtown Manhattan dressed in a black beanie and dark shades, a mildly eccentric disguise she takes off to reveal a cheerful demeanour. It is 15 years since the singer\u2019s first appearance on American Idol, and she has grown accustomed, through the merciless drive of publicity, to saying nothing, very pleasantly and at length. In the first half of our interview, Hudson is bright and polished. For the second half of our conversation \u2013 I can\u2019t tell exactly when the transition occurs, but it\u2019s somewhere around the time the subject of her pets comes up \u2013 she is funny and relaxed and a different presence altogether. The 38-year-old has won an Oscar, a Bafta and a Golden Globe (all for Dreamgirls), and two Grammys \u2013 one for her debut album, Jennifer Hudson, and the other for her work on the soundtrack to the stage production of The Color Purple \u2013 and is at that pitch of fame wherein she has to cover her face when crossing a hotel lobby. But when she lets loose, she is pure joy. So how do you play a cat? \u201cThe cool part about it is that each cat has a story, which maybe relates to us as humans.\u201d I suppose if Emma Thompson managed to be a teapot in Beauty And The Beast, I say. \u201cExactly.\u201d Hudson was still a young child when she started to notice a pattern developing. Like many in her family, she liked to sing, even though it made her tremendously nervous. In the choir at church, she would close her eyes so she didn\u2019t have to look at the crowd; at home, if there were more than a few people around to listen, she would often fail to get a note out. When she was 11, Hudson was due to sing at her grandmother\u2019s 91st birthday and, she recalls, \u201ceveryone sitting at the table laughed and said, \u2018She can\u2019t sing\u2019\u201d. This time, however, she managed to get through the song, and when she opened her eyes it was to a standing ovation. So it would be from then on \u2013 at school, at church and when she entered a talent show; every single time, singing with eyes closed, and the same outcome: \u201cOh, I won.\u201d Having a singing talent like Hudson\u2019s can be a liability in movie-making: producers and directors are always trying to get a song out of her, even when it doesn\u2019t belong. This is what happened, she says, during the filming of Winnie Mandela, the 2011 biopic in which Hudson played the title role. \u201cI had to say to them: \u2018Winnie doesn\u2019t sing.\u2019 They were trying to get me to sing in a choir! And I said, \u2018Winnie, she does not sing.\u2019\u201d I think we\u2019d have known if Mandela could sing like you. \u201cRight. And I like to stay as true to the character as possible. But they are always trying to find a way to make me sing, whether it\u2019s film, commercial or theatre.\u201d Hudson had accent coaching for the Mandela movie \u2013 she showcases one of the three \u201cclick\u201d sounds in the Xhosa language with impressive ease \u2013 and when Hooper requested a British accent from the actors in Cats, found herself veering madly back into South African. \u201cFirst off I was like, \u2018Me? With a British accent?\u2019\u201d She laughs. Hudson was born and raised in Chicago, but her parents were from the south \u2013 Mississippi \u2013 and she picked up some of their inflections. \u201cBut the African accent was the last thing stuck in my mind, so we had to undo that, first.\u201d Her base is still Chicago; Hudson lives there with her 10-year-old son, David, whose father is the wrestler David Otunga (the couple split in 2017). Going home, she says, is a blessed relief from the rigours of her schedule. For a while, she was commuting between LA and London while filming both countries\u2019 versions of The Voice: \u201cI\u2019d go from chair to chair.\u201d Those trips were long enough to bring David along, but ordinarily he stays in Chicago and when she gets home, \u201cI never have anything to do outside of just being a mom. When I\u2019m working, I have about 10 or 20 people talking to me at one time, and a dozen things going on. Then I go home and it\u2019s, like, still. Just still. I appreciate the quiet and simplicity.\u201d What does she do? \u201cI love getting up early in the morning and taking my dogs out. I have three dogs and two cats \u2013 Grizabella and Macavity. They go with me when I travel.\u201d Wait, what? The cats go with you? \u201cThey\u2019re here, now.\u201d In the hotel?! \u201cYes. They\u2019re upstairs right now.\u201d Why?! \u201cBecause it\u2019s the one thing I have that\u2019s consistent, that no one can take from me.\u201d Don\u2019t they freak out? \u201cNo. Well, Macavity is so chill, he loves being in his bag \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want the ruckus of the people. He\u2019s a sphinx. Then Grizabella, she doesn\u2019t love her bag as much, but if I sit her on my lap, she\u2019s fine. They have their litter tray. I\u2019m becoming a cat lady.\u201d When Hudson is home, you wouldn\u2019t know she\u2019s the type of person who travels with her cats, she insists. She has a house full of boys \u2013 her son and his friends. Her sister, Julia, lives close by. It\u2019s a life full of family and friends, during which she tends to sleep during the day, while her son is at school, then starts work, responding to emails and taking calls on her various deals, after he goes to sleep in the evening. \u201cThat\u2019s when my day starts.\u201d The day-sleeping is partly a mechanism to catch up on herself. Hudson is constantly working. Since the release of Dreamgirls in 2006, she has appeared in more than 15 feature films and countless TV shows, while producing three studio albums and six soundtracks. She is currently filming Respect, the Aretha Franklin biopic, a huge and stressful project. \u201cI need to rest,\u201d she says, of the short periods in between. \u201cI try to balance it out more. Home is so quiet and I like it that way. Taking the dogs out in the morning, the sun just shining.\u201d She describes the dogs: \u201cOscar is the dad; Grammy is the mother, and Dreamgirl is the baby. Oscar just had a birthday, his birthday is 16 October. He\u2019s 13 years old.\u201d Wow, I observe, you are invested in the backstory of your pets. \u201cUh-huh,\u201d says Hudson, and she looks dreamy. \u201cI had a goat, too, but he passed. His name was Prancer.\u201d *** There is a guilelessness and a sunniness to Jennifer Hudson that she says comes from her mother. Darnell Donerson raised her son and two daughters to be confident, happy people. When Hudson showed promise in any direction, her mother would pounce on it. \u201cShe used to tell us: \u2018No matter what you put your mind to, you can do.\u2019 She said: \u2018I think you can act.\u2019 Or, \u2018Jenny, I think you can draw.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Whatever, Momma.\u2019\u201d As it turned out, her mother\u2019s confidence was well placed, or rather, her attitude as a parent enabled her daughter\u2019s talent without overinvesting or putting too much pressure on her. \u201cOne of my other favourite things she\u2019d say is, \u2018Whatever makes you happy. As long as you\u2019re happy, Momma\u2019s happy.\u2019 And that\u2019s how it should be. No one knows what makes you happy, and who\u2019s to say what you should and shouldn\u2019t be? You know your value. Just because you value one thing, someone else may value another thing and you should respect that. And my mother \u2013 I can just see her saying all that.\u201d This is said with some weight. Just over 10 years ago, Hudson\u2019s mother, brother and nephew were shot and killed by her sister Julia\u2019s estranged husband, who is currently serving three life sentences for the crimes. Her nephew, Julian King, was seven years old; her brother, Jason, was 29; her mother was 57. Hudson sat through the trial and the sentencing. Later, she set up the Julian D King Gift Foundation, an educational charity, in her nephew\u2019s honour. During an interview in 2012, she talked to Oprah Winfrey about the emotional onslaught following the murders. \u201cWho do I grieve for first?\u201d she said. \u201cWho do I start with?\u201d This is in the background when Hudson talks about her family. Julia is four years older, and although she can\u2019t sing \u2013 \u201cShe and I have the same exact speaking voice, but she can\u2019t sing a note\u201d \u2013 the sisters are very similar in some ways. Unlike their mother, who was quiet, they are sociable creatures. \u201cWe\u2019re very introverted in that we don\u2019t go out much and party, but we\u2019ll talk to people.\u201d And like Hudson, her sister, she says, \u201cis a workaholic\u201d. What does she do? \u201cShe\u2019s a school bus driver. She\u2019s a character. She doesn\u2019t like to travel much \u2013 like, to get her to come with me to something is a task. She doesn\u2019t like to leave Chicago.\u201d Isn\u2019t there something mind-melting about the distance between your lifestyle and hers? Hudson smiles. \u201cI know.\u201d How do you integrate those realities? \u201cMost people don\u2019t understand my reality. It\u2019s kind of different. Like: the other day we went to see Patti LaBelle; my sister, and a bunch of her friends, and myself. And Julia said, \u2018Are you coming Wednesday?\u2019 And I said, \u2018What\u2019s Wednesday?\u2019 And she said, \u2018My birthday!\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, Lord. I know when your birthday is; it\u2019s just my schedule is so crazy that I only like to know what\u2019s today. Don\u2019t tell me about tomorrow.\u2019 So, from my perspective, it felt like her birthday was two weeks away.\u201d This logic \u2013 don\u2019t ask me to plan, or to remember your plans \u2013 is why celebrities have such trouble holding down relationships, of course. Can\u2019t Hudson see that, from her sister\u2019s point of view, her dismissal reads as thoughtless? \u201cWell, I just bought her another house, is that thoughtless?\u201d she explodes. \u201cI\u2019ve bought her two of \u2019em.\u201d She laughs uproariously. The two women were raised in a largely single-parent household; Hudson\u2019s father was absent until, in a move that seems an early example of Hudson\u2019s well-adjusted and emotionally businesslike approach to most things, she went to find him and tell him it was absurd he wasn\u2019t more in their lives. \u201cHe was a bus driver,\u201d she says. \u201cHe drove Greyhound. When I was 14 or 15 \u2013 because he has a whole lot of kids; like, 27\u2013\u201d Wait, are you serious? \u201cYes.\u201d Jesus Christ. \u201cOh, yes. Eleven girls, 16 boys. I\u2019m the youngest, or at least in the last two or three. And it was always my dream \u2013 because I love family \u2013 to have a giant table with all my siblings. Just imagine the giant table! So when I turned 15, we went to go look for our dad, me and my sister.\u201d What did your mother say? \u201cShe said, \u2018If you want to, go ahead.\u2019 Once we found him, he moved in with us and never left us until he died. His name was Sam. He was supposed to drive me to college, but he passed before he could. That was when I was 16.\u201d She smiles. \u201cI\u2019m almost 40 now.\u201d Have you met all of your 26 siblings? \u201cNot all. But quite a few. I\u2019m trying to count. One of my brothers \u2013 half-brothers \u2013 passed recently, or was it two of them? My sister Dinah\u2019s around, she was just fussing that she didn\u2019t get to see Patti LaBelle. I said, Dinah, I didn\u2019t know you loved Patti. And they got me Macavity [the cat] for my birthday.\u201d There is a good humour and a resilience that has obviously played a large role in Hudson\u2019s ability to come back from the unimaginable trauma of what happened in her family. She has not, she says, been twisted wholly out of shape by the murders. \u201cThank God. I think I attribute that first to God, next to [the fact that] when you experience trauma, it comes and goes. It\u2019s always there. But it\u2019s a matter of how you deal with it.\u201d For Hudson, it has been a question of honouring the lives of the people she loved, by \u201cdoing what they would have wanted me to do. It would be worse, to me, not to press forward. I\u2019m hearing my brother\u2019s voice say, \u2018Jenny, knock it off!\u2019 He would be angry at me for giving up. Or all the things that my mother instilled in us. She prepared us. She would say, \u2018You know, I\u2019m not always going to be here and I want you all to be able to make it.\u2019 She used to say, without family, you have nothing, which is why it\u2019s so important to take care of family. So if I\u2019m doing that, I know I\u2019m pleasing my mother. As for my nephew; that\u2019s where the Julian D King Gift Foundation comes from, because he was strong and very smart. So to live in a way that honours them is what presses you forward. Not to mention, thank God, that I have a child to live for.\u201d It has taken a presence of mind to enact these lessons and Hudson is ruthless in their execution. \u201cOf course you still get sad,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I go back to: what would my mother say? What would she do?\u201d These are questions she has been asking herself since the earliest days of her career, when she got her first professional singing job on a cruise ship. She nearly bolted on the first day. \u201cI\u2019m a homebody,\u201d she says. \u201cI love family, and that was my first time away from home. Talk about terrifying. And when I got to the ship, we had to do a wet drill, which I thought meant they were going to sprinkle water on us.\u201d Instead, they were made to jump into a body of water, \u201con to a life raft, flip it over, and swim. And I was like, \u2018Excuse me, do what? I\u2019m not jumping off of this.\u2019\u201d She thought of her mother, then. \u201cI told myself, this is my test: if I cannot get through a cruise ship contract for six months, then I don\u2019t need to go and audition for American Idol. This is not for me, but if I can get through this, then I will go forward. It\u2019s now or never; you jump in, or we\u2019re going home. And I jumped.\u201d Two days after she left the ship, in 2004, she turned up at the American Idol audition and her life changed. It\u2019s sometimes overlooked that Hudson didn\u2019t win the singing competition; she was a finalist but came seventh. Her performance was so powerful, however, that a year later, she was cast alongside Beyonc\u00e9 in the movie Dreamgirls. It was a terrifying experience. Hudson had never done a day\u2019s acting in her life \u2013 her roles on the cruise ship, as the narrator in Hercules The Musical and the soloist in The Lion King, were taken as acting credits to fudge things with Equity. And while she could obviously sing, \u201cI didn\u2019t start singing with my eyes open until I was 19. I was afraid to look into the crowd.\u201d She got through it with humour, a shrug, and the reminder that \u201cif I got through the last thing, I can get through this\u201d. So it has been, ever since. Between takes on Cats, Hudson would look around sometimes and gulp. \u201cIt was Ian McKellen\u2019s chair, Judi Dench\u2019s chair, and my chair! I\u2019m like: I\u2019m sitting next to Judi Dench.\u201d Hudson had heard and admired Elaine Paige\u2019s original of Memory, and was in awe of the Streisand version. But it struck her that the only way to approach the song without succumbing to nerves was through the drama of the material around it. \u201cA classic like that, you don\u2019t want to take it out of its context.\u201d (This is smart; I once saw Catherine Zeta-Jones have a crack at Send In The Clowns in a Broadway production of A Little Night Music, and she snapped so smartly out of role to enjoy the big moment, it broke the show\u2019s surface tension \u2013 as decisively as someone putting up hazard lights and drilling a hole in the stage.) \u201cWe have to stay true to the context of the song,\u201d Hudson says, \u201cbecause everyone knows it. But then the challenge of that is, well, what do you all want me to do with it?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI was putting the story in it and then the emotion. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a Grizabella as emotional as the one in the film.\u201d There have been bigger challenges. One day a few years ago, Hudson\u2019s phone rang and when she answered, it was Aretha Franklin. \u201cAnd she said, I\u2019ve made my choice, and I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s going to be you.\u201d Ever since Hudson won the Oscar for Dreamgirls, she had been in vague talks with Franklin\u2019s agents about playing her in a biopic, but it had taken the legendary singer 15 years to make the final decision. \u201cAnd so to know it\u2019s now happening, I think I\u2019m in shock. You all for real? It\u2019s happening now.\u201d If it had happened when she was 25, Hudson says, even her ability to withstand pressure might have crumbled. \u201cI\u2019d be like, are you all trying to kill me? It\u2019s all about timing and being prepared and if I was 20-anything, I would be like, I\u2019m sorry, I love you and all, but no.\u201d At 38, however, she is ready. She hears her mother\u2019s voice \u2013 \u201call you can do is the best you can\u201d \u2013 a phrase that, when you turn around to look at it, there isn\u2019t much to. \u201cNo, there\u2019s not,\u201d Hudson says. Why does it have such traction? There\u2019s no big mystery, she says: \u201cBecause I believe it.\u201d \u2022 Cats is released on 20 December.

For the most part the story of the food is the story of people who migrated to the islands from Europe, Asia and Africa, resulting in vibrant and invigorating flavours. King prawns with tamarind and coconut, Creole saffran (spicy turmeric) rice, and cumin and lentil flatbreads are all on my to-cook list.</p> <p>Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-food-of-sichuan-9781408867556.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Food of Sichuan</a></strong> (Bloomsbury) was first published almost 20 years ago and became something of a bible, but has been updated with new information, recipes and beautiful photos. Now it is a masterpiece. There is much expert knowledge and brilliant writing from Dunlop on textures, techniques and the story of Sichuanese cuisine. Equally, there are many achievable recipes, from bang-bang chicken to dandan noodles, which beg you to drop by your local Chinese grocer and get straight into the kitchen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"95ab7ae67d5fb4005f99e9eef3f4d1d15333e998\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95ab7ae67d5fb4005f99e9eef3f4d1d15333e998/0_0_952_1181/806.jpg\" alt=\"Pasta Grannies, The Secrets of Italy\u2019s Best Home Cooks\" width=\"806\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Georgie Hayden\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/taverna-9780224101646.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Taverna</a></strong> (Square Peg) takes her back to Cyprus, her motherland, for recipes her <em>yia-yias</em> (grandmothers) would be proud of.

The one most plastered with my sticky notes is Selina Periampillai\u2019s The Island Kitchen (Bloomsbury) with recipes from the Indian Ocean islands, from Madagascar to Mauritius (where the author\u2019s parents are from) and the Maldives. For the most part the story of the food is the story of people who migrated to the islands from Europe, Asia and Africa, resulting in vibrant and invigorating flavours. King prawns with tamarind and coconut, Creole saffran (spicy turmeric) rice, and cumin and lentil flatbreads are all on my to-cook list. Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s The Food of Sichuan (Bloomsbury) was first published almost 20 years ago and became something of a bible, but has been updated with new information, recipes and beautiful photos. Now it is a masterpiece. There is much expert knowledge and brilliant writing from Dunlop on textures, techniques and the story of Sichuanese cuisine. Equally, there are many achievable recipes, from bang-bang chicken to dandan noodles, which beg you to drop by your local Chinese grocer and get straight into the kitchen. Georgie Hayden\u2019s Taverna (Square Peg) takes her back to Cyprus, her motherland, for recipes her yia-yias (grandmothers) would be proud of. Much of this food I\u2019ve heard of \u2013 halva, taramasalata \u2013 but much of it I haven\u2019t, and tomato-braised peas and beans, courgette keftedes, tahinopita (tahini and cinnamon swirl) all sound delicious. The recipes centre on feasting, family and community, and the stories and photographs of her family are more personal, combining to give a satisfying taste of home. More homely cooking is available in Vicky Bennison\u2019s Pasta Grannies (Hardie Grant), the book of the YouTube series in which Italian nonnas show you how to make pasta dishes by hand. Part anthropological record of a dying skill, part deep dive into Italy\u2019s incredible regional culinary repertoire, it is a heart-warming big hug of a book. Baking books have tailed off in tandem with Bake Off viewer figures and instead fermented foods, pickles and preserves have arrived. Sour (Quadrille) by Mark Diacono zings from page to page, with must-cook-now recipes using the tang of citrus or the sweet sour of tamarind. Away from the direct heat of the stove, Bee Wilson\u2019s excellent The Way We Eat Now (4th Estate) is a state-of-the-nation book that explores our food systems, how global economics has changed the way we eat and how what we eat is not necessarily a question of personal choice. However, the book I\u2019ll be curling up with when not actually cooking is Charlotte Druckman\u2019s Women on Food (Abrams), her wide-ranging, unorthodox anthology of food writing. It\u2019s sharp, witty, entertaining and has insights from a host of brilliant food writers, from Nigella to Tejal Rao. \u2022 Meera Sodha\u2019s East: 120 Vegetarian and Vegan recipes from Bangalore to Beijing is published by Fig Tree. \u2022 Save up to 30% on the books of the year at guardianbookshop.com",

In rural India and parts of Africa the main culprits are household fires for cooking, and because women and girls make most of the meals, they bear the brunt of the lifelong health problems. In Europe, where particulate-spewing diesel was embraced over petrol, she retells how Volkswagen and other manufacturers shamefully flouted emissions limits. In Britain, rather than bothering to clean the air, successive governments did nothing. If it makes you angry, it should. Polluted air cuts short more than 7 million lives a year around the world. Each breath we take need not be toxic: we know how to fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"10138c0196b12bc297eadaa5c54a8254ad8e7a8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10138c0196b12bc297eadaa5c54a8254ad8e7a8f/0_0_1674_2560/654.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez - \" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It took the writer and campaigner Caroline Criado Perez to reveal the true extent of the man\u2019s world we live in.

Data, it turns out, matters. Look what happened when the BBC published its gender pay gap figures: the impact was immediate. The pervasiveness of the problem is staggering. While female drivers have fewer accidents, crashes leave them more seriously hurt, because car safety relies on \u201cReference man\u201d, a standard male crash test dummy. And women do worse after heart attacks because they don\u2019t experience the same symptoms as men.

It\u2019s a place of myths, burial chambers, deep chasms for dumping nuclear waste, and halls carved out by buried rivers and filled with black sand dunes. <em>Underland</em> is a beautiful if unsettling book through which run familiar themes: fascination, the transience of life and the human impact on the planet.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been 30 years since Barry Lopez, the master wilderness writer, won the National book award with Arctic Dreams, his glorious examination of life and landscape in the far north. The Arctic was under pressure back then, but the deepest scars from mining and oil extraction, and the full impact of the climate crisis, were nightmares still to come. In Horizon (Bodley Head), Lopez returns to the Arctic and travels onwards to five other spots: the Gal\u00e1pagos, Botany Bay, the Kenyan desert, the ice shelves of Antarctica, and Cape Foulweather on the Oregon coast. What he finds is a broken world, but as with other key environmental titles this year, such as Naomi Klein\u2019s On Fire (Penguin) and Greta Thunberg\u2019s pamphlet No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference (Penguin), he discovers space for hope, too. This year saw a flurry of books on one of the greatest scandals of our time: a public health failing so blatant that future generations will read about it in baffled astonishment. In Choked (Granta), Beth Gardiner, a US journalist in London, embarks on a global investigation into filthy air. In rural India and parts of Africa the main culprits are household fires for cooking, and because women and girls make most of the meals, they bear the brunt of the lifelong health problems. In Europe, where particulate-spewing diesel was embraced over petrol, she retells how Volkswagen and other manufacturers shamefully flouted emissions limits. In Britain, rather than bothering to clean the air, successive governments did nothing. If it makes you angry, it should. Polluted air cuts short more than 7 million lives a year around the world. Each breath we take need not be toxic: we know how to fix it. It took the writer and campaigner Caroline Criado Perez to reveal the true extent of the man\u2019s world we live in. What makes Invisible Women (Chatto) so compelling is the mountain of data she draws on. Data, it turns out, matters. Look what happened when the BBC published its gender pay gap figures: the impact was immediate. The pervasiveness of the problem is staggering. While female drivers have fewer accidents, crashes leave them more seriously hurt, because car safety relies on \u201cReference man\u201d, a standard male crash test dummy. And women do worse after heart attacks because they don\u2019t experience the same symptoms as men. From the implications of blind auditions on orchestra hires to big tech culture and its \u201cone size fits men\u201d, this is a brilliant expos\u00e9 that deservedly won the Royal Society science book prize. Robert Macfarlane launched his career from on top of the world. Mountains of the Mind (2003) became an instant classic and the starting point for a trilogy on the connection between landscapes and the human heart. In Underland (Hamish Hamilton), he descends into the \u201cawful darkness inside our world\u201d. It\u2019s a place of myths, burial chambers, deep chasms for dumping nuclear waste, and halls carved out by buried rivers and filled with black sand dunes. Underland is a beautiful if unsettling book through which run familiar themes: fascination, the transience of life and the human impact on the planet. Beyond the thrill of dark, enclosed spaces, far underground, is the shift in perspective forced on us by deep time, the chronology of the underland. \u201cWhen viewed in deep time, things come alive that seemed inert,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe world becomes eerily various and vibrant again. Ice breathes. Rock has tides. Mountains ebb and flow. Stone pulses. We live on a restless Earth.\u201d It\u2019s fabulous stuff. Following on from her acclaimed investigation into sexism (Inferior, 2017), Angela Saini\u2019s Superior (4th Estate) turns to the abuse of science to further racist agendas, and the racism inherent in science itself. The message is how race, a social construction, is biologically meaningless: far more genetic variation exists within populations than between them. As Saini points out, she may have more in common, genetically speaking, with her white neighbour than with the woman downstairs, who like Saini\u2019s parents was born in India.

The title refers to the nicknames of three famous Flemish cyclists (Roger de Vlaeminck, Rik van Looy and Frans Verbeeck) although Pearson introduces us to many more on his rain-soaked travels. Their stories illuminate the landscape and history of this little understood pocket of Europe, where true derring-do is the ability to withstand great suffering, either in the saddle or out of it. The latest book by the Guardian\u2019s Donald McRae weaves the narratives of a group of boxers in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Gerry Storey, the self-effacing hero at the centre of In Sunshine Or in Shadow (Simon &amp; Schuster), is a dock-worker and boxing trainer whose club bridged the loyalist-republican divide even in the deadliest days of violence. Years of interviews and research have informed McRae\u2019s account of Storey\u2019s extraordinary courage, and those of the fighters he reared: men such as Charlie Nash, who lost his brother on Bloody Sunday; Davy Larmour, whose father was horrifically injured by an IRA bomb; and world-champion-to-be Barry McGuigan. The result is as uplifting as it is heartbreaking. \u2022 Save up to 30% on the books of the year at guardianbookshop.com",

      "bodyText": "Amazon is set to break Sky\u2019s and BT\u2019s stranglehold on Premier League football when it begins live-streaming 20 top-flight English football games a season starting next week. The games will be streamed through Amazon\u2019s Prime Video service, on a schedule running from Tuesday 3 December until 27 December, marking the first time in almost three decades that football fans will be able to watch Premier League games for free. Amazon is using the matches to drive subscriptions to its \u00a379-a-year Amazon Prime service, which offers perks including free delivery of goods and music streaming as well as its TV service. But with a 30-day free trial on offer to non-members, many fans will be able to catch top-flight matches such as Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur without paying a penny. Premier League football fans have not been able to watch games free-to-air since Rupert Murdoch took them on to Sky\u2019s pay-TV service in 1992. The company has pulled out all the stops to ensure top class coverage \u2013 and avoid a repeat of the technical issues that marred its first UK exclusive live sport broadcast of the US Open last year \u2013 bringing in big names from Alan Shearer and Gaby Logan to Harry Redknapp and Thierry Henry. Amazon has drafted in 43 hosts, pundits and commentators in total, as it simulcasts five matches on 4 December and six matches on Boxing Day. The company is backing the live streaming with a media blitz of the scale usually reserved for its crown jewel entertainment shows, such as The Grand Tour or Good Omens. The campaign, which uses the strapline \u201cAmazon delivers the Premier League\u201d, includes TV ads across ITV, Sky, BT Sport, Channel 4 and Channel 5 as well as on buses and trains nationally and in tube stations. Amazon is aiming to boost the billions in revenues it makes in the UK annually (\u00a310.9bn last year), and the package of games works perfectly to drive its retail strategy. Prime members shop and spend significantly more than non-members. The run-up to Black Friday and ensuing festive buying season marks the busiest time of the year for sign-ups to Amazon Prime. And the company has learned that hot content super-charges new subscriber numbers. When The Grand Tour launched three years ago it drove one of Amazon\u2019s biggest days of new sign ups. Amazon is releasing a string of new content including the returning hit series Jack Ryan, The Marvellous Mrs Maisel and The Grand Tour, as well as the Andy Murray documentary Resurfacing. It hopes those tuning in for the football will see the value in paying after the trial period expires. The big question is whether Amazon\u2019s foray into streaming Premier League matches will be a short-lived experiment, or whether it marks the beginning of a full assault on the lion\u2019s share of the best matches. \u201cIt really depends how the streaming goes,\u201d says Sarah Simon, senior media analyst at Berenberg. \u201cIf it is a technical and commercial success Amazon might be emboldened to come back for more.\u201d The sheer cost of successfully challenging Sky has meant there have been very few serious challenges over the last 27 years. But then Amazon, with a market value of $900bn and headed by the world\u2019s richest man, Jeff Bezos, is no ordinary rival.

      "bodyText": "Silent film\u2019s place in the streaming realm is a conflicted one: it\u2019s at once ubiquitous and oddly hard to find. Which is to say there\u2019s plenty of it lying around online, often free of charge. The Internet Archive, much praised in this column, is obviously rich in early cinema gems if you can negotiate some circuitous searching, while YouTube is awash in soundless classics and curios alike, albeit in variable states of repair. (At least sound quality is never an issue.) Netflix has more to offer than you\u2019d expect at first glance. The streaming giant\u2019s back catalogue of classics may have dwindled, yet it\u2019s still the place to find a neat transfer of, for example, trailblazing female film-maker Lois Weber\u2019s landmark abortion drama Where Are My Children?, a fascinating social time capsule that\u2019s also less irrelevant than you\u2019d like it to be a full century after it was made. (It\u2019s just over an hour long: sandwich it between episodes of The Crown in your Netflix queue.) Obviously, Mubi occasionally delivers the silent goods, while the BFI Player remains a go-to spot for early British cinema in particular. But dedicated, easily navigable streaming spaces for silent cinema remain a rarity, which makes the Danish Film Institute\u2019s new Stumfilm site a welcome surprise.

      "body": "<p>Many years ago, one of our kids, who is obsessed with dressing up, had done enough good deeds to earn himself a new costume. He was about four years old, and we took him to the shop to make his choice. Almost immediately he chose a Minnie Mouse outfit. We duly bought it, and for many weeks afterwards we had Minnie Mouse with us around the house and on every excursion. Nobody seemed to bat an eyelid, and then one day we were invited to a huge family get-together. It felt too complicated to take him in the costume, as we knew that relatives would ask questions, or somebody would make a comment, and we would be upset that he had to hear from a dissenter within our own ranks. And so we made the decision to ask him to wear something else.</p> <p>I have since regretted that decision, and have often found myself wondering if it showed a lack of guts on our part as parents, as well as being a poor message to send to our son. I take some solace from the fact that we told him he had to wear something smart, and he avoided the obvious loophole of pointing out that Minnie actually wears a dress that is suitable for both formal and casual occasions.</p> <p>Societal pressure raised its head again more recently with another of our sons, who has taken enthusiastically to acting and singing. He has started performing in some bits and pieces, and is enjoying it thoroughly. So far, so \u201clooks like Romesh is using his Guardian column to brag about his kid\u201d. But the other day, he came home to tell us that some kids at school had been saying that his interests made him \u201cgay\u201d. To clarify, they were referring to the drama and singing; I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been copping off with any lads, because obviously that would make it an accurate observation. But it did present a conundrum. To me, the issue was twofold. I am pretty sure that our kids don\u2019t really have any concept of some interests being attached to certain genders or sexualities. That hasn\u2019t been a deliberate choice by me and my wife; it just hasn\u2019t come up. Which begs the question: how do kids acquire these perceptions?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/02/my-luck-must-be-out-watching-arsenal-romesh-ranganathan\">Romesh Ranganathan: my dad had to eat fried chicken before an Arsenal game. Am I any less superstitious?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I guess I\u2019m being polite here: the truth is, I think the parents of these kids are pricks. The other issue was whether to tell our son that being into what he\u2019s into doesn\u2019t make him gay, or to tell him that gay being bandied about as an insult isn\u2019t OK, or both, all the while providing him with the support that he obviously needed as he wanted to discuss this with us, when most days all he says is: \u201cSchool was fine. Can I play Super Smash Bros?\u201d</p> <p>We sat him down to have a parental chat. We talked about being interested in what he\u2019s interested in, and why he shouldn\u2019t let the expectations and presumptions of others shape what he wants to do with his life. I started talking about how the fact I do comedy probably made him more willing to try different things, and my wife told me I was making it about me again. We told him that he should do whatever he wants to do, and that people who do stuff that\u2019s expected of them end up unhappy. Something like that.</p> <p>And after all that, he looked at us and said: \u201cI mean, I might be gay. Who knows? I\u2019m only 10.\u201d It was then that I suspected that he might have been the one who was sitting us down, to have a parental chat.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many years ago, one of our kids, who is obsessed with dressing up, had done enough good deeds to earn himself a new costume. He was about four years old, and we took him to the shop to make his choice. Almost immediately he chose a Minnie Mouse outfit. We duly bought it, and for many weeks afterwards we had Minnie Mouse with us around the house and on every excursion. Nobody seemed to bat an eyelid, and then one day we were invited to a huge family get-together. It felt too complicated to take him in the costume, as we knew that relatives would ask questions, or somebody would make a comment, and we would be upset that he had to hear from a dissenter within our own ranks. And so we made the decision to ask him to wear something else. I have since regretted that decision, and have often found myself wondering if it showed a lack of guts on our part as parents, as well as being a poor message to send to our son. I take some solace from the fact that we told him he had to wear something smart, and he avoided the obvious loophole of pointing out that Minnie actually wears a dress that is suitable for both formal and casual occasions. Societal pressure raised its head again more recently with another of our sons, who has taken enthusiastically to acting and singing. He has started performing in some bits and pieces, and is enjoying it thoroughly. So far, so \u201clooks like Romesh is using his Guardian column to brag about his kid\u201d. But the other day, he came home to tell us that some kids at school had been saying that his interests made him \u201cgay\u201d. To clarify, they were referring to the drama and singing; I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been copping off with any lads, because obviously that would make it an accurate observation. But it did present a conundrum. To me, the issue was twofold. I am pretty sure that our kids don\u2019t really have any concept of some interests being attached to certain genders or sexualities. That hasn\u2019t been a deliberate choice by me and my wife; it just hasn\u2019t come up. Which begs the question: how do kids acquire these perceptions? I guess I\u2019m being polite here: the truth is, I think the parents of these kids are pricks. The other issue was whether to tell our son that being into what he\u2019s into doesn\u2019t make him gay, or to tell him that gay being bandied about as an insult isn\u2019t OK, or both, all the while providing him with the support that he obviously needed as he wanted to discuss this with us, when most days all he says is: \u201cSchool was fine. Can I play Super Smash Bros?\u201d We sat him down to have a parental chat. We talked about being interested in what he\u2019s interested in, and why he shouldn\u2019t let the expectations and presumptions of others shape what he wants to do with his life. I started talking about how the fact I do comedy probably made him more willing to try different things, and my wife told me I was making it about me again. We told him that he should do whatever he wants to do, and that people who do stuff that\u2019s expected of them end up unhappy. Something like that. And after all that, he looked at us and said: \u201cI mean, I might be gay. Who knows? I\u2019m only 10.\u201d It was then that I suspected that he might have been the one who was sitting us down, to have a parental chat.",

The demands amounted to, in the words of one witness, a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d that diverged from US policy goals and benefited Washington\u2019s adversary, Moscow.</p> \n<p>Multiple witnesses recounted a quid pro quo \u2013 a \u201cthis for that\u201d pressure campaign \u2013 that involved Trump withholding $391m in military aid approved by Congress for Ukraine and refusing to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the country\u2019s newly elected president, until he publicly pledged to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fbcc2df6-2ca9-42b1-af23-4ac18002017b\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Latin phrase 'quid pro quo' \u2013 meaning something for something \u2013 simply denotes an exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, the alleged 'quid pro quo' was a deal proposed by the Trump administration in which the Ukrainians would announce an investigation of Joe Biden and 2016 election tampering.

From the Oval Office to the frontlines of Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia, it is based on dozens of hours of public testimony, thousands of pages of depositions conducted by congressional investigators, media interviews, online communications and other available records.

But witnesses said he had \u201cmore insidious\u201d intentions: manufacturing smears against Biden.</p> \n<p>With the help of his Soviet-born associates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/10/rudy-giuliani-associates-trump-campaign-finance-violations-ukraine\">Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman</a>, Giuliani made contact with the Ukrainian general prosecutor at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, and his predecessor, Viktor Shokin.

He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/20/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskiy-takes-office-calls-snap-election\">inaugurated</a> on 20 May, the same day Yovanovitch officially left Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Zelenskiy had campaigned as a reformer who would stand up to Russia and end endemic corruption. To solidify that reputation, few gestures would be as valuable as a meeting with the US president at the White House.</p> \n<p>For weeks after his inauguration the Ukrainians sought a date for a visit. Then a delegation of Ukrainians was invited to meet with then national security adviser John Bolton at the White House on 10 July.</p> \n<p>Neither the Ukrainian officials nor Bolton and his team were prepared for what followed.</p> \n<p>Sitting in Bolton\u2019s office, near the Oval Office, the two sides spoke for nearly 45 minutes before the Ukrainians inquired about a date for a presidential meeting.</p> \n<p>Before Bolton replied, Gordon Sondland, a little-known hotelier who leveraged a million-dollar contribution to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee into an ambassadorship to the EU, pounced.</p> \n<p>Sondland blurted out that an \u201cagreement\u201d had been reached. \u201cThere will be a meeting,\u201d he said, according to testimony, \u201cif specific investigations are put under way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bolton stiffened.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor me, that was unmistakable body language,\u201d British-born Fiona Hill, then the top Russia adviser on the national security council (NSC), later testified, in her self-described <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/21/impeachment-witnesses-are-testimony-welcoming-inspiring-america/\">distinctive working-class English accent</a>. \u201cThen he looked up to the clock and at his watch \u2026 and basically said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s been really great to see you.

The trio was known as the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d and together they helped carry out Giuliani\u2019s shadow foreign policy campaign in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have a deal here with the [acting] chief of staff, [Mick] Mulvaney,\u201d Sondland said, pressing his case. \u201cThere will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations into 2016 and into Burisma\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Ukrainian natural gas company that once employed Biden\u2019s youngest son, Hunter, while he served as vice-president.</p> \n<p>Hill and her deputy, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, confronted Sondland. \u201cI stated to Ambassador Sondland that this was inappropriate and it had nothing to do with national security,\u201d Vindman testified.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7215348e1e77dc2920ac42615a09eb68ea06fbd5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7215348e1e77dc2920ac42615a09eb68ea06fbd5/0_15_4259_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fiona Hill testifies with David Holmes on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, on 21 November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fiona Hill testifies with David Holmes on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, on 21 November.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hill went back to Bolton, who ordered her to report the meeting to John Eisenberg, the senior lawyer on the NSC. \u201cYou tell Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told me, that I am not part of this, whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up,\u201d she testified.</p> \n<p>Asked by impeachment investigators whether she had relayed the message, Hill replied: \u201cI relayed it precisely.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is no public record of Eisenberg ever acting on the complaint.

Days earlier, the suspension of almost $400m in US military assistance for Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531\">had been made public</a>.</p> \n<p>Taylor had become increasingly alarmed by the behind-the-scenes machinations to force Zelenskiy into a \u201cpublic box\u201d by formally announcing that Ukraine was opening investigations into Burisma, the Bidens and 2016 election meddling.</p> \n<p>The Ukrainians were hesitant. They wanted to lock down a date for a meeting at the White House before making a public declaration.</p> \n<p>On 29 August, at the urging of Bolton, Taylor sent a rare cable directly to the secretary of state. Writing in the first person, he told Pompeo that withholding military aid was \u201cfolly\u201d. He testified that it was the first time he had ever sent such a cable in his decades-long career. Pompeo did not reply.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the Warsaw meeting on 1 September, the American delegation discussed how to handle questions about the frozen military assistance. Sondland jumped in and offered what he knew. \u201cIt looks like everything is being held up until these statements get made,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>At the meeting, Zelenskiy immediately brought up the military aid. Pence assured the anxious president that military aid to Ukraine was a priority and that he would raise the issue with Trump when he returned.</p> \n<p>After the inconclusive meeting, Sondland pulled Yermak into an anteroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Yermak asked. That\u2019s when Sondland, according to testimony, told Yermak that the aid would be released if Ukraine announced a new investigation into Burisma. (Sondland later testified that he \u201cpresumed\u201d the two matters were connected in the absence of any \u201ccredible explanation,\u201d but said Trump never explicitly conveyed that to him.)</p> \n<p>Then the ambassador spoke with Morrison, who was part of the delegation. \u201cHe walked across the space and he briefed me on what he had said to Mr Yermak,\u201d testified Morrison, who promptly reported the conversation to Taylor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9404b2018ec4ff9481a6d648ce529d231bf2d84f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9404b2018ec4ff9481a6d648ce529d231bf2d84f/0_181_5248_3149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Pence gives a speech at Pilsudski Square in Warsaw, Poland, on 1 September. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Pence gives a speech at Pilsudski Square in Warsaw, Poland, on 1 September. <br></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wojtek Radwa\u0144ski/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI was alarmed by what Mr Morrison told me about the Sondland\u2013Yermak conversation,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that security assistance, not just the White House meeting, was conditioned on the investigations.\u201d</p> \n<p>Taylor immediately texted Sondland. \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d he asked.</p> \n<p>\u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland replied.</p> \n<p>Taylor called him. He said Sondland told him that \u201c\u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the view from Washington was shifting. At this point, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/us/politics/trump-whistle-blower-complaint-ukraine.html\">according to news reports</a>, Trump was already aware of the existence of the whistleblower complaint while members of Congress pressured the White House to release the aid.</p> \n<p>On 9 September, Taylor texted Sondland again: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sondland, spurred by Taylor\u2019s increasingly \u201cfrantic\u201d texts, said he called Trump directly to ask for clarity.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d Sondland testified that he asked an irritable Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cI want nothing,\u201d he said Trump replied. \u201cI want no quid pro quo.

      "bodyText": "Darkness had settled over Kyiv on the evening of 24 April when Marie Yovanovitch, then US ambassador to Ukraine, was summoned from an event she was hosting at her home to answer an urgent phone call from Washington. The reception was to honor Kateryna Handzyuk, a young anti-corruption activist who died last year from an acid attack. Though the ambassador and the activist had never met, they shared a mission: trying to end a culture of corruption that has persisted for decades in the former Soviet republic. \u201cKateryna paid the ultimate price for her fearlessness in fighting against corruption and for her determined efforts to build a democratic Ukraine,\u201d Yovanovitch said that evening, before presenting the Women of Courage award to Handzyuk\u2019s father, Victor. Yovanovitch \u2013 who had spent 33 years in the US foreign service, serving six presidents, and who was viewed by colleagues and superiors as an exemplary public servant \u2013 left her guests to answer the call at around 10pm. It was Carol Perez, the director general of the state department. \u201cThere\u2019s trouble coming,\u201d she warned Yovanovitch, according to testimony. The concerns, she added, came from \u201cup the street\u201d, an unambiguous reference to the White House. Perez promised to find out more and call back at midnight. The minutes ticked by as Yovanovitch waited, racking her brain for answers. It was a delicate moment for Ukraine\u2019s young democracy, at war with Russia and in the midst of political transition. She had recently been asked to extend her service in Kyiv for another year, until 2020. But she had for months been the target of a smear campaign led by a Ukrainian prosecutor and Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. They wrongly accused her of disloyalty to the president and she believed that Giuliani saw her as a barrier to his interests in Ukraine. Was it possible their effort had succeeded in having her removed? Finally, closer to 1am, the phone rang again. \u201cCome home immediately,\u201d the ambassador was told. \u201cGet on the next plane to the US.\u201d \u2018Quid pro quo\u2019 The abrupt removal of an American ambassador raised the curtain on an extraordinary abuse-of-power drama threatening to unravel the Trump presidency. In private depositions and five nationally televised public hearings as part of the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment investigation, Trump administration officials past and present described Yovanovitch\u2019s ousting and the events that followed as shocking, \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d. In stark detail, they chronicled a concerted effort by the president and his allies to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Joe Biden, the former vice-president and a key political rival for Trump and a baseless and debunked conspiracy theory promoted by Russia that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 US election. The demands amounted to, in the words of one witness, a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d that diverged from US policy goals and benefited Washington\u2019s adversary, Moscow. Multiple witnesses recounted a quid pro quo \u2013 a \u201cthis for that\u201d pressure campaign \u2013 that involved Trump withholding $391m in military aid approved by Congress for Ukraine and refusing to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the country\u2019s newly elected president, until he publicly pledged to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. A whistleblower complaint alleging White House officials had witnessed Trump leverage the power of the presidency for political gain in a conversation with Zelenskiy triggered the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry in September, only the fourth time in American history. New details are still emerging as congressional investigators prepare to deliver a report on their investigation\u2019s findings. Next week the judiciary committee will hold its first public impeachment hearing on the question of whether Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine amount to \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d as provided for in the constitution. This is a comprehensive account of the critical events that have brought Trump to the edge of impeachment. From the Oval Office to the frontlines of Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia, it is based on dozens of hours of public testimony, thousands of pages of depositions conducted by congressional investigators, media interviews, online communications and other available records. In some instances, witnesses remember episodes differently and their recollections are reflected accordingly. Trump has denied all accusations of wrongdoing and insisted there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d. \u2018America\u2019s mayor\u2019 For months beginning in late 2018, Giuliani worked contacts in Ukraine, trying to get what his client \u2013 the president \u2013 wanted. Once regarded as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d and now better recognized as the president\u2019s henchman, Giuliani has insisted that his work was to defend Trump\u2019s reputation and clear up rumors about 2016 election tampering. But witnesses said he had \u201cmore insidious\u201d intentions: manufacturing smears against Biden. With the help of his Soviet-born associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Giuliani made contact with the Ukrainian general prosecutor at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, and his predecessor, Viktor Shokin. Both had complicated relationships with Yovanovitch, and Lutsenko in particular \u201cvowed revenge\u201d on the ambassador, according to testimony. In March 2019, the smear campaign against Yovanovitch ricocheted from articles in the US news outlet the Hill to Donald Trump Jr\u2019s Twitter account. But Lutsenko\u2019s own history of corruption was about to catch up with him, and Giuliani needed more. The former mayor of New York turned to two Ukrainian oligarchs, Dmytro Firtash and Ihor Kolomoisky, each of whom was in the crosshairs of the US justice department for alleged financial crimes. Through Parnas and Fruman, Giuliani offered to help the Ukrainians resolve their legal problems, the men said \u2013 in exchange for favors, including access to Zelenskiy. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and told the New York Times that there is nothing improper about seeking information about the Bidens from the oligarchs. \u201cWhere do you think you get information about crime?\u201d he said. \u2018The Three Amigos\u2019 With Yovanovitch out of the way, Trump began to exploit a new pressure point. Ukraine had just elected Zelenskiy, a comedian and actor with no political experience other than playing the role of president in a TV series. He was inaugurated on 20 May, the same day Yovanovitch officially left Ukraine. Zelenskiy had campaigned as a reformer who would stand up to Russia and end endemic corruption. To solidify that reputation, few gestures would be as valuable as a meeting with the US president at the White House. For weeks after his inauguration the Ukrainians sought a date for a visit. Then a delegation of Ukrainians was invited to meet with then national security adviser John Bolton at the White House on 10 July. Neither the Ukrainian officials nor Bolton and his team were prepared for what followed. Sitting in Bolton\u2019s office, near the Oval Office, the two sides spoke for nearly 45 minutes before the Ukrainians inquired about a date for a presidential meeting. Before Bolton replied, Gordon Sondland, a little-known hotelier who leveraged a million-dollar contribution to Trump\u2019s inauguration committee into an ambassadorship to the EU, pounced. Sondland blurted out that an \u201cagreement\u201d had been reached. \u201cThere will be a meeting,\u201d he said, according to testimony, \u201cif specific investigations are put under way.\u201d Bolton stiffened. \u201cFor me, that was unmistakable body language,\u201d British-born Fiona Hill, then the top Russia adviser on the national security council (NSC), later testified, in her self-described distinctive working-class English accent. \u201cThen he looked up to the clock and at his watch \u2026 and basically said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s been really great to see you. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve got another meeting.\u2019\u201d As the group spilled outside for a photo opportunity, which one attendee, the energy secretary, Rick Perry, commemorated on Twitter, Bolton took Hill aside and told her to follow them into a \u201cdebrief\u201d meeting in the White House basement. There, she found Sondland, with Perry and Kurt Volker, then an envoy to Ukraine. The trio was known as the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d and together they helped carry out Giuliani\u2019s shadow foreign policy campaign in Ukraine. \u201cI have a deal here with the [acting] chief of staff, [Mick] Mulvaney,\u201d Sondland said, pressing his case. \u201cThere will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations into 2016 and into Burisma\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Ukrainian natural gas company that once employed Biden\u2019s youngest son, Hunter, while he served as vice-president. Hill and her deputy, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, confronted Sondland. \u201cI stated to Ambassador Sondland that this was inappropriate and it had nothing to do with national security,\u201d Vindman testified. Hill went back to Bolton, who ordered her to report the meeting to John Eisenberg, the senior lawyer on the NSC. \u201cYou tell Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told me, that I am not part of this, whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up,\u201d she testified. Asked by impeachment investigators whether she had relayed the message, Hill replied: \u201cI relayed it precisely.\u201d There is no public record of Eisenberg ever acting on the complaint. Bolton has so far declined to step forward and say what he knows. Sondland later said their \u201crecollections of protest\u201d jarred with his memory of the meeting, which he described as a \u201cpositive step toward accomplishing our shared goals\u201d. \u201cEveryone was smiling,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone was happy, and we took a picture on the lawn on a nice, sunny day.\u201d The ambassador testified that he worked \u201cat the express direction\u201d of the president on matters related to Ukraine. \u201cTalk to Rudy,\u201d he said Trump had instructed him. Hill said she forewarned Sondland that this would not end well: \u201cI said to him: \u2018Ambassador Sondland, I think this is all going to blow up\u2019 \u2013 and here we are.\u201d The phone call They gathered around a speaker phone in the White House Situation Room: Alexander Vindman, NSC adviser Tim Morrison, and others. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Jennifer Williams, an aide to Mike Pence, were listening, too. At 9.03 on 25 July, Trump picked up the phone and waited to be connected with Zelenskiy. On the call, Trump congratulated Zelenskiy on his parliamentary victory. Zelenskiy told Trump he wanted to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Ukraine and called his American counterpart \u201ca great teacher\u201d. \u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,\u201d Trump replied, according to a call summary published by the White House. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very, very good to Ukraine.\u201d Zelenskiy replied that Trump is \u201cnot only 100%, but actually 1,000%\u201d right. He said Ukraine was \u201calmost ready\u201d to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump replied. He went on to ask for two investigations: one into a 2016 election conspiracy theory about a Democratic \u201cserver\u201d, and the second tied to Biden and his son. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me,\u201d Trump said. Zelenskiy told Trump that his new prosecutor \u201cwill look into the situation, specifically to Burisma, the company that you mentioned in this issue\u201d. The White House summary would later omit the word Burisma, which Vindman insisted Zelenskiy said. After the call ended, the White House advisers sat flabbergasted. Morrison had a sinking feeling and went to the lawyers. Vindman was shocked and went to the lawyers. Williams found the call \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cpolitical in nature\u201d and ensured the vice president had access to a transcript. In the aftermath of the 25 July call, multiple people spoke with an unnamed whistleblower who began to assemble the complaint that would be submitted two weeks later to the inspector general of the intelligence community, and would eventually prompt the opening of the formal impeachment investigation into Trump. Trump maintains that every aspect of the \u201cnothing call\u201d was \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d. The meeting The next morning in Kyiv, Sondland, Volker and Bill Taylor, who replaced Yovanovitch as the top diplomat in Ukraine \u2013 met with Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy told the delegation that Trump had on three occasions during their call the day before raised \u201csome very sensitive issues\u201d that he hoped to broach with the president during an in-person meeting, according to David Holmes, a US embassy official in Kyiv, who took notes during the meeting. At the time, Holmes did not understand the reference because, \u201ccontrary to standard\u201d procedure, the embassy had not received a readout of the call. After the meeting, Taylor and Volker traveled to the front lines in northern Donbass. \u201cI could see the armed and hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact,\u201d Taylor later recalled. \u201cOver 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week. To this day, that continues. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without US assistance.\u201d At this point Taylor was aware the US was withholding congressionally-approved military assistance to Ukraine. But he still didn\u2019t know why. The lunch Sondland had stayed in Kyiv for a meeting with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelenskiy. By the time Holmes was informed that he needed to take notes at the meeting, Sondland had already disappeared upstairs. He raced to catch him, arriving at Yermak\u2019s office too late. Yermak\u2019s assistant refused to let Holmes into the room. She said the men had insisted on meeting \u201cone-on-one\u201d with no notetaker present. Without a choice, he took a seat in the anteroom and waited. The meeting ended after half an hour, at noon. Shortly thereafter, Sondland, Holmes and two staff members were on their way to Sho, a trendy Ukrainian restaurant in the heart of Kyiv\u2019s administrative district. They were led through a dining room with whitewashed walls and ornate chandeliers to a table on the outdoor terrace. Holmes sat opposite Sondland, close enough to share an appetizer. Sondland ordered a bottle of wine for the table. The conversation was breezy and social. Then the ambassador announced he was going to call the president to give him an update on the morning\u2019s meetings. Holmes watched in amazement as Sondland dialed the White House and asked to be patched through to Trump. Embassy officials assume that mobile communications in Ukraine are being monitored, he testified, especially as the country\u2019s major mobile networks are owned by Russian companies. It was lunchtime. All around, waiters in clean white shirts whizzed past with steaming plates of rabbit-filled varenyk and pots of crimson borscht. \u201cGordon Sondland,\u201d he said into the receiver, according to Holmes\u2019s testimony. \u201cHolding for the president.\u201d An unmistakable voice boomed from across the Atlantic. Sondland theatrically jerked the phone away from his ear, \u201cpresumably because of the loud volume\u201d. He told the president he was calling from Kyiv. Trump asked if Sondland was in Ukraine. He was, Sondland replied, and fresh from a meeting with the country\u2019s new president who, he told Trump, \u201cloves your ass\u201d. \u201cSo he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it,\u201d Sondland said. Zelenskiy would do \u201canything you ask him\u201d. From across the table, Holmes said he could hear both sides of the call, which lasted nearly two-minutes and quickly moved on to other topics, including A$AP Rocky and the Kardashians. When the call was done, Holmes, emboldened by the ambassador\u2019s candor, asked whether it was true that the president \u201cdid not give a shit about Ukraine\u201d. Sondland said it was and explained that he only cared about \u201cbig stuff\u201d. A war with Russia should count as \u201cbig stuff\u201d, Holmes countered. Sondland shook his head. Trump was only interested in things like the \u201cBiden investigation\u201d that Giuliani was pushing. \u201cEvery element was extraordinary,\u201d Holmes told investigators. Sondland later said he did not remember the phone call but did not dispute the conversation: \u201cThat sounds like something I would say.\u201d Pence\u2019s Poland visit As a hellscape brewed in the western Atlantic, the White House reconsidered plans to send Trump to Warsaw for an event commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland. Hurricane Dorian had ravaged the Bahamas, leaving hundreds missing and whole neighborhoods washed away, and the category 4 storm was threatening Florida. On the sidelines of the Warsaw event, Trump was to meet with Zelenskiy, but it was decided that Pence would travel to the event in his stead. The Ukrainians were dealing with a looming disaster of their own. Days earlier, the suspension of almost $400m in US military assistance for Ukraine had been made public. Taylor had become increasingly alarmed by the behind-the-scenes machinations to force Zelenskiy into a \u201cpublic box\u201d by formally announcing that Ukraine was opening investigations into Burisma, the Bidens and 2016 election meddling. The Ukrainians were hesitant. They wanted to lock down a date for a meeting at the White House before making a public declaration. On 29 August, at the urging of Bolton, Taylor sent a rare cable directly to the secretary of state. Writing in the first person, he told Pompeo that withholding military aid was \u201cfolly\u201d. He testified that it was the first time he had ever sent such a cable in his decades-long career. Pompeo did not reply. Ahead of the Warsaw meeting on 1 September, the American delegation discussed how to handle questions about the frozen military assistance. Sondland jumped in and offered what he knew. \u201cIt looks like everything is being held up until these statements get made,\u201d he said. At the meeting, Zelenskiy immediately brought up the military aid. Pence assured the anxious president that military aid to Ukraine was a priority and that he would raise the issue with Trump when he returned. After the inconclusive meeting, Sondland pulled Yermak into an anteroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Yermak asked. That\u2019s when Sondland, according to testimony, told Yermak that the aid would be released if Ukraine announced a new investigation into Burisma. (Sondland later testified that he \u201cpresumed\u201d the two matters were connected in the absence of any \u201ccredible explanation,\u201d but said Trump never explicitly conveyed that to him.) Then the ambassador spoke with Morrison, who was part of the delegation. \u201cHe walked across the space and he briefed me on what he had said to Mr Yermak,\u201d testified Morrison, who promptly reported the conversation to Taylor. \u201cI was alarmed by what Mr Morrison told me about the Sondland\u2013Yermak conversation,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis was the first time I had heard that security assistance, not just the White House meeting, was conditioned on the investigations.\u201d Taylor immediately texted Sondland. \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d he asked. \u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland replied. Taylor called him. He said Sondland told him that \u201c\u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance\u201d. But the view from Washington was shifting. At this point, according to news reports, Trump was already aware of the existence of the whistleblower complaint while members of Congress pressured the White House to release the aid. On 9 September, Taylor texted Sondland again: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Sondland, spurred by Taylor\u2019s increasingly \u201cfrantic\u201d texts, said he called Trump directly to ask for clarity. \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d Sondland testified that he asked an irritable Trump. \u201cI want nothing,\u201d he said Trump replied. \u201cI want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelenskiy to do the right thing.\u201d It was also on 9 September that Congress learned of the existence of the whistleblower complaint. Two days later, the military aid is released. Two weeks after that, House speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, announced the commencement of a formal impeachment inquiry, which proceeds next week. \u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d she said, concluding: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A New Yorker who gained US citizenship as a child is suddenly facing deportation, along with several green card-holding members of his family, after apparent targeting by the Trump administration in what the family believes is a clear case of anti-Muslim bias. None of the individuals have a criminal record, and say the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only raised questions about the validity of their immigration status after another relative was arrested following a terrorist incident in the city. The government\u2019s actions have alarmed advocates and led to them accusing officials of meting out unfair \u201ccollective punishment\u201d. Ahsan Ullah, 32, an electrician from Brooklyn, was placed in immigration detention in Kearny, New Jersey, on 22 October. He spent about four weeks separated from his American wife and three children before being released on bond last Tuesday pending the outcome of his case. Four of his relatives, who all hold green cards, are also fighting government efforts to strip them of their US residency status. Since Trump came into office, the number of such denaturalization and citizenship revocation cases filed by DHS has surged. \u201cCitizenship is permanently conditional for many people who were not born here,\u201d said Fahd Ahmed, executive director of the advocacy group Desis Rising Up and Moving (Drum), which has been providing support to the Ullah family. \u201cAt a time when we are seeing a white nationalist current in government and society that wants to depopulate communities of color from this country, these cases are an indication of how their tactics and attacks are evolving.\u201d Ahsan was born in Bangladesh and adopted by his uncle at a young age, the family said. After the uncle won a US visa through the diversity lottery program, Ahsan was granted a green card. He migrated to the US at eight years old and became a citizen several years later. Meanwhile, his uncle successfully petitioned to bring his sister, Ahsan\u2019s biological mother and four siblings to the country as permanent residents in 2011. The family assumed their future in the US was secure. They focused on going to school, building careers and starting families. Ahsan became an electrician, got married and had three children. But everything changed in December 2017, when one of Ahsan\u2019s brothers, Akayed, was arrested for detonating a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City subway station. He was the only person injured, in what was seen as a botched attack. Family members both in the US and Bangladesh were questioned and none was found to have assisted the 27-year-old or to be supportive of terrorist organizations. Akayed was convicted of several terrorism offenses in 2018 and will be sentenced in February. Sherin, Ahsan\u2019s wife, 30, said that the day Akayed was arrested the rest of the family was utterly shocked to learn what he had done. \u201cFor at least three, four months we were in disbelief,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think [Akayed] was capable of this.\u201d From the moment of Akayed\u2019s arrest, other family members say that despite being cleared by law enforcement, they began to see consequences. Ahsan recounted receiving a letter from the bank notifying him that his personal and business banking accounts would be closed, and that the FBI put his business license on hold. Wary clients cancelled their contracts, he said. His mother and siblings would see New York police department squad cars parked regularly near their building and other places they frequented, including their mosque, which they had never remembered seeing before. Then, in April 2019, Ahsan received a letter out of the blue from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), part of the DHS, stating that the agency planned to cancel his US citizenship on the grounds it was not lawfully obtained. In a panic, his mother and siblings applied for citizenship but soon received news that not only had their application been denied but that the DHS intended to revoke their green cards.

In paperwork issued to the family, which was reviewed by the Guardian, the DHS claims that Ahsan, his mother and siblings have no legal or biological relationship to the uncle whose original success in the green card lottery facilitated the others\u2019 settling in the US. Lawyers for the family said they are gathering the paperwork to prove their relationships. The family and their advocates said the treatment amounts to collective punishment. \u201cThis is retribution for sharing the same DNA\u201d as someone accused of terrorism, Ahsan said in a phone call from the Hudson county correctional facility in New Jersey, just before his release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention. \u201cI\u2019ve been here [in the US] since I was a kid \u2013 my school is here, my college is here, my family is here, my business is here, my friends are here, my career is here,\u201d he said . \u201cThis is where my everything is.\u201d DHS declined to comment on the family\u2019s case. What\u2019s happening to the Ullah family is not an isolated case. A report by the Open Society Justice Initiative in September found that the Trump administration has filed three times more civil denaturalization cases, about 30 a year \u2013 stripping Americans of their citizenship \u2013 than the average annual number pursued under the eight preceding presidents. Nearly half of all persons targeted for denaturalization in 2017 and 2018 came from \u201cspecial interest\u201d countries, a label used to identify nations with presumed links to terrorism, including Bangladesh, the report said, which amounted to a policy of \u201ccollective suspicion\u201d. Manar Waheed, senior legislative and advocacy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the data indicates that \u201cthe same communities that this administration has targeted over and over again\u201d are being singled out. Ahsan said that while he was in detention, he missed the moment when his seven-month-old son said \u201cBaba\u201d for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised by all this,\u201d Ahsan said, speaking from the detention facility before he was released on bond. \u201cI pay my taxes, I\u2019ve never done anything wrong, I try to be a model citizen, and I\u2019m here [in detention].\u201d The administration has threatened to deport the family members unless they can prove their relationships are what they have long claimed and had not been challenged by the authorities before. The family is hoping they can reverse the Trump administration action by submitting challenges to the USCIS appeals office, contesting their deportation orders in immigration court and, if necessary, filing civil motions in federal court. But they are dismayed by the turn of events, and very nervous. Sherin said: \u201cYou can play everything by the book and they\u2019ll still get you.\u201d",

Carols in castles With opulent rooms full of antiques and oil paintings, 800-year-old Fyvie Castle, 25 miles north-east of Aberdeen, has hosted King William of Scotland, Robert the Bruce and Charles I.

The wheels of justice can be grindingly slow, experts told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated in knowing when the Epstein cases will come to a close, because we do not yet know all of the cases \u2013 both criminal and civil \u2013 that could find their way into the courts,\u201d said attorney Robert Gottlieb, who has practiced criminal defense for more than four decades.</p> <p>If the only new criminal case related to Epstein involved the jail guards, it could be resolved in a year or so, Gottlieb said, but he added: \u201cI highly doubt that that is going to be the only case.\u201d</p> <p>Veteran defense lawyer Ron Kuby also said the timeline for wrapping up the Epstein saga wasn\u2019t clear.</p> <p>\u201cThe great thing about saying the phrase \u2018the investigation is continuing,\u2019 that\u2019s a phrase that papers over everything \u2013 from \u2018indictment of others is imminent\u2019 to \u2018we\u2019re never going to do anything, but we don\u2019t want to say it,\u2019 and everything in between,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kuby said of Maxwell, \u201cif there was a specific human subject of the investigation, she strikes me as somebody who would be named most likely, but thus far [there\u2019s] nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Maxwell has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

      "bodyText": "The legal fallout from Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s arrest for sex trafficking and subsequent suicide in jail is likely to go on for years, ensuring that those caught up in the saga \u2013 like Prince Andrew \u2013 will face scrutiny and negative headlines for years to come. Federal authorities in the US have repeatedly said that the investigation into the sex trafficking case is ongoing, raising the prospect of a lengthy multi-pronged and international inquiry into the wealthy financier\u2019s jet-set lifestyle. There is already one criminal prosecution in relation to Epstein\u2019s death: two Manhattan correctional center guards were indicted for allegedly trying to hide their failure to check on him in his cell the night he killed himself. About one dozen accusers have also filed lawsuits against the convicted sex offender\u2019s estate, and more litigation is likely, ensuring a multitude of legal cases wending their way through the courts. Finally the whereabouts of Epstein\u2019s alleged procurer, Andrew\u2019s friend and British media heiress Ghislaine Maxwell, remain unknown, sparking a global guessing game about one of the key figures in Epstein\u2019s life. None of this is good news for the Duke of York, whose bumbling BBC Newsnight interview \u2013 in which he denied sexual activity with Epstein\u2019s then 17-year-old accuser, Virginia Giuffre \u2013 has resulted in chaos for the royal family. While the disgraced prince has now been removed from public duties, the Epstein affair seems virtually endless for him, both in time and scope, and is likely to make any return to prominence difficult, when at any moment a new wrinkle in the case might spur more bad headlines and tricky legal questions. Those wanting answers are unlikely to get them immediately. The wheels of justice can be grindingly slow, experts told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated in knowing when the Epstein cases will come to a close, because we do not yet know all of the cases \u2013 both criminal and civil \u2013 that could find their way into the courts,\u201d said attorney Robert Gottlieb, who has practiced criminal defense for more than four decades. If the only new criminal case related to Epstein involved the jail guards, it could be resolved in a year or so, Gottlieb said, but he added: \u201cI highly doubt that that is going to be the only case.\u201d Veteran defense lawyer Ron Kuby also said the timeline for wrapping up the Epstein saga wasn\u2019t clear. \u201cThe great thing about saying the phrase \u2018the investigation is continuing,\u2019 that\u2019s a phrase that papers over everything \u2013 from \u2018indictment of others is imminent\u2019 to \u2018we\u2019re never going to do anything, but we don\u2019t want to say it,\u2019 and everything in between,\u201d he said. Kuby said of Maxwell, \u201cif there was a specific human subject of the investigation, she strikes me as somebody who would be named most likely, but thus far [there\u2019s] nothing.\u201d Maxwell has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Her lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. As for a timeline of potential charges related to the Epstein case, this depends on many factors \u2013 from the statutes of limitations for certain crimes to whether allegations can be proved. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to know what the future holds in terms of criminal prosecutions,\u201d Kuby said. He also opined on the extent of future prosecutions. \u201cThe only people who are likely to face the wrath of the carceral state are the two black guards,\u201d he continued, referring to corrections officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, who have pleaded not guilty. \u201cYou have this massive sprawling international sex trafficking conspiracy involving the richest, whitest people on the planet who, with their white-skinned privilege and political connections and money, escape unwhipped by justice \u2013 and the only people who end up actually facing the criminal system are two overworked, underpaid black prison guards because that\u2019s the nature of racism in America,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou constantly have people at the very bottom who tend to be poor and black answering for crimes of people at the very top, who happen to be rich and white.\u201d As for the civil litigation, finding and retrieving Epstein\u2019s assets could be a complicated process as lawyers seek compensation for his victims, said Dror Bikel, a high-profile New York City divorce lawyer versed in tracking finances. \u201cThere has to be some sort of legal proceeding\u201d involving persons suing his estate, Bikel said. \u201cThe first thing you want to do is get an order restraining anybody from touching any assets at all.\u201d To determine Epstein\u2019s assets, one would start by analyzing tax returns and there could well be \u201cpainstaking forensic accounting work\u201d, he said. Plus, assets which don\u2019t generate income \u2013 such as art \u2013 would not show up on a tax return. The late financier signed a will two days before his death, indicating he was worth $577,672,654 when he died, according to the New York Post, which broke the news of this document. The money, approximately $18m more than what Epstein declared when asking for bail, was put into a trust. The full extent of his wealth \u2013 which includes properties and $18,551,700 in \u201cAviation Assets, Automobiles and Boats\u201d, among other assets \u2013 is not clear.

Stir to combine, then put over a very low heat to infuse for 10 minutes, stirring now and then: it should not simmer or boil at any time. After the 10 minutes, crank up the heat a little. As soon as it begins to simmer, remove from the heat and strain over the chopped chocolate. Scrape and press the lime and vanilla against the sieve to extract all of their flavour, then discard. Add the salt and whisk until you have a smooth ganache. Pour into a shallow container and set aside, uncovered, in a cool place for an hour, then cover and refrigerate until just firm \u2013 about two hours.</p> <p>Line an oven tray with baking paper. Remove the ganache from the fridge and, using a teaspoon, scoop out small mounds of truffle (just over 10g per truffle) and put on to the lined tray \u2013 don\u2019t worry about shaping them at this stage. Refrigerate the truffles for half an hour to firm up, then hand-roll each mound roughly into a ball. Put back in the fridge until very firm.</p> <p>To coat the truffles, put two thirds of the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a small saucepan of simmering water. Stir gently to melt the chocolate, remove from the heat, add the rest of the chocolate and stir until smooth.</p> <p>Using two skewers, dip each truffle ball into the melted chocolate, leaving the excess to drip back into the bowl, then put back on the lined baking tray. Leave the chocolate to set a little, then roll in the chopped pistachio nuts or gently dust with cocoa powder. Refrigerate until completely set before packing in gift bags. The truffles will keep for up to two weeks in an airtight container in the fridge.</p> <h2><strong>Hazelnut and seed brittle</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ada49427cb39d66d453d3a31ce12c0c74e9e641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ada49427cb39d66d453d3a31ce12c0c74e9e641/0_0_3839_4075/942.jpg\" alt=\"Snap decision: Helen Goh\u2019s hazelnut and seed brittle.\" width=\"942\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snap decision: Helen Goh\u2019s hazelnut and seed brittle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>30 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>4-5 small bags</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp sesame seeds</strong><br><strong>150g skinless, roasted hazelnuts</strong>, roughly chopped <br><strong>2 tsp caraway seeds</strong><br><strong>2 tsp coriander seeds</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp flaky sea salt</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp water</strong><br><strong>135g brown sugar</strong><br><strong>135g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>115g unsalted butter</strong>, cubed<br><strong>1 tsp vanilla extract</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp baking soda</strong><br><strong>130g chocolate</strong> (60-70%), melted</p> <p>Roughly chop the hazelnuts (you want fairly big pieces) and transfer to a small bowl. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a low heat. Shake the pan regularly until they begin to take on some colour, then toss into a bowl with the hazelnuts. Toast the caraway and coriander seeds in the same pan for about a minute, then transfer to a mortar or spice grinder to grind coarsely, then add to the hazelnuts. Add the salt and mix to combine, then set aside.</p> <p>Line a large oven tray with baking paper and put it close to the hob. Put the water in a small saucepan, add the sugars and butter, and put on a low heat. Stir gently until the butter has melted and the sugars dissolve.</p> <p>Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a boil. Simmer, stirring regularly to prevent it from catching and burning, then put a sugar thermometer into the caramel and cook until the temperature reaches 150C/300F \u2013 it will begin to smoke a little, but don\u2019t worry.</p> <p>Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and baking soda. Stir gently, being careful as the caramel will bubble up a little, then quickly pour the caramel evenly on to the tray. Using tea towels, carefully tilt the tray so it forms an even layer. Do not spread or touch the caramel as this will alter the consistency of the brittle. Set aside to cool and harden.</p> <p>When the brittle has cooled, spread the melted chocolate all over in an even layer, then immediately sprinkle the nut and seed mix over the top. Set aside in a cool place (but not the fridge or freezer) for the chocolate to set, then break up into large shards to put into gift bags; you should get four to five small bags. The shards will keep for seven to 10 days stored in an airtight container.</p> <h2><strong>Marmalade and almond rugelach</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08f945892e3bf229145279d6210ff0e40aaf183e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08f945892e3bf229145279d6210ff0e40aaf183e/0_0_3839_4075/942.jpg\" alt=\"That\u2019s a wrap: Helen Goh\u2019s marmalade and almond rugelach.\" width=\"942\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That\u2019s a wrap: Helen Goh\u2019s marmalade and almond rugelach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep/chill <strong>2 hr 30 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>25 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>24</strong></p> <p>For the pastry<br><strong>160g plain flour</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp baking powder</strong><br><strong>\u215b tsp salt</strong><br><strong>Finely grated zest of 1 small orange</strong><br><strong>Seeds </strong><strong>of \u00bc vanilla pod</strong><br><strong>125g unsalted butter</strong>, cold, cut into cubes<br><strong>125g cream cheese</strong>, cold</p> <p>For the filling<br><strong>40g flaked almonds</strong>, lightly toasted, crushed<br><strong>80g light muscovado sugar</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp ground cloves</strong><br><strong>150g fine-cut marmalade</strong></p> <p>To glaze<br><strong>25g flaked almonds</strong>, finely crushed <br><strong>\u00bc tsp cinnamon</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp demerara sugar</strong><br><strong>1 egg</strong>, lightly beaten</p> <p>Make the pastry up to two days ahead. Put the flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse twice to combine. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese, and pulse until the dough just begins to come together in a ball around the blade.</p> <p>Tip the dough out on to a lightly floured worktop and knead a little to bring it together. Divide the pastry into two, wrap loosely in clingfilm and press into flattish discs, and transfer to the fridge for at least an hour and up to two days.</p> <p>For the filling, put the almonds in a small bowl with the muscovado sugar, cinnamon and cloves, and set aside. Line a large oven tray with baking paper.</p> <p>Roll each piece of dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 25cm circle about 2mm thick (use a plate or saucepan lid to trace into a circle if your pastry looks very irregular). With a small spatula or back of a spoon, spread the marmalade evenly over each surface, then sprinkle with the almond sugar mix. Use a knife or, even better, a pizza wheel to cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into 12 equal triangles. The best way to do this is to slice into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge starting from the wide, outside edge and working towards the point of the triangle, so that it looks like a miniature croissant. Put on the baking tray, spaced 3cm apart, then leave to rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.</p> <p>When ready to bake, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. For the glaze, crush the flaked almonds with a rolling pin into very fine pieces then combine in a small bowl with the cinnamon and sugar. Lightly brush the tops of the rugelach with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with the almond sugar mix. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown all over, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. These will keep for about four days.</p> <h2><strong>Black treacle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/25/gingerbread-house-recipe-observer-food-monthly-20-best-baking-recipes-christmas\">gingerbread</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a81b9fc23d3fd270d9288409cb386c3df9cafdbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a81b9fc23d3fd270d9288409cb386c3df9cafdbc/0_0_3839_4075/942.jpg\" alt=\"Star of the show: Helen Goh\u2019s black treacle gingerbread.\" width=\"942\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star of the show: Helen Goh\u2019s black treacle gingerbread.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lizzie Mayson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prep <strong>30 min</strong><br>Chill <strong>2 hr</strong><br>Cook <strong>20 min</strong><br>Makes <strong>About 50</strong></p> <p><strong>420g plain flour</strong><br><strong>1 \u00bd tsp baking powder</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp </strong><strong>bicarbonate of/baking soda</strong><br><strong>2 tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>1 tsp each ground cloves,</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp ground ginger, </strong><strong>ground allspice</strong><br><strong>\u00bc tsp freshly grated nutmeg</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp salt</strong><br><strong>125g unsalted butter</strong>, room temperature, cubed<br><strong>200g light muscovado sugar</strong><br><strong>200g black treacle</strong><br><strong>1 egg</strong>, lightly whisked<br><strong>30g candied orange peel </strong>(optional), finely chopped</p> <p>For the glaze<br><strong>100g icing sugar</strong>, sifted<br><strong>2 tbsp water</strong> (or rum)</p> <p>Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt into a bowl and set aside.</p> <p>Put the butter, sugar and treacle in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat on a medium-high speed for about two minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl a couple of times to ensure it is evenly mixed.</p> <p>Add the egg and beat to incorporate, then, on a low speed, add the candied peel (if using) and the dry ingredients.

      "bodyText": "Dried lime truffles with honey and salt (pictured above) Prep 10 min Cool 4 hr+ Cook 1 hr Makes About 40 20g dried limes (about 6) 250ml double cream Seeds and pod of \u00bd vanilla bean 2 tbsp light muscovado sugar 1 tbsp honey 250g dark chocolate (70%), finely chopped \u00bc tsp flaky sea salt To coat 350g dark chocolate (70%), finely chopped 2 tbsp finely chopped pistachios or cocoa powder Put the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl and set aside. Crack open the dried limes \u2013 a light bash in a mortar is very efficient and satisfying here \u2013 then put the pieces of lime shrapnel in a small saucepan with the cream, vanilla, sugar and honey. Stir to combine, then put over a very low heat to infuse for 10 minutes, stirring now and then: it should not simmer or boil at any time. After the 10 minutes, crank up the heat a little. As soon as it begins to simmer, remove from the heat and strain over the chopped chocolate. Scrape and press the lime and vanilla against the sieve to extract all of their flavour, then discard. Add the salt and whisk until you have a smooth ganache. Pour into a shallow container and set aside, uncovered, in a cool place for an hour, then cover and refrigerate until just firm \u2013 about two hours. Line an oven tray with baking paper. Remove the ganache from the fridge and, using a teaspoon, scoop out small mounds of truffle (just over 10g per truffle) and put on to the lined tray \u2013 don\u2019t worry about shaping them at this stage. Refrigerate the truffles for half an hour to firm up, then hand-roll each mound roughly into a ball. Put back in the fridge until very firm. To coat the truffles, put two thirds of the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a small saucepan of simmering water. Stir gently to melt the chocolate, remove from the heat, add the rest of the chocolate and stir until smooth. Using two skewers, dip each truffle ball into the melted chocolate, leaving the excess to drip back into the bowl, then put back on the lined baking tray. Leave the chocolate to set a little, then roll in the chopped pistachio nuts or gently dust with cocoa powder. Refrigerate until completely set before packing in gift bags. The truffles will keep for up to two weeks in an airtight container in the fridge. Hazelnut and seed brittle Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Makes 4-5 small bags 1 tbsp sesame seeds 150g skinless, roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped 2 tsp caraway seeds 2 tsp coriander seeds \u00bc tsp flaky sea salt 2 tbsp water 135g brown sugar 135g caster sugar 115g unsalted butter, cubed 1 tsp vanilla extract \u00bd tsp baking soda 130g chocolate (60-70%), melted Roughly chop the hazelnuts (you want fairly big pieces) and transfer to a small bowl. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a low heat. Shake the pan regularly until they begin to take on some colour, then toss into a bowl with the hazelnuts. Toast the caraway and coriander seeds in the same pan for about a minute, then transfer to a mortar or spice grinder to grind coarsely, then add to the hazelnuts. Add the salt and mix to combine, then set aside. Line a large oven tray with baking paper and put it close to the hob. Put the water in a small saucepan, add the sugars and butter, and put on a low heat. Stir gently until the butter has melted and the sugars dissolve. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a boil. Simmer, stirring regularly to prevent it from catching and burning, then put a sugar thermometer into the caramel and cook until the temperature reaches 150C/300F \u2013 it will begin to smoke a little, but don\u2019t worry. Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and baking soda. Stir gently, being careful as the caramel will bubble up a little, then quickly pour the caramel evenly on to the tray. Using tea towels, carefully tilt the tray so it forms an even layer. Do not spread or touch the caramel as this will alter the consistency of the brittle. Set aside to cool and harden. When the brittle has cooled, spread the melted chocolate all over in an even layer, then immediately sprinkle the nut and seed mix over the top. Set aside in a cool place (but not the fridge or freezer) for the chocolate to set, then break up into large shards to put into gift bags; you should get four to five small bags. The shards will keep for seven to 10 days stored in an airtight container. Marmalade and almond rugelach Prep/chill 2 hr 30 min Cook 25 min Makes 24 For the pastry 160g plain flour \u00bc tsp baking powder \u215b tsp salt Finely grated zest of 1 small orange Seeds of \u00bc vanilla pod 125g unsalted butter, cold, cut into cubes 125g cream cheese, cold For the filling 40g flaked almonds, lightly toasted, crushed 80g light muscovado sugar \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon \u00bc tsp ground cloves 150g fine-cut marmalade To glaze 25g flaked almonds, finely crushed \u00bc tsp cinnamon 1 tbsp demerara sugar 1 egg, lightly beaten Make the pastry up to two days ahead. Put the flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse twice to combine. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese, and pulse until the dough just begins to come together in a ball around the blade. Tip the dough out on to a lightly floured worktop and knead a little to bring it together. Divide the pastry into two, wrap loosely in clingfilm and press into flattish discs, and transfer to the fridge for at least an hour and up to two days. For the filling, put the almonds in a small bowl with the muscovado sugar, cinnamon and cloves, and set aside. Line a large oven tray with baking paper. Roll each piece of dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 25cm circle about 2mm thick (use a plate or saucepan lid to trace into a circle if your pastry looks very irregular). With a small spatula or back of a spoon, spread the marmalade evenly over each surface, then sprinkle with the almond sugar mix. Use a knife or, even better, a pizza wheel to cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into 12 equal triangles. The best way to do this is to slice into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge starting from the wide, outside edge and working towards the point of the triangle, so that it looks like a miniature croissant. Put on the baking tray, spaced 3cm apart, then leave to rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes. When ready to bake, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. For the glaze, crush the flaked almonds with a rolling pin into very fine pieces then combine in a small bowl with the cinnamon and sugar. Lightly brush the tops of the rugelach with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with the almond sugar mix. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown all over, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. These will keep for about four days. Black treacle gingerbread Prep 30 min Chill 2 hr Cook 20 min Makes About 50 420g plain flour 1 \u00bd tsp baking powder \u00bc tsp bicarbonate of/baking soda 2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp each ground cloves, 1 tsp ground ginger, ground allspice \u00bc tsp freshly grated nutmeg \u00bd tsp salt 125g unsalted butter, room temperature, cubed 200g light muscovado sugar 200g black treacle 1 egg, lightly whisked 30g candied orange peel (optional), finely chopped For the glaze 100g icing sugar, sifted 2 tbsp water (or rum) Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt into a bowl and set aside. Put the butter, sugar and treacle in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat on a medium-high speed for about two minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl a couple of times to ensure it is evenly mixed. Add the egg and beat to incorporate, then, on a low speed, add the candied peel (if using) and the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough comes together around the paddle, then tip out on to a clean, lightly floured worktop. Knead gently to bring together, then split roughly into two. Cover each half with a wet tea towel, then press gently to form flattish discs, put in the fridge for at least two hours and up to three days. When ready to bake, heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/gas 5\u00bd and line two oven trays with baking paper. Working with one piece of dough at a time, unwrap and put on a lightly floured worktop. Roll the disc out to 6-7mm thick, then use biscuit cutters to cut out shapes. Transfer to the lined trays, then bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown. The biscuits will be crisp around the edges and slightly soft in the middle. While the biscuits are cooking, make the glaze by whisking together the icing sugar and water/rum). When done, remove the biscuits from the oven, leave to stand for two minutes, then brush with the glaze while the biscuits are still warm. Cool completely before wrapping. The biscuits will be crisp to begin with and will soften over time, and will keep for three weeks. \u2022 Helen Goh is co-author of Sweet (Ebury Press, \u00a327) and product developer at Ottolenghi.",

      "body": "<p>It was just a small question in our regular Consumer Champions column. Why, a reader asked, had her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/25/dr-martens-boots-quality-wear-tear\" title=\"\">\u00a3170 Dr Martens boots fallen apart</a> after just six months? The response was huge, with readers accusing the bootmaker of sacrificing quality, offshoring production and chasing profits under the ownership of a London-based private equity company a long way from its roots in Northamptonshire.</p> <p>Much of the response was emotional: from the moment the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend scissor-kicked his way on stage in 1967 wearing eight-eyes boots, through to the height of punk, wearing Dr Martens has been a symbol of British working-class subculture. The company\u2019s shift to China, factory closures in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Somerset, and a takeover by private equity, seem symbolic of what has happened to the British economy since then. Yes, there\u2019s still a \u201cMade in England\u201d label on some Dr Martens \u2013 but today only 2% of its shoes are manufactured in England, with everything else moved to Asia.</p> <p>So has there really been a decline in quality? Many Guardian readers think so. One sent us pictures of her poorly stitched boots. \u201cI bought the limited edition Lazy Oaf X boots for \u00a3180, two out of the three boots we ordered have broken! I have previous pairs of Dr Martens which have lasted me five-plus years so I know I haven\u2019t \u2018worn them out\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94fe741ceccef16fdbe0a646c049632a19bbbe13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94fe741ceccef16fdbe0a646c049632a19bbbe13/0_340_1985_2479/801.jpg\" alt=\"Pete Townshend on stage\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pete Townshend of the Who lent Dr Martens the sheen of stardom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another reader, CH, says: \u201cI purchased cherry red shoes and within eight months the sole was coming away from the shoe. Sadly Dr M\u2019s workmanship and quality is not as good as it once was.\u201d</p> <p>QBC from London wrote to Dr Martens, alleging: \u201cYour production standards have dropped. The previous pair had a moulded insole that could be removed from the boot and fitted perfectly right into the toe of the boot. The replacement pair has a glued-in flat-foam insole which leaves a gap between it and the inside of the boot. Not only that but the leather that comprises the tongue is 0.2mm thinner \u2013 1.4mm compared to 1.6mm of the previous pair.\u201d</p> <p>But Dr Martens\u2019 chief executive, Kenny Wilson, who joined in 2018 from the home furnishing store Cath Kidston, robustly rejects the allegations. \u201cWhile we produce around 11m pairs of shoes a year and have a very low rate of defects (0.5% of our total), we accept and acknowledge that we don\u2019t get it right all the time. In these cases we work very hard to understand what happened and learn from it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b30eb455025659d8a4d2c6f2a6253729ac1cddaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b30eb455025659d8a4d2c6f2a6253729ac1cddaf/0_263_6650_3990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Martens chief executive Kenny Wilson at its head office in Camden, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Martens chief executive Kenny Wilson at its head office in Camden, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chief operating officer, Geert Peeters, says the shoes are still all welted, the leather has not changed and production standards have not slipped. The materials suppliers have not changed for decades and there is stringent quality control, the company says. It denies that the leather is thinner, and says shoe construction remains the same as on 1 April 1960, the day the 1460 boot was named and first made.</p> <p>Has the move to factories in China sent quality spiralling? One commentator alleges: \u201cAs any Dr Martens aficionado knows, the quality plummeted when they moved most production out of the UK. I have two otherwise identical pairs of Dr Martens boots \u2013 one UK made, one Chinese-made \u2013 and while the UK-made ones are among the most comfortable footwear I own, the Chinese-made ones [are]made of nasty, rigid, thinner leather \u2026 in this case the manufacturer apparently sacrificed quality for profit, and its customers are paying the price in bunions and blisters.\u201d</p> <p>Not true, says Dr Martens. The shift to Asia was in 2004, so it\u2019s by no means a recent development. It says the production methods used in its Asian factories are identical to those at its base in England, and that you could pick up an operator in one of its Asia factories and shift them to England, and all the processes would be exactly the same \u201call the way down to putting the lid on the box\u201d.</p> <p>Other critics say it is not China that\u2019s the problem, but its new owners. Dr Martens is now owned by Permira, a \u00a330bn group headquartered in Pall Mall, London, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/24/dr-martens-private-equity-permira\" title=\"\">bought it in 2013</a> from the Griggs family for \u00a3300m.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0633eeccc38ca443b0578961dee38c5e3a69becb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0633eeccc38ca443b0578961dee38c5e3a69becb/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four pairs of black Fr Marten shoes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Marten shoes can last for years \u2013 but are quality standards slipping?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Grady/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe stitching came apart on my slip-on boots. Take a brand, hand it over to venture capitalists, who then slash costs and pimp image,\u201d was the view of one reader.</p> <p>Critics of private equity firms say they typically make deep cuts to jobs and operating costs then sell the business off five or six years later for a quick profit. Indeed, one Labour MP said in 2007 it was a \u201cnational scandal that the casino capitalists from global private equity groups are allowed to treat British workers and some of our biggest companies as nothing more than pawns in a game of get rich quick\u201d. Those were the words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/23/privateequity1\" title=\"\">John McDonnell</a>, then a lowly backbench MP who no one thought might one day be a serious contender to become chancellor of the exchequer.</p> <p>But the company says it is a fiction that there has been cost cutting or asset stripping. \u201cOur growth story is driven by investment. Operating expenses grew by 30% last year, and for the period of Permira\u2019s ownership, investment in operating expenses has been larger than revenue growth. And we have just made a big investment in our factory in England to double production.\u201d</p> <p>Yet what is also apparent from the response to our story is how many readers were recommending a brand called Solovair instead. Its shoes are strikingly similar to Dr Martens, and they are all made in England. The company made Dr Martens shoes under licence for 35 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around since 1881 in Northamptonshire, and in 2006 were bought out by a local person who saved the company and kept all 60 employees in their jobs. We\u2019re still very small compared with Dr Martens, but we\u2019re growing fast.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "It was just a small question in our regular Consumer Champions column. Why, a reader asked, had her \u00a3170 Dr Martens boots fallen apart after just six months? The response was huge, with readers accusing the bootmaker of sacrificing quality, offshoring production and chasing profits under the ownership of a London-based private equity company a long way from its roots in Northamptonshire. Much of the response was emotional: from the moment the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend scissor-kicked his way on stage in 1967 wearing eight-eyes boots, through to the height of punk, wearing Dr Martens has been a symbol of British working-class subculture. The company\u2019s shift to China, factory closures in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and Somerset, and a takeover by private equity, seem symbolic of what has happened to the British economy since then. Yes, there\u2019s still a \u201cMade in England\u201d label on some Dr Martens \u2013 but today only 2% of its shoes are manufactured in England, with everything else moved to Asia. So has there really been a decline in quality? Many Guardian readers think so. One sent us pictures of her poorly stitched boots. \u201cI bought the limited edition Lazy Oaf X boots for \u00a3180, two out of the three boots we ordered have broken! I have previous pairs of Dr Martens which have lasted me five-plus years so I know I haven\u2019t \u2018worn them out\u2019.\u201d Another reader, CH, says: \u201cI purchased cherry red shoes and within eight months the sole was coming away from the shoe. Sadly Dr M\u2019s workmanship and quality is not as good as it once was.\u201d QBC from London wrote to Dr Martens, alleging: \u201cYour production standards have dropped. The previous pair had a moulded insole that could be removed from the boot and fitted perfectly right into the toe of the boot. The replacement pair has a glued-in flat-foam insole which leaves a gap between it and the inside of the boot. Not only that but the leather that comprises the tongue is 0.2mm thinner \u2013 1.4mm compared to 1.6mm of the previous pair.\u201d But Dr Martens\u2019 chief executive, Kenny Wilson, who joined in 2018 from the home furnishing store Cath Kidston, robustly rejects the allegations. \u201cWhile we produce around 11m pairs of shoes a year and have a very low rate of defects (0.5% of our total), we accept and acknowledge that we don\u2019t get it right all the time. In these cases we work very hard to understand what happened and learn from it.\u201d The chief operating officer, Geert Peeters, says the shoes are still all welted, the leather has not changed and production standards have not slipped. The materials suppliers have not changed for decades and there is stringent quality control, the company says. It denies that the leather is thinner, and says shoe construction remains the same as on 1 April 1960, the day the 1460 boot was named and first made. Has the move to factories in China sent quality spiralling? One commentator alleges: \u201cAs any Dr Martens aficionado knows, the quality plummeted when they moved most production out of the UK. I have two otherwise identical pairs of Dr Martens boots \u2013 one UK made, one Chinese-made \u2013 and while the UK-made ones are among the most comfortable footwear I own, the Chinese-made ones [are]made of nasty, rigid, thinner leather \u2026 in this case the manufacturer apparently sacrificed quality for profit, and its customers are paying the price in bunions and blisters.\u201d Not true, says Dr Martens. The shift to Asia was in 2004, so it\u2019s by no means a recent development. It says the production methods used in its Asian factories are identical to those at its base in England, and that you could pick up an operator in one of its Asia factories and shift them to England, and all the processes would be exactly the same \u201call the way down to putting the lid on the box\u201d. Other critics say it is not China that\u2019s the problem, but its new owners. Dr Martens is now owned by Permira, a \u00a330bn group headquartered in Pall Mall, London, which bought it in 2013 from the Griggs family for \u00a3300m. \u201cThe stitching came apart on my slip-on boots. Take a brand, hand it over to venture capitalists, who then slash costs and pimp image,\u201d was the view of one reader. Critics of private equity firms say they typically make deep cuts to jobs and operating costs then sell the business off five or six years later for a quick profit. Indeed, one Labour MP said in 2007 it was a \u201cnational scandal that the casino capitalists from global private equity groups are allowed to treat British workers and some of our biggest companies as nothing more than pawns in a game of get rich quick\u201d. Those were the words of John McDonnell, then a lowly backbench MP who no one thought might one day be a serious contender to become chancellor of the exchequer. But the company says it is a fiction that there has been cost cutting or asset stripping. \u201cOur growth story is driven by investment. Operating expenses grew by 30% last year, and for the period of Permira\u2019s ownership, investment in operating expenses has been larger than revenue growth. And we have just made a big investment in our factory in England to double production.\u201d Yet what is also apparent from the response to our story is how many readers were recommending a brand called Solovair instead. Its shoes are strikingly similar to Dr Martens, and they are all made in England. The company made Dr Martens shoes under licence for 35 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around since 1881 in Northamptonshire, and in 2006 were bought out by a local person who saved the company and kept all 60 employees in their jobs. We\u2019re still very small compared with Dr Martens, but we\u2019re growing fast.\u201d",

For the past two years, she and her husband\u2019s family have made each other\u2019s presents. \u201cIt started a couple of years ago when money was a bit tight and my husband\u2019s mum said: \u2018Let\u2019s do one Secret Santa present that we purchase and then one crafty gift.\u2019 So now we draw names out of a hat around October time.</p> <p>The rule is you have to make it yourself. It\u2019s a really nice thing to do and you\u2019re not buying for the sake of buying. It\u2019s all quite eco conscious. The beauty of it is that you have to think about what that person has been talking about or mentioned.\u201d</p> <p>The upshot of the different approach to Christmas presents is that it often involves picking up a new skill or improving existing handcrafting skills.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband learned to use the sewing machine when he made a pillow for his mum. I once knitted a scarf for my father-in-law as he was gardening in the winter.\u201d</p> <p>So far Spina, a social media marketing manager living in Edinburgh, has received a wine rack from her father-in-law and homemade cosmetics. There\u2019s no limit on the amount spent but Spina says they try to encourage each other to keep it to a minimum. \u201cSometimes we set a little challenge so this year is to buy via Freecycle and upcycle it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6293edf29363f77eda4c8e1623fce0440373de16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6293edf29363f77eda4c8e1623fce0440373de16/0_48_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Espensen\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Espensen says local businesses are worth supporting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Espensen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I buy local \u2013 anyone hustling out there is worth supporting\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Sam Espensen, 46, </em><em> lives in Bristol </em></p> <p>Running Bristol Spirit, a bar in Bristol, Sam Espensen, 46, knows only too well how much business is dependent on the support of her community. That\u2019s why since 2015 she has committed to buying presents from local traders for family and friends.</p> <p>\u201cI became conscious of the impact buying locally has, from an economic point of view and also how much people appreciate something independently made,\u201d says Sam, who also founded her own drinks brand. \u201cThey also tend to be at the forefront of new trends, environmentally conscious ways of manufacturing and producing, and you can genuinely see how their businesses make a difference to their own lives and the local people they employ. I\u2019m a producer myself \u2013 and when I meet fellow indies and see the huge amount of work, ethics and creativity they offer I really want to support that.\u201d</p> <p>Espensen spends between \u00a35 and \u00a315 a person on presents such as jewellery, art and home products for family members such as her aunt and cousin, as well as goddaughter and friends. Past Christmas presents she\u2019s bought from local businesses include chutney from GingerBeard\u2019s Preserves in Bristol and a pressed flower frame from Paly Glass. The Bristolian believes supporting local businesses at Christmas makes shopping a lot more fun. \u201cIt\u2019s also a lot more mindful as you\u2019re genuinely interacting with who you\u2019re buying from and for \u2013 less mad dash round the shops and more checking out markets and local shops.\u201d </p> <p>Given the economic and political backdrop, she says it\u2019s more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. \u201cThere is increasing uncertainty about job security \u2013 and anyone hustling out there on their own is worth supporting,\u201d she adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c8a8b6c73b45ef203f4e408266b5c3a3978bcd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c8a8b6c73b45ef203f4e408266b5c3a3978bcd2/89_181_1111_667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Watkivs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Watkivs finds buying Christmas presents a lot easier since she decided to avoid waste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Watkivs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m having a zero-waste Christmas\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>Charlotte Watkivs, 26, lives in Birmingham</em></p> <p>After Charlotte Watkivs, 26, moved to a zero-waste lifestyle at the start of 2017, she soon realised she had to think differently about gifts. When it came to Christmas, first to change was the wrapping paper. \u201cPreviously, I was wrapping presents in cheap, shiny wrapping paper,\u201d says Watkivs, who runs a social enterprise, <a href=\"http://zerowastelife.co.uk/\" title=\"\">zerowastelife.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I used up all the papers I already owned, I switched to brown paper and now I customise it with stamps or paper-cut shapes. I never used to think about where anything I was buying came from before it reached me, or where it would end up after I\u2019d used it.\u201d</p> <p>Now she abides by \u201cfive Rs\u201d: refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot. \u201cIf what I buy doesn\u2019t fall into one of those zero-waste methods of waste reduction, I won\u2019t buy it. Local and ethical gifts often fit into these categories already and experience gifts are brilliant as they are typically zero waste.\u201d</p> <p>Past \u201cwaste-free\u201d gifts she has bought include preserves and handmade truffles from independent delis in Birmingham for her grandparents. This year she plans to buy a cookery course at a local bakery for her dad. \u201cThese gifts really align with my values of supporting the local economy, being low waste or being an experience.\u201d</p> <p>Watkivs says she now finds buying Christmas presents a lot easier. \u201cI find that it cuts out a lot of the overwhelming choice that can be out there on the high street. I used to think about quantity over quality when it came to presents. I would assume that multiple presents looked more generous, even if these were the tacky kind of present that gets discarded on Boxing Day. It means I buy less, at a higher quality and I also have to really think about what I buy and whether they will get real value from it.\u201d</p>",

It really is more special.\u201d \u2018We make gifts for each other\u2019 Marguerite Spina, 34, lives in Edinburgh For Marguerite Spina, 34, Christmas now means getting crafty. For the past two years, she and her husband\u2019s family have made each other\u2019s presents. \u201cIt started a couple of years ago when money was a bit tight and my husband\u2019s mum said: \u2018Let\u2019s do one Secret Santa present that we purchase and then one crafty gift.\u2019 So now we draw names out of a hat around October time. The rule is you have to make it yourself. It\u2019s a really nice thing to do and you\u2019re not buying for the sake of buying. It\u2019s all quite eco conscious. The beauty of it is that you have to think about what that person has been talking about or mentioned.\u201d The upshot of the different approach to Christmas presents is that it often involves picking up a new skill or improving existing handcrafting skills. \u201cMy husband learned to use the sewing machine when he made a pillow for his mum. I once knitted a scarf for my father-in-law as he was gardening in the winter.\u201d So far Spina, a social media marketing manager living in Edinburgh, has received a wine rack from her father-in-law and homemade cosmetics. There\u2019s no limit on the amount spent but Spina says they try to encourage each other to keep it to a minimum. \u201cSometimes we set a little challenge so this year is to buy via Freecycle and upcycle it.\u201d \u2018I buy local \u2013 anyone hustling out there is worth supporting\u2019 Sam Espensen, 46, lives in Bristol Running Bristol Spirit, a bar in Bristol, Sam Espensen, 46, knows only too well how much business is dependent on the support of her community. That\u2019s why since 2015 she has committed to buying presents from local traders for family and friends. \u201cI became conscious of the impact buying locally has, from an economic point of view and also how much people appreciate something independently made,\u201d says Sam, who also founded her own drinks brand. \u201cThey also tend to be at the forefront of new trends, environmentally conscious ways of manufacturing and producing, and you can genuinely see how their businesses make a difference to their own lives and the local people they employ. I\u2019m a producer myself \u2013 and when I meet fellow indies and see the huge amount of work, ethics and creativity they offer I really want to support that.\u201d Espensen spends between \u00a35 and \u00a315 a person on presents such as jewellery, art and home products for family members such as her aunt and cousin, as well as goddaughter and friends. Past Christmas presents she\u2019s bought from local businesses include chutney from GingerBeard\u2019s Preserves in Bristol and a pressed flower frame from Paly Glass. The Bristolian believes supporting local businesses at Christmas makes shopping a lot more fun. \u201cIt\u2019s also a lot more mindful as you\u2019re genuinely interacting with who you\u2019re buying from and for \u2013 less mad dash round the shops and more checking out markets and local shops.\u201d Given the economic and political backdrop, she says it\u2019s more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. \u201cThere is increasing uncertainty about job security \u2013 and anyone hustling out there on their own is worth supporting,\u201d she adds. \u2018I\u2019m having a zero-waste Christmas\u2019 Charlotte Watkivs, 26, lives in Birmingham After Charlotte Watkivs, 26, moved to a zero-waste lifestyle at the start of 2017, she soon realised she had to think differently about gifts. When it came to Christmas, first to change was the wrapping paper. \u201cPreviously, I was wrapping presents in cheap, shiny wrapping paper,\u201d says Watkivs, who runs a social enterprise, zerowastelife.co.uk. \u201cWhen I used up all the papers I already owned, I switched to brown paper and now I customise it with stamps or paper-cut shapes. I never used to think about where anything I was buying came from before it reached me, or where it would end up after I\u2019d used it.\u201d Now she abides by \u201cfive Rs\u201d: refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot. \u201cIf what I buy doesn\u2019t fall into one of those zero-waste methods of waste reduction, I won\u2019t buy it. Local and ethical gifts often fit into these categories already and experience gifts are brilliant as they are typically zero waste.\u201d Past \u201cwaste-free\u201d gifts she has bought include preserves and handmade truffles from independent delis in Birmingham for her grandparents. This year she plans to buy a cookery course at a local bakery for her dad. \u201cThese gifts really align with my values of supporting the local economy, being low waste or being an experience.\u201d Watkivs says she now finds buying Christmas presents a lot easier. \u201cI find that it cuts out a lot of the overwhelming choice that can be out there on the high street. I used to think about quantity over quality when it came to presents. I would assume that multiple presents looked more generous, even if these were the tacky kind of present that gets discarded on Boxing Day. It means I buy less, at a higher quality and I also have to really think about what I buy and whether they will get real value from it.\u201d",

If my bank shut half its branches, I don\u2019t think I or many of its other customers would even notice.</p> <p>How should we approach stories about banks closing their branches? Rush to the barricades and demand they are kept open? Or sigh and accept that some of these high-rent locations barely see a customer for hours, and are going the same way as the telephone box?</p> <p>TSB this week said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/25/tsb-close-branches-jobs-bank-it-meltdown\" title=\"\">close another 86 branches</a> next year. RBS Group (including NatWest) has closed 1,085 of its branches since 2015, and now has just 846 left. HSBC is down to 624 from 1,066 four years ago. In total, a third of all bank branches have disappeared in a remarkably short space of time. The former head of Barclays said last year he expected another half of all branches to close in the next five to 10 years. Judged by the pace of closures recently, it will probably be sooner than that.</p> <p>It\u2019s a personal disaster for those working in the branches. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in banking since the financial crash, and frontline branch staff have been hit hardest.</p> <p>After every branch closure announcement, there\u2019s a PR routine. Unions express their outrage at job losses. The bank says it is only closing as a last resort, conditions are \u201cchallenging\u201d, but customers can always use the Post Office instead. Consumer groups issue statements expressing their horror at the closures, and anger over how older customers are being abandoned. Rinse and repeat a month later when the next bank makes the same announcement.</p> <p>There are lots of banks that never go through this routine. Monzo and Starling don\u2019t. Their now very large customer bases \u2013 and they are not all 20-something millennials \u2013 don\u2019t use their branches (they don\u2019t have any) and they somehow get by. And we forget very quickly: all 164 branches of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester were shut in 2009. No one mourns them today.</p> <p>Which? is fond of research that says that \u201ctwo-thirds of people would find life difficult without convenient access to a branch\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s nearly December and I haven\u2019t been in a branch of my bank so far this year. I don\u2019t think I went last year either. If my bank shut half its branches, I don\u2019t think I or many of its other customers would even notice. How should we approach stories about banks closing their branches? Rush to the barricades and demand they are kept open? Or sigh and accept that some of these high-rent locations barely see a customer for hours, and are going the same way as the telephone box? TSB this week said it would close another 86 branches next year. RBS Group (including NatWest) has closed 1,085 of its branches since 2015, and now has just 846 left. HSBC is down to 624 from 1,066 four years ago. In total, a third of all bank branches have disappeared in a remarkably short space of time. The former head of Barclays said last year he expected another half of all branches to close in the next five to 10 years. Judged by the pace of closures recently, it will probably be sooner than that. It\u2019s a personal disaster for those working in the branches. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in banking since the financial crash, and frontline branch staff have been hit hardest. After every branch closure announcement, there\u2019s a PR routine. Unions express their outrage at job losses. The bank says it is only closing as a last resort, conditions are \u201cchallenging\u201d, but customers can always use the Post Office instead. Consumer groups issue statements expressing their horror at the closures, and anger over how older customers are being abandoned. Rinse and repeat a month later when the next bank makes the same announcement. There are lots of banks that never go through this routine. Monzo and Starling don\u2019t. Their now very large customer bases \u2013 and they are not all 20-something millennials \u2013 don\u2019t use their branches (they don\u2019t have any) and they somehow get by. And we forget very quickly: all 164 branches of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester were shut in 2009. No one mourns them today. Which? is fond of research that says that \u201ctwo-thirds of people would find life difficult without convenient access to a branch\u201d. Really? In my south London suburb there were five branches when I moved there. Now there are zero. During the same period the area has economically boomed. Some people are undoubtedly inconvenienced when a branch closes, especially if they are a business with heavy dealings in cash. But today, few are. I had dinner with the boss of one of the major banks last week. They were being contrite about recent closures, as banks tend to be towards the press. Why don\u2019t you just close the lot, I ventured, trying to tease out what they really think. They perked up rather a lot \u2013 yes, they said, many branches are empty these days, now that smartphones are the main way they serve customers. And the explosion in contactless payments has meant demand for cash handling services has collapsed. In truth, the banks see a future where their branches serve first-time buyers, for face-to-face mortgage interviews, and small businesses, for loans and financial guidance. There\u2019s every reason for these services to be provided in business parks, with easy parking. And in the meantime they will maintain a high street presence \u2013 albeit one that receives little investment \u2013 to serve a dwindling number of older customers who are unable or unwilling to use app-based banking.

All the banks will be trying to avoid being the last one standing, meaning some may close even before they really have to.

Airports do it with car hire desks. Shopping centres do it with food courts. But it won\u2019t happen. The unhappy dance will continue, with one set of customers deeply frustrated and others oblivious, until most branches are gone. If you want to keep your local bank branch, the answer\u2019s simple: use it. But very few people will. p.collinson@theguardian.com",

She played Kelly, fighting mortality in the real world while partying it up in a virtual, artificially created alternate reality. Her character was desperately in love with life, and Mbatha-Raw\u2019s performance too was joy personified. The episode was acclaimed for treating the same-sex relationship at its centre with an optimism and lightness of touch, and Kelly and Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) swiftly became queer icons. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it culturally,\u201d says Mbatha-Raw of her initial response to the script. \u201cI just thought: \u2018Wow, I love this story. I have to do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She is, though, \u201cthrilled\u201d at the impact it has had and loves working on material that breaks down cultural barriers \u2013 as San Junipero did, as Belle did, as the recent black skinhead drama Farming did. There is also next year\u2019s Misbehaviour, set around 1970\u2019s Miss World competition, in which she plays Jennifer Hosten, the first woman of colour to win the event. That year, women\u2019s liberation movement activists stormed the stage on live television. They swung football rattles as the host Bob Hope did his shtick, before hurling rotten fruit, flour and smoke bombs all over the shop.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>intersectional</em>,\u201d says Mbatha-Raw, playfully affecting a faux-American accent. \u201cI love it. Miss World in 1970 was ridiculously misogynistic. It\u2019s amazing to reflect on how far we\u2019ve come. But also, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Hosten\">Jennifer Hosten</a>, it challenged perceptions of who is allowed to be a beauty queen. Perceptions of beauty [itself].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d601e72c956f24ac12f42c880bbf4a07ccd78188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d601e72c956f24ac12f42c880bbf4a07ccd78188/0_321_2829_3535/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mbatha-Raw in Nell Gwynn.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Royal mistress ... Mbatha-Raw in Nell Gwynn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of Mbatha-Raw\u2019s work speaks to a worldview formed early on: she was born in Oxford in 1983 to a black South African doctor and a white British nurse. \u201cMy parents are from different countries, completely different cultures,\u201d she says. As a student activist in South Africa, her father campaigned against apartheid. \u201cHe was part of the ANC,\u201d she says, \u201cfighting for their rights.\u201d At risk of being sent to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for almost two decades, he left South Africa, helped to resettle by the UN\u2019s Refugee Agency UNHCR.</p> <p>Being biracial, she says, \u201cis an interesting perspective, because you can see every side of that conversation. I definitely relate to the idea of bringing people together. My first trip to South Africa [in December 2013] to see my family there, they jokingly called me The Unifier; that\u2019s what they called Nelson Mandela at one point. But I feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to unite the different parts of my life. And I think that it\u2019s my responsibility to do that in my work.\u201d</p> <p> Belle is another case in point. Dido Belle, raised by the Earl of Mansfield in Kenwood House, north London, goes on to further the progress of abolitionists (on screen in any case; there was some dramatic licence). Mbatha-Raw had chased the role because she was excited to get the chance to play a black woman in a period costume drama who wasn\u2019t a servant. \u201cI think it\u2019s really, really important to bring to light these untold stories,\u201d she says. \u201cThey deserve to have an audience.\u201d</p> <p>Although fictional, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s character in her new film, the Edward Norton-directed, 1950s-set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/motherless-brooklyn-film-review-edward-norton\">Motherless Brooklyn</a>, had a similar pull. She plays Laura Rose, a lawyer and community activist campaigning against racial discrimination. Norton\u2019s detective Lionel Essrog begins following her, and as a bond begins to grow, she guides him through a corrupt political landscape. It is a tender relationship but Laura Rose, battling the city\u2019s big business behemoths, is more than the love interest or spider-woman often found in such genre work.</p> <p>\u201cWith movies from the 50s,\u201d says Mbatha-Raw, \u201cwe\u2019re so used to seeing the archetypal housewife. Even in the noir genre you\u2019re the femme fatale or the jazz singer. I love the fact that even though Laura grew up in the Harlem jazz scene, she has a law degree. She traverses the worlds: the jazz club, and her activism. She has all of these layers that you don\u2019t often get to see in cinema with female characters from that period, and certainly women of colour.\u201d</p> <p>Mbatha-Raw liked the script because such stories, she says, are rarely seen on screen. Her research into the politics of 1950s New York was an education: \u201cLearning about things like how the bridges were built low so that the buses couldn\u2019t get to the beaches. The people who were on the buses were the poor people, poor people of colour. A very insidious, technical method to keep these people out of enjoying the city. Laura Rose has a progressive resistance to the bullies at the top.\u201d</p> <p>Researching the role, she went to Harlem, while there meeting up with Denise Burse, who played the older version of her character Kelly in San Junipero. Mbatha-Raw beams when she recollects on the day they spent together, her eyes on the verge of popping out. \u201cOh my God!\u201d she says, remembering. \u201cI\u2019d never been to Harlem before and Denise was the one person that I knew who lived there, who had always said: \u2018I\u2019ll take you on a tour.\u2019 So I met the older me!\u201d They went for coffee before spending the day in Harlem, with Burse pointing out old jazz bars as they traipsed about. Black Mirror fans catching a glimpse of the pair would have lost their minds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b821bed49942910b7fcb4429f2582c417ae46639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b821bed49942910b7fcb4429f2582c417ae46639/0_210_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Belle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costume jewel... as Dido Elizabeth Belle in Belle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The initial draw for taking on Motherless Brooklyn was to work with Norton; she is a longtime fan of his work, but she speaks intently about her character\u2019s significance. \u201cIt\u2019s progressive to be an activist,\u201d she says. For some time, Mbatha-Raw seemed to lie low, not giving too much away, but she is increasingly speaking up about social issues. On her Instagram and Twitter accounts, promo-centric posts sit beside more politicised ones. I ask her about a Time\u2019s Up retweet, presuming a show of support; in fact, she has been involved since the activist organisation\u2019s inception.</p> <p>\u201cI went to the first meeting in LA about it before the 2018 Golden Globes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been to several meetings and been part of both the British and the American gestation of the movement. Gathering together and strategising.\u201d</p> <p>Her concerns are increasingly bleeding into her work, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/01/the-morning-show-review-jennifer-aniston\">The Morning Show</a>, Apple TV+\u2019s #MeToo-tinged look at US breakfast television, which was rewritten in the wake of the allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and harassment against chatshow anchors Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, confronting such issues head-on. And after Misbehaviour, she stars in Seacole, as Mary Seacole, the British-Jamaican nurse who came to the aid of dying soldiers in the Crimean war.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an actor\u2019s responsibility,\u201d she says, to work on things that \u201chelp the culture to evolve, and provoke conversations.\u201d Obviously, there are many actors who couldn\u2019t care less about such stuff. That\u2019s a personal choice, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping your soul nourished. About being able to hold your head up and have a conversation about your work. I don\u2019t want to be a product.\u201d</p> <p>You can certainly tell in junket interviews when stars are not quite on board with the contractually obliged claims tumbling out of their mouths. She shudders at the thought. \u201cI\u2019d rather feel free to express myself than feel like I was doing something for the money,\u201d she says, \u201cthan feel like I\u2019d sold out and my soul had withered in the process.\u201d She giggles at the melodrama of it all. Self-effacing to the last.</p> <p><em>Motherless Brooklyn is in cinemas from Friday 6 December</em></p>",

Miss World in 1970 was ridiculously misogynistic. It\u2019s amazing to reflect on how far we\u2019ve come. But also, with Jennifer Hosten, it challenged perceptions of who is allowed to be a beauty queen. Perceptions of beauty [itself].\u201d Much of Mbatha-Raw\u2019s work speaks to a worldview formed early on: she was born in Oxford in 1983 to a black South African doctor and a white British nurse. \u201cMy parents are from different countries, completely different cultures,\u201d she says. As a student activist in South Africa, her father campaigned against apartheid. \u201cHe was part of the ANC,\u201d she says, \u201cfighting for their rights.\u201d At risk of being sent to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for almost two decades, he left South Africa, helped to resettle by the UN\u2019s Refugee Agency UNHCR. Being biracial, she says, \u201cis an interesting perspective, because you can see every side of that conversation. I definitely relate to the idea of bringing people together. My first trip to South Africa [in December 2013] to see my family there, they jokingly called me The Unifier; that\u2019s what they called Nelson Mandela at one point. But I feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to unite the different parts of my life. And I think that it\u2019s my responsibility to do that in my work.\u201d Belle is another case in point. Dido Belle, raised by the Earl of Mansfield in Kenwood House, north London, goes on to further the progress of abolitionists (on screen in any case; there was some dramatic licence). Mbatha-Raw had chased the role because she was excited to get the chance to play a black woman in a period costume drama who wasn\u2019t a servant. \u201cI think it\u2019s really, really important to bring to light these untold stories,\u201d she says. \u201cThey deserve to have an audience.\u201d Although fictional, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s character in her new film, the Edward Norton-directed, 1950s-set Motherless Brooklyn, had a similar pull. She plays Laura Rose, a lawyer and community activist campaigning against racial discrimination. Norton\u2019s detective Lionel Essrog begins following her, and as a bond begins to grow, she guides him through a corrupt political landscape. It is a tender relationship but Laura Rose, battling the city\u2019s big business behemoths, is more than the love interest or spider-woman often found in such genre work. \u201cWith movies from the 50s,\u201d says Mbatha-Raw, \u201cwe\u2019re so used to seeing the archetypal housewife. Even in the noir genre you\u2019re the femme fatale or the jazz singer. I love the fact that even though Laura grew up in the Harlem jazz scene, she has a law degree. She traverses the worlds: the jazz club, and her activism. She has all of these layers that you don\u2019t often get to see in cinema with female characters from that period, and certainly women of colour.\u201d Mbatha-Raw liked the script because such stories, she says, are rarely seen on screen. Her research into the politics of 1950s New York was an education: \u201cLearning about things like how the bridges were built low so that the buses couldn\u2019t get to the beaches. The people who were on the buses were the poor people, poor people of colour. A very insidious, technical method to keep these people out of enjoying the city. Laura Rose has a progressive resistance to the bullies at the top.\u201d Researching the role, she went to Harlem, while there meeting up with Denise Burse, who played the older version of her character Kelly in San Junipero. Mbatha-Raw beams when she recollects on the day they spent together, her eyes on the verge of popping out. \u201cOh my God!\u201d she says, remembering. \u201cI\u2019d never been to Harlem before and Denise was the one person that I knew who lived there, who had always said: \u2018I\u2019ll take you on a tour.\u2019 So I met the older me!\u201d They went for coffee before spending the day in Harlem, with Burse pointing out old jazz bars as they traipsed about. Black Mirror fans catching a glimpse of the pair would have lost their minds. The initial draw for taking on Motherless Brooklyn was to work with Norton; she is a longtime fan of his work, but she speaks intently about her character\u2019s significance. \u201cIt\u2019s progressive to be an activist,\u201d she says. For some time, Mbatha-Raw seemed to lie low, not giving too much away, but she is increasingly speaking up about social issues. On her Instagram and Twitter accounts, promo-centric posts sit beside more politicised ones. I ask her about a Time\u2019s Up retweet, presuming a show of support; in fact, she has been involved since the activist organisation\u2019s inception. \u201cI went to the first meeting in LA about it before the 2018 Golden Globes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been to several meetings and been part of both the British and the American gestation of the movement. Gathering together and strategising.\u201d Her concerns are increasingly bleeding into her work, including The Morning Show, Apple TV+\u2019s #MeToo-tinged look at US breakfast television, which was rewritten in the wake of the allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and harassment against chatshow anchors Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, confronting such issues head-on. And after Misbehaviour, she stars in Seacole, as Mary Seacole, the British-Jamaican nurse who came to the aid of dying soldiers in the Crimean war. \u201cIt\u2019s an actor\u2019s responsibility,\u201d she says, to work on things that \u201chelp the culture to evolve, and provoke conversations.\u201d Obviously, there are many actors who couldn\u2019t care less about such stuff. That\u2019s a personal choice, she says: \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping your soul nourished. About being able to hold your head up and have a conversation about your work. I don\u2019t want to be a product.\u201d You can certainly tell in junket interviews when stars are not quite on board with the contractually obliged claims tumbling out of their mouths. She shudders at the thought. \u201cI\u2019d rather feel free to express myself than feel like I was doing something for the money,\u201d she says, \u201cthan feel like I\u2019d sold out and my soul had withered in the process.\u201d She giggles at the melodrama of it all. Self-effacing to the last. Motherless Brooklyn is in cinemas from Friday 6 December",

      "bodyText": "When George the Poet turned down an MBE, he joined a long tradition of cultural figures who refused the honour because of the British empire\u2019s legacy. Howard Gayle, Liverpool\u2019s first black footballer, declined becoming a Member of the British Empire in 2016, saying: \u201cMy ancestors would be turning in their graves after how empire and colonialism had enslaved them\u201d. In 1977, Ken Loach said he couldn\u2019t accept because the British empire was a \u201cmonument of exploitation and conquest\u201d. Benjamin Zephaniah went for the pithy \u201cNo way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire\u201d when he was offered an OBE in 2003. But George the Poet (real name George Mpanga) \u2013 who rose to prominence first as a spoken-word poet, then a rapper and, more recently, a podcaster \u2013 went further. He wouldn\u2019t be able to accept the honour, which he refused in May 2019, because, he said, Britain raped his ancestral country of Uganda. \u201cYour forefathers grabbed my motherland, pinned her down and took turns. They did that every day for a couple hundred years and then left her to treat her own burns,\u201d he said on his award-winning poetry podcast \u2013 Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast?. Less than a week after the story broke, Mpanga is in Los Angeles on a business trip, and has no regrets over his decision or calling the British Empire \u201cpure evil\u201d. \u201cI think we need language that addresses the situation in a way that is truthful,\u201d he says. \u201cTo dance around the subject, and to imply that I\u2019m turning down an MBE for reasons that need to be handled with politeness \u2026 that would put me in danger of undermining the situation.\u201d Mpanga says he couldn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to make people \u201creally understand how damaging the legacy of British colonialism has been on the African continent\u201d. Mpanga delivered the message via his podcast, which has become a sensation by \u201cpushing podcasting\u2019s limits\u201d. Mixing narrative fiction, with contemporary news and rap, it won in five categories at the British Podcast Awards and came about after Mpanga decided to step back from a music career, which had seen him shortlisted in the BBC Sound of 2015 poll and sign a deal with Universal. Despite his success \u2013 the 28-year-old, who grew up on an estate in Harlesden, north-west London before going to Kings College, Cambridge \u2013 decided to have a two-year hiatus. He had become disillusioned by the way the industry required him to curtail his \u201csocially progressive\u201d agenda in order to fit in with the rigid world of album release cycles, promo and an increasing expectation for him to embrace \u201cpure, unbridled celebrity\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to present your work in the most market-friendly way,\u201d he says. \u201cMy priority wasn\u2019t necessarily being market-friendly.

I know so little about you as a woman in your own right: all of my memories are through a child\u2019s eye, or are second-hand stories passed on.

Instead of judgment, you reacted with interest. Your sensitivity throughout the early mum-less years laid the foundation for a solid adult friendship. Thank you for providing me with some semblance of the relationships I see my friends have with their mothers.

I\u2019ve had far more time without you than with you, but not a day goes by when I don\u2019t think of you. I know so little about you as a woman in your own right: all of my memories are through a child\u2019s eye, or are second-hand stories passed on. I hope you would have approved of the way I\u2019ve turned out. I hope you approve, too, of the women I\u2019ve used to fill my mum void. You\u2019re irreplaceable, of course, but they\u2019re doing a pretty good job. To my stepmum: I know I was a brat when you arrived, and the excuse of being a moody, grieving teenager will only take me so far. I\u2019m sorry for the early years of our relationship \u2013 there is a huge sense of shame that I associate with that time. When you married Dad it was one of the happiest days of my life. I remember calling you my \u201cstepmum\u201d for the first time the day after and it felt so normal. Having a similar career to you means that you understand my work woes in a way that Dad never can, and I appreciate that more than you know. To my auntie: you\u2019re the only adult I was ever able to talk to about boys, sex, and that one time I smoked weed. Instead of judgment, you reacted with interest. Your sensitivity throughout the early mum-less years laid the foundation for a solid adult friendship. Thank you for providing me with some semblance of the relationships I see my friends have with their mothers. I no longer get envious and sad when I think of what I\u2019m missing, because I have you. To my ex-boyfriend\u2019s mum: there was no obligation for us to keep in touch when, at 17, your son dumped me, but now, 12 years on, we\u2019re still in contact. You said you thought of me as a surrogate daughter and it brought me to tears. I have learnt so much from you about how to be a strong, independent woman, which is definitely what you are.

Ammar Kalia Strictly Come Dancing 7.10pm, BBC One Just when you thought it was safe to relax, it is time for a Strictly musical special. This week\u2019s show features Craig Revel Horwood leading anyone he can round up in the studio to a Hello, Dolly! medley. And if that\u2019s not enough to tempt you, the competition is fierce as the remaining couples head towards the final. Hannah Verdier The X Factor: Celebrity Final 7.10pm, ITV It has been a long and bumpy seven weeks for our tuneful celebrity hopefuls and now it\u2019s time to see who will be crowned the first X Factor Celebrity winner. With fan favourites Martin Bashir and Glee\u2019s Kevin McHale already long gone, the title is anyone\u2019s to play for. There will be tears and triumph to come. AK Great Australian Railway Journeys 8pm, BBC Two The final episode of a series that hasn\u2019t exactly gone out of its way to swerve Aussie cliches (tonight\u2019s detours include koalas and lamingtons) but has been gently cheerful viewing all the same. Faint praise perhaps, but Michael Portillo remains a more palatable TV presenter than politician. Phil Harrison Michael McIntyre\u2019s Big Show 8.10pm, BBC One Given we appear to be fast hurtling back to 1975, this throwback variety show should fit in rather well. This week, Baby Spice sacrifices her phone for another game of Send to All, a pair of unwitting brothers from Coventry end up as the Unexpected Stars, and Freya Ridings performs. Ali Catterall The Sinner 9.10pm, BBC Four After the opening two episodes of this psychological thriller pitted the child Julian as the possible murderer of his two parents on a trip to Niagara Falls, this week\u2019s revelations twist the plot even further. Speculation about Julian\u2019s time raised in the Mosswood commune abounds. AK Film choice Borat 11.15pm, Comedy Central Sacha Baron Cohen became public enemy No 1 in Kazakhstan with this big-screen excursion of his naive, misogynist and antisemitic reporter Borat, trailing across the US in search of Pamela Anderson. It is one of the most tasteless and offensive films ever made \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to laugh. Paul Howlett Live sport Premier League Football: Newcastle United v Man City 12noon, BT Sport 1. A top-flight clash from St James\u2019 Park. Rugby Union: Wales v Barbarians 2.15pm, Channel 4. Wayne Pivac takes charge of his first Wales game.

      "body": "<p>It is Friday afternoon, an hour or so before sunset, and I am in my office shed. My wife is gardening a few feet away, cutting the stalks of spent dahlias down to the ground. This makes me uncomfortable, because even though I am sitting at my desk and facing my computer screen, it is obvious I am not actually doing anything. My wife\u2019s proximity is the only thing keeping me awake.</p> <p>I lean back in my chair to glance up at the rear windows of the neighbours, wondering how much of this scene they can see. My shed is basically a glass box, glowing with the light from my desk lamp under an ashen November sky. I look like a museum exhibit of a man not doing anything.</p> <p>There is a sharp tap on the glass. I turn to see my wife struggling to pull a large sack of compost from a wheelbarrow directly in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cLift with your legs,\u201d I say. Her eyebrows arch, but she does not move. I stand up and open the door, letting in a blast of cold air.</p> <p>\u201cHelp,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>I take the sack from her. It\u2019s wet on the underside, and soaks the sleeves of my jumper.</p> <p>\u201cThere, please,\u201d she says, pointing to a spot on the ground. I waddle over and drop the sack.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m putting bulbs in all of these,\u201d she says, indicating the four earthenware pots that stand either side of my shed door.</p> <p>\u201cNow?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d I say. \u201cThese are my business hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look very busy,\u201d she says, craning her neck towards my screen.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not meant to be this close,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d look busy from the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another one in the car,\u201d she says, pointing to the sack of compost with a muddy trowel. \u201cI\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday morning, I am awakened by the sound of rain drumming on the roof, and the radio droning in the background. The sky outside is the colour of slate.</p> <p>\u201cEugh,\u201d I say to the heaped-up duvet next to me. There is no answer. I grab my phone from the bedside table.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s almost 10! I\u2019ve got work to do before lunch.\u201d There is no answer.</p> <p>\u201cI should have done it Friday, of course, but you know how\u2026\u201d I stop and pull back the duvet. There is no one beneath it.</p> <p>The rest of the house is silent. The sitting room is empty, and so is the kitchen. I make coffee. Staring blankly out the back window into the drizzle, I see that the leaves on the lawn have arranged themselves into four circular piles. How curious, I think. At the far end of the garden, I detect movement: my wife, rake in hand, making another pile.

      "bodyText": "It is Friday afternoon, an hour or so before sunset, and I am in my office shed. My wife is gardening a few feet away, cutting the stalks of spent dahlias down to the ground. This makes me uncomfortable, because even though I am sitting at my desk and facing my computer screen, it is obvious I am not actually doing anything. My wife\u2019s proximity is the only thing keeping me awake. I lean back in my chair to glance up at the rear windows of the neighbours, wondering how much of this scene they can see. My shed is basically a glass box, glowing with the light from my desk lamp under an ashen November sky. I look like a museum exhibit of a man not doing anything. There is a sharp tap on the glass. I turn to see my wife struggling to pull a large sack of compost from a wheelbarrow directly in front of me. \u201cLift with your legs,\u201d I say. Her eyebrows arch, but she does not move. I stand up and open the door, letting in a blast of cold air. \u201cHelp,\u201d my wife says. I take the sack from her. It\u2019s wet on the underside, and soaks the sleeves of my jumper. \u201cThere, please,\u201d she says, pointing to a spot on the ground. I waddle over and drop the sack. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m putting bulbs in all of these,\u201d she says, indicating the four earthenware pots that stand either side of my shed door. \u201cNow?\u201d I say. \u201cWhy not now?\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d I say. \u201cThese are my business hours.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t look very busy,\u201d she says, craning her neck towards my screen. \u201cYou\u2019re not meant to be this close,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d look busy from the kitchen.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s another one in the car,\u201d she says, pointing to the sack of compost with a muddy trowel. \u201cI\u2019ll need it.\u201d On Sunday morning, I am awakened by the sound of rain drumming on the roof, and the radio droning in the background. The sky outside is the colour of slate. \u201cEugh,\u201d I say to the heaped-up duvet next to me. There is no answer. I grab my phone from the bedside table. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s almost 10! I\u2019ve got work to do before lunch.\u201d There is no answer. \u201cI should have done it Friday, of course, but you know how\u2026\u201d I stop and pull back the duvet. There is no one beneath it. The rest of the house is silent. The sitting room is empty, and so is the kitchen. I make coffee. Staring blankly out the back window into the drizzle, I see that the leaves on the lawn have arranged themselves into four circular piles. How curious, I think. At the far end of the garden, I detect movement: my wife, rake in hand, making another pile. I open the back door. \u201cHave you gone insane?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of thing you would ever do, is it?\u201d she says. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, pointing up at the large tree that looms over the garden, still bearing half its leaves. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to wait until they all fall off.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was too messy.\u201d I pull on my boots and stomp between the piles to my shed, where I sit down at the computer, open up a document and stare, arms folded. Behind me, on the other side of the glass, my wife is now on her hands and knees, digging away at the bare earth. \u201cHello!\u201d she says. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I swivel round in my chair to see that she is talking to a robin perched at her side on the newly turned soil. I stand and lean out of the door. \u201cI can\u2019t write with you doing manual labour just there,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s unseemly.\u201d The robin tweets. \u201cIs that right?\u201d my wife says. \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d I say. \u201cYou could always help,\u201d she says. I look back toward the kitchen. The lawn, I notice, is already carpeted with a fresh layer of yellowed leaves.

      "body": "<p>It feels as if the entire world\u2019s press is there, standing on the pavement outside the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. They\u2019re in Hong Kong to cover the protests, but tonight, the Friday before National Day, they\u2019re off duty. From the bottom of the hill, the bars of Lan Kwai Fong thrum reliably. There is an uneasy peace in the air, as though we all know that, three days from now, the long-running citywide demonstrations will reach a violent new apex.</p> <p>I\u2019ve walked this route hundreds of times, and been a parade of different selves. I\u2019ve been a teenager trying to score 7-11 beer on the spot where Chungking Express was filmed. I\u2019ve been a visiting writer ordering drinks at the FCC bar. But now I am the mother and primary carer of a nine-month-old, and my time out has been negotiated. Quite frankly, I am dazzled by the world after 7pm. As I shuffle past the media crowd, I feel a pull, a yearning. In another life, I\u2019d be there with them. When I moved back to Hong Kong in 2018, it was in search of stories about the strange, convoluted city I was born in.</p> <p>I take the lift up to a wood-panelled room and join a table of thirtysomethings wearing plastic flower garlands. I am expecting to be the main event tonight, at the reunion of my primary school class. For nine years, I was the only mixed-race person at my local Cantonese school, where I was known widely as <em>gweimui</em> (literally \u201cghost girl\u201d). Chinese school is where I developed a lingering complex about not fitting in, and where, after being bullied, I fantasised that one day I\u2019d do something so momentous it would appear in a newspaper, and my classmates would see that I was more than just a girl with an English dad and a Hong Kong mum.</p> <p>This thought was the founding brick of ambition that drove me to become a musician and writer, under the name <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/emmy-the-great\" title=\"\">Emmy the Great</a>. Now my wish has finally come true, but with a caveat. I am at this reunion because someone saw an article about me in an arts magazine, but it wasn\u2019t about any of my albums, or projects, or anything I\u2019ve written. It was about what it\u2019s like to have an English dad and a Hong Kong mum. Some 25 years later, this is still my most noticeable feature.</p> <p>I look around the table, disoriented by faces I never expected to see again. Surely they will want to know about the amazing life I went on to lead! I prepare the necessary Cantonese vocabulary in my head. \u201cAfter we left primary school, I moved to East Grinstead, Sussex. In England, I wasn\u2019t a white girl any more. I was considered Chinese. In England, I had to assert over and over that I was British \u2013 still do. But I was so grateful for the grass and open space that I accepted this identity. I never expected to be back here in Hong Kong, a <em>gweimui</em> once more. And, suddenly, I\u2019m a mother, too! I never sleep. I never go out. I\u2019m caught between expat and Cantonese culture. I\u2019m losing my mind, actually. How are you?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m self-conscious about having one foot in Hong Kong, and one abroad. This is how it\u2019s always been</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But despite a morbid obsession with the wrongs perpetrated on me by a group of 10-year-olds, I can\u2019t keep my thoughts from the topic of the moment. The city has been tense and uncertain since the first major demonstrations began in June, initially in response to a bill that would allow extraditions from Hong Kong to China, but now expanded to five demands, including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police conduct. Parenting has thrown up new challenges, like calling the council to ask for the ingredients of their teargas, and its effect on children. As each new weekend approaches, the population speculates. Will it be peaceful, or will it spill into violence? Will we wake to news that makes us tearful with pride for Hong Kong, or horrified by the scale of the escalation?</p> <p>Tonight, as China gears up to celebrate its 70th year as a republic, there is no doubt about which way the news will swing. Someone at the reunion says they are boycotting products from the mainland, including tea. Another, a tiny boy who has inexplicably grown into an adult, says he won\u2019t use the MTR metro system any more, now that it\u2019s been accused of enforcing the government\u2019s agenda by shutting down during protests. I spot an opening to admit that, the day the demonstrations began, I was in England, on tour. By the time I got back, teargas had become the stock police response, and my partner and I decided we wouldn\u2019t attend demonstrations \u2013 in case we find ourselves incapacitated and unable to care for our daughter. Instead, I say nothing. I don\u2019t tell them, either, that we are planning to leave Hong Kong for England when our daughter turns one, because I\u2019m self-conscious about having one foot in Hong Kong, and one abroad. This is how it\u2019s always been. It\u2019s how they remember me. And, ever since the protests began, I am wondering if it makes me a part of the problem.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I can only tell you what I remember. In 1994, Forrest Gump was the English-language film at every cinema for months. Every weekend, my parents would throw their three children into a Volvo and drive to Pacific Place, a mall in the Admiralty district. We\u2019d meet our friends, expat families whose children went to international schools, at McDonald\u2019s, where the kids would climb the Ronald McDonald in the playzone, until we were allowed to go to the CD store and pick out an album. Everybody wore Nikes and had a favourite WWE wrestler and Street Fighter move.</p> <p>In 90s Hong Kong, everyone could speak English, even taxi drivers like my Uncle Ron, who had crazy hair and had once cut a demo tape in a stoner-rock band. But my siblings and I spoke Cantonese, too. On the weekends that we didn\u2019t see our friends, we had dim sum with my mum\u2019s family: Auntie Dora, Uncle Sam and Uncle Ron; my two older cousins, too, one of whom had recently taken a new English name, Michael Jordan Lee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd4da04968f137b6241de96d399f073430a86705\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd4da04968f137b6241de96d399f073430a86705/142_18_1101_661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moss with her grandmothers, 1988. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moss with her grandmothers, 1988.<strong> </strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy Emma-Lee Moss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>American basketball, Japanese anime, Oxbridge ambitions. In Hong Kong \u2013 where the phrase \u201ceast meets west\u201d is so overused that I\u2019ve seen it advertising a shampoo parlour for dogs \u2013 you were at the centre of the world town, a place where global capitalist culture could run unfettered, dominating the rituals and quirks of the Chinese way of life. Watching over it all was benevolent, late-stage British colonialism; its influence seeped into everything, from the names of English lords on road signs, to the \u201cChinglish\u201d that permeated the local Cantonese dialect. Hong Kong\u2019s last governor, Chris Patten, was vaguely popular, <a href=\"https://www.aristeon.net/2016/03/hongkong-last-british-governor-approval-rate-higher-than-post-handover-leaders.html\" title=\"\">his final approval ratings still higher than any subsequent leader</a>. It was China that we feared and felt distinct from, even as schoolchildren.</p> <p>As the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 approached, the expat families began discussing their various plans to leave. Many had one parent who was from Hong Kong, and one from abroad. The handover was an obvious deadline to fulfil any ambitions of living in \u201cthe other place\u201d, where you went to visit your grandparents. Our closest family friends went to Australia, Singapore, Germany and Texas. When the day came that the British flag was folded up, and the People\u2019s Liberation Army marched in, we were already scattered around the world, watching on TV while our mothers cried. I didn\u2019t see my best friends, Dan and Ash, again until I was 18. Today, when I text them images of Pacific Place filled with protesters, they joke: \u201cForrest Gump tickets released again?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For families like mine, the handover was an opportunity to start again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Looking back, it\u2019s easy to view 1997 as a year of mass exodus from the city, a moment marked by the loss of foreign professionals (who are still inexplicably \u201cexpats\u201d while other temporary workers are \u201cmigrant workers\u201d). But to do that would be to ignore the vast majority of Hong Kong people, who are Hong Kong-born Chinese, speak Cantonese as a first language and were not offered British passports by the departing government. They include my uncles, my aunt, my cousins, my classmates. There are also the minority ethnic groups who are as rooted in Cantonese culture as Hong Kongers.

      "bodyText": "It feels as if the entire world\u2019s press is there, standing on the pavement outside the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. They\u2019re in Hong Kong to cover the protests, but tonight, the Friday before National Day, they\u2019re off duty. From the bottom of the hill, the bars of Lan Kwai Fong thrum reliably. There is an uneasy peace in the air, as though we all know that, three days from now, the long-running citywide demonstrations will reach a violent new apex. I\u2019ve walked this route hundreds of times, and been a parade of different selves. I\u2019ve been a teenager trying to score 7-11 beer on the spot where Chungking Express was filmed. I\u2019ve been a visiting writer ordering drinks at the FCC bar. But now I am the mother and primary carer of a nine-month-old, and my time out has been negotiated. Quite frankly, I am dazzled by the world after 7pm. As I shuffle past the media crowd, I feel a pull, a yearning. In another life, I\u2019d be there with them. When I moved back to Hong Kong in 2018, it was in search of stories about the strange, convoluted city I was born in. I take the lift up to a wood-panelled room and join a table of thirtysomethings wearing plastic flower garlands. I am expecting to be the main event tonight, at the reunion of my primary school class. For nine years, I was the only mixed-race person at my local Cantonese school, where I was known widely as gweimui (literally \u201cghost girl\u201d). Chinese school is where I developed a lingering complex about not fitting in, and where, after being bullied, I fantasised that one day I\u2019d do something so momentous it would appear in a newspaper, and my classmates would see that I was more than just a girl with an English dad and a Hong Kong mum. This thought was the founding brick of ambition that drove me to become a musician and writer, under the name Emmy the Great. Now my wish has finally come true, but with a caveat. I am at this reunion because someone saw an article about me in an arts magazine, but it wasn\u2019t about any of my albums, or projects, or anything I\u2019ve written. It was about what it\u2019s like to have an English dad and a Hong Kong mum. Some 25 years later, this is still my most noticeable feature. I look around the table, disoriented by faces I never expected to see again. Surely they will want to know about the amazing life I went on to lead! I prepare the necessary Cantonese vocabulary in my head. \u201cAfter we left primary school, I moved to East Grinstead, Sussex. In England, I wasn\u2019t a white girl any more. I was considered Chinese. In England, I had to assert over and over that I was British \u2013 still do. But I was so grateful for the grass and open space that I accepted this identity. I never expected to be back here in Hong Kong, a gweimui once more. And, suddenly, I\u2019m a mother, too! I never sleep. I never go out. I\u2019m caught between expat and Cantonese culture. I\u2019m losing my mind, actually. How are you?\u201d But despite a morbid obsession with the wrongs perpetrated on me by a group of 10-year-olds, I can\u2019t keep my thoughts from the topic of the moment. The city has been tense and uncertain since the first major demonstrations began in June, initially in response to a bill that would allow extraditions from Hong Kong to China, but now expanded to five demands, including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police conduct. Parenting has thrown up new challenges, like calling the council to ask for the ingredients of their teargas, and its effect on children. As each new weekend approaches, the population speculates. Will it be peaceful, or will it spill into violence? Will we wake to news that makes us tearful with pride for Hong Kong, or horrified by the scale of the escalation? Tonight, as China gears up to celebrate its 70th year as a republic, there is no doubt about which way the news will swing. Someone at the reunion says they are boycotting products from the mainland, including tea. Another, a tiny boy who has inexplicably grown into an adult, says he won\u2019t use the MTR metro system any more, now that it\u2019s been accused of enforcing the government\u2019s agenda by shutting down during protests. I spot an opening to admit that, the day the demonstrations began, I was in England, on tour. By the time I got back, teargas had become the stock police response, and my partner and I decided we wouldn\u2019t attend demonstrations \u2013 in case we find ourselves incapacitated and unable to care for our daughter. Instead, I say nothing. I don\u2019t tell them, either, that we are planning to leave Hong Kong for England when our daughter turns one, because I\u2019m self-conscious about having one foot in Hong Kong, and one abroad. This is how it\u2019s always been. It\u2019s how they remember me. And, ever since the protests began, I am wondering if it makes me a part of the problem. *** I can only tell you what I remember. In 1994, Forrest Gump was the English-language film at every cinema for months. Every weekend, my parents would throw their three children into a Volvo and drive to Pacific Place, a mall in the Admiralty district. We\u2019d meet our friends, expat families whose children went to international schools, at McDonald\u2019s, where the kids would climb the Ronald McDonald in the playzone, until we were allowed to go to the CD store and pick out an album. Everybody wore Nikes and had a favourite WWE wrestler and Street Fighter move. In 90s Hong Kong, everyone could speak English, even taxi drivers like my Uncle Ron, who had crazy hair and had once cut a demo tape in a stoner-rock band. But my siblings and I spoke Cantonese, too. On the weekends that we didn\u2019t see our friends, we had dim sum with my mum\u2019s family: Auntie Dora, Uncle Sam and Uncle Ron; my two older cousins, too, one of whom had recently taken a new English name, Michael Jordan Lee. American basketball, Japanese anime, Oxbridge ambitions. In Hong Kong \u2013 where the phrase \u201ceast meets west\u201d is so overused that I\u2019ve seen it advertising a shampoo parlour for dogs \u2013 you were at the centre of the world town, a place where global capitalist culture could run unfettered, dominating the rituals and quirks of the Chinese way of life. Watching over it all was benevolent, late-stage British colonialism; its influence seeped into everything, from the names of English lords on road signs, to the \u201cChinglish\u201d that permeated the local Cantonese dialect. Hong Kong\u2019s last governor, Chris Patten, was vaguely popular, his final approval ratings still higher than any subsequent leader. It was China that we feared and felt distinct from, even as schoolchildren. As the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 approached, the expat families began discussing their various plans to leave. Many had one parent who was from Hong Kong, and one from abroad. The handover was an obvious deadline to fulfil any ambitions of living in \u201cthe other place\u201d, where you went to visit your grandparents. Our closest family friends went to Australia, Singapore, Germany and Texas. When the day came that the British flag was folded up, and the People\u2019s Liberation Army marched in, we were already scattered around the world, watching on TV while our mothers cried. I didn\u2019t see my best friends, Dan and Ash, again until I was 18. Today, when I text them images of Pacific Place filled with protesters, they joke: \u201cForrest Gump tickets released again?\u201d Looking back, it\u2019s easy to view 1997 as a year of mass exodus from the city, a moment marked by the loss of foreign professionals (who are still inexplicably \u201cexpats\u201d while other temporary workers are \u201cmigrant workers\u201d). But to do that would be to ignore the vast majority of Hong Kong people, who are Hong Kong-born Chinese, speak Cantonese as a first language and were not offered British passports by the departing government. They include my uncles, my aunt, my cousins, my classmates. There are also the minority ethnic groups who are as rooted in Cantonese culture as Hong Kongers. For families like mine, the handover was an opportunity to start again. For those who stayed behind, it was the beginning of a period of uncertainty. The Basic Law \u2013 a de facto constitution \u2013 promised Hong Kong \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d for 50 years. This created, in principle, a liminal time between British and Chinese rule during which the question \u201cWho are we?\u201d became crucial and explosive. In his book Generation HK, on the young Hong Kongers who came of age in the post-97 period, the journalist Ben Bland describes the end of British rule as leaving an \u201cidentity vacuum\u201d. In fact, the end of the colonial era also left an opportunity for Hong Kongers to regroup, to allow Hong Kong-Chinese culture to lift itself from the shadows, and to look back and ask what of the city\u2019s history would be preserved, and protected, before it was absorbed into the mainland. Today, you can\u2019t take a step without hearing the phrase: \u201cThis is the real Hong Kong.\u201d It is a thought that emerges when you find yourself in an alleyway populated by street vendors selling milk tea from polystyrene cups; when the light begins to drop over Aberdeen harbour (in Cantonese, Little Hong Kong) and a fisherwoman steers her craft, one hand on her Samsung Galaxy; when teenage couples hold hands at the entrance to Ocean Park (real Hong Kong), the amusement park that was never defeated by the arrival of Disneyland (not real Hong Kong). It is an inescapable concept, as tangible as rain, all the more sweet for the fear that it will soon slip away. For Hong Kongers today face inordinate pressure that goes beyond the cliff edge of 2047. The high living costs associated with its status as a haven for the wealthy have led to an ever-widening gap between rich and poor, which finds its most extreme expression in \u201ccage homes\u201d for those who cannot afford housing. Meanwhile, whenever Beijing\u2019s influence creeps beyond the promises of the Basic Law, it throws up ambiguities in its wording. The effect is like gaslighting: are we crazy? Or are our freedoms being eroded? The quest for post-colonial identity is something that lured me back to Hong Kong in late 2017. That spring, I had spent a month in Xiamen as part of a British Council scheme, and the effort to communicate in Mandarin (which, it turns out, I don\u2019t speak), had somehow unlocked all the Cantonese I\u2019d stored up from my childhood. I was dreaming in Cantonese, and felt a longing to be back in Hong Kong, to see the lanterns at the Mid-Autumn festival. My parents, sister and nephew had been back in the city for some time. As well as this, there was a person. While in transit from Xiamen, I had met a British artist who worked at one of the international galleries. We had bonded over our scattered thirties and our love of English woodlands. That Mid-Autumn, we began an adventurous period of walking through the city at twilight, the time when the light bounces off the buildings like mermaid scales in the wind. It was three years since the Umbrella Revolution and Occupy Central. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that the civil unrest had dissipated. Instead, I sensed a defiance in Hong Kong and linked it to the arts. Venues had been shut down by strict building regulations, and lifestyle restrictions that made earning money from music almost impossible, and yet, as the indie DJ Wong Chi Chung told me, there were more than 800 indie bands based in Hong Kong. Improvisation was key: wall murals around unexpected corners, rooftop farms, pop-up art spaces in old factories. It was a place fighting to find itself, asserting its right to be. It was increasingly where my heart belonged. In January 2018, I decided to return to Hong Kong. My flight arrived in March. Forty weeks later, my partner and I checked into the hospital where I was born, and I gave birth to our daughter. *** \u201cDoes anyone feel that the city\u2019s flaws are their own fault?\u201d This is the question that nobody throws me in the support group for women with postnatal depression and anxiety; in the free playgroup run by friendly septuagenarian churchfolk; in the parenting WhatsApp groups and in the void of the mums\u2019 Facebook pages where I have stooped to scrolling for hours through ads for baby products.

A manual labourer in Stevenage, he has argued himself hoarse trying to persuade his workmates that Labour in general, and Jeremy Corbyn in particular, can make their lives better.</p> \n<p>\u201cI talk about things that are directly relevant, like council housing or privatisation,\u201d says David, who is in his 30s and works in the public sector. \u201cI tell them if the Tories win we could be privatised. We\u2019ll be working longer hours for less money. But they don\u2019t care. They just talk about immigrants bringing down wages and how Boris will get rid of them after he\u2019s got Brexit done.

He grew up not far from where I did, and went to the same junior school. In an hour-long interview he quotes Orwell, Chomsky and Plato. For the most part the views of his fellow workers baffle him. He puts it down to a number of things. \u201cThey believe what they read in the paper,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then they just repeat it. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re watching the debates or reading the manifestos. I think the media\u2019s got a lot to answer for. It can make them argue against themselves.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62a5b79e25a0aad864cfbe720dc00bcd7431362b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62a5b79e25a0aad864cfbe720dc00bcd7431362b/0_237_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view from Market Place pedestrian path in Stevenage town centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view from Market Place pedestrian path in Stevenage town centre.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They make a lot more sense to me. David grew up during austerity; I grew up during the Thatcherite boom years. I remember when people could first buy their council houses. They went for a fraction of their value and for a while, for the first time in their lives, people who had little to complain about suddenly had something to be happy about. They felt well off. There was a lot of building work as they built porches and back extensions. When the privatisations came they bought shares.</p> \n<p>Thatcherism wasn\u2019t imposed upon them. Many, if not most, rushed towards it with open wallets.</p> \n<p>The affinity wasn\u2019t just material. It was cultural too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/20/stevenage-small-business-owners-brexit-no-deal\">Stevenage backed Brexit</a> but the blend of patriotism, class ambivalence and aspiration that drew it towards the Tories goes beyond that. I recall strongly an older brother of my friend trying to persuade me not to stay on at school but to go to work. He did the sums for me. The money I would lose out on over the five years I was at school and university, and the practical skills I could accrue in that time. He was genuinely looking out for me. \u201cI\u2019m not even talking about over time,\u201d he told me.</p> \n<p>The attachment to Labour was never abandoned completely. The town may have voted Conservative in seven of the last 10 elections, but between 1997 and 2005 it delivered Labour far bigger majorities and since 1973 the council has been in Labour hands; in May Labour even gained a seat. But the ties that bound them to Labour have frayed. \u201cMost of the people I work with don\u2019t know what a union is,\u201d said one Labour voter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7045d052-ca32-4039-863c-95ce20012bcf\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A \u201cbellwether\u201d seat is a constituency that has tended to swing between Labour and Conservative, giving an indication of who is going to win the election overall. Bristol North West, for example, turned Conservative when Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, reverted to Labour in 1997 as Tony Blair was elected, then went Tory again in 2010 when Gordon Brown lost control of No 10. In 2017, the constituency voted Labour, which did not indicate that Jeremy Corbyn would be forming a government, but clearly showed that Theresa May was not building on the votes won by David Cameron in 2015.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jeff Bullock, 64, doesn\u2019t believe everything he reads in the paper.

      "bodyText": "David (not his real name) is a diehard socialist who finds himself increasingly exasperated with the working class. A manual labourer in Stevenage, he has argued himself hoarse trying to persuade his workmates that Labour in general, and Jeremy Corbyn in particular, can make their lives better. \u201cI talk about things that are directly relevant, like council housing or privatisation,\u201d says David, who is in his 30s and works in the public sector. \u201cI tell them if the Tories win we could be privatised. We\u2019ll be working longer hours for less money. But they don\u2019t care. They just talk about immigrants bringing down wages and how Boris will get rid of them after he\u2019s got Brexit done. I\u2019ve stopped bothering,\u201d he says. \u201cEven the union rep says he\u2019s not voting Labour this time. I just put in my earphones and get on with it.\u201d David is working class. He grew up not far from where I did, and went to the same junior school. In an hour-long interview he quotes Orwell, Chomsky and Plato. For the most part the views of his fellow workers baffle him. He puts it down to a number of things. \u201cThey believe what they read in the paper,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then they just repeat it. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re watching the debates or reading the manifestos. I think the media\u2019s got a lot to answer for. It can make them argue against themselves.\u201d They make a lot more sense to me. David grew up during austerity; I grew up during the Thatcherite boom years. I remember when people could first buy their council houses. They went for a fraction of their value and for a while, for the first time in their lives, people who had little to complain about suddenly had something to be happy about. They felt well off. There was a lot of building work as they built porches and back extensions. When the privatisations came they bought shares. Thatcherism wasn\u2019t imposed upon them. Many, if not most, rushed towards it with open wallets. The affinity wasn\u2019t just material. It was cultural too. Stevenage backed Brexit but the blend of patriotism, class ambivalence and aspiration that drew it towards the Tories goes beyond that. I recall strongly an older brother of my friend trying to persuade me not to stay on at school but to go to work. He did the sums for me. The money I would lose out on over the five years I was at school and university, and the practical skills I could accrue in that time. He was genuinely looking out for me. \u201cI\u2019m not even talking about over time,\u201d he told me. The attachment to Labour was never abandoned completely. The town may have voted Conservative in seven of the last 10 elections, but between 1997 and 2005 it delivered Labour far bigger majorities and since 1973 the council has been in Labour hands; in May Labour even gained a seat. But the ties that bound them to Labour have frayed. \u201cMost of the people I work with don\u2019t know what a union is,\u201d said one Labour voter. Jeff Bullock, 64, doesn\u2019t believe everything he reads in the paper. He came to the Stevenage as a six-month-old baby from Islington in the 50s. They built much of the town around him. He knew my mother from when she used to run local play schemes and, later, he became her mortgage broker. Bullock voted for Brexit. He says he would not vote for Labour so long as Corbyn is leader but it transpires that he hasn\u2019t voted Labour since Jim Callaghan, who he met in the town centre. He laughs at the suggestion he has somehow been duped into voting against his own interests. \u201cLabour have all these wonderful ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m all for fairness. But at the end of the day somebody\u2019s got to pay for it \u2013 either through their taxes or higher prices \u2013 and I don\u2019t think Labour\u2019s ever quite got that.\u201d Where Brexit is concerned he thinks its condescending to suggest he didn\u2019t know what he was voting for. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay any notice to what was written on the side of the bus,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted us to stand on our own two feet. I think we can. And I think we should. I don\u2019t like the fact that we\u2019re dictated to.\u201d Even if it makes us worse off, I ask him. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might be uncomfortable but that doesn\u2019t mean we stop.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump arrives in London next week for a two-day Nato summit which will see him greeted on Tuesday evening by doctors, nurses and other NHS workers leading a protest of tens of thousands outside Buckingham Palace. The protesters \u2013 aiming to highlight potential risks to the NHS in a future US-UK trade deal \u2013 will march from Trafalgar Square up the Mall, and gather at Canada Gate when Trump and other Nato leaders meet the Queen at a 6pm drinks reception. It will mark the formal beginning of a short summit that has been in the diary for 18 months, but has ended up occurring at the closing stages of an election campaign, prompting jitters in No 10 \u2013 and making for Labour\u2019s best hope of a comeback. Boris Johnson pleaded with Trump not to wade into British politics in an interview on LBC: \u201cIt\u2019s best when you have close friends and allies like the US and the UK \u2026 for neither side to be involved in each other\u2019s election campaigns.\u201d Labour is preparing for something different, mindful of the fact Trump can rarely be relied upon to exercise discretion. The last time the US president was in the UK in June, he said that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d \u2013 including the NHS \u2013 in trade talks. It is not yet clear if Corbyn himself will address the London demonstration, which will begin at around 4pm in Trafalgar Square. Confirmed speakers for the event include veteran activist Tariq Ali, musician Brian Eno, and Kate Hudson, the head of CND, although the Trump baby blimp is not expected to make a reappearance. The Labour leader is expected to give a foreign policy speech on Sunday, aimed squarely at Trump, and has accused Johnson of putting the NHS \u201con the table\u201d in \u201csecret talks for a deal with Donald Trump after Brexit\u201d. On Friday, Johnson responded, insisting that the NHS is \u201cnot for sale or up for negotiation\u201d in any future trade talks. Trump is arriving late on Monday night, leaving the president free time on Tuesday before the Palace reception for bilateral meetings but also media interviews, possibly with Piers Morgan on ITV or Nigel Farage on LBC. The leaders \u2013 including, presumably Trump \u2013 will then go from Buckingham Palace to Downing Street for a second reception on Tuesday evening, this time hosted by Johnson. Downing Street has yet to release details, but other European leaders said they expected to be present. On Wednesday the leaders will head to the luxury Grove hotel on the outskirts of Watford, a past base for England football teams ahead of World Cups, where Trump is scheduled to give a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, almost immediately after a separate press conference from Johnson. The summit has already been deliberately stripped down so that its main purpose is ceremonial, focusing on the 70th anniversary of an alliance whose first headquarters was in the UK, to reduce the potential for diplomatic rows. Receptions and press events aside, its only substantive business is a three-hour session at the Grove hotel on Wednesday morning where each leader is due to speak for four minutes, a cumbersome format that Nato says acts as a useful opportunity to raise key points. Nor is Trump the only complication. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is due to attend, a month after his country\u2019s invasion of the Kurdish region of Syria, and has already been sparring with France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron. Erdo\u011fan asked Macron to \u201ccheck whether you are brain dead\u201d after the French leader had argued that Nato was failing to provide strategic coordination between the US, Europe and Turkey. Nonetheless, Nato officials were already expecting Trump to dominate proceedings. \u201cWhat can we do? It\u2019s a leaders summit after all,\u201d one said ahead of the meeting, although the question may be what topic will the unpredictable president chose to pick up. At the last leaders\u2019 summit, in Brussels in July 2018, the US president ripped up the schedule, and demanded that Europeans spend more on defence \u2013 or the US would walk out of the 70-year military alliance and \u201cgo it alone\u201d. This time Nato, eager to demonstrate concrete progress, released spending figures showing that allies increased defence spending by 4.6% in real terms, and that a growing minority of its 29 members were meeting long-term spending promises. \u201cMore allies are meeting the guideline of spending 2% of GDP on defence,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, Nato\u2019s secretary general, told a press conference. \u201cThis year, nine allies will meet the guideline. Up from just three allies a few years ago.\u201d The UK, at 2.1%, already meets the target, although the US spends 3.4%. But such efforts are unlikely to be enough to ensure a harmonious summit eight days before Britain goes to the polls.",

The first day was ... frustrating. Just over half the overs were lost to rain, and after gambling by putting New Zealand in, Joe Root had only three wickets to show for it. Tom Latham, with a compact unbeaten hundred, and Ross Taylor, with a hot-and-cold fifty, calmly assembled the partnership that won the day.</p> <p>Root and Chris Silverwood had picked an XI with an eye on pub-quiz immortality \u2013 five seamers, no spinner, no regular keeper \u2013 but the performance was better than the cast list. Jofra Archer, who took no wickets, bowled as well as Chris Woakes, who took two, and would have got rid of Latham soon after lunch had Ben Stokes not dropped another expensive catch.</p> <p>Today, Root will need to combine Archer\u2019s fire with the wiles of Woakes and Stuart Broad, while hoping that there\u2019s some swing for Sam Curran and that Stokes\u2019s knee injury doesn\u2019t accelerate his drift towards being a specialist batsman. All the New Zealanders have to do is serve up more of the same, and Latham\u2019s last few Test hundreds have all gone past 150. It could be dull, but it\u2019s unlikely to be as bad as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/29/marnus-labuschagne-david-warner-centuries-australia-pakistan-second-test\">David Warner v Pakistan</a>.</p> <p>Play starts half an hour early for the rest of the match, to claw back some of the lost overs, so I\u2019ll see you at 9.30pm UK time, 10.30am in NZ. The forecast is clear for the first half of the day, dodgy thereafter.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T19:06:18.817Z\">at 7.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

Be sure to stick around for Ali Martin\u2019s report from Hamilton and all the reaction, plus join us again tomorrow/today for more hot OBO action. Buy from me, cheerio! New Zealand\u2019s day, undoubtably. Saving the game is the priority for England at the moment, never mind trying to win it. Much work to do for the captain and his team. 18th over: England 39-2 (Burns 24, Root 6) The final over of the day then, in all likelihood. Wagner charges in again. Burns is comfortable so the bowler switches to round the wicket. But Burns is able to flick away for a single, leaving his captain to face the last couple of deliveries. Root leaves and \u2026 flicks just wide of leg gully for a single! Cripes! 17th over: England 37-2 (Burns 23, Root 5) Daryl Mitchell, after his batting heroics earlier, gets the chance to turn his arm over. He struggles to make Burns play at first, swinging the ball away from the left hander, then gets bunted down the ground for a single. 16th over: England 36-2 (Burns 22, Root 5) Neil Wagner comes into the attack for the first time today. Cue the predictable short-pitched barrage. It\u2019s calmly negotiated by Root, though. 15th over: England 35-2 (Burns 21, Root 5) Root, who has been on the defensive since arriving at the crease, is quick to pounce as Southee strays too full, clipping with consummate timing for four. This pair have maybe four more overs to get through. 14th over: England 30-2 (Burns 20, Root 1) Root stands firm in the face of another accurate, testing over from Henry, who has sent down an excellent spell. Another maiden. 13th over: England 30-2 (Burns 20, Root 1) Southee into the seventh over of his spell \u2026 and Burns is dropped again! He flicks in the air to midwicket where Raval dives but can\u2019t cling on. The ball was travelling and it would\u2019ve been a superb catch but \u2026 you\u2019ve seen them taken. Another reprieve for Burns. Root gets off the mark from his 10th delivery, a single pushed through the covers. 12th over: England 28-2 (Burns 19, Root 0) Into the final 30 minutes of the day then. Root just about sees out a maiden from Henry. 11th over: England 28-2 (Burns 19, Root 0) Burns is a whisker away from inside-edging onto his own stumps, and instead picks up four more. 10th over: England 24-2 (Burns 15, Root 0) Henry gets the wicket he should\u2019ve had last over. This is beginning to feel very much like New Zealand\u2019s day. And New Zealand\u2019s Test. And New Zealand\u2019s series. A cracking ball from Henry, an equally good take from Watling. England\u2019s No 3 was just straightened up a touch as the ball wobbled away outside off and caught the edge of his defensive prod. The New Zealand wicketkeeper did superbly to scoop the ball low to his right. 9th over: England 20-1 (Burns 11, Denly 4) Southee continues and Burns again shows his good side, driving on the walk through the covers. Risky perhaps, but it\u2019s the sort of shot that gets you forking over cash at the turnstiles. 8th over: England 20-1 (Burns 11, Denly 4) Burns, RAF moustache to the fore, unfurls one of those trademark ramrod-straight drives for four back past Henry. He really does look a Test opener for years to come. As to his partner, that remains a more open question. And as I type that, Burns wafts outside off, the edge flies through to first slip and Taylor puts down a dolly. 7th over: England 15-1 (Burns 6, Denly 4) Hawkeye shows the ball was careering into leg stump. The young opener\u2019s balance was all over the shop there \u2013 perhaps he was a little shaken by the blows he\u2019d taken earlier in his innings, if we were looking to be charitable? Denly flicks his first ball away for four through midwicket. Southee gets one to lift up a touch off a length, the ball pinging into Sibley\u2019s \u2026 box \u2026 area. Young Dominic has reaped the benefit of modern protective wear a couple of times already this innings. But there\u2019s nothing that can protect him from this! He misses a straight one, Southee raps him on the pad and Dharmasena\u2019s finger goes up. Might have been sliding down but he opted not to review. It\u2019ll be interesting to see the Hawkeye. 6th over: England 11-0 (Burns 6, Sibley 4) Burns punches Henry down the ground for a couple and it has to be said that the England openers have made a very confident, unflustered start (other than the blow Sibley took in the third). 5th over: England 8-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 3) Southee continues and keeps Burns honest. The threat of rain seems to have dissipated and the ground is now bathed in sunlight and shadow (Oh Danny Boy etc). A few clouds are lingering but I\u2019d be surprised if we get any interruptions now. 4th over: England 7-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 2) Sibley pinks up a single off Henry\u2019s second over. \u201cJohn, as a public service to ageing test cricket observers, would you mind publishing the details of where to order the rock-hard six pack from?\u201d requests Ian Forth. Of course, simply turn on any number of TV channels at 4am in the morning and you\u2019ll find a selection of magical gadgets and gizmos which, through mild twisting or vibrating, will, for 10 regular payments of 39.95, will enable you to develop that Adonis-like physique while you wear a rictus grin and sweat not a jot. There\u2019s no confusion, Tina. Just good science. 3rd over: England 6-0 (Burns 4, Sibley 1) Southee is bang on the money here, probing away at the newcomer Sibley. Then \u2013 blimey \u2013 he ducks straight into a shorter ball which slams into the badge on his helmet. That was a heavy blow, the ball pinging off to point. The England physio comes out to take a look and go through a few checks. It\u2019s a fairly lengthy delay but he\u2019s OK to continue. Burns, who called his dazed partner through for a leg bye, ends the over with a glorious cover drive for four to get off the mark. 2nd over: England 1-0 (Burns 0, Sibley 1) Matt Henry at the other end. Ten dots to start the innings then Sibley nudges to leg to get the England total off the mark. 1st over: England 0-0 (Burns 0, Sibley 0) Southee starts things off with the ball for New Zealand, who will really fancy getting stuck into the England top order over the next hour or so. Burns, after nearly getting himself into a tangle off the first, sees out a maiden. Out come Burns and Sibley for England. They have about an hour and 20 minutes to get through this evening. Meanwhile, after a little 4am teleshopping channel hopping here in the freezing, misty UK, I\u2019m ready to get a rock-hard six pack, a bed that will enable me to sleep the best sleep ever and a steam-powered mop thing that I can also use to clean the bathroom taps. Not the sort of total that guarantees a positive result for the hosts but a very useful one nevertheless. England are going to have to go very big here to stand a chance of victory and they\u2019re going to have to do it at a reasonable lick. And that\u2019s that. Wagner goes first ball, flicking Curran\u2019s low full toss straight to Sibley at midwicket. 129th over: New Zealand 375-9 (Wagner 0, Henry 5) A wicket maiden for Archer, which will feel pretty good after being blasted for a couple of sixes. \u201cIn answer to Ali\u2019s question (over 118), I\u2019m pretty sure Matt Henry and Henry Nicholls have played together,\u201d writes Ian Forth. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to find an English example - although Steve James will have played together with James Maher for Glamorgan (not admittedly in England). Ashley Giles and Giles Clarke no doubt sat on the same committees together.\u201d Santner has an almighty swing at another Archer bouncer but swishes at fresh air on this occasion. He connects with his next effort \u2026 but picks out Woakes at square leg. 128th over: New Zealand 375-8 (Santner 23, Henry 5) Woakes \u2026 full \u2026 punched gloriously down the ground by Henry for four. Super shot that. And it\u2019s followed by five dots. 127th over: New Zealand 371-8 (Santner 23, Henry 1) Six! Archer bangs one in short, looking for the extra bounce that Broad and Woakes have found, but Santner helps it on its way and over the rope down at backward square leg. And six more! A carbon copy, this time glancing off the forehead of a steward who was looking in the wrong direction. There\u2019s a moment of worry but he\u2019s all smiles afterwards, which is a relief. 126th over: New Zealand 359-8 (Santner 11, Henry 1) Matt Henry, who has a Test half century to his name, gets off the mark with a push into leg. Woakes digs one in short, Southee offers the handle, Pope takes a comfortable pouch. 125th over: New Zealand 357-7 (Santner 10, Southee 18) Archer (25-7-58-0) replaces Broad. Southee calls Santner through for a quick single \u2026 Woakes\u2019s shy at the stumps would\u2019ve run him out with a direct hit. Santner, though, survives to prod the next ball through the gap in the slip cordon and away for a boundary that brings up 350. Four more byes come from the next, a steepling bouncer leaving Pope with no chance. 124th over: New Zealand 348-7 (Santner 6, Southee 17) Southee rocks back and flat bats Woakes straight down the ground for four, then guides through the covers for a single. He\u2019s looking to get on with things. Santner, meanwhile, is happy enough to block out. 123rd over: New Zealand 343-7 (Santner 6, Southee 12) Broad has Southee scratching and scuffling untidily but can\u2019t winkle the No 9 out. He scampers to the non-striker\u2019s end, then there\u2019s a huge appeal as Santner is struck on the pad. There was an equally huge inside edge \u2013 not out. Meanwhile over in Adelaide, you can follow Australia\u2019s run feast with \u2013 oof! \u2013 Geoff Lemon and Rob Smyth here: 122nd over: New Zealand 342-7 (Santner 6, Southee 11) Woakes almost has Santner back in the hutch but a top edge drops safe. England might fancy wrapping this up pretty quickly now but Southee has other ideas, cutting very fine for four then launching over mid on for a couple more. 121st over: New Zealand 334-7 (Santner 5, Southee 4) So a very fine debut innings comes to an end. Tim Southee is the new batsman and gets off the mark with a little edge to third man. Broad has admirable figures of 27-7-72-4. England seem to have succeeded in their latest petition to get the ball changed but it\u2019s soon behaving in the same way as its predecessor, whistling away to the boundary off Mitchell\u2019s bat. Another lovely cover drive from the debutant. Broad digs in the next, though, and he has his man. This time Mitchell can\u2019t get on top of his pull shot and sends a catch straight down the throat of Archer at deep backward square. 120th over: New Zealand 326-6 (Santner 5, Mitchell 69) Woakes \u2013 who looks to have been hitting the weights since the summer, he\u2019s built like the proverbial brick outhouse \u2013 struggles to worry Santner, who adds two more to the total. Weather watch: it has clouded over a fair bit but the clouds don\u2019t look particularly threatening. Fingers crossed. 119th over: New Zealand 324-6 (Santner 3, Mitchell 69) Broad and Woakes are both bowling extremely full here, perhaps looking for reverse swing. It has resulted in the occasional ugly full bunger but has occasionally also discomfited the batsmen. Broad gives up just a couple of singles on this occasion. 118th over: New Zealand 322-6 (Santner 2, Mitchell 68) Because New Zealand have been scoring so slowly (in the main), England, despite being in the field for the best part of two days, are still in this if they can bag a couple of quick wickets here. Woakes instead strays onto Mitchell\u2019s pads and gets neatly tucked away to cow corner for four. Anyone? 117th over: New Zealand 317-6 (Santner 2, Mitchell 62) Broad has one ball left of this pre-tea over \u2026 and with it Santner gets off the mark with a couple pushed into the on side. So England head off for tea with a spring in their collective step. It was a hugely challenging session for them but that wicket could keep them in the game. Can they capitalise? Watling clips a full ball from Broad away for a single \u2013 had he missed that only his front pad would\u2019ve prevented middle stump being ripped from its moorings. Mitchell pulls in slightly more unconvincing fashion than usual to again get England pulses jumping again \u2026 and then Broad makes the breakthrough. A ferocious rising delivery finds the splice of Watling\u2019s bat and the ball pops up to Burns in the slips. 116th over: New Zealand 313-5 (Watling 54, Mitchell 62) Joe Root brings himself on for a quick twirl before the break, hoping against hope for a moment of magic or madness. No sign of either here though, just a trio of singles. 115th over: New Zealand 310-5 (Watling 52, Mitchell 61) This pair have been together for 51 overs now, a really impressive recovery from 191 for five. Tea is on the horizon, so Mitchell keeps his powder dry even though Broad sends down a couple of fairly juicy full tosses. Another maiden. 114th over: New Zealand 310-5 (Watling 52, Mitchell 61) And, typically, after pointing out the increasing run rate, a maiden from Curran. 113th over: New Zealand 310-5 (Watling 52, Mitchell 61) Runs are beginning to flow a little easier now. Broad bangs one in short but it sits up at just above hip height and Mitchell helps it on its way to fine leg for four. There were 24 runs scored in the first hour after lunch \u2013 there have been 38 in the 45 minutes since. Not exactly a deluge but a significant uptick as the bowlers have tired. 112th over: New Zealand 304-5 (Watling 52, Mitchell 55) Watling drives beautifully straight down the ground \u2026 too straight. Straight into the stumps at the bowler\u2019s end, in fact. Four dots \u2026 then Watling goes to his 50 with by crashing a wide half volley from Curran through the covers for four. 111th over: New Zealand 300-5 (Watling 48, Mitchell 55) I should have mentioned this an over or two ago but Mitchell moving to his fifty also brought up the 100 partnership. Consider yourself informed. Stuart Broad returns to the fray. Mitchell, happy to take on the shorter ball, pulls hard for two to bring up the New Zealand 300. 110th over: New Zealand 298-5 (Watling 48, Mitchell 53) Sam Curran returns to the attack; Watling responds with a sweetly-timed off-drive for four. This pair are looking rock-solid at the moment, and they have all day in truth. 109th over: New Zealand 294-5 (Watling 44, Mitchell 53) Shot! Mitchell drives through the covers sumptuously as Stokes puts one in the slot. He nears a debut half-century \u2026 and he gets there in fine style, crunching a pull down to cow corner for four more. 108th over: New Zealand 286-5 (Watling 44, Mitchell 45) A short leg and a leg slip for Watling as Archer continues his search for a breakthrough. BJ carefully watches the first couple with an almost professorial intensity then flicks through midwicket as Archer overpitches. He does well to ride out a lifting delivery from the last too. 107th over: New Zealand 282-5 (Watling 40, Mitchell 45) Stokes continues. There were fears he would be out for the South Africa series with his knee injury but instead he\u2019s charging in again. It\u2019s hard to know how much to read into that \u2013 such is Stokes appetite for the contest that you feel he\u2019d be all-too-ready for a six-over spell on a broken ankle. This time around he sends down a maiden at Mitchell. 106th over: New Zealand 282-5 (Watling 40, Mitchell 45) The forecast earlier was for a bit of rain this afternoon but the weather in Hamilton remains bright and sunny (with a bit of cloud about) as Mitchell thunks Archer back down the ground for four. The batsman has a big airy pull at the next but connects only with the Waikato air, but \u2013 BOOM \u2013 he makes contact with the same shot a ball or two later, Curran making a fine diving stop on the boundary. He wasn\u2019t far off making the catch, actually. 105th over: New Zealand 273-5 (Watling 40, Mitchell 40) Hello and good evening/morning/whenever it is where you are. Whenever and wherever you have been during this series, there has been a good chance that BJ Watling will have been batting while you go about your business. Utterly untroubled and unruffled he\u2019s looked today, though here Stokes tempts him a little into a big off-drive that he inside-edges back down the track. 104th over: New Zealand 272-5 (Watling 40, Mitchell 39) Archer tries going round the wicket to Watling, who \u2013 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2013 keeps him out. When Archer, quickening up now, goes back over the wicket, Watling cuts for two, and reaches 40 off his 157th ball. \u201cThe pitch is placid,\u201d says Mike Atherton. And that\u2019s drinks, with NZ ominously well set. In an effort to make something happen, I\u2019m off to bed and John Ashdown is here to entertain you. Thanks for reading. 103rd over: New Zealand 269-5 (Watling 38, Mitchell 38) Stokes keeps Watling quiet \u2013 though the greater challenge might be to provoke him into making a noise. 102nd over: New Zealand 268-5 (Watling 38, Mitchell 37) Archer has a shout for LBW against Mitchell, who still seems a candidate for it, but it\u2019s too high. A maiden leaves Archer with figures of 22-7-46-0. Looking at them, you might think he was a medium-pacer, which is what he has often been in this innings. 101st over: New Zealand 268-5 (Watling 38, Mitchell 37) Barrage time again, and Daryl Mitchell takes on Stokes. One swivel yields only a single, but the next races away for four. Even if he gets out in a minute, Mitchell can call his Test debut a success. And here\u2019s Brian Withington. \u201cSome very gritty cricket in progress, so I\u2019m rising to David Hindle\u2019s dangled bait. Joe Root may be experiencing a lean run with the bat and some technical challenges but I suspect he is still England\u2019s best batsman for the long term. Good luck finding a replacement, I say. \u201cIn passing, I\u2019m tempted to reflect that the hounding into premature retirement of Alistair Cook has really worked wonders for the fortunes of the England team.\u201d Hounding? By whom? 100th over: New Zealand 260-5 (Watling 35, Mitchell 32) Archer replaces Woakes and draws an inside edge from Watling, but it heads harmlessly into the pad. Off the past ten overs, there have been just 14 runs. 99th over: New Zealand 259-5 (Watling 35, Mitchell 31) Ben Stokes, England\u2019s resident glutton for punishment, is back for more. His natural angle in brings a single and a two before he finds his line. 98th over: New Zealand 256-5 (Watling 33, Mitchell 30) Woakes is trying one variation per over, and this time it\u2019s a slow yorker. Watling keeps it out with a phlematic prod. In his last four Test innings he has a personal tally of 420-2, with stays at the crease of 239 minutes, 306 minutes, 667 minutes and now 180 minutes, which makes a grand total of 1432. Or eight minutes short of 24 hours. The mind boggles. 97th over: New Zealand 255-5 (Watling 33, Mitchell 29) Curran to Watling. Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. \u201cIt\u2019s a stalemate,\u201d says Ian Smith. 96th over: New Zealand 255-5 (Watling 33, Mitchell 29) Another maiden from Woakes, who slips in a slower ball to keep us awake. 95th over: New Zealand 255-5 (Watling 33, Mitchell 29) Well, they are trying the barrage, but they\u2019re getting Curran to deliver it. While he did take a wicket with a bouncer this morning, it\u2019s asking a lot of a diminutive medium-pacer. \u201cHint of desperation,\u201d says a commentator who may be Mark Richardson. Mitchell, seeing three men back for the hook, helps himself to a single; for Watling, the three men come in to save the single in the midwicket zone. 94th over: New Zealand 254-5 (Watling 33, Mitchell 28) Woakes bowls a bouncer to Watling which is so sparky and steep that you wonder if England shouldn\u2019t try a barrage from Archer. 93rd over: New Zealand 253-5 (Watling 33, Mitchell 27) Runs! Five of them! Mitchell flicks Curran for a single, then Watling cuts for four. That sends his strike rate for the innings rocketing to 28. 92nd over: New Zealand 248-5 (Watling 29, Mitchell 26) Another over from Woakes, another maiden. 91st over: New Zealand 248-5 (Watling 29, Mitchell 26) Curran bowls a maiden to Mitchell, who nearly perishes, not through anything the bowler does, but by falling over as he decides against a run. Flat on his stomach, poking his bat back over the line, he loses his dignity but not his wicket. An interesting take on Joe Root has landed in my inbox. \u201cRoot\u2019s batting decline was already beginning before he got the captaincy,\u201d says David Hindle. \u201cIt was a small drop off, but nevertheless it was there. Why will taking the captaincy away automatically correct the list of technical problems with his batting? Why will it stop his persistent nicking off to nothing balls? Why will it stop him falling over his front leg in embarrassing style to perfectly straight ones? It won\u2019t. \u201cHe\u2019s no batting saviour. He never will be one. It\u2019s time to do more than drop him as captain. It\u2019s time to look for someone else entirely.\u201d 90th over: New Zealand 248-5 (Watling 29, Mitchell 26) Woakes beats Watling, too comprehensively to catch the edge. And that is lunch, with New Zealand owning the last hour and honours even over the morning as a whole. We\u2019ve had 35.2 overs and NZ have made 75-2. Most of the bowlers have been good, but England\u2019s collective energy, so strong at first, has gone flat. With rain around, the draw must be the favourite and that suits NZ just fine. See you in half an hour. 89th over: New Zealand 248-5 (Watling 29, Mitchell 26) While we\u2019re on the subject of slo-mo, Rory Burns pulls off a half-stop in the gully which, when slowed down, turns into a ballet. It brings a song to mind \u2013 any Boz Scaggs fans in the house? The angels lay their clouds across his sky They line up for him every night Some have wings and others sing The rest do lazy ballets in the air 88th over: New Zealand 247-5 (Watling 28, Mitchell 26) Woakes continues, conceding a couple of singles. More importantly, here\u2019s John from Turton, replying to Ben Bernards (77th over). \u201cTo be fair, it was a reference to the rugby community. On the way to the ground this morning, there was a guy on the AM sports channel going on about Wayne Barnes\u2019s mistake in the World Cup final 12 years ago! The cricket followers do have a much better sense of proportion.\u201d This is like an argument in a very nice pub, filmed in slow motion. 87th over: New Zealand 245-5 (Watling 27, Mitchell 25) Archer is off too, replaced by Curran, who beats Mitchell outside off. There was a noise, and an appeal, but the noise was the thud of bat on pitch. 86th over: New Zealand 243-5 (Watling 26, Mitchell 24) Root takes Broad off, quite rightly, and brings on Woakes. He starts with an ellipsis \u2013 dot, dot, dot \u2013before going one, one, dot. It\u2019s all a bit too tidy from England. Root may be regretting not having Saqib Mahmood among his five seamers. 85th over: New Zealand 241-5 (Watling 25, Mitchell 23) The fifty partnership comes up, bathetically, with a leg bye off Archer. It\u2019s taken 21 overs, not that that will bother Watling, who was probably born imperturbable. It\u2019s a maiden for Archer, but there\u2019s no threat. 84th over: New Zealand 240-5 (Watling 25, Mitchell 23) Broad\u2019s finding some movement but it\u2019s modest and into the pads, where most batsmen are comfortable. 83rd over: New Zealand 237-5 (Watling 24, Mitchell 21) Mitchell keeps on flirting with LBW, jabbing and flicking at straight balls, but it\u2019s working for him. Jofra has found a few extra Ks, up to 138 now. 82nd over: New Zealand 234-5 (Watling 24, Mitchell 18) Well, Broad isn\u2019t the third seamer yet: he stays on, and Woakes will have to wait. \u201cThis is the moment in the game,\u201d says David Lloyd. \u201cThis is it.\u201d And he suspects that England are not raising their intensity \u2013 though Broad, as if hearing him, has an LBW appeal against Mitchell with a nice late inswinger. That would be very reviewable, if England weren\u2019t out of reviews. But HawkEye agrees with umpire Dharmasena that it was going over, just. 81st over: New Zealand 232-5 (Watling 23, Mitchell 17) Root takes the new ball and hands it to Jofra Archer, with a suspicion that it\u2019ll be Woakes at the other end. Archer\u2019s second ball swings in after passing the stumps, wrong-footing Pope and going for a bye. There\u2019s some bite and bounce, but, as yet, no pace: the first four balls are only 130-132 kph. 80th over: New Zealand 230-5 (Watling 22, Mitchell 17) I don\u2019t believe it! After 17 successive dots, Watling tucks Broad for a triumphant two. And then cover-drives him for four. Broad, who bowled well this morning, is looking a bit third-seamer-ish now. 79th over: New Zealand 224-5 (Watling 16, Mitchell 17) Stokes bowls what is surely his last over. He\u2019s limping back to his mark, yet still running in and bowling faster than Broad. His itch to be involved is ridiculous. 78th over: New Zealand 224-5 (Watling 16, Mitchell 17) Denly\u2019s little outing is over as Broad returns. Yet another maiden, the 20th of the innings. 77th over: New Zealand 224-5 (Watling 16, Mitchell 17) Stokes looks in proper pain now, though it doesn\u2019t stop him appealing for caught behind against Mitchell. Pope and Root are very interested but they don\u2019t have any reviews left. Here\u2019s Ben Bernards, picking up on John from Turton (71st over). \u201cWhat\u2019s with this geezer? We\u2019ve had a lot of English migrate to NZ in the last 10-15 years, but not sure we\u2019ve reached an overall national status of \u2018whingers\u2019 just yet...\u201d At last, a diplomatic incident. 76th over: New Zealand 223-5 (Watling 15, Mitchell 17) Milking time for Denly. Root is filling space before the new ball but there\u2019s a case for getting Archer on now, so he\u2019s firing on all cylinders when he has something shiny in his hand. 75th over: New Zealand 219-5 (Watling 14, Mitchell 14) Watling flicks Stokes for two, but then misses one that straightens outside off. Watching Watling today, you\u2019d never guess he\u2019d just made a double hundred. 74th over: New Zealand 217-5 (Watling 12, Mitchell 14) Denly gives his first ball oodles of air and Mitchell is equal to it, biding his time before playing a cover drive. A couple of balls later, Mitchell is dancing down the track and hitting a straight six, which a TV graphic clocks at 110 metres. 73rd over: New Zealand 209-5 (Watling 12, Mitchell 6) Stokes is game for a second over, angling it in as he always has. Even with a dicky knee, he can bowl a bouncer that vaults over the keeper for two byes. That\u2019s another maiden. Anyone feeling sleepy? 72nd over: New Zealand 207-5 (Watling 12, Mitchell 6) Stung by all that criticism, Joe Root has suddenly become Mr Funky Bowling Changes. He replaces Curran with Joe Denly\u2019s leg-breaks, which didn\u2019t feature at all in the last Test. Root is rewarded with a very handy over \u2013 five dots and a single to Watling. And that\u2019s drinks, with the morning belonging firmly to England. 71st over: New Zealand 206-5 (Watling 11, Mitchell 6) Off goes Woakes, and on comes... Stokes! So much for Ian Ward\u2019s story at the start of the day (20:48). He runs in as normal, although there are one or two grimaces and gyrations as he walks back. Mitchell, perhaps wary of Stokes\u2019 s reputation, plays out another maiden. Here\u2019s John from Turton. \u201cI know this subject\u2019s been aired before but has anyone explained the one-minute delay? I suspect the Radio NZ Sport commentator is less than a cover drive\u2019s distance from me but he\u2019s had time to send a smoke signal by the time it catches up. Also, why doesn\u2019t Sky Go work in the Land of the Long White Whinge?\u201d 70th over: New Zealand 206-5 (Watling 11, Mitchell 6) Curran follows the review with a long hop, which Watling clubs through backward point. That\u2019s the first boundary today off Curran, whose spell now stands at 5-2-8-1. A medium-sized appeal, not given, no big deal \u2013 but they\u2019ve reviewed, which seems odd. \u201cLooks like a deflection off the bat,\u201d says the TV ump. And it is, so not out. 69th over: New Zealand 202-5 (Watling 7, Mitchell 6) A maiden from Woakes to Mitchell, who is now starting on off stump. We\u2019ve had 15 runs in the past ten overs, and nine of them came in that little flurry of four balls from Woakes. 68th over: New Zealand 202-5 (Watling 7, Mitchell 6) Mitchell is falling over to the off side, which should make him a candidate for LBW b Curran. And the TV cameras have spotted his mum filming him on her phone, which could make him a candidate for collapsing with sheer embarrassment. 67th over: New Zealand 201-5 (Watling 7, Mitchell 5) Off his ninth ball, Mitchell finally connects with one of his big square-of-the-wicket strokes, flicking a short ball from Woakes for a handsome first four. Watling adds insult to injury with a poky little push-edge for four, and that\u2019s the 200 up. \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s best over of the morning,\u201d says Ian Smith. \u201cRolling in the deep,\u201d adds Adele, on the PA. 66th over: New Zealand 192-5 (Watling 3, Mitchell 0) Another maiden as Curran pitches it up, searching for swing, and Watling\u2019s drives go to the men in the ring. Here\u2019s John Starbuck. \u201cif England restrict NZ to 250 or so they\u2019ll feel they\u2019ve done a good job. The poverty of current expectations?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t quit say that. It\u2019s true that if Jimmy Anderson was here, you\u2019d have expected the score to be 170 for seven last night. But 250 all out would be fine, wouldn\u2019t it? 65th over: New Zealand 192-5 (Watling 3, Mitchell 0) Woakes keeps it tight to Watling and then jags a short one past the outside edge of Mitchell, who is being given an early introduction to the difference between Tests and T20. 64th over: New Zealand 191-5 (Watling 2, Mitchell 0) Out comes Daryl Mitchell, for the first time in Test cricket, though he has the comforts of his home ground. He stands well outside his crease, which surely means you stick a short leg in to keep him pegged down. Root doesn\u2019t. Curran tries another bouncer and Mitchell misses it by a mile with a hook that\u2019s more of a flail. A wicket maiden for Curran, who so often makes something happen. Curran, who deserved a wicket five minutes ago, has one now as Nicholls gets under his bouncer and gives Broad a simple catch at fine leg. England are back in business. 63rd over: New Zealand 191-4 (Nicholls 16, Watling 2) Time for another change, as Woakes replaces Archer. Woakes\u2019s line and length are as tidy as his hair, and more so than his new-found beard. \u201cEvening Tim.\u201d Evening, Guy Hornsby. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to say I thought play began at 10pm, so my gallows-ready humour had been slightly deflated by seeing Tom Latham\u2019s already out.\u201d First-world problems, eh. \u201cI can\u2019t even get my despondency in properly. Is there anything more English, staying in on a Friday night?\u201d 62nd over: New Zealand 191-4 (Nicholls 16, Watling 2) Time for a change: Broad gives way to Sam Curran, who is 12 years younger, a foot shorter and much the same speed. He immediately draws a nick from Watling \u2013 and it falls tantalisingly short of Ollie Pope, who had to change direction where perhaps an experienced keeper would have been in the right place. 61st over: New Zealand 188-4 (Nicholls 14, Watling 1) Archer moves over the wicket to the left-handed Nicholls, who is hit on the thigh as he tries to whip to leg. Another maiden. Archer may be averaging 146 with the ball in this short series but he is only going at 2.48 per over. 60th over: New Zealand 188-4 (Nicholls 14, Watling 1) After defending a series of full, straight deliveries from Broad, Nicholls pulls the last ball of the over to deep backward square for a single. England are one quick wicket from being in a very good position. 59th over: New Zealand 187-4 (Nicholls 13, Watling 1) A lovely yorker from Archer is kept out by Watling. A maiden. England have started well this morning, with accuracy and intensity. 58th over: New Zealand 187-4 (Nicholls 13, Watling 1) Broad, the wise old don of the attack in the absence of Anderson, bowls another accurate over. He has excellent figures of 16-5-38-2. 57th over: New Zealand 186-4 (Nicholls 13, Watling 0) Nicholls flicks Archer breezily through square leg for four. Archer\u2019s request for a field change is rejected by Root, and the pair have a long chat at the end of the over. Their relationship is worth keeping an eye on. 56th over: New Zealand 182-4 (Nicholls 9, Watling 0) BJ Watling is the new batsman. A rare, almost shocking mistake from Tom Latham gives England an early wicket. He offered no stroke to Broad, bowling around the wicket, and heard the grim sound of his off stump being pegged back. Latham played with such expert judgement that it\u2019s hard to believe he left a straight one. It did jag back a touch, but not enough to absolve Latham. 55th over: New Zealand 178-3 (Latham 101, Nicholls 9) Jofra Archer completes the over he started yesterday afternoon. His first ball is a sharp, 88mph bouncer that Latham avoids. Another bouncer hits Latham on the shoulder and flies away for a leg bye. But the final delivery of the over is a bit too straight, which allows Nicholls to jump across and flick it fine for four. Some unsurprising news from Hamilton: Ben Stokes will not be able to bowl today, according to Sky Sports\u2019 Ian Ward. It means England are down to their last four seamers. Barney Ronay on Joe Root Ali Martin\u2019s first-day report Evening everyone, morning everyone else, and welcome to the second day of the second Test. The first day was ... frustrating. Just over half the overs were lost to rain, and after gambling by putting New Zealand in, Joe Root had only three wickets to show for it. Tom Latham, with a compact unbeaten hundred, and Ross Taylor, with a hot-and-cold fifty, calmly assembled the partnership that won the day. Root and Chris Silverwood had picked an XI with an eye on pub-quiz immortality \u2013 five seamers, no spinner, no regular keeper \u2013 but the performance was better than the cast list. Jofra Archer, who took no wickets, bowled as well as Chris Woakes, who took two, and would have got rid of Latham soon after lunch had Ben Stokes not dropped another expensive catch. Today, Root will need to combine Archer\u2019s fire with the wiles of Woakes and Stuart Broad, while hoping that there\u2019s some swing for Sam Curran and that Stokes\u2019s knee injury doesn\u2019t accelerate his drift towards being a specialist batsman. All the New Zealanders have to do is serve up more of the same, and Latham\u2019s last few Test hundreds have all gone past 150. It could be dull, but it\u2019s unlikely to be as bad as David Warner v Pakistan. Play starts half an hour early for the rest of the match, to claw back some of the lost overs, so I\u2019ll see you at 9.30pm UK time, 10.30am in NZ. The forecast is clear for the first half of the day, dodgy thereafter.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the international Red Cross has sharply criticised Britain\u2019s policy of stripping the citizenship of people held in Syria after the fall of Islamic State, saying it is \u201cnot conducive\u201d to long-term peace in the region. Peter Maurer said the UK and other western countries also needed to consider repatriating children held with their mothers in Syria\u2019s overcrowded refugee camps \u2013 at a time when the UK Home Office has said no more returns of British minors are in the pipeline. Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told the Guardian that he \u201cfailed to see\u201d how denying people such as 19-year-old Shamima Begum their nationality would help a crisis made more complex by the recent Turkish invasion. \u201cThere are things which are probably not conducive to a solution and I fail to see at the present moment how stripping citizenship and making people stateless or just pushing or betting on a second nationality which should deal with the issue brings more clarity,\u201d he said. The UK has repeatedly stripped citizenship from people who travelled over to join Isis where it believes they have a valid second nationality, although Begum \u2013 who left east London when she was 15 \u2013 has challenged such a decision in the British courts, arguing that she has in fact been rendered stateless. The invasion of the border areas of Kurdish-dominated north-east Syria in October has led to further population displacement as locals have fled Turkey\u2019s army, estimated by Maurer at \u201cdefinitely more than 100,000 and probably closer to 200 [thousand]\u201d, and further complicated the region\u2019s humanitarian crisis. The ICRC had been able to maintain access to al-Hawl, the largest refugee camp in north-east Syria, but said its access to camps and Isis prisons on the frontline had become more difficult. \u201cWe haven\u2019t now revisited prisons now under the control of Turkish armed forces,\u201d Maurer added. But he warned that countries such as the UK that tried to ignore their citizens in the region unfairly increased the burden on Syria and neighbouring Iraq: \u201cThey have even more difficulties in terms of infrastructure, security, environment, and therefore we have to start somewhere.\u201d The ICRC estimated that there were roughly 10,000 to 15,000 families in the refugee camps from 60 to 70 countries, populations that were \u201coverwhelmingly kids, some of them are accompanied by their mothers and some of them are orphans\u201d.

Scotland Yard is investigating the 28-year-old, who was known to the authorities and fitted with an electronic tag to monitor his movements. He was allowed out a year ago after serving time for his part in a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange. Khan was arrested in December 2010 and released on licence (parole) in December 2018, wearing an electronic tag. A police search believed to be linked to the London Bridge investigation is being carried out in the West Midlands at a three-storey block of flats in Wolverhampton Road, Stafford, close to the town centre. Two people, one man and one woman, died after being stabbed in the attack that started at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall during a conference about rehabilitating offenders. Another two women and a man were injured and taken to hospital. The suspect was shot dead by police on London Bridge, about 2pm. Khan was attending the conference, according to the Met police assistant commissioner, Neil Basu. He said: \u201cWe believe that the attack began inside before he left the building and proceeded onto London Bridge.\u201d The Parole Board has issued a statement saying it had no involvement in the release of Khan. Footage has emerged showing three members of the public, including one armed with a fire extinguisher and another with a five-foot narwhal tusk, grappling and grounding the attacker before police arrived. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has argued that more resourcing is needed for the police, saying \u201cyou can\u2019t disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation, the tools that judges have.\u201d Sadiq Khan said there would be an increased police presence on the streets in the wake of the attack to reassure members of the public. Security minister Brandon Lewis refused to say whether the attack showed a failure by authorities. He repeatedly refused to comment on the specifics of the incident, but said that more assessment was needed of the sentences given to violent criminals. Khan was among nine men who pleaded guilty on the eve of their trial to plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey, and had a handwritten list noting the names and addresses of other potential targets including Boris Johnson, who was then mayor of London. That plot was said to have been inspired by al-Qaida. The sentencing judge identified Khan and two others as \u201cthe more serious jihadists\u201d and said they should not be released until they were no longer a threat to the public. Sadiq Khan, praised the \u201cbreathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran towards danger\u201d to stop the attacker. The mayor also thanked police who put their lives on the line.

\u2018terrorist military training facility\u2019</h2> \n  <p>London Bridge suspect <strong>Usman Khan</strong> once planned to establish and train at a \u201cterrorist military training facility\u201d on land owned by his family in Kashmir, according to <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Judgments/mr-j-wilkie-sentencing-remarks-r-v-chowdhury.pdf\">sentencing remarks from his conviction for terrorism offences</a> in 2012.</p> \n  <p>Khan was one of nine people arrested for involvement in the Stock Exchange Plot in December 2010 and, at 19, was the youngest of the group. But in his sentencing remarks, <strong>Mr Justice Wilkie</strong> said Khan and two others were \u201cmore serious jihadis\u201d than the others.</p> \n  <p>He said Khan should not be released before he had served a minimum of eight years of his 16 year sentence \u2014 which, backdated to his arrest in December 2010, saw him released in December 2018. He received a 20% discount on his sentence for pleading guilty and was subject to a terrorism notification period of 30 years.</p> \n  <p>Wilkie said Khan and his co-accused <strong>Nazam Hussain</strong> and<strong> Mohammed Shahjahan</strong> were planning to fund and establish the terrorist training school, with Khan and Hussain planning to leave the UK in January 2011 to train. </p> \n  <p>Wilkie said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is clear that this was a serious, long term, venture in terrorism the purpose of which was to establish and manage a terrorist training facility at the Madrassa, to fundraise for its construction and operation by the use of various means, including fraud, and to recruit young British Muslims to go there and train, thereafter being available to commit terrorism abroad and at home.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wilkie said that even considering Khan\u2019s youth, the risk he posed was \u201cso significant that it can only be adequately met by an [instrument for public protection].\u201d That would allow him to be remanded indefinitely so long as he was considered to pose a risk. The IPP sentencing model was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/10/ipp-sentencing-regime-in-england-and-wales-branded-deeply-harmful\">abolished in 2012</a>.</p> \n  <p>Said Wilkie:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They were working to a long term agenda, no less deadly in its potential than the potential for damage and injury the subject of the short term intentions of the others. They were intent on obtaining training for themselves and others whom they would recruit and, as such, were working to a more ambitious and more serious jihadist agenda.</p> \n   <p>In my judgment, these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on licence in the community, subject to conditions, by reference to a preordained release date.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de1c22d8f087410d9875840\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-30T01:35:53.427Z\">1.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">What we know so far</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Two people, one man and one woman, died after being stabbed in an attack that started at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall during a conference about rehabilitating offenders.</li> \n   <li>Two women and one man were injured and remain in hospital. </li> \n   <li>The suspect was shot dead by police on London Bridge, about 2pm.

It is with the heaviest of hearts that I must now inform you that, as well as the suspect who was shot dead by police, two of those injured in this attack in the London Bridge area have tragically lost their lives.</p> \n   <p>My heart goes out to their loved-ones and to the three further injured victims, who I understand are being treated in hospital, and of course to everybody who has been affected by today\u2019s terrible and mindless events.</p> \n   <p>The attack started at Fishmonger\u2019s Hall in the City of London. My understanding is that police were called at 1.58pm and City of London police officers had bravely and professionally confronted the suspect by 2.03pm; just five minutes later.</p> \n   <p>If you are concerned about anyone who was there today please try to contact them and if you cannot, then get in touch with us.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank all the emergency service personnel who are currently working tirelessly to deal with this incident, particularly the police officers from the Met and the City who have worked so closely together to protect the public.</p> \n   <p>I also want to thank the members of the public who have helped, either by showing extraordinary courage by stepping in or by following the instructions they\u2019ve been given by officers at the scene and in the area. This support from our public assists us more than you could know.</p> \n   <p>In the coming days, you will see more police \u2013 both armed and unarmed \u2013 patrolling our streets to help reassure those who are understandably concerned. Similarly, our counter-terrorism detectives will be working round the clock to identify those who have lost their lives, to support all the victims and their families. We are also working at full-tilt to understand exactly what has happened and whether anyone else was involved. For this reason we expect cordons to remain in place around the London Bridge area for some time.</p> \n   <p>This afternoon, I met with the prime minister and the home secretary, and also had a meeting with the mayor. I\u2019m very grateful for all their support. Indeed, we have been working closely with the government at every level and just as closely with our partners across London. This will obviously continue in the coming days.</p> \n   <p>This joint effort mustn\u2019t stop with the authorities, though. As you know, we are treating this as a terrorist incident. Fighting terrorism takes effort and determination from all of us. If you have any information or concerns, please do contact us.</p> \n   <p>The empty ideology of terror offers nothing but hatred and today I urge everyone to reject that. Ours is a great city because we embrace each other\u2019s differences. We must emerge stronger still from this tragedy. In doing that we will ensure that the few who seek to divide us will never, ever succeed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Police have asked anyone with information that could assist with their investigation to call the anti-terrorist hotline: 0800 789 321.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de17f168f08dcf251b4bcb4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T20:29:12.310Z\">8.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>One other update: Dick was unable to say whether or not the suspect was known to police, telling reporters only: \u201cThis is a very fast moving, dynamic investigation, we will keep you updated.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de17e168f08dcf251b4bcb2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-29T20:23:53.851Z\">8.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That concludes the Met commissioner\u2019s statement; the main update of which seems to be confirmation of the numbers of people affected.

      "bodyText": "The Met has identified the London Bridge attacker as Usman Khan, a 28-year-old man released from prison on a licence (parole) in December 2018 after spending eight years in jail for terrorism offences. He pleaded guilty in 2012 to offences including planning and raising funds for terror related activities and planned to establish, and train at, a terrorist military training facility in Kashmir. The judge termed his plans a \u201cserious, long term venture in terrorism\u201d and warned he may pose an ongoing risk to the public. You can read more about his history here. Khan was wearing an electronic tag and had reportedly been invited to attend a justice conference on prison rehabilitation at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, on the northern side of London Bridge, on Friday. The attack began there. One man and one woman died after being stabbed. Their names have not been formally released. Two women and one man remain in hospital. Khan was shot dead by police after being restrained by bystanders, including one man wielding a fire extinguisher and another wielding a five-foot-long narwhal horn he had apparently taken from the walls of Fishmongers\u2019 Hall. Before the sun comes up in the UK, here are the first run of the London papers. London Bridge attacker once planned \u2018terrorist military training facility\u2019 London Bridge suspect Usman Khan once planned to establish and train at a \u201cterrorist military training facility\u201d on land owned by his family in Kashmir, according to sentencing remarks from his conviction for terrorism offences in 2012. Khan was one of nine people arrested for involvement in the Stock Exchange Plot in December 2010 and, at 19, was the youngest of the group. But in his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Wilkie said Khan and two others were \u201cmore serious jihadis\u201d than the others. He said Khan should not be released before he had served a minimum of eight years of his 16 year sentence \u2014 which, backdated to his arrest in December 2010, saw him released in December 2018. He received a 20% discount on his sentence for pleading guilty and was subject to a terrorism notification period of 30 years. Wilkie said Khan and his co-accused Nazam Hussain and Mohammed Shahjahan were planning to fund and establish the terrorist training school, with Khan and Hussain planning to leave the UK in January 2011 to train. Wilkie said: It is clear that this was a serious, long term, venture in terrorism the purpose of which was to establish and manage a terrorist training facility at the Madrassa, to fundraise for its construction and operation by the use of various means, including fraud, and to recruit young British Muslims to go there and train, thereafter being available to commit terrorism abroad and at home. Wilkie said that even considering Khan\u2019s youth, the risk he posed was \u201cso significant that it can only be adequately met by an [instrument for public protection].\u201d That would allow him to be remanded indefinitely so long as he was considered to pose a risk. The IPP sentencing model was abolished in 2012. Said Wilkie: They were working to a long term agenda, no less deadly in its potential than the potential for damage and injury the subject of the short term intentions of the others. They were intent on obtaining training for themselves and others whom they would recruit and, as such, were working to a more ambitious and more serious jihadist agenda. In my judgment, these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on licence in the community, subject to conditions, by reference to a preordained release date. Two people, one man and one woman, died after being stabbed in an attack that started at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall during a conference about rehabilitating offenders. Two women and one man were injured and remain in hospital. The suspect was shot dead by police on London Bridge, about 2pm. He has been identified as Usman Khan, a 28-year-old man who was jailed for terrorism offences in 2012 after pleading guilty to involvement in the 2010 Stock Exchange Plot. He was arrested in December 2010 and released on licence (parole) in December 2018, wearing an electronic tag. He had reportedly been invited to attend the Learning Together conference. Nine men, including Khan, pleaded guilty on the eve of their trial to plotting to bomb the London Stock Exchange, Big Ben, and Westminster Abbey, and had a handwritten list noting the names and addresses of other potential targets including Boris Johnson, who was then mayor of London. The plot was said to be inspired by al-Qaida. The sentencing judge identified Khan and two others as \u201cthe more serious jihadists\u201d and said they should not be released until they were no longer a threat to the public. Johnson telegraphed concerns with the parole system in his second press statement late on Friday, telling reporters had \u201clong argued\u201d that it was a \u201cmistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early.\u201d University of Cambridge \u2018devastated\u2019 Professor Stephen Toope, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, said he was \u201cdevastated\u201d that an event organised by its Institute of Criminology was targeted in the attack. He said: I am devastated to learn that today\u2019s hateful attack on London Bridge may have been targeted at staff, students and alumni attending an event organised by the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Criminology. We are in touch with the Metropolitan Police, and awaiting further details of the victims. We mourn the dead and we hope for a speedy recovery for the injured. Our thoughts are with all their families and friends. The 2010 Stock Exchange plot, which the Met said bridge attacker Usman Khan was involved with, was said by prosecutors to have been inspired by al-Qaida. Nine men pleaded guilty over the incident in 2012. London Bridge attacker Usman Khan was jailed for terrorism offences in 2012, the Met said. He was part of the Stock Exchange plot which was disrupted by MI5 and the police. He is also understood to have been a supporter of al-Muhijaroun, the extremist group which scores of terrorists were involved with, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Neil Basu said the event began at Learning Together, a justice conference featuring ex-prisoners, academics and justice advocates. Organiser the Learning Together Network has locked its twitter account. Basu said in a statement: The circumstances, as we currently understand them, are that the attacker attended an event earlier on Friday afternoon at Fishmonger\u2019s Hall called \u2018Learning Together\u2019. We believe that the attack began inside before he left the building and proceeded onto London Bridge, where he was detained and subsequently confronted and shot by armed officers. Extensive cordons are likely to remain in place for some time and I would ask the public to continue to avoid the area. The Times has reported that the attacker, who police have identified as Usman Khan, was invited to attend the conference and sat through a morning session. Bryonn Bain, an associate professor with the University of California in Los Angeles, spoke at the conference prior to the attack. Basu said police would be increasing patrols across London in the wake of the attack, and asked anyone with images or footage to submit it to police here. Usman Khan was convicted in 2012 for terrorism offences and released from prison in December 2018 on licence, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said. In a statement, Basu said police were searching Khan\u2019s Staffordshire residence and that he is believed at this stage to have acted alone. Whilst we are still in the early stages of the investigation, at this time we are not actively seeking anyone else in relation to the attack. However, we continue to make fast time enquiries to ensure that no other people were involved in this attack and that there is no outstanding threat to the public. As I stated earlier, police were called at 13:58hrs to a stabbing at premises near to London Bridge, EC1. Emergency services attended, including officers from the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police. A male suspect was shot by specialist armed officers and I can confirm that he died at the scene. We are now in a position to confirm the identity of the suspect as 28-year-old Usman Khan who had been residing in the Staffordshire area. As a result, officers are, tonight, carrying out searches at an address in Staffordshire. Basu said a man and a woman were killed in the attack while three others, one man and two women, remained in hospital. This individual was known to authorities, having been convicted in 2012 for terrorism offences. He was released from prison in December 2018 on licence and clearly, a key line of enquiry now is to establish how he came to carry out this attack. Tragically, two people \u2013 a man and a woman \u2013 were killed during the attack. Three others \u2013 a man and two women \u2013 were also injured and remain in hospital. Police have identified the suspect of the London Bridge Attack as 28-year-old Usman Khan from Staffordshire. \u2018I did what any Londoner would do\u2019 A man who helped tackle a knife-wielding terrorist who killed two people near London Bridge said he intervened because it was \u201cwhat any Londoner would do\u201d. Thomas Gray, 24, was among a group of men who dragged the killer to the floor near Fishmongers\u2019 Hall on Friday. The tour firm manager said he stamped on the terrorist\u2019s wrist to try to make him release one of two large knives he was carrying Gray told the PA news agency: I was brought up on rugby and the rule is \u2018one in, all in\u2019. I did what any Londoner would do and tried to put a stop to it. Gray said he had been driving northbound on London Bridge with a colleague when they saw several people running towards the south of the bridge. He said they did not know what to do, so he turned the car off and by the time he got to the attacker, he had been \u201cwrestled\u201d to the floor by \u201cfive or six other blokes\u201d. He said: He had two knives on him, one in each hand, and it looked like they were taped to his hands. I stamped on his left wrist while someone else smacked his hand on the ground and kicked one of the knives away. I went to pick up the knife when I heard a cop say \u2018he has got a bomb\u2019. I then got back and hid behind a school bus which was full of kids at the time. Gray said he saw \u201ctwo or three\u201d shots fired by police hit the attacker, who then \u201chit the deck\u201d. I then heard a fourth one and then a pop and a bang, followed by \u2018run, run, run\u2019. I turned and ran and then heard a volley of shots from behind us. Gray told ITV News the attacker was being chased by five men with a \u201cfire extinguisher\u201d before he was wrestled to the ground. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has offered his sympathies to the victims of attacks in London and the Hague. He said he is not aware of any Australians caught up in either incident. The maintenance worker who witnessed the London Bridge knife attack claims he was told the assailant had been in prison for terrorism offences. One witness said he spoke to one of the men who helped wrestle the knifeman to the ground after they were taken to the Salvation Army headquarters to be interviewed by police. He told the PA news agency: The guy who was on top of him said he [the attacker] had been in prison for terrorism, apparently. Some of the guys who were on top of him were ex-prisoners and they had all been in the Fishmongers\u2019 Hall. The guy told me he was in prison with the attacker. One witness, a 24-year-old maintenance worker from Croydon, said he was driving his van across the bridge when he saw four men tackle the attacker. He told PA News Agency: As I got on the bridge armed police pulled in front of me. There were already four pedestrians on top of the guy on the floor. One of them [pedestrians] was shouting \u2018shoot him in the f***ing head\u2019. I\u2019m still in my van at this point, trying to turn around. Then the police say \u2018get out of the van\u2019, so I had to leave it there. I then saw them [police] shoot him three or four times. I was in shock. I wanted to get away. Everyone was shouting run because he had something across his chest. It was crazy. One of the bystanders who helped restrain the attacker was armed with a five-foot narwhal tusk. Amy Coop, a writer and director who was in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall when the attack occurred, said the man took the tusk from the wall. Footage of the attacker being tackled to the ground shows a man holding a long white pole, which Coop identified as the tusk. The attacker is understood to have been wearing an electronic tag when he staged the attack after being released from prison for terrorism related offences. He was known to the authorities at MI5 and police because of his previous conviction, sources confirm. Thomas Gray said he was among those members of the public who helped tackle the attacker on London Bridge. He told ITV News: Me and my colleague Stevie were driving northbound over London Bridge and we sort of came up behind a double-decker bus and we noticed several people jumping over the central reservation out to the right and sort of just peered our heads around and saw there was one chap running away from five guys running him down with a fire extinguisher. So Stevie and I just thought what to do, and just ran towards it, left the cars where they were and tried to do our best to apprehend the suspect. When we got there, he was wielding two knives, one was duct-taped to his hand so all I could do after the guys had held him down and were pinning him to the ground, tried to stamp as hard as I could on his wrist to try and release the knife as it were. Someone kicked the knife away, somewhere northbound up London Bridge and then after that the police armed response were really quick, got there almost instantaneously and, at that point, we were told he had a bomb vest so we cleared house and got out the way. At that point, saw a guy get shot a couple of times and then hit the deck. I hid behind a school bus full of little children ... got the bus turned around and they went back south over London Bridge. At that point, we were told to stay where we were, as we were then told he had a gun as well. So we just stayed put, heard another shot and a little explosion and we just heard \u2018run\u2019 so we just turned and high-tailed it south over London Bridge and heard 15 or so gunshots. The prime minister has described the deaths of two members of the public at London Bridge as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and said there would be an \u201cenhanced\u201d police presence on the streets following the attack. Johnson said he had \u201clong argued\u201d that it is a \u201cmistake to allow serious and violent criminals to come out of prison early and it is very important that we get out of that habit and that we enforce the appropriate sentences for dangerous criminals, especially for terrorists, that I think the public will want to see\u201d. Speaking in Downing Street ahead of the Cobra meeting, Johnson declined to say whether the individual was known to the security services or the police before the incident took place. On the election campaign, he said: I think it\u2019s very important that in a democracy we continue to get on with the democratic process and I think it\u2019s vital that we show respect to the victims, to their families and certainly we\u2019ve acknowledged that and campaigning has been suspended and the opposition parties have also suspended campaigning in London. But I think it\u2019s very important in a democracy that we are not bowed and we are not intimidated by terrorism and that we get on with the normal democratic processes and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing. Johnson added: We\u2019ve received the heartbreaking news tonight that two members of the public have lost their lives in this attack and obviously our thoughts are very much with them, their families, their loved ones and everybody affected by the attack. My thanks go first of all to the emergency services, the police for their bravery and their professionalism, and to repeat again my thanks to those members of the public who put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect others and I think they represent the best of our country and I thank them on behalf of the rest of our country. A British Red Cross spokesman has said: The British Red Cross is in communication with the authorities regarding the incident that occurred at London Bridge today. We are closely monitoring the situation and are ready to make the UK Solidarity Fund available to those affected by the attack. The fund was set up in 2017 following the attacks in Manchester and London and offers financial support to victims of terror attacks in need anywhere in the UK.\u201d Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, has just released this statement on the conditions of the three people being treated in hospital: Our heartfelt thanks go to everyone who responded to this incident, both the extraordinarily brave members of the public and our emergency responders. As the Met police have confirmed, sadly two people have died in addition to the suspect. London Ambulance Service treated people at the scene and three were taken to hospital. We can confirm that one patient is critical but stable, a second person is in a stable condition and a third person has less serious injuries. Our deep sympathies are with the families and all those affected by today\u2019s incident. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has released an updated statement following Scotland Yard\u2019s briefing earlier this evening (see: 8.16pm). Heartbreaking confirmation from the Met Commissioner that two people who were attacked this afternoon have tragically died \u2013 victims of the appalling terrorist attack at London Bridge. My heart goes out to them, their loved ones and to everybody affected. London will never be cowed by terrorism. Terrorism will never win. I want to reassure Londoners and visitors that there will be enhanced police patrols, including firearms teams, on the streets of London this weekend. I will be attending the government\u2019s emergency Cobra meeting tonight. Here\u2019s the full text of Cressida Dick\u2019s statement: I am deeply saddened and angered that our city has again been targeted by terrorism. It is with the heaviest of hearts that I must now inform you that, as well as the suspect who was shot dead by police, two of those injured in this attack in the London Bridge area have tragically lost their lives. My heart goes out to their loved-ones and to the three further injured victims, who I understand are being treated in hospital, and of course to everybody who has been affected by today\u2019s terrible and mindless events. The attack started at Fishmonger\u2019s Hall in the City of London. My understanding is that police were called at 1.58pm and City of London police officers had bravely and professionally confronted the suspect by 2.03pm; just five minutes later. If you are concerned about anyone who was there today please try to contact them and if you cannot, then get in touch with us. I want to thank all the emergency service personnel who are currently working tirelessly to deal with this incident, particularly the police officers from the Met and the City who have worked so closely together to protect the public. I also want to thank the members of the public who have helped, either by showing extraordinary courage by stepping in or by following the instructions they\u2019ve been given by officers at the scene and in the area. This support from our public assists us more than you could know. In the coming days, you will see more police \u2013 both armed and unarmed \u2013 patrolling our streets to help reassure those who are understandably concerned. Similarly, our counter-terrorism detectives will be working round the clock to identify those who have lost their lives, to support all the victims and their families. We are also working at full-tilt to understand exactly what has happened and whether anyone else was involved. For this reason we expect cordons to remain in place around the London Bridge area for some time. This afternoon, I met with the prime minister and the home secretary, and also had a meeting with the mayor. I\u2019m very grateful for all their support. Indeed, we have been working closely with the government at every level and just as closely with our partners across London. This will obviously continue in the coming days. This joint effort mustn\u2019t stop with the authorities, though. As you know, we are treating this as a terrorist incident. Fighting terrorism takes effort and determination from all of us. If you have any information or concerns, please do contact us. The empty ideology of terror offers nothing but hatred and today I urge everyone to reject that. Ours is a great city because we embrace each other\u2019s differences. We must emerge stronger still from this tragedy. In doing that we will ensure that the few who seek to divide us will never, ever succeed. Police have asked anyone with information that could assist with their investigation to call the anti-terrorist hotline: 0800 789 321. One other update: Dick was unable to say whether or not the suspect was known to police, telling reporters only: \u201cThis is a very fast moving, dynamic investigation, we will keep you updated.\u201d That concludes the Met commissioner\u2019s statement; the main update of which seems to be confirmation of the numbers of people affected. To recap, Dick said two people died and three more are being treated in hospital. The Met commissioner says more armed police will patrol and, as part of Scotland Yard\u2019s efforts to work out if anyone else was involved, cordons will remain for some time. Dick says she met the prime minister, the home secretary and London\u2019s mayor and the police are working with the government. She reaffirms that the attack is being treated as a terror incident and asks for the public\u2019s help in combating it. Dick says the ideology behind terrorism will never succeed. Taking questions, she says she\u2019s unable to provide any updates on the conditions of those in hospital and she says she cannot confirm anything about the identities of those who died, adding that confirming identities is a priority for the police. Dick says officers were called at 1.58pm and had confronted the attacker within five minutes. She asks anyone worried about a loved-one to try to get in touch with them and, if they cannot, to contact the police. She pays tribute to the emergency services who responded and to the bystanders who intervened and then followed the instructions they were given by police, saying it assists officers \u201cmore than you can know\u201d. Cressida Dick is speaking now. She confirms that two people died in the attack and three more are being treated in hospital. The suspect was also shot dead by the police. The Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, will give a statement outside New Scotland Yard in about 10 minutes, police say. The London Ambulance Service says it took three people to hospital after today\u2019s incident. It\u2019s worth noting that the number of people injured could be greater because officials are not yet able to rule out the possibility that some people made their own way to hospital. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee \u2013 known as Cobra \u2013 at 9.30pm, a Downing Street spokesman has said. A faked tweet made to look like it came from the account of Jeremy Corbyn has been circulating online. In the mocked-up screengrab, which we will not disseminate any further, it is made to appear as if the Labour leader expressed sympathy for the suspect, who was shot dead by the police, rather than for the victims of the terror attack. No such tweet every existed. Corbyn\u2019s real statement following the attack can be read here. Adam, a 30-year-old hotel night manager who was walking along the bridge on the way to the gym when he heard gunshots, said he thought the stabbing had taken place near a van that was stationary in the middle of the road. He was feet away on the other side of the bridge, he told reporters after leaving the police witness centre hours later. The police came towards us and started moving vehicles and it was all in such a rush and there was a lot of people who were quite stressed. Yeah, so it was quite difficult to see what was happening, you know. I think everyone was confused. It seemed to be unfolding because, when I was walking along the bridge at first, there was nothing happening. He was taken to the witness centre by police and spent two hours giving details and getting assistance from trained welfare officials. I\u2019m just trying to process everything, I suppose. I haven\u2019t seen nearly enough to be what you called shaken or traumatised. I\u2019d imagine that anyone that was on the other side of the road probably is, though. The prime minister, Boris Johnson called the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, this evening. Johnson will receive further updates from security officials within the next hour to see what more has emerged since he met officials earlier in the evening. A decision on whether or not the government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra should meet will be judged on the basis of the meeting, it is understood. The president of the European parliament, David Sassoli, has expressed his condolences after today\u2019s attack: A large police cordon remains in place around the north side of London Bridge following the knife attack. Pedestrian and vehicle access along Upper Thames Street, which runs underneath part of the bridge, is blocked by police at its junction with Swan Lane through to Lower Thames Street at its junction with Fish Hill Street. The pedestrian cordon extends north-east to Fenchurch Street, at its junction with Philpot Lane, and north to Gracechurch Street, at its junction with Bell Inn Yard. On the north-west side on the bridge, the pedestrian cordon extends to Cannon Street at its junction with Bush Lane. Monument Station, which is within the cordon, remains closed. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has released the following statement in response to the London Bridge attack: My heart goes out to the victims of this appalling attack. We owe a deep debt of gratitude to our police and emergency services and the brave members of the public who put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect others. We must remain united across all our communities and we cannot let our democratic process be derailed by acts of terror. We are suspending campaigning in London tonight as a mark of respect for those who suffered in this attack. We will not be cowed by those who threaten us. We must and we will stand together to reject hatred and division. It is now understood that two members of the public have died following today\u2019s attack. We reported at 6.04pm that one member of the public had been killed. National Rail has confirmed that London Bridge station has reopened. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has paid tribute to the emergency services for their response to today\u2019s incident: Our emergency services have once again displayed the courage and professionalism that keeps us safe everyday. I am hugely grateful to each and every one of them. My thoughts are with the people who were injured and all those affected by this appalling display of violence. Today\u2019s incident reminds us that we can never take our security for granted. We must never forget the vital work that our police and security services do to keep us safe. Those who seek to terrorise us, divide us or undermine our freedoms will never succeed. The University of Cambridge has said it\u2019s concerned for the welfare of some of its staff and students who were reported to have been attending an event just metres away from the incident. A spokesman said: We are gravely concerned at reports that University of Cambridge staff, students and alumni were caught up in the incident at London Bridge. We are urgently seeking clarification and further details. Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by these terrible events. A woman who works as a trader in Borough market, and who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian that some people were injured in the panic. \u201cI was breaking down some cardboard boxes to take to the bins and was almost knocked over by the oncoming stampede to get out of the market. I saw some people get knocked over and sustain head injuries. I then ran into The Gentlemen Baristas where staff took people downstairs to the basement. \u201cPolice then moved us further away so I reconvened with colleagues at a pub on Borough High Street. I am now heading home but the buses are understandably a nightmare. All the stalls have been left open and market management has not officially closed the market for trading; some staff remained in the area but they have now been told that no one is allowed to return to the market. Most traders have no bags or wallets and many are stuck in the London Bridge area. \u201cI\u2019m a bit shaken but not as bad as others \u2013 some have PTSD from the previous terrorist attack on London Bridge. Everyone\u2019s collective fear was quite intense but we are mainly anxious for tourists. \u201cWe have already seen a significant drop in the number of visitors to the market compared to before the previous attack. The worry is now that many stalls may lose good business right before what is our busiest time of year.\u201d Julia O\u2019Dell, 25, who works in sales at a software store on Borough High St, gave this account of the aftermath: Just after 2pm I was on my lunch break and I popped across the road to get a sandwich at the Pret a Manger on Borough High Street. When I came out, everyone at London Bridge was running away from the incident and shouting \u2018Gun! Shooting!\u2019 There were about 100 people in a massive panic \u2013 I was shocked, I didn\u2019t know what was going on, it was like out of a movie. You could see fear in people\u2019s eyes; there were tourists as well as people who worked round the market. Then the police were blocking the whole of Borough High Street off with buses, lorries and coaches. I started walking further away, and then there more shouts of \u2018run!\u2019 About 30 of us bolted ran down a side street to the back of King\u2019s College. There was a fire exit door that someone opened and everyone ran in. The staff were amazingly calm and they locked the door as there were fears that there was a lone shooter out there. I was feeling very shaky. Everyone there was on high alert, we were all checking the news on our phones. After about 30 minutes, we read on the news that someone had been detained, and we thought it was safe to leave. So the staff unlocked the doors. One member of the public has died after the attack, sources involved in the NHS response to the incident say. All the casualties were taken to the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel, one of the capital\u2019s four designated major trauma centres. Police announced earlier that the suspect was shot and died at the scene. Johnson was asked if the immediate danger was over following the fatal shooting of the suspect. He said: \u201cTo the best of our knowledge the incident has been contained.\u201d He added: \u201cBut I would urge everybody, of course, to be to be vigilant and one cannot help but think back to what happened in 2017 in the same part of the city, and I hope very much that people will be able, as fast as possible to to go about their normal business.\u201d Speaking after a briefing from the police he said: While this is an ongoing investigation, the police can confirm that this was a terrorist incident. And clearly my thoughts are first with emergency services with the police the bravery that they showed in going towards danger as they do. I also want to pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery of those members of the public who physically intervened to protect the lives of others. And for me, they represent the very best of our country, and I thank them on behalf of all of our country. I think we\u2019re all very saddened also to learn that some people have been injured in this event and our sympathies are very much with them and with their loved ones. Clearly the Metropolitan Police are continuing their investigations, and I can assure you and assure everyone that anybody involved in this crime, in these attacks, will be hunted down and will be brought to justice. The message that we send to them and anyone associated with this type of attack is one that will be familiar, and that is that this country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack and our values our British values will prevail. Asked if he would suspend election campaigning, Johnson said: \u201cI\u2019ve obviously stopped my campaigning for this evening, but will be we\u2019ll be reviewing the matter in the course of next few hours.\u201d Boris Johnson says the investigation into the terrorist incident is ongoing. Speaking in Downing Street, he said \u201canybody involved in this crime and these attacks will be hunted down and will be brought to justice\u201d. He also paid tribute to the bravery of the emergency services and members of the public who intervened in the London Bridge attack. Johnson said the UK would \u201cnever be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack and our British values will prevail\u201d. Some three-and-a-half hours on from the attack, the number of casualties is thought to be at least 10 people. There is serious concern about the condition of two of those injured. Officially no figure has been given for the number of the members of the public injured. The suspect was shot by police and died at the scene, police have said. Khan said a number of people were wounded in the incident Friday and that some of the injuries are serious. He did not offer a figure, but said it was important to allow the families of those who were hurt some privacy. London mayor Sadiq Khan has paid tribute to \u201cbreathtaking heroism\u201d from members of the public who confronted the attacker. Speaking to reporters he said: \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about the images we\u2019ve seen is the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran towards danger, not knowing what confronted them. \u201cWe do know from the statement given by the assistant commissioner Neil Basu that there appears to be a device on the suspect. \u201cMembers of the public didn\u2019t realise at the time that was a hoax device and they really are the best of us, another example of the bravery and heroism of ordinary Londoners running towards danger, risking their own personal safety to try and save others. \u201cAnd I want to say thank you to them on behalf of all Londoners but also because it shows the best of us.\u201d Little is know yet about the about the number of people injured in the stabbing attack. This image shows one of those who was hurt. More than 20 witnesses were taken to be debriefed at the police allocated building near the incident. Some of them looked shaken as they entered the building. More arrived in marked and unmarked police vehicles as the afternoon wore on including restaurant and transport workers. None were willing to talk to reporters. British Transport Police have urged the public not to be alarmed by the presence of more firearms police officers on duty in London over the weekend. John Moseley contacted the Guardian community team to report what he saw. I got off an overland train at London Bridge and went into the Tooley Pret \u00e0 Manger to get a sandwich. When I came out with it, I heard shouting from the west side of the street looking towards the bridge. A policeman, shouting, ran out of a pedestrian walking area on the river side of the street and tried to get across the street, somewhat held up, I think, both by pedestrians and a passing van. When he got across, he ran into a Starbucks, seemingly in pursuit of someone. Another policeman came down the street at roughly the same place as he had crossed and seemed to be telling everyone to run eastwards on the street. A cyclist on the other side of the street, the river side told me, seeming dazed, maybe a little shell shocked, that he\u2019d seen a man get shot on London Bridge. From the way he described it, it sounded as if this man had been down on the ground, but appeared to be fiddling with something on his chest, as if he might be trying to set off a bomb, but, again, it wasn\u2019t clear. The fatal shooting of the suspect will now be investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Under the law they have to examine all police shootings and they will investigate independently. Fears of an explosive device and uncertainty after the attack meant people fled in terror and took cover where they could, witnesses have told the Guardian. Jo, from East London, was sheltered in a restaurant in Borough Market: I was shopping in the area when they started to cordon it off. There was panic in the market and people started running. I saw two people fall over. I was walking down a side street trying to leave the area when all of a sudden people started running. The police then told people to get inside, so we sheltered in Le Pain Quotidien. They locked the doors and moved people away from the glass. The police have just let us leave. Constanze, 26, from Elephant and Castle, is stuck in the News Building near London Bridge: Our building is on lockdown. My team and I feel unsettled, scared and worried but we were luckily safe inside the building when it happened. No one has given us any sense when we will be able to leave. The announcements over the tannoy just say: \u2018Police have advised the incident is ongoing and the building will remain on lockdown. We have been advised there is no indication the situation will change soon.\u2019 Aditi, 29, from New York, went into hiding in the attic of a cheese shop: A policeman came to the crowd near Kappacasein Dairy and asked us to move indoors but at the time we couldn\u2019t process that information or know what to do with it. I then noticed people starting to run very fast away from the entrance of Borough Market, so we ran down a side street and noticed people running into Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy. We were one of the last to get in before they locked the door. We were taken to the attic and the staff said they had been trained for such an incident. We were there for around 30 minutes before the police gave clearance to exit and move further away from the market. My partner and I are rattled but OK. We\u2019re just glad to be safe. Here are the main points from Basu\u2019s statement: A number of people were injured after reports of a stabbing near London Bridge. Their condition has not been disclosed. The suspected knife attacker died at the scene after being shot by armed officers. The attacker was wearing what police now believe was a fake suicide vest. The attack is being treated as a terrorist incident. Counter-terrorism command is leading the investigation, but the police retain an open mind on any motive. Police have appealed for information, video and photographs of the incident. Police patrols will be increased across London and the rest of the UK. Ahead of his briefing with Basu, Boris Johnson has put out another statement: Here\u2019s Assistant Commissioner Basu\u2019s statement in full: I can confirm that at approximately 2pm today Friday the 29th of November. Police were call to a stabbing at a premises near to London Bridge EC1. Emergency services attended including officers from the City of London police and the Metropolitan Police. A male suspect was shot by specialist armed officers from the City of London police, and I can confirm that this suspect died at the scene. A number of other people received injuries during this incident. As soon as we can provide further updates on their condition we will. And our heartfelt sympathies go out to everybody who\u2019s been involved in this and is anxiously waiting for information on their loved ones. As soon as we can get that information we will get it to you. As you would expect due to the nature of the incident, we responded as though this was terrorist related. I\u2019m now in a position to confirm that it has been declared a terrorist incident. We are working jointly with the City of London police as we continue to respond. Officers from the met counterterrorism command and now leading this investigation, but I must stress we retain an open mind as to any motive. It would be inappropriate to speculate further at this time. Due to reports that the suspect may have had an explosive device, specialists offices also attended the scene and wide cordons are in place to ensure there remains no further danger to the public. However, I can confirm at this time, we believe a device that was strapped to the body of the suspect is a hoax explosive device. Officers continue to carry out meticulous searches in the area to ensure there is no outstanding threat to the public. Those extensive cordons will remain in place for a considerable time, and I would ask the public please continue to avoid the area. Public Safety is obviously our top priority. We will be enhancing police patrols both in the city and the country. I would ask anyone with information, image or footage of the incident that can be shared with our investigations aim to do so on the UK police image appeal website. I would also ask the public to continue to remain vigilant and report any concerns that they have to the police. I\u2019m not going to take questions at this time. The Prime Minister has asked for a personal briefing and I\u2019ll be heading with the Commissioner of the Met to Downing Street immediately. Due to reports that the suspect was wearing a suicide vest a cordon remains around the area. But Basu said the police now believe the vest was a hoax suicide vest. It has been declared a terrorist incident, Basu says. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, is giving a press conference outside Scotland Yard. He confirms the suspect died at the scene. Several people were stabbed by the suspect before he was wrestled to the ground and disarmed by members of the public, PA reports. Footage on social media appeared to showed one man being pulled away by armed officers moments before the suspect is shot at point-blank range. Another bystander could be seen carrying a large knife from the scene. Police sources and witnesses said the suspect appeared to be wearing a suicide vest. After being shot, he raised his arms towards his head before lying still. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s latest news story on the incident. A witness who works in an office near where the incident took place said he was leaving Pret a Manger at around 2pm on Friday when he saw a struggle across the street. I could see five or six people in a bundle, it looked like one of them had a makeshift weapon. Then all of a sudden everyone scattered and the police were there, I think it was three police officers. I heard two shots, one after the other. I think the person was on the ground and they shot him when he was on the ground. Then I thought why am I watching this, it could be a terrorist and others could be at large, so I rushed back to my office. During a campaign visit to Cardiff, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, expressed concern at the incident. She said: Clearly, we don\u2019t know the exact details of what has happened, and my thoughts are with everybody who has been caught up in that incident in whatever way. Including, of course, the brave police who are dealing with it with professionalism and in the way in which they do become the first responders in these difficult times. Underground trains are not stopping at London Bridge as the station remains closed. Florence, 28, a student, was in the area when the incident happened. She said: I was on a bread-making course in Borough market, and we were initially told to stay inside, but could hear a lot of commotion and panic outside. After about half an hour armed police told us to evacuate, and we were walked to safety about five minutes away. They kept us all very calm, as ever, [I was] impressed by the response of the police. Police didn\u2019t give us any information at the time. I felt pretty shaken when we were shut inside but safe once we got out. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has urged Londoners to \u201cstay resolute in our determination to stand strong and united in the face of terror\u201d. In a statement he said: The Metropolitan police have confirmed that as a precaution the horrendous incident at London Bridge is being treated as though it is terrorism-related. I remain in close contact with the Metropolitan police and am being kept updated with events. It has been confirmed that people were injured in the attack. My heart goes out to them, their families and all affected. Thank you to our brave emergency services who responded to today\u2019s horrific attack. Every day they put their lives on the line for us \u2013 running towards danger in order to keep London safe. We must \u2013 and we will \u2013 stay resolute in our determination to stand strong and united in the face of terror. Those who seek to attack us and divide us will never succeed. The London Bridge area remains closed \u2013 please avoid the area at this time and follow Met police for further updates, and TfL for travel updates. If you are near the incident, please follow the directions of any officers on the ground. A suspect shot by police today at London Bridge has died, two sources with knowledge of the investigation say. A witness said the man shot by the police could have been wearing an explosive vest. Speaking to the BBC, Karen Bosch said: I was on the bus coming southbound over London Bridge. We had just pulled away from the bus stop when the bus came to a sudden stop, because there were people running across the bridge into the road, sort of looking over their shoulders and filming behind them. It looked like there was a fight going on ... people tussling with each other. And then you realise it was police wrestling with one tall bearded man. I had my baby with me, so I moved her behind the stairwell to be safe. Then there was two shots or two loud pops, I think they were gunshots. And I also saw a spent Taser. And then the guy was lying on the floor. He then pulled his coat back, which showed that he had some sort of vest underneath \u2013 [I don\u2019t know] whether it was a stab vest or some sort of explosive vest. The police then really quickly moved backwards. On the bus we were panicking because at this point we were almost as close as the police to him. And he was sort of lying there pulling his coat backwards and the police were shouting at him and staying back from him. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has thanked the police and the emergency services for their response. A Downing Street source said Boris Johnson is on his way back to No 10 from his constituency where he will receive further updates on the incident. As a precaution the incident is being treated by police \u201cas if it is terror-related\u201d.

Staff at Monument station confirmed five people had been injured in the attack. The tube station has been closed off as armed police investigate. Boris Johnson said: \u201cI\u2019m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response.\u201d The home secretary, Priti Patel, said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d. Police have nothing about the motive of the apparent attack, but counter terrorism officers are involved in the investigation. Owen Jones, the Guardian columnist, said he arrived in the area minutes after the incident and saw people running away in fear. He said: \u201cI turned up as emergency services had arrived en masse in the area \u2026 Cordons were being put up and people were running away. The police were yelling \u2018keep moving\u2019 and people were running away looking frightened. I was by London Bridge about to the cross the bridge. \u201cOne of my friends was evacuated from their office in the area \u2026 I saw lots of people running down the streets towards me \u2026 It was a bad atmosphere and everyone in the area are quite worried. In these circumstances, no one knows what is going on. It was just a very chaotic \u2013 where I was, people were scared. They were genuinely very scared.\u201d Amanda Hunter, who witnessed the shooting from a bus and videoed the aftermath, described what she saw to BBC News. She said: I was coming home on the 21 bus and all of all a sudden it stopped. There was some commotion and I looked out the window and I just saw these three police officers going over to a man. It seemed like there was something in his hand. I\u2019m not 100% sure, but then one of the police officer shot him. From there, I was able to take a video of the scene. We were stopped on the bus maybe for me a minute and a half and then we\u2019re able to safely get off the bridge. There was only three police officers at the time. But by the time I got off the bridge, that\u2019s when I started to hearing the sirens. I heard about three shots to get the man. Everyone was just kind of into shock. Sources have confirmed that a suspect was shot by police. During the incident five people were injured, some are in serious condition. More video appears to show members of the public tackling a man on London Bridge before police intervened. Police pulled people off the man and then appeared to shoot him. The emergency services say they are treating the situation as a \u201cmajor incident\u201d. Borough market next to London Bridge has also been cordoned off, amid unconfirmed reports that a suspect was seen in the the market. Location of incident Scotland Yard has confirmed that police were called to a stabbing near London Bridge just before 2pm. One man has been detained, and \u201ca number of people\u201d have been injured. Someone was stabbed on London Bridge, a security source told Reuters. London Ambulance have crews on the scene as more videos have emerged appearing to confirm police shooting someone on the bridge. Here\u2019s video of people running off the bridge and vehicles trying to turn around. Witnesses say one person was shot by police. Twitter user, Amanda Hunter, who was on a bus at the time has video of the aftermath of the incident. The BBC\u2019s reporter at the scene also said he saw someone shot by police. Images from the scene show a white lorry across both carriageways on the bridge. London Bridge has been cleared and sealed off after shots were heard in the area. Scotland Yard has confirmed that it is dealing with \u201can incident\u201d on the bridge. A BBC reporter in the area said he heard two shots fired.

There should be plenty more to come and double-figure odds make him attractive, for all that Elliott could be in stronger form. Yala Enki is interesting on his first start with Paul Nicholls but the Welsh National is thought to be the aim. Cabaret Queen has evidently improved but her new mark looks stiff. Regal Encore and Brave Eagle are two at bigger prices who could get involved. 1.50 Newbury A brave and classy winner at Ascot in January, Downtown Getaway is a horse with a future who should be ahead of the handicapper. His April flop is easily forgiven but his jumping will need to be slicker this season. 2.05 Newcastle It is hard to see past Nicky Henderson\u2019s Buveur D\u2019Air as he tries to be the first since Comedy Of Errors to win the Fighting Fifth Hurdle three years in a row. Silver Streak is a useful rival but would be getting 13lb in a handicap. 2.25 Newbury Another Henderson runner on what may be a big day for the yard, French Crusader won easily at this track when last seen a year ago. That was his handicap debut and there should be plenty more to come, though this is a step up in class. 3.20 Newcastle With the Henry Oliver yard finding some form, Kilfilum Cross makes plenty of appeal. Second in the Kim Muir on his second start for Oliver, the grey ran well over too short a trip on his reappearance at Halloween. 3.40 Newbury A late mistake kept No Comment in third on his reappearance but it was an encouraging run from a horse who has dropped to a good mark. This step down in trip is an interesting experiment.",
