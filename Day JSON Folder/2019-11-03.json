      "bodyText": "Online casinos should be subject to maximum stake limits similar to the \u00a32 limits imposed on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), according to a report released by a group of MPs who are demanding a \u201croot and branch\u201d overhaul of gambling law. In a wide-ranging report, members of the cross-party group on gambling-related harm \u2013 who include high-profile Conservatives such as Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 called for a raft of measures to protect vulnerable people. Their recommendations include: A \u00a32 stake limit on online slot machines. An end to betting by credit card. Restrictions on \u201cVIP\u201d accounts. An investigation into non-disclosure agreements. The report also echoed Labour\u2019s call for the Gambling Act 2005 to be replaced, dismissing the existing law as \u201canalogue legislation in a digital age\u201d, ill suited to regulating an online sector that pulls in \u00a35.6bn a year. MPs in the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on gambling-related harm are understood to believe that they have a good chance of influencing gambling policy, regardless of the outcome of the general election. Labour, which liberalised gambling laws under Tony Blair, has already said it favours a stricter regime, while the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is thought to be sympathetic to calls for stricter regulation. He was among MPs who openly criticised the government over a proposed delay to the curbs on FOBTs introduced earlier this year. The interim report from the APPG, led by Labour\u2019s Carolyn Harris, Duncan Smith from the Conservatives and the SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan, is the result of a six-month inquiry including evidence sessions with gambling companies and addicts. Among the more eye-catching recommendations in the report, due to be published this week, is a maximum \u00a32 bet on online slot machines. This would echo the ban on \u00a3100-a-spin FOBTs introduced earlier this year after the government branded the machines a \u201csocial blight\u201d following a lengthy campaign. \u201cIf they are not acceptable in land-based venues they should not be allowed online,\u201d the report said. The MPs also backed calls to stop credit cards being used to gamble \u2013 as well as the introduction of mandatory affordability checks \u2013 to make sure customers don\u2019t get into financial difficulty. The average disposable income in Britain is \u00a3450 a month but online casinos and bookmakers often check on a customer\u2019s finances only after they have lost thousands of pounds. And they also recommended restrictions on \u201cVIP\u201d accounts, frequently cited in cases where problem gamblers racked up huge debts after being offered incentives such as free sport tickets or bonuses. Brigid Simmonds OBE, the chair of the industry\u2019s Betting and Gaming Council, said gambling companies were \u201ccommitted to ensuring a safe gambling experience for all customers, using the wide range of tools that online operators have at their disposal\u201d. \u201cOur members continue to invest significantly in new technology to make full use of data and algorithms to identify risk of harm and interact with customers at an early stage, and to introduce new affordability checks on customers.\u201d But the report said gambling companies had not been able to tell MPs what level of gambling they considered affordable and therefore could not reliably intervene when customers are losing dangerous amounts. \u201cThis report highlights the urgent need for a root and branch review of the regulation of online gambling,\u201d said Harris, who oversaw the report. She also singled out the industry\u2019s regulator the Gambling Commission, saying it was not fit for purpose in the age of internet gambling and required greater powers to sanction companies. A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: \u201cWe are disappointed that this report has been released before we have been given the chance to give evidence.\u201d They added: \u201cThe report does not reflect our considerable action and progress on most of the areas of concern set out in the report and we look forward to being given the chance to outline that work to the APPG.\u201d The commission said last week that it would not fine Ladbrokes after the Guardian revealed the bookmaker told the victims of a problem gambler\u2019s \u00a31m theft that it would only repay them if they signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The regulator has issued guidance to firms advising against the use of such NDAs, and the cross-party group\u2019s report called for a change in the law to prevent bookmakers using them to keep information from the regulator. The report also calls for online firms to improve their systems to identify vulnerable people and protect children, as well as to simplify terms and conditions. Duncan Smith, the vice-chair of the APPG, said: \u201cIt is outrageous that there are not stake limits online, that gamblers are still able to gamble using credit cards online and that operators are able to continue to offer inducements to the vulnerable without proper sanction.\u201d",

This is a rate which has remained relatively unchanged over the last 20 years. To put these figures into a global context, Australia lags 28th out of 34 OECD countries when ranked according to stillbirth rates. Stillbirth is twice as common as deaths attributable to HIV/Aids and for every death due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (Sids), there will be 35 stillbirths. The cost to families, the healthcare system and the economy are staggering. Direct costs to families include those associated with funeral arrangements and stillbirth investigations such as autopsies, which are not yet Medicare-subsidised. Indirect costs arise from enduring trauma which affects workplace productivity, family relationships and may lead to long-term mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidality. Economic analysis estimates the summative costs of stillbirth to our nation over five years to be $680m. However, stillbirth has long been ignored as a public health issue and considered a personal tragedy that sometimes happens and ought not to be discussed. Those involved in maternity care are also deeply affected by stillbirth. Looking after a woman during what is one of the most devastating events of her life is a heavy responsibility. We learn their stories in the delivery suite as they are induced to deliver their stillborn baby, in the clinic when they return for a postnatal check or in the assessment unit during their next pregnancy. In a profession focused on facilitating the delivery of new life, each story fills us with sadness. Research suggests that as many as 8% of obstetricians will contemplate leaving obstetric practice due to the emotional toll of stillbirth care. In 2018, the Senate stillbirth inquiry has brought stillbirth into the public health spotlight. The inquiry received hundreds of submissions from parents, clinicians and researchers. Recommendations for stillbirth education and research were drafted to reduce the stillbirth rate by 20% over the next three years. Last month on International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day, the government launched the Safer Baby Bundle, an evidence-based education and awareness campaign designed for healthcare professionals involved in maternity care to help end preventable stillbirth and improve care for women that may be at risk. This involves education in five key areas: supporting women to cease smoking, educating women regarding side sleeping, increased awareness regarding decreased foetal movements and optimum timing of delivery in women with risk factors. This initiative draws on successful campaigns in Scotland which reduced stillbirth rates by 22% over five years and in the Netherlands where rates declined by 55% in 14 years. As I progress in my training, I am sure to meet more families touched by the tragedy of stillbirth. I hope that the Safer Baby Bundle will herald a paradigm shift in our approach to stillbirth and lead to similar declines in rates here.

This buffer between pasture and riverbank acts as a filter, Bowler says. \u201cAny water that comes from the farm has to pass through that vegetated strip before it enters the waterway.\u201d</p> <p>It also assists with erosion. \u201cThe river is always going to be meandering and hitting the bank with some force. By vegetating with long-lived large trees like eucalyptus and wattles, it reinforces the bank and gives it resilience.\u201d</p> <p>As shelterbelt trees grow, they can keep cattle cool in summer and warm in winter, bring in native birdlife, control insect populations and connect corridors of bush for wildlife migration. Comfortable cows don\u2019t expend energy moderating their body temperature, so they can spend it on milk production instead. Research suggests that total <a href=\"http://www.dairyingfortomorrow.com.au/wp-content/uploads/EBONS-Report-Issue-3-2015_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">dairy production can increase by up to 30%</a> in the shelterbelt\u2019s lifetime (20% improved pasture growth, 10% improved milk production).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQxnQF2SF8\"                                                                        > <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6fQxnQF2SF8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Planting areas next to waterways are fenced, which promotes the growth of grass and protects water catchments.

In September the federal court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/18/queensland-government-loses-battle-to-cull-sharks-on-great-barrier-reef\">upheld a tribunal ruling</a> that the Queensland government could not use lethal shark control measures \u2013 typically baited hooks known as drum lines \u2013 within the Great Barrier Reef marine park.</p> <p>Last week British tourists Alistair Raddon, 28, and his friend Danny Maggs, 22, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/airlie-beach-shark-attack-two-men-injured-off-queensland-coast\">attacked and injured</a> while on a snorkelling trip in the Whitsundays. Raddon had his foot bitten off.</p> <p>In their statement, tourism authorities noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/24/whitsundays-shark-attacks-occurred-in-swimming-no-go-zone-conservationists-say\">recent incidents had occurred in the Whitsundays,</a> where permanent drum lines have never been installed.</p> <p>\u201cPrior to the most recent shark incident, the ruling \u2026 put the spotlight on the use of shark control measures in the Great Barrier Reef marine park and led to conflicting views being articulated at a political level,\u201d the statement by tourism authorities said.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge all parties in this discussion to determine the way forward without unintended further damage to the travelling public\u2019s perception about the exposure to risk when visiting the Great Barrier Reef. Any unnecessarily alarming publicity has the potential to further damage a perception-driven tourism industry.\u201d</p> <p>The Queensland government removed drum lines from the marine park immediately after the most recent court ruling. The state\u2019s fisheries minister, Mark Furner, has written to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, asking for amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Act to circumvent the ruling and allow for the reinstatement of lethal shark control.</p> <p>The tourism industry statement said doing so would be \u201can unnecessary step to achieve the outcomes that are sought by both industry and we would suggest, by the community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe adverse implication of changing the GBRMPA Act could be far-reaching and may have a detrimental bearing on the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s status as a world heritage area.\u201d</p> <p>The statement said drum lines could be reinstalled at popular mainland swimming beaches as a temporary measure, as the tribunal decision had allowed for a phase-out of lethal measures.</p> <p>But ultimately the tourism groups said more comprehensive research was needed around shark behaviour, including understanding recent apparent changes to behaviour, and \u201cimproved and innovative management tools\u201d informed by science.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia\u2019s reputation as a safe destination is a critical competitive advantage for our destination,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThis reputation is not built on a claim that accidents cannot happen here but on an implied assurance we have in place appropriate precautionary measures for all circumstances and that we respond compassionately and professionally to any incident.</p> <p>\u201cWe accept that visiting any natural environment and any interaction with wildlife requires appropriate awareness for operators and visitors, based on accurate information. It also calls for behavioural guidelines and adequate precautions to be put in place.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, in the context of the recent incidents involving sharks in the Whitsundays, we have a very limited understanding of the scientific facts that might explain changes to shark behaviour or movements in the different locations visited by tourism operators across the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>\u201cLong-term solutions will require a clearer understanding of shark movements and detailed analysis of the recent incidents.</p> <p>\u201cGuided by new scientific evidence, the industry is keen to work with government to implement improved and innovative management tools that can achieve better outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>Polling by the Humane Society International Australia, which ran the tribunal case against lethal shark control, last week found 73% of Queenslanders supported replacing drum lines with non-lethal shark control measures, such as drone technology.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Peak bodies representing the Queensland tourism industry have resisted calls for changes to Great Barrier Reef protection legislation to allow for lethal shark control measures. The strong statement, co-signed by several tourism bodies, said any such move would be an \u201cunnecessary step\u201d and could affect the reef\u2019s world heritage status. Instead, they want governments to conduct more research into shark behaviour and develop innovative management tools, informed by that science. The statement said the recent political bickering and \u201cunnecessarily alarming publicity\u201d about lethal shark control measures had the potential to harm the tourism sector. Debate has become particularly hysterical in recent months. In September the federal court upheld a tribunal ruling that the Queensland government could not use lethal shark control measures \u2013 typically baited hooks known as drum lines \u2013 within the Great Barrier Reef marine park. Last week British tourists Alistair Raddon, 28, and his friend Danny Maggs, 22, were attacked and injured while on a snorkelling trip in the Whitsundays. Raddon had his foot bitten off. In their statement, tourism authorities noted recent incidents had occurred in the Whitsundays, where permanent drum lines have never been installed. \u201cPrior to the most recent shark incident, the ruling \u2026 put the spotlight on the use of shark control measures in the Great Barrier Reef marine park and led to conflicting views being articulated at a political level,\u201d the statement by tourism authorities said. \u201cWe urge all parties in this discussion to determine the way forward without unintended further damage to the travelling public\u2019s perception about the exposure to risk when visiting the Great Barrier Reef. Any unnecessarily alarming publicity has the potential to further damage a perception-driven tourism industry.\u201d The Queensland government removed drum lines from the marine park immediately after the most recent court ruling. The state\u2019s fisheries minister, Mark Furner, has written to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, asking for amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Act to circumvent the ruling and allow for the reinstatement of lethal shark control. The tourism industry statement said doing so would be \u201can unnecessary step to achieve the outcomes that are sought by both industry and we would suggest, by the community\u201d. \u201cThe adverse implication of changing the GBRMPA Act could be far-reaching and may have a detrimental bearing on the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s status as a world heritage area.\u201d The statement said drum lines could be reinstalled at popular mainland swimming beaches as a temporary measure, as the tribunal decision had allowed for a phase-out of lethal measures. But ultimately the tourism groups said more comprehensive research was needed around shark behaviour, including understanding recent apparent changes to behaviour, and \u201cimproved and innovative management tools\u201d informed by science. \u201cAustralia\u2019s reputation as a safe destination is a critical competitive advantage for our destination,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThis reputation is not built on a claim that accidents cannot happen here but on an implied assurance we have in place appropriate precautionary measures for all circumstances and that we respond compassionately and professionally to any incident. \u201cWe accept that visiting any natural environment and any interaction with wildlife requires appropriate awareness for operators and visitors, based on accurate information. It also calls for behavioural guidelines and adequate precautions to be put in place. \u201cUnfortunately, in the context of the recent incidents involving sharks in the Whitsundays, we have a very limited understanding of the scientific facts that might explain changes to shark behaviour or movements in the different locations visited by tourism operators across the Great Barrier Reef. \u201cLong-term solutions will require a clearer understanding of shark movements and detailed analysis of the recent incidents. \u201cGuided by new scientific evidence, the industry is keen to work with government to implement improved and innovative management tools that can achieve better outcomes.\u201d Polling by the Humane Society International Australia, which ran the tribunal case against lethal shark control, last week found 73% of Queenslanders supported replacing drum lines with non-lethal shark control measures, such as drone technology.",

It was two sloppy goals from our point of view but teams like Liverpool do that to you, like Manchester City did [to Villa the previous week]. They just drain you mentally.\u201d Having seen his team fall to each of the top two within the space of a week the Villa manager, Dean Smith, foresees the title race going down to the wire again. \u201cI think they\u2019ll go toe-to-toe until the end of the season,\u201d he said.",

This was all at their expense, but they are a young team, the youngest to play in a World Cup final with 25 twenty-somethings in their squad of 32.

New Zealand have lost four World Cup knock-out matches in the last 20 years now. None of the teams who beat them went on to win the final. It is one thing to persuade yourself the fabled All Black aura does not make any difference in the week before playing them but another really to believe it the week after, too, when you are sure you are already on top of the world. There are always new lessons, then, even for a wily old dog like Eddie Jones. As one of his young standout performers, Sam Underhill, said when he was asked if he had heard of the theory that you have to lose a World Cup final before you learn how to win one: \u201cNo, but I\u2019m a fan of it now\u201d.</p> \n<p>Even the English may agree that South Africa\u2019s victory was a fitting way to finish a tournament that was, after all, about opening the game to new audiences. It is easy to forget in the wash of it all what a risk World Rugby took by bringing their marquee tournament to Japan, where the game is \u2013 or was \u2013 a minority sport. There has been nothing quite like it since Fifa decided to hold the 1994 football World Cup in the US. And it has paid off. They filled almost every seat in every stadium and at the tournament\u2019s peak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/31/rugby-mania-japan-world-cup\" title=\"\">won an audience of 54.8m TV viewers in Japan alone</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/south-africa-hopes-rugby-world-cup-win-can-bring-unity-ramaphosa-desmond-tutu\">'We are a special country': South Africa hopes World Cup win can bring unity</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3e073f0d-1573-40db-a0de-cb2dc1755f75\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kB70fEXtajs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That was during Japan\u2019s game against Scotland at the end of the pool stages. It was one of those matches which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/13/japan-typhoon-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">meant more than can be conveyed in facts and figures like that</a>, when the sport became about something much larger and more important than itself. It was the day after typhoon Hagibis had blown through and, around the country, they were still reckoning the damage. The official death toll was 24 when the match started, 28 when it finished. Days later it finally reached 89. Some of those deaths were just miles up the highway from the stadium.</p> \n<p>What was that match but a gesture of pride and defiance and togetherness? They were pumping floodwater out of the changing rooms on the morning of the game. One could hear the plain truth in Mandela\u2019s words then. And one could hear it again in the little town of Kamaishi, the smallest place to host a World Cup match, where they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/23/kamaishi-stadium-rugby-world-cup-tsunami\" title=\"\">built their new stadium on the site of the school that was swept away in the tsunami in 2011</a>. There never was a town that seemed as happy to be hosting a match. It was, the manager of the local rugby team said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/24/scott-fardy-tsunami-kamaishi-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">their way of thanking the world for its support after the disaster</a>.</p> \n<p>They never did get to play the second game that was scheduled there. It was one of the three matches cancelled because of the typhoon. It would have been the biggest fixture of the tournament for the two teams who were due to play, Namibia and Canada. But instead they got on with helping the people who lived there clear up the damage. Rugby loves to talk about its values and there they were again for everyone to see in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/oct/13/canada-rugby-players-help-clean-up-operation-after-typhoon-hagibis-in-japan-video\" title=\"\">footage of the Canadian players shovelling mud off the roads</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ecb3b5e3a993db5d9bc560c97559cf09726c50f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ecb3b5e3a993db5d9bc560c97559cf09726c50f/0_128_3834_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canada team memberso clean a road in Kamaishi following the cancellation their match against Namibia because of Typhoon Hagibis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canada team members clean a road in Kamaishi following the cancellation their match against Namibia because of Typhoon Hagibis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u6a2a\u5c71\u7d14\u592a\u90ce/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a timely reminder of the best of the game because there was some of the worst on show too, in the backstage bickering between the unions about who was to blame for the cancelled matches. It was a flash of the sport\u2019s narrow-minded side. If the World Cup offered a glimpse of what the game might become, it also showed some of what is holding it back. In Europe the game is being taken over, piece by piece, by the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/sep/10/cvc-ownership-f1-warning-premiership-rugby-union\" title=\"\">who were recently accused of \u201craping the sport\u201d of F1</a>. Let us see how those traditional values and this newfound drive to develop the game, this desire to prioritise player welfare, hold up in partnership with a firm whose biggest worry is the bottom line.</p> \n<p>In many ways the game has changed these last few weeks. This tournament could be the beginning of something. And in many others the game remains the same. It could also be its end.</p>",

England were never, have never been, better than they were on the weekend they beat the unbeatable All Blacks. It may turn out, when they finish their debrief, that they were still suffering from the hangover of that when they played South Africa. They would not be the first. New Zealand have lost four World Cup knock-out matches in the last 20 years now. None of the teams who beat them went on to win the final. It is one thing to persuade yourself the fabled All Black aura does not make any difference in the week before playing them but another really to believe it the week after, too, when you are sure you are already on top of the world. There are always new lessons, then, even for a wily old dog like Eddie Jones. As one of his young standout performers, Sam Underhill, said when he was asked if he had heard of the theory that you have to lose a World Cup final before you learn how to win one: \u201cNo, but I\u2019m a fan of it now\u201d. Even the English may agree that South Africa\u2019s victory was a fitting way to finish a tournament that was, after all, about opening the game to new audiences. It is easy to forget in the wash of it all what a risk World Rugby took by bringing their marquee tournament to Japan, where the game is \u2013 or was \u2013 a minority sport. There has been nothing quite like it since Fifa decided to hold the 1994 football World Cup in the US. And it has paid off. They filled almost every seat in every stadium and at the tournament\u2019s peak won an audience of 54.8m TV viewers in Japan alone. That was during Japan\u2019s game against Scotland at the end of the pool stages. It was one of those matches which meant more than can be conveyed in facts and figures like that, when the sport became about something much larger and more important than itself. It was the day after typhoon Hagibis had blown through and, around the country, they were still reckoning the damage. The official death toll was 24 when the match started, 28 when it finished. Days later it finally reached 89. Some of those deaths were just miles up the highway from the stadium. What was that match but a gesture of pride and defiance and togetherness? They were pumping floodwater out of the changing rooms on the morning of the game. One could hear the plain truth in Mandela\u2019s words then. And one could hear it again in the little town of Kamaishi, the smallest place to host a World Cup match, where they had built their new stadium on the site of the school that was swept away in the tsunami in 2011. There never was a town that seemed as happy to be hosting a match. It was, the manager of the local rugby team said, their way of thanking the world for its support after the disaster. They never did get to play the second game that was scheduled there. It was one of the three matches cancelled because of the typhoon. It would have been the biggest fixture of the tournament for the two teams who were due to play, Namibia and Canada. But instead they got on with helping the people who lived there clear up the damage. Rugby loves to talk about its values and there they were again for everyone to see in the footage of the Canadian players shovelling mud off the roads. It was a timely reminder of the best of the game because there was some of the worst on show too, in the backstage bickering between the unions about who was to blame for the cancelled matches. It was a flash of the sport\u2019s narrow-minded side. If the World Cup offered a glimpse of what the game might become, it also showed some of what is holding it back. In Europe the game is being taken over, piece by piece, by the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, who were recently accused of \u201craping the sport\u201d of F1. Let us see how those traditional values and this newfound drive to develop the game, this desire to prioritise player welfare, hold up in partnership with a firm whose biggest worry is the bottom line. In many ways the game has changed these last few weeks. This tournament could be the beginning of something. And in many others the game remains the same. It could also be its end.",

Jones\u2019s side surpassed expectations by reaching the final in Japan and temporarily returning to No 1 in the world rankings for the first time since 2004. They were comprehensively beaten by the Springboks, however, who gained the upper hand at the scrum after Kyle Sinckler was knocked out in the third minute and had to be replaced. England fielded the youngest World Cup team in the professional era in Saturday\u2019s final, with an average age of 27 years and 60 days, and players such as Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Maro Itoje are expected to form the backbone of the side at the next World Cup. Of the 31-man squad, only Dan Cole, Courtney Lawes, Ben Youngs, Mark Wilson and Willi Heinz are in their 30s but Jones is set to make changes for next year\u2019s Six Nations campaign and beyond.

His powers show no signs of waning, and it would be more of a surprise were he not to overhaul the German great\u2019s haul. \u201cLooking at my Dad\u2019s smile says it all,\u201d Hamilton says in his latest post-race TV interview. \u201cCloud nine doesn\u2019t get close to where I am.</p> <p>Today\u2019s race summed him up. Beginning from fifth on the grid, his competitive instincts put him within sniffing distance of the win he didn\u2019t even need, despite grid position and race strategy being against him. Bottas was excellent, though, and deserved the win in a race that ebbed and flowed and had plenty of sub-plots. </p> <p>Anyway, that\u2019s us wrapped up for the evening/afternoon. Thanks for your company and emails. Bye.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/dominant-lewis-hamilton-laps-of-honour-us-grand-prix\">Dominant Lewis Hamilton earned his laps of honour in US Grand Prix | Giles Richards</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T23:28:41.372Z\">at 11.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dbf44828f08c428d8935f68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T21:21:37.208Z\">9.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Expanding on that theme, Rosberg has tweeted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nico_rosberg/status/1191094863099551745\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Karting together who would have thought that we&#39;d both be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/F1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#F1</a> world champion one day.

We had a strong pace, the only thing I could focus on was to win, but it was not gong to be enough for the title. I wasn\u2019t quite sure which strategy was going to be the better one but my race was good, and we both had some traffic. Big congrats to Lewis, I\u2019ve failed on my own targets, but he deserves the title.</p> <p>A union flag clad <strong>Hamilton</strong> is approached now: \u201cIt was such a tough race today,\u201d he says. \u201cValtteri did a great job, didn\u2019t think the one-stop would be possible. I feel so much emotion, to my whole team here, the people back at the factory, I\u2019ve got my family here, my aunt from Trinidad. My dad told me when I was six or seven never to give up and that\u2019s kind of the family motto, I was hopeful I might win today but we didn\u2019t have it in the tyres unfortunately. As an athlete I feel as fresh as can be right now, and for these races remaining we won\u2019t let up now. Pleased for all the Brits and people with the UK flags supporting me here.</p> <p><strong>Verstappen</strong> is up next: \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out today \u2013 we did the best we could they were a bit faster today. For us it was a very good race, we had a decent pace, I tried to catch Lewis but that yellow flag on the back straight meant I couldn\u2019t use DRS so I might have come second.

In some respects this race feels like the equivalent of turning up on the final day of a series-deciding Test match, with the batting side 63 for 1 and needing only another 35 for victory. You know who\u2019s going to win, and probably how, but the the formalities, the celebrations and the sense of history still lure you through the gates.</p> <p>And it\u2019s quite the achievement Lewis Hamilton is on the cusp of: a sixth F1 world championship, which would put him second on the all-time list behind only Michael Schumacher, and a fifth in six years. His domination of this decade has been emphatic, backed by a champion team, and blessed by his adaptability, resilience and sheer talent.</p> <p>All he needs to do today is finish in the top eight, and he can finish outside it and still seal the title should his teammate Valtteri Bottas not win. The Finn is in pole, so must fancy his chances in this particular race, but it would be a major shock if his senior Mercedes teammate isn\u2019t celebrating tonight.</p> <p>None of this means today\u2019s race will lack spice. For one thing, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/31/red-bull-max-verstappen-lewis-hamilton-remark-mercedes\">verbal jousting</a> this week between Hamilton and Max Verstappen over the latter\u2019s aggressive style, and another near miss between the pair in qualifying yesterday, will make the contest between those two well worth watching. Especially as Hamilton will want to make his way through the field from fifth on the grid; his sparring partner Verstappen starts in third.</p> <p>These remaining races might also offer us into a glimpse into what the F1 world might look like whenever the Hamilton Supremacy finally ends. Charles Leclerc has had a lively first campaign, and the watchable Monagesque driver starts from fourth on the grid today, while another rookie, Alexander Albon, will also be one to watch. The Thai driver was sixth in qualifying yesterday.</p> <p>So in summary then, don\u2019t go anywhere. <strong>Lights out 7.10pm.</strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So, a lively old sporting weekend that began with that memorable Rugby World Cup triumph for South Africa over England draws to a close with a British sporting success for Lewis Hamilton once again, who as a six-time world champion is now one off Michael Schumacher\u2019s all-time record of seven titles. His powers show no signs of waning, and it would be more of a surprise were he not to overhaul the German great\u2019s haul. \u201cLooking at my Dad\u2019s smile says it all,\u201d Hamilton says in his latest post-race TV interview. \u201cCloud nine doesn\u2019t get close to where I am. Today\u2019s race summed him up. Beginning from fifth on the grid, his competitive instincts put him within sniffing distance of the win he didn\u2019t even need, despite grid position and race strategy being against him. Bottas was excellent, though, and deserved the win in a race that ebbed and flowed and had plenty of sub-plots. Anyway, that\u2019s us wrapped up for the evening/afternoon. Thanks for your company and emails. Bye. Expanding on that theme, Rosberg has tweeted: Anthony Hamilton is back for a post-race interview on his son\u2019s triumph: \u201cWho would ever have dreamed it?\u201d he beams. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really talk about the championship, every time we discuss things we talk just about the next race, and when opportunities like this come around to win the championship you have to think about these things a bit more. But he still wants to win, as you saw. I\u2019 m glad for Valtteri too as he had the pole. \u201cHe\u2019s pulled together a really fgood team of friends over the past four years, we have friends and family meetings and dinners, and that\u2019s all really good for him. His old sparring partner Nico Rosberg is now alongside him. \u201cJust a big congratulations to you Anthony because you have such a big part in his career,\u201d he tells Hamilton Sr, \u201cwe go back a long way back to when I was 13.\u201d Do you think he\u2019ll go to 2021, Rosberg asks him. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re feeling fit, you can keep going for as long as you can. When he was eight and we had no money, and he first got in his kart, we just said if you\u2019re gonna do this, you\u2019re gonna go for it properly.\u201d Our man in Austin, Tom Dart, has filed his race report: And here\u2019s a tribute to Hamilton by Johnny Herbert: 1 Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes+1:56 0 0 2 Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes 3 Max Verstappen, Red Bull 4 Charles Leclerc, Ferrari 5 Alexander Albon, Red Bull 6 56 0 0 6 Daniel Ricciardo. Renault 7 Lando Norris, McLaren 8 Carlos Sainz Jr, McLaren 9 Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Renault 10 Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso 11 Sergio P\u00e9rez, Racing Point 12 Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Alfa Romeo 13 Lance Stroll, Racing Point 14 Antonio Giovinazzi, Alfa Romeo 15 Romain Grosjean,Haas 16 George Russell, Williams DNF Pierre Gasly, Toro Rosso; Kevin Magnussen, Haas; Robert Kubica, Williams; Sebastian Vettel, Ferrari Bottas speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice win, feels good, I\u2019ve felt very good since yesterday in the car. We had a strong pace, the only thing I could focus on was to win, but it was not gong to be enough for the title. I wasn\u2019t quite sure which strategy was going to be the better one but my race was good, and we both had some traffic. Big congrats to Lewis, I\u2019ve failed on my own targets, but he deserves the title. A union flag clad Hamilton is approached now: \u201cIt was such a tough race today,\u201d he says. \u201cValtteri did a great job, didn\u2019t think the one-stop would be possible. I feel so much emotion, to my whole team here, the people back at the factory, I\u2019ve got my family here, my aunt from Trinidad. My dad told me when I was six or seven never to give up and that\u2019s kind of the family motto, I was hopeful I might win today but we didn\u2019t have it in the tyres unfortunately. As an athlete I feel as fresh as can be right now, and for these races remaining we won\u2019t let up now. Pleased for all the Brits and people with the UK flags supporting me here. Verstappen is up next: \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out today \u2013 we did the best we could they were a bit faster today. For us it was a very good race, we had a decent pace, I tried to catch Lewis but that yellow flag on the back straight meant I couldn\u2019t use DRS so I might have come second. Hamilton\u2019s very impressive, just doing phenomenally, with a great team behind him.\u201d Kvyatt\u2019s been given a five-second time penalty. The Mercedes hegemony just goes on and on, in car and in strategy, and Bottas\u2019s performance suggests a serious challenge next year. But Hamilton will take some dislodging, his status as an all-time great even more firmly cemented. \u201cWhat an incredible weekend, I can\u2019t believe it, thank you so much guys,\u201d trills Hamilton back at his team. And he performs some celebratory doughnuts in front of a whooping grandstand. Meanwhile, Kvyatt and Perez are under investigation for causing a collision on that closing lap. Title number six is won. \u201cGet in there Lewis, what a drive mate, that is it,\u201d Hamilton is told over the radio. There\u2019s no response, the commentators reckon on account of him bawling. But a word for Bottas \u2013 a tremendous win from pole, though he had to fight his way back to the front on several occasions. Lap 56/56 Verstappen almost looks as if he\u2019s trying to take on Hamilton at the start of the final lap but locks up. He closes the gap on the Briton to below a second, but it\u2019s too much of an ask. Bottas cruises ahead of both of them, he\u2019s driven brilliantly in a challenging, undulating race and deserves the win. AND TAKES IT. Lap 55/56 Magnusson skids onto the gravel and is out of the race, seemingly suffering from brake failure, which brings out the yellow flag. It\u2019s all done and dusted. Lap 54/56 Hamilton may not win this race, but his competitive approach to it, when he could have coasted, says everything about the qualities that have made him such a serial winner. He\u2019s 1.1sec behind Bottas with two laps remaining. Lap 53/56 Bottas is looking formidable now, 2/1sec ahead of Hamilton, with Verstappen closing in third, two seconds behind the champion-elect. Verstappen gets the go-ahead from his Red Bull team to attack that second place. Lap 52/56 Bottas retakes the lead! The Finn attacks on the straight now, and this time he has the power and moves ahead of Hamilton to his left. Exhilarating stuff. It\u2019s his race to lose now, and he has fresher tyres. Verstappen too is now only 3.4sec behind the lead now too. Lap 51/56 Hamilton hold off a Bottas attack! Bottas gets within DRS range but can he turn on the afterburners? Not quite, as Hamilton turns them on even more. Bottas takes him on on the corner, but Hamilton comes again, forcing his teammate wide and retaining his lead. He just won\u2019t tolerate being beaten. That\u2019s why he\u2019s champion. Lap 50/56 Bottas is almost \u2013 almost \u2013 within striking distance, but not quite yet. The lead\u2019s below a second now. Norris overhauls Gasly to move into eighth. Lap 49/56 Bottas has some more traffic to deal with, those middle-of-field runners themselves jostling fiercely for places and points, and he has 1.2sec to make up. Verstappen\u2019s closing too in third, 5.6sec further back Lap 48/56 How they stand: 1 Hamilton +1.45 2 Bottas +5.89 3 Verstappen +5.78 4 Leclerc +50.8 5 Albon 6 Ricciardo 7 Sainz 8 Gasly 9 Perez 10 Norris Lap 47/56 Leclerc, having not done a great deal, duly sets a fastest race lap on 45, as Bottas cuts Hamilton\u2019s lead to 1.8sec. This could yet be quite the finish. The Finn is told to go for it by his team, while Hamilton\u2019s fans are beginning to celebrate. Lap 46/56 Albon moves above Sainz into sixth to put another top-six finish in touching distance. Hamilton\u2019s lead is now 2.3sec \u2013 he\u2019s had 22 laps on these tyres. Will they hold out? Lap 45/56 Hamilton is now 11 laps away from that sixth world title. He still leads, though Bottas has shaven some more time off it, moving to within 3.2sec of his teammate. Verstappen is third, then Leclerc is way back in fourth and unlikely to cheer Ferrari up with a podium slot. Lap 44/56 Bottas is gaining on Hamilton, but not at a sufficient pace; if those tyres can last, the Briton\u2019s going to win the title with a top-of-the-podium finish. Bottas may be bogged down but he set a race fastest lap on lap 43. Hulkenberg, hunting points, cuts a corner in a duel with Raikkonen and overhauls him to move into 11th. The stewards might have a look, mind. Lap 43/56 Bottas still can\u2019t quite get within striking distance of Hamilton, Raikkonen and Perez offering further traffic obstruction, and these problelms tend to be striking on the high-speed sections of the track. Kubica\u2019s retirement was prompted by a hydraulic problem, by the way. He\u2019s one of two drivers to retire today, alongside Vettel. Lap 42/56 Hamilton is offered the option for another stop, having complained again about his tyres; how\u2019s he going to call it? The title\u2019s surely his, now it\u2019s just about the win. He leads by 4.3sec from Bottas. Verstappen is third, a slightly becalmed Leclerc fourth, Ricciardo fifth, Norris sixth. Lap 41/56 Hamilton registers further anxiety about his tyres, though with 60% performance at the front and 70% at the rear, he should in theory be able to stay out. Lap 40/56 Hulkenburg forces Kvyatt wide and onto the gravel, moving a head of him into 12th. Then both pit, having had their fun. Bottas has now got clear of that bothersome traffic, and has daylight to Hamilton, who\u2019s now only 4.6sec ahead of him. Verstappen, in third, is now dealing with the same congestion that was bothering Bottas. Lap 39/56 Bottas continues to purr, but he\u2019s got some back-field traffic between him and Hamilton to make his way through. The lead is 5.8sec now. Lap 38/56 Bottas has eaten two seconds into Hamilton\u2019s lead in the past two laps. Verstappen, in third, is told he needs to take eight tenths of a second per lap off Hamilton to win \u2013 it\u2019s doable, but not easy. And he\u2019s not torn up trees in this race, Verstappen, despite his strong starting position. Lap 37/56 So to recap, Hamilton leads by 7.5sec, having pitted once, from Bottas, who\u2019s been in twice, and Verstappen, six seconds further back having also stopped twice. Bottas sets a fastest lap of the race though, and is going for the win here. Lap 36/56 Hamilton now leads, but he\u2019s reportedly just beginning to question his tyres, so he and Mercedes face a judgment call on how to handle this race. Will he pit again? Or is he bluffing? Ricciardo is facing a battle for fifth from the improving Albon, whom I was clearly right to praise earlier. Lap 35/56 Verstappen goes into the pits, having struggled with his tyres in the previous couple of laps, switching onto medium tyres. The Red Bull man is down to third as he comes out, so we currently are back to a one-two for Mercedes scenario again. Bottas is pitting now too, for the same tyres. Lap 34/56 Bottas has a poor lap, getting caught in traffic at the back of the field, particularly around turn 12, trying to lap Magnussen. His lead is down to just over six seconds. Lap 33/56 A how-they-stand recap: 1 Bottas +7.4sec, 2 Verstappen +5.72 3 Hamilton, 4 Leclerc, 5 Ricciardo. Kubica retires from the race, having been bringing up the rear in 20th. Lap 32/56 Albon\u2019s moving nicely through the field again after his early problems forced a premature put stop. He overhauls Sainz to move into seventh place. Bottas still leads from Verstappen and Hamilton, who also has the fastest lap, which means he can finish ninth and still win the title, if that record stands to the end of the race. Lap 31/56 \u201cWhy does Mercedes work to give Hamilton a one stop race, and not Bottas?\u201d asks Susan Preston. \u201cIs Hamilton the only driver able to do it? And doesn\u2019t Bottas get annoyed by the preferential treatment of Hamilton?\u201d Lap 30/56 It\u2019s as bumpy as an austerity-ravaged cul-de-sac on turn two, which will mitigate against risks at that part of the track. Meanwhile, further back Perez regains some ground with a fine manouevre on turn 15 to move ahead of Kvyatt and Stroll back into 12th. Bottas stretches his lead to 6.9sec over Verstappen, who\u2019s labouring a touch. Lap 29/56 Hamilton duly heeds the advice and drops the pace a tad, staying around the 1.39 mark to stay third and 11.7sec behind the leader, Bottas. Verstappen is holding steady in second. Lap 28/56 In the middle of the field, Hulkenberg\u2019s one-stop strategy is beginning to labour, as he\u2019s passed by Gasly and Albon who move into eighth and ninth respectively. Lap 27/56 A swift Hamilton lap 26 tooka 2.7sec chunk out of Bottas\u2019s lead there. Hamilton\u2019s now told \u201cIt\u2019s critical we make the one-stop plan work\u201d, cautioning him perhaps about not burning the speed too excessively right now. Lap 26/56 Here\u2019s the latest scores on the doors then. Bottas leads by five seconds from Verstappen, with Hamilton eight seconds further back in third. Leclerc is fourth, 24 seconds off the lead, with Ricciardo fifth. Hard to call, this, it really is. Lap 25/56 Hamilton comes out of the pit lane in third, and will want to go the distance on these tyres now. Vettel is speaking from trackside about his calamitosu race. He said he felt \u201cno contact, wanted to go through the footage. I had a really poor grip, struggled to get the tyres to work, had a poor feeling with the car straight away. I was just about settling into a rhythm and the the suspension failed.\u201d Lap 24/56 Bottas attacks Hamilton, having got the nod from his team, and he retakes the lead. And this time Hamilton DOES pit. Lap 23/56 Ricciardo takes on Perez and wins, moving into sixth and continuing an impressive drive in upper midfield. Hamilton\u2019s called into the pit but is having none of it. \u201cI want to go longer,\u201d he says. That\u2019s thrown a few plans. Lap 22/56 A bit of data boffinry on screen shows impressive tyre performance from Hamilton, who maintains a lead from Bottas but it\u2019s down to 1.3sec. Leclerc moves up above Hulkenberg and Perez into fourth. Lap 21/56 Leclerc goes into the pits, and is a little tardy with it, coming out in sixth. Hamilton leads by 4.1sec from Bottas, who has pitted. Verstappen is third Lap 20/56 Hamilton has been told by his team that they expect Bottas and Verstappen to go for a two-stop race, though the Briton is losing around two seconds a lap to Bottas at the moment. Norris and Gasly pit \u2013 it looks like we\u2019re looking a lot of two-stop races here. Lap 19/56 Verstappen\u2019s losing a second a lap at the moment to Bottas, as the cards continue to fall Mercedes\u2019 way. The Red Bull man may need to stop again. Sainz and Magnusson pit. Lap 18/56 Right, time for an update after all these comings and goings: Here\u2019s how they stand - 1 Hamilton 2 Bottas 3 Verstappen 4 Leclerc 5 Ricciardo 6 Norris 7 Gasly 8 Sainz 9 Raikkonen 10 Hulkenberg. Giovinazzi pits Lap 17/56 Bottas set a newfastest lap for the race on lap 16 by the way, as Hamilton has his one-stop strategy confirmed by his team. Meanwhile Albon\u2019s been told by his team that they\u2019ve spotted some damage to the car, and he\u2019s struggling back down in 13th, having lost six places since the start. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have bigged him up in my preamble. Lap 16/56 Bottas effortlessly passes Leclerc on the corner to move into second. That looked almost too easy, though Leclerc might have been chancing it had he fought that one too hard. Hamilton still leads. Lap 15/56 Bottas comes out of the pits in third, behind Leclerc, who\u2019s not looked too threatening but is now in second. Hamilton leads. That title\u2019s within sniffing distance. Verstappen is fourth, but still very much in contention here \u2013 that pit stop looks to have benefited him. Lap 14/56 Verstappen comes back out on fourth, posing Mercedes the question of whether to pit Bottas, which they do. Lap 13/56 Verstappen comes into the pits, as soon as the pit window opens, and hard tyres go on for medium. So it\u2019s a Mercedes one-two at the moment. There\u2019s some speculation that the damage was done to Vettel\u2019s car on turn eight before he veered off after turn nine. Lap 12/56 Verstappen is struggling to get much from his tyres here and has Hamilton closing on him - he\u2019s within DRS range of Verstappen, who\u2019s been complaining about his car. Lap 11/56 Vettel is out of the race. That suspension failure has ended his involvement in this grand prix, his first DNF here. Towards the back, Perez takes advantage of a Giovinazzi lock-up at turn 12 to sneak ahead of him into 14th Lap 10/56 A tasty little duel between Kvyatt and Magnusson sees the former overhaul the latter to move into 11th. Further up, Hamilton\u2019s starting to gain on Verstappen. As Bottas\u2019s lead moves over two seconds. Could we be headed for a Mercedes one-two here? Lap 9/56 Vettel\u2019s considerate parking after his mini-accident has prevented the emergency safety car from being deployed at least, so fair play to him for that. Anyway, out front it\u2019s 1 Bottas, 2 Versappen, 3 Hamilton, 4 Leclerc, 5 Ricciardo, 6 Norris. The top three in particular look serene while it\u2019s all a bit frenetic and fractious behind them. Lap 8/56 More woe for Vettel - his rear suspension has gone, and he slides off the track. Have the track bumps done for him? He\u2019s having an absolute nightmare here, and he\u2019s becalmed at trackside. Ricciardo passes Norris and moves into fifth. Lap 7/56 Albon\u2019s had a warning for exceeding track limits on turn 19. Three of those and he\u2019s out. Lap 6/56 Lando Norris has done well to move up to fifth, but there\u2019s a fair old gap in front of him to the top four, where Leclerc\u2019s still hanging in there. Ferrari tell Leclerc \u201cwe are going for plan B, and you need to close the gap to Hamilton.\u201d Lap 5/56 So, Bottas leads by 1.8sec from Verstappen who\u2019s 1.5sec ahead of Hamilton, as things begin to settle down. The junior Mercedes man is looking good. Lap 4/56 No further action will be taken over the Albon-Sainz clash. Looking back at the start, that was a masterful start by Hamilton, going round the outside to overhaul Leclerc. Ferrari say they can see the massive understeer Vettel\u2019s reporting but they don\u2019t have explanations for his grip problems. Wonder when he\u2019ll pit. Lap 3/56 Sainz and Albon are under investigation by the stewards over that first-turn collision. There\u2019s plenty of movement in pecking orders here - Raikkonen has gained six places since the start, and he\u2019s up to 11th. Bottas leads by 1.3sec from Verstappen, with Hamilton third. Lap 2/56 Vettel is complaining of damage. Another who\u2019s had some, Albon, is already coming into the pits, having been squeezed by Sainz and veering off the track. But the top two look unscathed \u2013 Bottas leads from Verstappen, with Hamilton in third. Vettel has also been overtaken by Ricciardo, leaving the German in seventh. Lap 1/56 \u2026 and away we go. The front runners get away well and Bottas comes out on top, but Albon and Sainz veer off and make contact, but return to the track. Then Hamilton MAKES GROUND ALREADY, he passes Leclerc and Vettel, Norris moves ahead of Ricciardo. Vettel\u2019s struggling already. Ferrari do not seem to have fired their tyres up, Leclerc is fourth and Vettel sixth. The general sense is that drivers will opt for a one-stop strategy, with the top five on the grid all on medium tyres. \u201cI have a bad feeling Lewis might suffer reliability issues today. Law of averages and all that,\u201d emails James Roe. Perhaps it\u2019s been that kind of sporting weekend for fans of English sportsmen, but I think he\u2019ll be Ok. It\u2019s a sharp, demanding start, a short uphill to turn one. And they\u2019re getting ready for the formation lap. More news on that Verstappen car bother: Red Bull officials confirm it had a hairline crack on the wing, but they got permission to change it, and it\u2019s \u201call done and dusted\u201d. A snatched chat with the man in pole, Valtteri Bottas: \u201cI feel a lot of pressure, the start will obviously be one of the key points of the race, that\u2019s the first thing I\u2019ll be focusing on. If I can come out of that in front, it\u2019ll be an interesting race.\u201d Verstappen\u2019s needing to replace a rear wing, with Red Bull engineers scurrying around his car, as Sky\u2019s Martin Brundle sets off on his grid walk, stopping for a jabber with the actor Matthew McConaughy, who casually remarks that he had dinner with Hamilton last night. \u201cWe could see something special today,\u201d he says. And Hamilton\u2019s dad, Anthony, is in and among it. \u201cI got the call [to come to the race]. he says, \u201c\u2018Dad you need to be here,\u2019 so the whole family are here en masse. It\u2019s unreal, we can\u2019t believe we are where we are, and what\u2019s happened to us. It feels like the first year in formula one every year.\u201d Track details: there are 56 laps in the USA Grand Prix, and the Circuit of the Americas\u2019 lap distance, across 20 turns, is 5.513km. The lap record is 1:37.392, set last year by none other than Lewis Hamilton, though he only came third here last year, behind Kimi Raikkonen and Max Verstappen \u201cHi from turn 4,\u201d chirps Kevin, by email, \u201cSurrounded here by fans from all over the world. Lots of cowboy boots in attendance too. I came from relatively nearby Boston. Looking fwd to a great race. Conditions are .... perfect.\u201d Yes, it looks a scorcher. It\u2019s a sell-out at the Circuit of the Americas, despite the fixture clash with the Nascar weekend up the road at the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Whether the additional carrot of live pop in the evening from Imagine Dragons and Pink is a moot point, but there should be enough glamour on the track anyhow. Get the party started. And those driver championship standings: 1 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 363pts 2 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP 289 3 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 236 4 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 230 5 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 220 6 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 77 7 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 76 8 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 74 9 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 43 10 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 38 How they line up on the grid: 1 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 2 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 3 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 4 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 5 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes 6 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 7 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 8 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren 9 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 10 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 11 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 12 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas 13 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Scuderia Toro Rosso 14 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 15 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas 16 Antonio Giovinazzi (Ita) Alfa Romeo Racing 17 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo Racing 18 George Russell (Gbr) Williams 19 Sergio P\u00e9rez (Mex) Racing Point 20 Robert Kubica (Pol) Williams Evening/afternoon everyone. In some respects this race feels like the equivalent of turning up on the final day of a series-deciding Test match, with the batting side 63 for 1 and needing only another 35 for victory. You know who\u2019s going to win, and probably how, but the the formalities, the celebrations and the sense of history still lure you through the gates. And it\u2019s quite the achievement Lewis Hamilton is on the cusp of: a sixth F1 world championship, which would put him second on the all-time list behind only Michael Schumacher, and a fifth in six years. His domination of this decade has been emphatic, backed by a champion team, and blessed by his adaptability, resilience and sheer talent. All he needs to do today is finish in the top eight, and he can finish outside it and still seal the title should his teammate Valtteri Bottas not win. The Finn is in pole, so must fancy his chances in this particular race, but it would be a major shock if his senior Mercedes teammate isn\u2019t celebrating tonight. None of this means today\u2019s race will lack spice. For one thing, the verbal jousting this week between Hamilton and Max Verstappen over the latter\u2019s aggressive style, and another near miss between the pair in qualifying yesterday, will make the contest between those two well worth watching. Especially as Hamilton will want to make his way through the field from fifth on the grid; his sparring partner Verstappen starts in third. These remaining races might also offer us into a glimpse into what the F1 world might look like whenever the Hamilton Supremacy finally ends. Charles Leclerc has had a lively first campaign, and the watchable Monagesque driver starts from fourth on the grid today, while another rookie, Alexander Albon, will also be one to watch. The Thai driver was sixth in qualifying yesterday. So in summary then, don\u2019t go anywhere. Lights out 7.10pm.",

Not scale, massed and in the open; instead it is scale, atomised and to a large extent operating in the dark. Not Beaverbrook, but Facebook. In social media during election campaigns, political players operate as individuals, as parties, through proxies (overt and covert), and as precision advertisers armed with unknown quantities of highly specific personal data about voters. The past always teaches something, but on the whole, broadcasting regulation as we have known it seems to have very little to contribute to a widely shared and pressing problem: how to create a framework that ensures that both free and fair elections and freedom of expression thrive in our strange new communications environment. \u2022 Paul Chadwick is the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor",

Suspension woes forced Vettel out of the race on lap eight.</p> \n<p>The afternoon soon settled into a three-way tussle between Bottas, Hamilton and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Hamilton was on a one-stop strategy, with Bottas and Verstappen adopting two-stop tactics, making the outcome hard to predict.</p> \n<p>Hamilton enjoyed a roughly three-second advantage entering the final 10 laps of the 56-lap race but Bottas was steadily gaining ground on fresher tyres and he overtook his teammate on lap 52.

But I feel like I\u2019ve got the best tools now, up to this point at least,\u201d he said. Hamilton paid tribute to Niki Lauda, the three-time champion who acted as an advisor to Mercedes. He died in May aged 70. \u201cIt\u2019s been the hardest year for us as a team. We lost Niki this year, a real crucial and pivotal member of our team,\u201d Hamilton said. Despite his unassailable lead in the standings with two races still to come, Hamilton has won only two of the past seven races after eight victories in the first 12. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real challenge, the second half of the season. It\u2019s been the toughest second half of the season I think we\u2019ve had as a team,\u201d he said, paying tribute to his Mercedes squad for \u201cout-thinking\u201d Ferrari, who arguably had advantages in power and straight-line speed. One minor blemish is the relative lack of pole positions \u2013 four so far compared with 11 in 2018 \u2013 though Hamilton said that, while he has not dominated in qualifying, he has at least been consistent. \u201cOtherwise I think it\u2019s been the best performing year,\u201d he said. Only his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, could have delayed the date of Hamilton\u2019s coronation, so it was fitting that the two fought hard for first place in Austin, duelling in the closing stages as Bottas successfully chased down the Briton. Bottas, second in the standings, had to win from pole and hope Hamilton finished outside the top eight at a venue where he habitually excels. The 30-year-old Finn did what was required but so did Hamilton, with a solid, composed and determined drive on a bumpy surface. The result was especially impressive given that he started in fifth but he rose to third before the end of the first lap, surging past the struggling Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc. Suspension woes forced Vettel out of the race on lap eight. The afternoon soon settled into a three-way tussle between Bottas, Hamilton and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Hamilton was on a one-stop strategy, with Bottas and Verstappen adopting two-stop tactics, making the outcome hard to predict. Hamilton enjoyed a roughly three-second advantage entering the final 10 laps of the 56-lap race but Bottas was steadily gaining ground on fresher tyres and he overtook his teammate on lap 52. Hamilton had just enough left to hold off Verstappen in the final stages. The inevitable question now is whether he can catch Schumacher. \u201cI\u2019ve always said to you that reaching Michael never was a target for me. I\u2019m not really one that thinks of records and those kind of things. I definitely had thought that getting anywhere near Michael was just so far-fetched,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that I have the ability to continue to grow and to do more with this team.\u201d Rather than look too far into the future, Hamilton preferred to cast his mind back to the past. He recalled sitting at home with his father, Anthony, watching races on television and eating bacon sandwiches. Anthony was in the cheering crowd beneath the podium after this race, standing next to the cowboy-hatted Texan actor, Matthew McConaughey, who gave Hamilton a hearty hug. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond surreal, that my life journey has brought me to this point in winning the sixth title. I don\u2019t really know how I\u2019m supposed to feel,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the whole Cloud Nine thing but I\u2019m flying super high right now.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 4 November.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Ash Barty has concluded a stellar 2019 by winning the WTA finals trophy</strong> and landing a $6.4m cheque after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/nov/03/tennis-wta-finals-ashleigh-barty-v-elina-svitolina-final-live\">beating the defending champion Elina Svitolina 6-4, 6-3</a>. It was the sixth meeting between the two, with the Ukrainian having won all previous encounters. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been a year that just hasn\u2019t stopped. It\u2019s been a year of incredible ups and downs \u2013 I think more ups than downs,\u201d a relieved Barty said post-match. The 23-year-old started the year ranked 15th<sup> </sup>in the world, but won her first grand slam at the French Open, before becoming just the second Australian woman after Evonne Goolagong Cawley to be crowned World No 1.</p> \n<p><strong>Labor has set an 11 November deadline for </strong><strong>Greg Hunt to commit to a \u201csignificant package\u201d for aged care</strong>, after a scathing report by the royal commission into the sector highlighted \u201catrocious\u201d behaviour towards older Australians. The report called for urgent funding for home care packages, action on chemical restraints used in nursing homes and the removal of disabled young people from aged care facilities. With a home care wait list of 120,000 it has been suggested that it might need a commitment of $2.5bn to address, a figure the health minister has not confirmed.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 4 November. Top stories Ash Barty has concluded a stellar 2019 by winning the WTA finals trophy and landing a $6.4m cheque after beating the defending champion Elina Svitolina 6-4, 6-3. It was the sixth meeting between the two, with the Ukrainian having won all previous encounters. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been a year that just hasn\u2019t stopped. It\u2019s been a year of incredible ups and downs \u2013 I think more ups than downs,\u201d a relieved Barty said post-match. The 23-year-old started the year ranked 15th in the world, but won her first grand slam at the French Open, before becoming just the second Australian woman after Evonne Goolagong Cawley to be crowned World No 1. Labor has set an 11 November deadline for Greg Hunt to commit to a \u201csignificant package\u201d for aged care, after a scathing report by the royal commission into the sector highlighted \u201catrocious\u201d behaviour towards older Australians. The report called for urgent funding for home care packages, action on chemical restraints used in nursing homes and the removal of disabled young people from aged care facilities. With a home care wait list of 120,000 it has been suggested that it might need a commitment of $2.5bn to address, a figure the health minister has not confirmed. He has promised \u201cstronger action\u201d on the issue of chemical restraints but suggested \u201cageism\u201d in Australian society is bigger than just a governmental issue. Boris Johnson has apologised to Tory party members for failing to exit the EU on 31 October, having repeatedly claimed he\u2019d rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than request another extension. Britain\u2019s PM said it was with \u201cdeep regret\u201d that Brexit did not occur, but blamed parliament\u2019s passing of what he called \u201cthe surrender act\u201d for failing to keep his promise. He also said Donald Trump was \u201cpatently in error\u201d for claiming the terms of Johnson\u2019s proposed Brexit deal would prevent an US-UK trade agreement. Australia The NSW police watchdog only fully investigated 2% of complaints levelled against officers, citing cuts to its operational budget for its failure to complete more than 2,547 initial investigations. \u201cOur budget position is challenging,\u201d wrote the commissioner, Michael Adams. One of Treasury\u2019s senior executives is facing internal investigation and has been removed from updated organisational charts, Guardian Australia has ascertained. The department has not confirmed the nature of the investigation against the employee. A 22-year-old man has appeared in court in Melbourne charged with the murder of his seven-week-old baby. The man from regional Victoria handed himself in and did not apply for bail. The world The man accused of the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane near Auckland one year ago will stand trial this week. The death prompted an emotional public statement from Jacinda Ardern and an outpouring of grief around NZ. Greta Thunberg has been caught the wrong side of an ocean after Chile cancelled its hosting of the COP25 climate summit, with the teenager asking on social media for a lift via sustainable transport \u201chalf around the world\u201d to the new location, in Spain. Pollution almost 400 times the amount deemed healthy has prompted 30 plane diversions away from Delhi, with schools closed, construction work halted and the government planning to hand out 5 million face masks. A Conservative candidate in a key marginal seat in the forthcoming UK general election is facing a strong backlash, after confirming online comments in which she suggested people seeking benefits should be \u201cput down\u201d. Recommended reads Animal rights activists want it stopped, the racing industry wants it to flourish, but ahead of the \u201crace that stops the nation\u201d are there changes to horse racing that might please both? Calla Wahlquist offers five immediate improvements. The six-time winning Melbourne Cup owner Lloyd Williams supports the banning of whips, while several states have banned jumps racing completely. No racing for under two-year olds, a national horse traceability register and a ban of tongue ties could also help the sport. On the outskirts of south-western Brisbane a discovery sent twitchers into a frenzy: two regent honeyeaters, a critically endangered species, had been discovered feeding on ironbark blossoms. For keen onlookers like Andrew Stafford, it was a rare occurence for a bird described in the 1980s as \u201cfairly common\u201d. \u201cThey are an eye-popping treat, with their chainmail breastplate and wings intricately embroidered in black and sulphur-yellow.\u201d But with land clearance threatening their ever-diminishing habitats the regent honeyeater could yet disappear from right in front of us. For the Australian crime writer Gary Disher book signings are a mix of delight and trepidation. Berated by elderly psychiatrists, constantly asked \u201cHow can you write about such terrible things\u201d or worst of all \u2013 ignored entirely while long queues snake out the door for Ian Rankin. \u201cShould I have to account for myself?

After decades of tourists climbing the rock, and months of hysteria over the closure of the climb, what does the future hold for Uluru? In this episode of Full Story Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, describes the scenes on the ground as the climb closed, and we hear from the Anangu people about the future of this sacred place. Sport A-League visa signings are the players expected to elevate the competition and delight fans, but four rounds in, the imports of many clubs are proved mixed successes. The first Victory-Western United derby proved one such contrast. The All Blacks may still be reeling from a shock Rugby World Cup third-place finish but a new coach is just one of many worries facing New Zealand rugby, writes Matt McILraith, with age group issues and declining Super Rugby attendances looming. Media roundup More than $6.3bn a year is received by pensioners in $1m-plus homes, reports the Australian, according to a landmark review by academics at ANU, with the federal government spending more than $50bn a year on the pension.

The shambles of Halloween Week is but a distant memory, and all eyes are on the next big milestone \u2013 the Blackpool Tower Ballroom in two weeks\u2019 time. Are you excited? I\u2019m excited. </p> <p>Sadly we\u2019ve had to say goodbye to Will Bailey this week, who hasn\u2019t recovered from the knee injury he sustained in training last week. A real shame for him and Janette, but hopefully we\u2019ll see Will back for a Christmas special one year; he was a real highlight of this year\u2019s show. The most likely scenario is that the show will continue as normal, with just three couples in the Final; it\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in previous years when a celebrity has left. </p> <p>A quick update to Heidi\u2019s Hunches below \u2013 if there are only three couples in the final, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me one bit if it was Kelvin, Michelle and Karim; what\u2019s more interesting is whether Alex or Saffron can mount a series challenge and unseat one of the Big Three. I\u2019ve also moved Chris and Karen out of the danger zone \u2013 they\u2019ve got Couple\u2019s Choice this evening, which seems to be a get out of jail free card. </p> <p><strong>Group 1: one eye on the final </strong>\u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy</p> <p><strong>Group 2: hot on their heel leads</strong> \u2013 Alex and Neil, Saffron and AJ</p> <p><strong>Group 3: battling for Blackpool </strong>\u2013 Emma B and Anton, Chris and Karen</p> <p><strong>Group 4: dodging the dance-off </strong>\u2013 Mike and Katya, Emma W and Aljaz</p> <p>Kick off tonight is at 7pm, so grab snacks, booze and loved ones and make yourselves comfy. The comment box is open for your wit and wisdom, so get stuck in. See you then!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-02T18:29:04.237Z\">at 6.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

So that\u2019s it for another show \u2013 shall we do it all again next week? Kick off is at 6.50pm, so join me then. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you fancy giving me a wave \u2013 thank you as ever for joining in with your joyous comment box contributions. Have a great week, and keep dancing! Hx Emma is genuinely distraught. I think she might have been a little bit in love with Aljaz, and who can blame her? He may well be the nicest man on the planet, and I can also confijrm he smells DIVINE. All the judges vote to save Mike and Katya, which means Emma and Aljaz are leaving the Strictly dancefloor. I\u2019m always sad to see Aljaz go, but Emma\u2019s struggle with Latin was always going to make it hard for her to progress in the competition. With Will also leaving this week, at least Aljaz and Janette get to spend quality couple time together. Dance off time! Emma and Aljaz are up first, still dancing the the world\u2019s most ladylike Samba. A couple of sambucas would not have gone amiss \u2013 if anything this is even more lacklustre than last night. Time for Mike\u2019s Charleston \u2013 his feet still point inwards on the swivel and the lifts are still perilous, but none of these things seemed to matter last night so there\u2019s no reason to suspect they will now. So who else is safely through to pre-Blackpool? Alex and Kevin/Neil are safe, along with Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni and Saffron and AJ! Which means Emma and Aljaz are joining Mike and Katya in tonight\u2019s dance off. Based on last night\u2019s scores, it\u2019s likely that Emma will be heading back to scrubbing rhinos at Longleat and Mike will continue to prove harder to get rid of than a Scottish ten pound note in Norwich. Motsi\u2019s dress looks like the google result for \u2018sexy Halloween mummy costume\u2019. She is accompanied by some Aljaz/Luba barefoot contempo-waft, alongside a routine from Johannes and Graziano - the first time a same-sex individual pair has been featured on Strictly. It\u2019s a lovely thing to see, and will hopefully demonstrate to certain corners of the press that the world will not end if two men touch each other on the BBC\u2019s flagship show. Well that was gorgeous and uplifting. I know we were all sad about Johannes leaving last week, but in the immortal words of Maria Von Trapp, when god closes a door, somewhere he opens a window. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of singer/songwriter and Strictly stalwart Emili Sande, who is singing her single \u2018Shine\u2019. If you ever need a party game, try saying all of that with a mouthful of Maltesers. So who is safely through to next week? Chris and Karen are safe, along with Emma and Anton (OOOH) and Karim and Amy. First couple in the bottom two: MIKE AND KATYA. So the public saved Emma and Anton, no doubt due to the judges being a bit harsh on Emma for choreography that really wasn\u2019t her fault. Meanwhile Mike and Katya were 6th (out of 9) on the leaderboard, so it seems the public weren\u2019t nearly as keen on his Charleston as the judges were. Last night on Strictly: Karim and Amy smashing the Quickstep, a fun and charming Foxtrot from Alex and not-Neil, plus the usual array of overmarking and undermarking that gives us something to chunter about. I suspect we\u2019ll be saying goodbye to one of the Emmas this evening, but couldn\u2019t tell you which one. Not sure I want to watch either again, to be honest. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in yet another high-necked roasting bag, Claudia looking rather fabulous in sparkly red and white. Tonight\u2019s pro dance features a medley of Elton John songs, kicking off with Aljaz looking resplendent in a couple of dead swans. There\u2019s a LOT of polyester in this routine. And we\u2019re off! Every time I watch these credits I\u2019m surprised to see James Cracknell. Had completely forgotten he was on this show. Incidentally, if you missed the Countryfile Casual Weather earlier, it was the lovely Sarah Keith-Lucas in a frock that wouldn\u2019t look out of place at one of Emma Longleat\u2019s garden parties. Not so much as a casual cardigan, she clearly didn\u2019t get the memo. I miss the gentle meanderings of pre-Strictly Countryfile. Attenborough is amazing, but there\u2019s too much clifftop peril and furry death for Sunday teatime. I want chat about orchard management and pig husbandry in Sussex. Maybe a short interlude where people with beards weave stuff out of twigs. Craven hawking a calendar like he\u2019s got a target to hit before his annual performance review. Evening all, and welcome back for tonight\u2019s Strictly Results Show! Last night was another Strictly rollercoaster of twists and turns, from \u2018ooh that was worth a nine\u2019 to \u2018why was that worth a nine?\u2019. I\u2019ve given up trying to work out the judges\u2019 rationale, it seems to vary from week to week. That way madness lies, so I\u2019m inclined to just enjoy the ride. Tonight we another couple into the Strictly sunset \u2013 the leaderboard suggests it will be a battle of the Emmas, but it\u2019s been somewhat unpredictable of late. Kick off is at 7.15pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! I\u2019ll be back here at 7.15pm tomorrow for the Results Show, so join me then. Thank you as ever for joining in and being amazing, enjoy the rest of your Saturday and never return to a lit firework. Until tomorrow! Hx So that\u2019s it for the dancing, and the voting is open! Karim and Amy are at the top of the leader board, with Emma and Anton at the bottom \u2013 if you want further details, can confirm that everyone else was somewhere in between. My faves this evening were definitely Kelvin and Oti and Alex and Kevin, we could well be lining up for both Emmas in the dance-off tomorrow, who do you think will go? Scores: 7,7,8,8 \u2013 a total of 30 for Mike and Katya. I mean, sure. Why not. Shirley loved the energy, but there were a few mistakes. Bruno thought it was cheeky and charming and Mike sold it like a showman, but lots of errors. Craig agrees on the timing, but he loved the musical comedy. Motsi thought it lost energy but it was a lot of fun. This is a masterclass in Charleston slapstick and characterisation, which Mike is very good at. However it\u2019s stompy, lacks swivel, has turned in feet (DRINK), and has quite a few mistakes and timing issues. Who knows if the judges will notice? And finally this evening it\u2019s MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines\u2019 by the Ron Goodwin Orchestra. Has Mike really not done a Charleston yet? I feel like every week has been a Charleston. Scores: 5,6,5,6 \u2013 a total of 22 for Emma and Anton. Bit harsh, I think. Motsi wants Emma to keep pushing, she can see her potential. Shirley thought the timing was completely off \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if it was Emma\u2019s fault or Anton\u2019s choreography. Anton chunters on over Shirley, which won\u2019t win him any votes in the dance-off. Bruno thought it lacked perpetual Cuban motion but Emma gave it a good go. Craig wasn\u2019t keen on the free arm placement, but the leg extension and storytelling were great. Emma looks glorious with a fringe, it really suits her. Some nice foot placement and leg action in this Rumba, which is a good distraction from Anton\u2019s Bruce Forsyth sexy time face. A really good effort, quite enjoyed that. Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! This week they\u2019re dancing the Rumba to \u2018Woman In Love\u2019 by Barbra Streisand. Emma implied last week that this was going to be quite hot, which leaves me quite torn \u2013 I love a filthy Rumba, but not necessarily if it involves a snake-hipped Anton. Scores: 8, 9,9,8 \u2013 a total of 34 for Chris and Karen. I\u2019ve entered a parallel universe, and I do not like it. Loving the sparkly bucket hats, but that\u2019s really the highlight of this routine for me. It\u2019s great fun, but if you\u2019re going to dance street you need the moves. And if you don\u2019t have the moves, at least dance in time. It\u2019s a no from me. Craig thought that was sick, and I think he means it in a good way. Motsi thought it was Chris\u2019s best dance, and Shirley thought it was so entertaining, they looked like actual street dancers. Bruno thought they were almost right on time. Am I drunk? Couple\u2019s Choice alert, it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN: This week they\u2019re dancing a Street/Commercial routine to \u2018Let\u2019s Get Ready to Rhumble\u2019 by PJ and Duncan. A brief history lesson for those of your who don\u2019t remember 1994 - before Ant &amp; Dec were the biggest thing on TV, there was Byker Grove, baggy jeans, floppy hair and so many lyrics they were frightened to use \u2018em. I highly recommend the video on Youtube when you have a minute, it\u2019s the most 1990s thing you will ever see. Chris\u2019s mum and dad! DRINK! Chris\u2019s wife and adorable son! DRINK! Scores: 7,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 31 for Alex and Kevin. Bruno is loving to see how Alex is growing in confidence, but she needs to work on her musical phrasing. Craig thought we saw Alex for the first time this evening, and this accidental partnership is working wonders (poor Neil). Motsi loved the quality of the movement, Alex just needs to work on her consistency. Shirley is enjoying the artistry and footwork, I missed the end of that critique because I accidentally changed channels whilst reaching for an oven chip. Alex\u2019s red dress is one of the most fabulous I\u2019ve seen in a while, and this American Smooth has bags of cheeky charm and style. Sad that Neil can\u2019t dance this week, but Kevin is doing him proud and there\u2019s a lovely chemistry here considering they\u2019ve been thrown together since last week. It\u2019s a little untidy in places, but Alex is the Journey of the series for me \u2013 what a transformation. Next up it\u2019s ALEX AND KEVIN! Neil is still injured, so Kevin is stepping in for another week. Judging by the comments on Instagram, this appears to have upset a great many people who have far too much time on their hands. Anyway, this week Alex and Kevin are dancing the American Smooth to \u2018Ain\u2019t No Mountain High Enough\u2019 by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. I\u2019d have preferred the one about how the world is just a great big onion, but let\u2019s go with this for now. Scores: 6,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 27 for Saffron and AJ. Shirley thought it was a power-packed routine, but Saffron\u2019s hip rotation wasn\u2019t great and her feet were turned in (DRINK). Bruno is punch drunk (standard), and he\u2019s not sure those lifts were legal. There was some loss of balance and the timing wasn\u2019t on it in places \u2013 it was \u2018mental but fabulous\u2019. Craig agrees that it lacked fluidity, but it did have some dynamic moments. Motsi loved Saffron\u2019s risk taking and the beginning was amazing, but she needs to clean it up and keep the energy. I have no idea why this has a basketball theme, but let\u2019s go with it. Nice starting basket from AJ, but I\u2019m not sure that hoop is a regulation height. Saffron is in her element here \u2013 lots of sass and party energy, but it feels a bit laboured in places and the lifts look a bit clunky. The timing goes a bit awry towards the end, and Saffron suddenly looks quite out of her depth. A shame. It\u2019s time for SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Instruction\u2019 by Jax Jones featuring Demi Lovato and Stefflon Don. This is a stone cold banger with a proper carnival vibe, am very much hoping one of the Dave Arch singers goes all in on the Stefflon Don interlude. Scores: 8,9,8,9 \u2013 a total of 34 for Kelvin and Oti. Motsi loved how they captured the mood of the dance, it was outstanding. Shirley wanted it to be flatter, there was too much rise and fall for a Viennese (see? Ten years have not been wasted), but she loved the emotional elements. Bruno loved the storytelling and emotional tonality, it was light as a feather and soft as a caress. Craig agrees with Shirley \u2013 too much rise and fall, but the storytelling was super. God I love watching these two dance, it\u2019s always incredibly special. Kelvin has a beautiful lyrical quality to his dancing and Oti is a goddess. Might a bit too much rise and fall for a Viennese, but what the hell do I know. Goosebumps stuff right there. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Say Something\u2019 by A Great Big World and Christina Aguilera. This song is hauntingly beautiful, and I have high hopes for Kelvin and Oti giving us a Viennese to match. Tess has a chat with Will, who is gutted to be out of the competition. He\u2019s hoping to be fit for Tokyo 2020, a stark reminder that he might have waved goodbye to a Paralympic gold medal in pursuit of a Halloween-themed Jive. Fingers crossed it\u2019s nothing serious. Scores: 5,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 26 for Emma and Aljaz. Craig liked the energy, but technically it was a bit sloppy and messy in places. Motsi thought Emma\u2019s body coordination was good, and her personality kept it up. Shirley loved the closed hold throughout and she definitely saw some bounce, but Emma needs to work on her posture. Bruno would definitely come to Emma\u2019s party, and it was a great job of a very hard dance. We this starts with promise, and Emma has enviably swingy hair. There are some timing issues here, and some of the transitions are pretty clunky. There\u2019s no question that Emma\u2019s dancing has come on significantly this year, but it still feels a bit like she\u2019s dancing the Samba whilst trying to hold a 50p between her bum cheeks. Can someone loosen her corset? It\u2019s time for EMMA AND ALJAZ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Samba to \u2018I Don\u2019t Care\u2019 by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber. This was one of my fave songs of the summer, hopefully Emma will tackle it with a suitable level of party abandon. Scores: 8,9,9,8 \u2013 a total of 34 for Michelle and Giovanni. Bruno thought it was clean, clear and menacing, but Michelle could have extended the shapes more. Craig agrees \u2013 he wanted more extension in the shaping, but there was purpose and passion. Motsi loved the intensity between Michelle and Giovanni, it was a different interpretation and she liked it. Shirley loved that there was no flash and no trash, executed with exquisite timing. Think I need to watch that again. Michelle\u2019s outfit has got quite a lot going on, making it difficult to appreciate her shaping. Some nice flamenco elements in the middle, but it feels a bit tentative and needs more aggression and passion. Loved the routine, but I wanted a bit\u2026more? Next up it\u2019s MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019 by Queen. I loved their Foxtrot last week - despite them being in the slot of death tonight, I have every hope that this is going to be skirt-swishing Latin fierceness from start to finish. Gyles Brandreth is doing the Terms &amp; Conditions. It is a thing that happened. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Karim and Amy. Well, that sets quite a bar for this evening, doesn\u2019t it? Shirley thought it was a brilliant way to start the show \u2013 Karim\u2019s frame was exquisite and his footwork was off the chart. Bruno thought it was a Saville Row quickstep tailored to the highest standard, it was absolutely perfect. Craig thought there was occasional gapping, but it was clean, precise and had lovely swing and sway \u2013 totally stunning. Motsi thought Karim killed it, it was the best start ever. Well this is fun \u2013 apart from the tailoring being slightly alarming on the eyeballs, Karim is nailing this Quickstep \u2013 he has a lovely frame and his footwork is outstanding. Super stylish and classy, enjoyed that a lot. First up tonight it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to \u2018Mr. Pinstripe Suit\u2019 by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. We already know that Karim has incredible footwork, and he\u2019s finally been given a song that is an appropriate fit for the dance. I have very high hopes for this being a ten-tastic start to tonight\u2019s dancing. Out come the judges! Shirley has had a hospital procedure this week, but great to see her still on the show and looking fabulous. And now the stars \u2013 Karim and Amy are clashing horribly. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in an electric blue sparkle pantsuit, like Sandy from Grease meets Avatar. Claudia in ill-fitting power shoulders. And we\u2019re off! We\u2019re halfway through, and it\u2019s all about positivity and purpose. So many training room poppies \u2013 DRINK! Look, I\u2019m part of an extensive military family and fully support the incredible work of the Royal British Legion, but if any of the poppies we see in the training room weren\u2019t pinned on by a production assistant and immediately removed once the cameras stopped rolling, I\u2019ll eat my poppy hat. Tonight\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo: a swig of leftover rugby lager for any occurrence of the following: Early mentions of Blackpool Incongruous training room poppies Previously unseen relatives Sickled feet A ten from Craig (in the immortal words of The Weeknd, I feel it coming) Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing Liveblog! We\u2019ve reached Week 7, which means we\u2019re about the crest the Strictly Hill and start freewheeling to the Grand Final on 14th December. The shambles of Halloween Week is but a distant memory, and all eyes are on the next big milestone \u2013 the Blackpool Tower Ballroom in two weeks\u2019 time. Are you excited? I\u2019m excited. Sadly we\u2019ve had to say goodbye to Will Bailey this week, who hasn\u2019t recovered from the knee injury he sustained in training last week. A real shame for him and Janette, but hopefully we\u2019ll see Will back for a Christmas special one year; he was a real highlight of this year\u2019s show. The most likely scenario is that the show will continue as normal, with just three couples in the Final; it\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in previous years when a celebrity has left. A quick update to Heidi\u2019s Hunches below \u2013 if there are only three couples in the final, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me one bit if it was Kelvin, Michelle and Karim; what\u2019s more interesting is whether Alex or Saffron can mount a series challenge and unseat one of the Big Three. I\u2019ve also moved Chris and Karen out of the danger zone \u2013 they\u2019ve got Couple\u2019s Choice this evening, which seems to be a get out of jail free card. Group 1: one eye on the final \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy Group 2: hot on their heel leads \u2013 Alex and Neil, Saffron and AJ Group 3: battling for Blackpool \u2013 Emma B and Anton, Chris and Karen Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 Mike and Katya, Emma W and Aljaz Kick off tonight is at 7pm, so grab snacks, booze and loved ones and make yourselves comfy. The comment box is open for your wit and wisdom, so get stuck in. See you then!",

      "body": "<p>The 2019 election will be the first in decades where both Labour and the Conservatives promise to turn on the public spending tap. The manifestos have yet to be released, but both have already made multibillion-pound pledges as the era of austerity comes to an end.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s major spending pledges focus on the NHS, benefits, homes and the renationalisation of utilities and rail companies. The Conservatives are expected to confirm expectations of cuts to income tax and national insurance and the lifting of the cap on benefits.</p> <h2>Warm homes</h2> <p><strong>Labour pledge:</strong> Under a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d Labour would fund energy-saving upgrades to low-income households over the next decade. Wealthier households would receive interest-free loans for enhancements. It also promises to bring the energy bills of nearly 10 million low-income households down by an average of \u00a3417 a year and eradicate fuel poverty, benefiting 1.14 million elderly people.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong> \u00a360bn. The total bill for upgrade works would be \u00a3250bn \u2013 \u00a39,300 per home \u2013 but the party says \u00a321bn would come from loans to regional energy agencies and \u00a3169bn from savings on household energy bills.</p> <h2>NHS and social care</h2> <p><strong>Conservative pledge:</strong> Under a so-called health infrastructure plan, as many as 40 new hospitals will be rbuilt in England.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong> \u00a313bn, but only six hospitals will go ahead at first at a cost of \u00a32.8bn.</p> <p><strong>Labour pledge:</strong> Overall spending will be increased, paid for by rises in income tax on the highest 5% of earners, plus increasing tax on private medical insurance. Will scrap prescription charges and develop a state drug company to develop cheaper medicines. Will increase GP trainee numbers in England by 50%. Creation of a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/24/labour-national-care-service-disabled-care\">National Care Service </a>to extend personal care to the over-65s.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong><em> </em>The 2017 election pledge was for \u00a330bn in extra funding, and more is expected in the latest manifesto. The cost of axing prescription charges is estimated at about \u00a3750m. Doubling the number of people who receive free social care in England will cost \u00a36bn. </p> <h2>Benefits and pensions</h2> <p><strong>Conservative pledge:</strong> The government announced over the weekend that about 2.5 million people on universal credit will see their payments rise by 1.7%, in line with inflation, as will people still on benefits replaced by universal credit, benefiting more than 10 million people in all. The state pension will increase to \u00a3175.20 a week, or an extra \u00a3344 a year.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong> \u00a35bn to end the freeze on benefits, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.</p> <p><strong>Labour pledge:</strong><em> </em>Labour says it will abolish the benefits freeze, scrap universal credit and put an end to the two-child benefits limit. It criticises the Tories for having imposed the freeze in the first place and pledged \u201ca much more humane, humanitarian system\u201d.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong><em> </em>At the Labour conference, the party said it would spend \u00a33bn on an emergency funding of the benefit system. No pricing was put on longer-term changes to universal credit.</p> <h2>Utility companies</h2> <p><strong>Labour pledge:</strong><em> </em>To bring into public ownership the gas and electricity supply networks and the privatised water and sewerage companies. It has also proposed renationalising the rail operating companies and the Royal Mail.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong><em> </em>The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said that taking control of the water companies could cost less than \u00a315bn, citing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/876e456e-6f42-11e9-bbfb-5c68069fbd15\">calculations made by the Financial Times</a>. But if the government paid the current stock market value, the price could be closer to \u00a340bn.</p> <p>The gas and electricity networks, currently in the hands of providers such as National Grid, Iberdrola and Ovo Energy, which has bought SSE\u2019s retail business, will cost far more. National Grid alone has a current market value of \u00a331bn.</p> <p>Crucially, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/16/how-does-labour-plan-to-pay-for-its-energy-nationalisation-policy\">Labour will cut costs</a> by taking into account \u201cpension fund deficits; asset stripping since privatisation; stranded assets; the state of repair of assets; and state subsidies given to the energy companies since privatisation\u201d. Existing shareholders would be compensated with bonds. The CBI said Labour\u2019s renationalisation plans would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/14/labour-plans-for-utilities-would-cost-the-uk-200bn-says-cbi\">cost a total of \u00a3196bn</a>, but the party accused the employers\u2019 body of \u201cincoherent scaremongering\u201d and the organisation admitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/cbi-admits-error-in-196bn-price-tag-for-labour-plans\">exaggerating the likely total </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/cbi-admits-error-in-196bn-price-tag-for-labour-plans\">cost</a>.</p> <h2>Railways and roads</h2> <p><strong>Labour pledge:</strong><em> </em>The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto included a pledge to bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expired, and this is expected to be repeated in its new manifesto.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong><em> </em>This could be relatively cheap, because the rail companies operate on time-limited franchises. As they expire, the government could pick them up almost cost-free. Longer-term franchises could be taken over using break clauses in their contracts.</p> <p>McDonnell has said his plans are cost-neutral because the cash generated by newly acquired private companies would cover the cost of financing the debt needed to buy them.</p> <p><strong>Conservative pledge:</strong> The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has already announced extensive spending plans for the strategic roads network. Boris Johnson has previously signalled his opposition to the HS2 high-speed link.</p> <p><strong>The cost:</strong> Javid\u2019s roads spending for 2020 to 2025 could be about \u00a325bn under already-announced plans, with an additional \u00a3220m to improve bus services. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has already delayed the first phase of HS2 between London and Birmingham by up to five years.

      "bodyText": "The 2019 election will be the first in decades where both Labour and the Conservatives promise to turn on the public spending tap. The manifestos have yet to be released, but both have already made multibillion-pound pledges as the era of austerity comes to an end. Labour\u2019s major spending pledges focus on the NHS, benefits, homes and the renationalisation of utilities and rail companies. The Conservatives are expected to confirm expectations of cuts to income tax and national insurance and the lifting of the cap on benefits. Warm homes Labour pledge: Under a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d Labour would fund energy-saving upgrades to low-income households over the next decade. Wealthier households would receive interest-free loans for enhancements. It also promises to bring the energy bills of nearly 10 million low-income households down by an average of \u00a3417 a year and eradicate fuel poverty, benefiting 1.14 million elderly people. The cost: \u00a360bn. The total bill for upgrade works would be \u00a3250bn \u2013 \u00a39,300 per home \u2013 but the party says \u00a321bn would come from loans to regional energy agencies and \u00a3169bn from savings on household energy bills. NHS and social care Conservative pledge: Under a so-called health infrastructure plan, as many as 40 new hospitals will be rbuilt in England. The cost: \u00a313bn, but only six hospitals will go ahead at first at a cost of \u00a32.8bn. Labour pledge: Overall spending will be increased, paid for by rises in income tax on the highest 5% of earners, plus increasing tax on private medical insurance. Will scrap prescription charges and develop a state drug company to develop cheaper medicines. Will increase GP trainee numbers in England by 50%. Creation of a new National Care Service to extend personal care to the over-65s. The cost: The 2017 election pledge was for \u00a330bn in extra funding, and more is expected in the latest manifesto. The cost of axing prescription charges is estimated at about \u00a3750m. Doubling the number of people who receive free social care in England will cost \u00a36bn. Benefits and pensions Conservative pledge: The government announced over the weekend that about 2.5 million people on universal credit will see their payments rise by 1.7%, in line with inflation, as will people still on benefits replaced by universal credit, benefiting more than 10 million people in all. The state pension will increase to \u00a3175.20 a week, or an extra \u00a3344 a year. The cost: \u00a35bn to end the freeze on benefits, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Labour pledge: Labour says it will abolish the benefits freeze, scrap universal credit and put an end to the two-child benefits limit. It criticises the Tories for having imposed the freeze in the first place and pledged \u201ca much more humane, humanitarian system\u201d. The cost: At the Labour conference, the party said it would spend \u00a33bn on an emergency funding of the benefit system. No pricing was put on longer-term changes to universal credit. Utility companies Labour pledge: To bring into public ownership the gas and electricity supply networks and the privatised water and sewerage companies. It has also proposed renationalising the rail operating companies and the Royal Mail. The cost: The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said that taking control of the water companies could cost less than \u00a315bn, citing calculations made by the Financial Times. But if the government paid the current stock market value, the price could be closer to \u00a340bn. The gas and electricity networks, currently in the hands of providers such as National Grid, Iberdrola and Ovo Energy, which has bought SSE\u2019s retail business, will cost far more. National Grid alone has a current market value of \u00a331bn. Crucially, Labour will cut costs by taking into account \u201cpension fund deficits; asset stripping since privatisation; stranded assets; the state of repair of assets; and state subsidies given to the energy companies since privatisation\u201d. Existing shareholders would be compensated with bonds. The CBI said Labour\u2019s renationalisation plans would cost a total of \u00a3196bn, but the party accused the employers\u2019 body of \u201cincoherent scaremongering\u201d and the organisation admitted exaggerating the likely total cost. Railways and roads Labour pledge: The party\u2019s 2017 manifesto included a pledge to bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expired, and this is expected to be repeated in its new manifesto. The cost: This could be relatively cheap, because the rail companies operate on time-limited franchises. As they expire, the government could pick them up almost cost-free. Longer-term franchises could be taken over using break clauses in their contracts. McDonnell has said his plans are cost-neutral because the cash generated by newly acquired private companies would cover the cost of financing the debt needed to buy them. Conservative pledge: The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has already announced extensive spending plans for the strategic roads network. Boris Johnson has previously signalled his opposition to the HS2 high-speed link. The cost: Javid\u2019s roads spending for 2020 to 2025 could be about \u00a325bn under already-announced plans, with an additional \u00a3220m to improve bus services. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has already delayed the first phase of HS2 between London and Birmingham by up to five years. A review on the future of the \u00a362bn scheme has been put on hold until after the election. Personal taxes Conservative pledge: Increase the threshold for the 40p rate of income tax from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, and raise the starting point for national insurance (NI), with reports that this will be worth \u00a3460 per worker. The cost: The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the income tax giveaway would cost \u00a38bn a year and help 2.5 million of the highest-earning employees. Every \u00a31,000 rise in the threshold at which employees and the self-employed pay NI would cost \u00a33bn. Matching it with the starting point for income tax of \u00a312,500 would cost \u00a317bn. Labour pledge: No specific pledges yet, but the party\u2019s 2017 manifesto promised to impose a 45p tax rate on those earning more than \u00a380,000 and a 50% rate above \u00a3123,000. At present, the highest income tax rate is 45%, for those earning more than \u00a3150,000. Labour would also significantly increase capital gains tax and might replace inheritance tax with a \u201clifetime gifts\u201d levy, with a tax-free allowance of \u00a3125,000, less than half the current \u00a3325,000. There are also plans to increase corporation tax to 26%, up from the current rate of 19%. The cost: Raising taxes is not a cost but a revenue measure. Labour has previously estimated that income tax rises would raise \u00a36.4bn. The corporation tax take would increase by \u00a319.4bn, and \u00a36.5bn would come in from shutting tax loopholes. Law and order Conservative pledge: Bolster police ranks by 20,000 in England and Wales and arm more police with Tasers. People convicted of violent and sexual crimes, as well as foreign national offenders, will face heavier sentences. Labour has separately pledged to give the police \u201cthe money they need\u201d and are expected to match Conservative commitments on police numbers.

Critics say the extra money from central government will be swallowed up by the extra pension costs forces will have to pay after a decision by the Treasury to increase payments. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2019. An earlier version implied that Labour would replace inheritance tax with a \u201clifetime gifts\u201d levy. That should have said that Labour might do that.",

Marco Silva has been drinking in The Last Chance Saloon for a while and the consensus is the under-pressure Everton manager is almost out of time. That\u2019s despite two wins from his past three matches, though the latter came against his former club, Watford, in the cup in midweek. Shove Silva\u2019s results under the microscope and the picture is bleak, with Everton hovering above the bottom three having won just three league games this season \u2013 against the division\u2019s three W\u2019s: Watford, Wolves and West Ham. If there is any consolation for Silva it is that each of those victories have come at Goodison Park, where they take on Tottenham determined to arrest their slump. \u201cWe need to change it as you can\u2019t have two faces \u2013 one when you play at home and one completely different away,\u201d Silva said.</p> \n  <p>Things are not entirely rosy for Mauricio Pochettino either, with the Spurs manager picking up just one win from his past five matches. Spurs, scarred from shellackings by Bayern Munich and then Brighton, have struggled to strike any form of balance or consistency, particularly on the road \u2013 they have yielded a single away win in the league since January \u2013 but Pochettino will hope his team take this opportunity to prove they are out of the woods. \u201cAt the moment we struggle a little bit in our confidence,\u201d said Pochettino, whose side are winless in their past 11 away games. \u201cThe most important is how we are going to finish, it\u2019s not nice to see you in the middle of the table but that is a reality we need to accept. If you don\u2019t accept the reality you are going to struggle. We know very well that we need time, to be strong, be solid and start to win because that is going to be the best thing for us.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 4.30pm (GMT)</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T15:44:12.096Z\">at 3.44pm GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company. Thoughts with Andr\u00e9 Gomes, who Marco Silva has confirmed was taken by ambulance to hospital: A classy snippet from Pochettino in his press conference regarding a classy touch from the Everton skipper. \u201cI want to thank the captain, S\u00e9amus Coleman \u2013 he came into the dressing room to console Son,\u201d the Spurs manager said. Marco Silva confirms Andr\u00e9 Gomes has gone to hospital. \u201cOur medical staff is taking control of everything and soon there will be more information,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wait until it is a bit more clear. It is a bad moment for us as a group and as a team. It more than a football game, this is the most important thing right now. We as a group have to keep togetherness.\u201d Fabian Delph, understandably, found it difficult to keep his emotions in check. \u201cWe feel just as you can imagine,\u201d says a deflated Delph. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult time for us. He [Andr\u00e9 Gomes] is one of our brothers, someone we care about. It is difficult to put into words how we feel. As soon as we could get in touch we will send him our best. It\u2019s difficult to see. It\u2019s hard to talk now. \u201cOur thoughts are with Andr\u00e9, we all want to see him as soon as possible. He\u2019s such a good guy, such a good professional. It\u2019s hard to put into words. When it happened, it is hard to refocus. We buckled down and were desperate to get something out of the game. It was a big push. Mind is muffled, we are happy to get the point but I am not thinking of the result, we are all just thinking of Andr\u00e9. It\u2019s a difficult time for us, especially for him. We will give him all of our support.\u201d Word from the Premier League on the Son sending off. In a statement released a moment ago, they say: \u201cThe red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge.\u201d Marco Silva talks, and is reluctant to talk too much about the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes, stating he only saw the incident live. \u201cWe showed a fantastic team spirit, if you can talk about the game. There were many, many stops that did not help the game or the performance. I think we deserved a little bit more, in the second half we were more balanced and they didn\u2019t create anything. Until the goal they scored, we had the two big, big chances. After, one mistake, one counterattack and maybe the only time they went in our area. After we reacted, we had some chances to equalise and we showed that spirit to come back.\u201d More from Pochettino. He says Son Heung-min is devastated and adds that the referee Martin Atkinson should have checked the VAR screen to realise his challenge was not red-card worthy. \u201cSonny was devastated,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cIt was difficult to keep calm. When you watch the action on TV, there is no intention to do what happened after. It was very, very bad luck for him and bad luck for the family of Everton. It finished with a red card for Sonny, very unfair and of course the conditions of the game changed. We defended well but then we conceded. I am disappointed with the result, and disappointed with other things that happened in the 90 minutes. I cannot agree with the sending off of Sonny and many things that happened before. I think the referee needs to go to the screen, like in different leagues.\u201d Read Andy Hunter\u2019s report from Goodison Park: Mauricio Pochettino speaks, and sends his best wishes to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. \u201cWe feel very sorry, we feel very sorry because it was a really bad situation,\u201d he says, after puffing his cheeks. \u201cIt was very bad luck how he landed in the action. We can only send our best wishes and of course we are devastated for the situation. Football is not important but the situation of him is important. Of course we can talk about football but always feeling bad, feeling sorry and very devastated for the action.\u201d Asked whether recent criticism stings, Alli replies: It depends who from. There are certain people that obviously when they something it hurts and it really kicks you up the backside and certain people who say stuff and you just roll your eyes at it and it\u2019s in one ear and out of the other. Growing up, coming from League One into the Premier League, you have to have a strong mentality you have a strong mentality. Granted I didn\u2019t have the best of seasons last season, I picked up a few injuries or whatever but that\u2019s all behind me now and I\u2019m working hard. Maybe last week against Liverpool I didn\u2019t perform as well as I can but I think in the other games, Watford and in the Champions League, I think I\u2019ve played well. People always say \u2018can Dele get back to where he was?\u2019 But I don\u2019t want to get back to where I was, I want to go past that and keep improving. Some people just say it [criticism] because it\u2019s their job to say something.\u201d Dele Alli speaks, and very well too. Of the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not nice, I didn\u2019t want to look too much at what happened but I just want to send him our best wishes. He is an amazing footballer. I just went into the changing room and he [Son Heung-min] is devastated, he is in tears but it\u2019s not his fault. He is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and he would never mean to do something like that. He cannot even pick his head up, he is crying that much. It does play on your mind [in the game] but you have to stay professional, focus and switched on. Unfortunately we switched off for a split second and they scored.\u201d It is very much secondary given the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes \u2013 but it has to be said that the video assistant referee technology had a bit of a stinker. It was an understandable human error by Martin Atkinson and the officials to award Son Heung-min a red card on the back of the agony the Everton midfielder found himself in but, on closer inspection, his challenge was in no way worthy of a red. Which is precisely when technology should surely intervene ... Cenk Tosun cancelled out a fine Dele Alli opener \u2013 but all thoughts from both teams will be with Andr\u00e9 Gomes at the final whistle. The Everton midfielder was carried off on a stretcher after sustaining a serious-looking injury. Son Heung-min was sent off for fouling Andr\u00e9 Gomes, but replays appear to show that the injury was not as a result of that challenge but rather because how the midfielder awkwardly fell. Alli\u2019s opener was timely, in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, who names his England squad on Thursday, but by the end it was a distant memory, after Tosun powered in Digne\u2019s cross to equalise. There was also a long VAR check for a possible Everton penalty after Alli seemingly handled in the box but, after a three-minute delay and numerous checks, play continued. 101 min: Ryan Sessegnon is on for his Spurs debut, in place of Christian Eriksen. Sessegnon\u2019s first touch? A crucial headed clearance. 100 min: Ten-man Spurs are suddenly hanging on. Everton are level \u2013 and it\u2019s a brilliant goal. Tosun powers home a header, meeting Lucas Digne\u2019s brilliant volleyed, first-time cross. It was a wonderful floating cross into Digne by Yerry Mina, who lost his footing after sending the ball across the field. Digne fired the ball into the box, where Calvert-Lewin and Tosun were both champing at the bit, and Tosun did the rest. 90+5 min: Delph is penalised for a challenge on Lo Celso. Spurs win a free-kick on halfway. Seven minutes to play at Goodison. 90+2 min: The game, as you would expect, has gone very flat after that horrifying injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. That Son was distraught and the distress of both sets of players and the crowd speak volumes of the severity of the injury. Goes without saying, but all thoughts with Andr\u00e9 Gomes. 90 min: There will be 12 added minutes. 88 min: Juan Foyth replaces Aurier for Spurs, who are down to 10. 86 min: Sigurdsson and Calvert-Lewin are on for Everton. Tom Davies was withdrawn, while Andr\u00e9 Gomes was carried off through injury. 84 min: Now is perhaps not the time to address it but replays show Son\u2019s challenge was worthy of a yellow card at most. It appears the way Andr\u00e9 Gomes awkwardly landed on the turf was why the concern around him was so serious \u2013 not the manner of Son\u2019s challenge. 83 min: Andr\u00e9 Gomes is carried off on a stretcher. Marco Silva\u2019s eyes appear to be watering. That looked a very nasty injury. Goodison rises to its feet as the Everton midfielder is carried off. Sky say an ambulance is waiting to take him to hospital. 82 min: Medical staff continue to attend to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. 80 min: Son Heung-min has been sent off. But the Tottenham forward has to be consoled as he heads down the tunnel. Both sets of players appear very distressed at the injury sustained to Andr\u00e9 Gomes. Replays suggest the injury to Andr\u00e9 Gomes was sustained after Son\u2019s challenge, as a result of the way he fell. 78 min: There is real concern for Andr\u00e9 Gomes. Son Heung-min looks absolutely distraught, close to tears. Son\u2019s tackle was not brilliant. 74 min: Giovani Lo Celso replaces Tanguy Ndombele, who had been booked. Tosun replaced Theo Walcott a few minutes ago. The delay for that latest VAR check? More than three minutes. Spiffing ... 73 min: \u201cPerhaps VAR should be restricted to (more) objective decisions,\u201d emails Dave Hannah. \u201cSuch as offside? The disruptive delays that we are all coming to hate appear to be caused by situations that require subjectivity, and often don\u2019t have a clear right answer. The decision is not improved by involving VAR. As ridiculous as an offside armpit sounds, at least it\u2019s an objective decision.\u201d It has been a total killjoy, hasn\u2019t it? 72 min: No penalty. 71 min: A long delay, as the VAR check continues ... 69 min: From the resulting corner, the VAR has flagged up a possible handball. Dele Alli appears to handle the corner, taking the ball away from Yerry Mina. Are Everton about to be awarded a penalty? Anthony Taylor is seeking out all angles. 68 min: Gazzaniga is almost beaten! Tom Davies surges through the Spurs midfield, bypassing a sea of white shirts before spraying the ball wide to Walcott, who is lurking on the right flank, as per. Walcott\u2019s low cross is ordinary but it cannons off Ben Davies, and almost catches Gazzaniga cold. Davinson S\u00e1nchez seemed worried too, but Spurs get away with it. Everton corner ... 66 min: Everton are readying Cenk Tosun. Amid all of the excitement, Tanguy Ndombele went into the book shortly after the goal for a crude challenge on Djibril Sidib\u00e9. Dele Alli strikes! After Alex Iwobi squanders possession, Son slides in Alli, who drives inside Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and fires into the corner beyond Pickford. It was a thumping finish and Alli\u2019s celebration packs a punch, too; he holds an index finger over his mouth before going to ground, pretending to be in a deep sleep. Alli basks in the glory, after Spurs break incisively at Goodison. 60 min: Richarlison stings Gazzaniga\u2019s gloves! Digne raids down the left and cuts the ball back towards the edge of the box. Davinson S\u00e1nchez is sluggish to react and the ball runs into the path of Richarlison, who takes aim first time. His effort is not lacking in power \u2013 but it\u2019s relatively close to the Spurs goalkeeper, who gratefully gathers. S\u00e1nchez has been at the heart of the action in the last few moments. It was the Spurs defender who Richarlison felt tripped him in the box. 59 min: Richarlison goes down in the box \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing doing. Martin Atkinson sprints away, totally uninterested. 58 min: Tottenham\u2019s next opponents are Sheffield United, and both Chris Wilder and Alan Knill are at Goodison to cast their eye over Spurs. Hopefully Wilder has covered his eyes from much of this. It\u2019s been dire from both teams. 55 min: Eriksen sends a gorgeous ball flashing across the six-yard box ... but Tottenham cannot get anyone on the end of it. Everton clear. It was an exemplary cross in \u2013 but Spurs are still to fashion a shot on target. Everton have had just the one. 54 min: Pochettino is nodding along to the fourth official, who is busy explaining the VAR\u2019s decision not to award a penalty. The Spurs manager seems to be taking it pretty well \u2013 but he\u2019s clearly miffed Son did not get the penalty. 51 min: Seconds after the big screens say: VAR decision: no penalty, Martin Atkinson is informed the incident is being reviewed, for a second time. When the VAR check is checked, play can resume. It\u2019s all a bit farcical. Mina certainly made contact with Son. Whether it was a theatrical fall, only he knows. 50 min: Son goes down in the box, collapsing to the floor under pressure ... but Martin Atkinson is unmoved. Yerry Mina\u2019s trailing leg does appear to make contact with the Spurs winger. The video assistant referee will have a look ... 49 min: Lucas Moura is adamant he has earned Spurs a corner but, in fact, Holgate helps Everton win a goal-kick. We go again. 47 min: Stephen Carr emails back in to confirm, sadly, he is not the Stephen Carr. \u201cI am happy to confirm that I am not football\u2019s Stephen Carr and also that I have been to Peterborough on a number of occasions,\u201d he says. As you can tell, not a lot going on in the second half at Goodison. Other than Everton almost pressing Spurs into trouble, with Serge Aurier getting out of a tight corner. 46 min: Spurs\u2019 Dele Alli gets the second half going. \u201cThis match isn\u2019t just like watching paint dry,\u201d emails Stephen Carr (unconfirmed whether it\u2019s the former Tottenham and Newcastle defender). \u201cIt\u2019s like watching beige paint dry. In an abandoned bus stop. In Peterborough.\u201d Anyway, do dust yourselves off for what will surely be a pulsating second half ... Meanwhile, in Italy ... It\u2019s not been a classic. Richarlison looks the most likely to do any damage, with the Everton forward having a couple of efforts repelled. Spurs have not had anything to shout about either. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. Neither Gareth Southgate, up in the posh seats, or indeed anyone else look too excited. It has been a largely dull first half. 43 min: Richarlison works an opening \u2013 but his shot zooms over! He does really well, in fairness. Iwobi plays a simple pass into his path and Richarlison wriggles away from Sanchez, spinning into a yard of space before getting a shot off. Plenty of endeavour from Everton, but not an awful lot to show for it. 42 min: Son Heung-min has not had a sniff. He\u2019s had 10 forgettable touches, fewer than anyone else on the pitch, including both goalkeepers. 41 min: Another Everton corner, another Lucas Moura clearance. 39 min: Andr\u00e9 Gomes is winded as a result of that collision but the Everton midfielder is quickly back on to the field. 38 min: Richarlison feeds Iwobi, nudging the ball into the winger\u2019s path way out from goal. Iwobi charges down the left before teeing a cross into the box but Spurs deal with it. It was a fairly aimless pass in the end. Andr\u00e9 Gomes was cutely blocked off by Sanchez, but Everton have no chance of a penalty. 35 min: Lucas Moura lashes the ball away and Eriksen buys Spurs 50-odd yards of territory, and now Everton find themselves on the back foot. A replay shows Yerry Mina needlessly pulled back Dele Alli as Spurs broke forward on the counter. Martin Atkinson is alerted to it and has a curt word with the defender. 34 min: Everton earn a corner ... 32 min: Richarlison sends a shot at Gazzaniga! The Everton forward does the hard part, controlling Lucas Digne\u2019s dinked cross from the left with his first touch before swivelling and getting a shot away. The ease with which Richarlison manhandled the ball was reminiscent of Joshua King against Manchester United on Saturday. But, the Brazilian\u2019s effort lacks conviction and the Spurs goalkeeper comfortably gathers. 31 min: Eriksen is booked. Lu\u00eds Boa Morte is going ballistic down on the touchline. Silva\u2019s staying calm on this one. Those tackles have revved up Goodison. 30 min: Walcott goes into Martin Atkinson\u2019s book for a late challenge on Ben Davies. Walcott is quick to embrace the Spurs full-back, who is all smiles. It turns out the VAR had a peek at whether Walcott\u2019s challenge was deserving of upgrading to a red card but that\u2019s not the case. 28 min: Nice move from Everton! Sidib\u00e9 slips in Walcott, who races to the byline before standing up an inviting cross. Lurking towards the back post is Andr\u00e9 Gomes, who is not renowned for his aerial ability. The Everton midfielder gets his header all wrong, shunting the ball well over Gazzaniga\u2019s goal. 27 min: Alderweireld nods a straight-off-the-training-ground free-kick wide of goal. It was well-worked by Spurs, who played it short but Everton made life difficult for Alderweireld, who needed a miracle to generate the required power to trouble Pickford. Down on the touchline, Silva is barking like mad. 25 min: Andr\u00e9 Gomes slides through Richarlison but the forward ends up taking the shot on early, rather than allowing the ball to run through in front of him. Richarlison ended up taking the sting out of the pass and giving Sanchez and Alderweireld the initiative to bite back at the Brazilian. 22 min: Spurs get sloppy and then so do Everton, with Digne undercooking a pass inside for Iwobi. Spurs gobble up possession and probe down the left. Ben Davies ends up buying a corner out of Walcott. That was all a bit cheap \u2013 and almost costly. The corner comes to nothing but, when Aurier recycles the ball, his cross from the right lures Pickford into a wild punch. Everton survive. 20 min: Sidib\u00e9 drops the ball before taking a throw-in. It\u2019s not quite happening for either team at the moment at a fairly subdued Goodison. 18 min: The Spurs buildup is all a little too pedestrian and predictable but, eventually, they work the ball wide to Serge Aurier, who whacks the ball in from the right. It\u2019s straight down Jordan Pickford\u2019s throat. 15 min: Walcott gallops into a gaping hole inside the Spurs box but the Everton winger\u2019s cross is not good enough. He fizzes a pass into no man\u2019s land and Spurs hoover up the danger. Everton have been bright without testing Gazzaniga. 12 min: Goodison rises to its feet to commemorate the life of James Myers, a 12-year-old who died on a railway line in Merseyside last month. On the pitch, both teams seem a little cagey; it is almost as if a lot is riding on this one. 11 min: Spurs almost carve an opening. After some patient buildup play, Toby Alderweireld floats a cross-field ball into Davies, who slides in Eriksen. But Everton eventually manage to crowd Tottenham out. It was a slick move, a sign of how Spurs can open up teams. That\u2019s as good as it\u2019s got for Spurs so far. 9 min: Pickford launches the ball high to Walcott out on the right flank. He tries and fails to keep it in, with Davies in close proximity. 8 min: Everton are hogging the ball. Spurs cannot get hold of it. 5 min: Walcott\u2019s pace causes more problems down the Spurs left but the winger\u2019s decision-making lets him down. Again. He ends up running into trouble and Spurs clear their lines. Still, an encouraging start for Everton to build on. 4 min: Pickford wellies the ball downfield in search of Theo Walcott, who had comfortably eluded Davies, but Gazzaniga is alert to alert. It was a wonderful, mammoth Ederson-like kick down the pitch by Pickford. A beautiful kind of route one. 3 min: Spurs think they are in, but the assistant referee adjudged Ben Davies, who is wearing the captain\u2019s armband, offside. The defender had been slipped in down the left flank. His low cross almost picked out Lucas Moura. But it counts for nothing. 1 min: Everton make a decent start. Richarlison plays a beautiful blind pass into Djibril Sidib\u00e9, who scurries forward. They knock the ball around, keeping hold of possession before trying to pick out Iwobi, but the cross evades him. Everton get things started at Goodison. We\u2019ve had an impeccable minute\u2019s silence. Here we go ... Marco Silva speaks, and talks about Yerry Mina replacing Michael Keane, who has endured a torrid time. \u201cWhen you have good competition, it\u2019s always a tough decision,\u201d he says. \u201cWe needed to establish a strategy and [consider] the strengths of the opponents as well, and that helps decide our best eleven. You have to plan.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino talks, and confirms Harry Kane is cocooned in a blanket on the sofa with a virus. \u201cHim and his family got a virus, he started to feel bad on Friday night and it was impossible for him to train on Saturday or to travel with the team,\u201d Pochettino says. \u201cI hope he will feel better and be ready as soon as possible. It is always difficult with injured players like him or Hugo and of course we are trying to cope with this situation. We have a very good squad and different players can step up.\u201d Tim Cahill has just proclaimed Leicester \u201cthe real deal\u201d. Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side could have ended up with three or four in the end: Leicester really are quite brilliant. Ben Chilwell, Youri Tielemans, Jamie Vardy and James Maddison, in front of the watching England assistant Steve Holland, have all been superb. Again. Beyond Manchester City and Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side set the benchmark. Work to do for Everton and Spurs ... Leicester are about to return third in the table. They are two goals to the good against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park: We need to be moving up the table. It has been difficult in the past few weeks but the coach can\u2019t take all the blame. It is us that go out on to the pitch and we need to take responsibility. We are all under the same pressure and unfortunately the results aren\u2019t happening. We were very frustrated last week.\u201d Team news news: the headline absentee is Harry Kane, with the England captain missing out for Tottenham through illness. Jan Vertonghen is not deemed fit enough to make up the numbers after a hamstring problem, while Ben Davies returns in place of the suspended Danny Rose to skipper Spurs. Ryan Sessegnon, however, is among the Spurs substitutes; he could make his Tottenham debut. As for Everton, Tom Davies is one of three changes for Marco Silva. Theo Walcott is also in from the off. Everton (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Sidib\u00e9, Holgate, Mina, Digne; Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Delph; Walcott, Davies, Iwobi; Richarlison Subs: L\u00f6ssl, Keane, Coleman, Sigurdsson, Tosun, Calvert-Lewin, Kean Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1): Gazzaniga; Aurier, S\u00e1nchez, Alderweireld, Davies; Sissoko, Ndombele; Son, Alli, Eriksen; Moura Subs: Vorm, Foyth, Dier, Sessegnon, Winks, Lo Celso, Parrott Referee: Martin Atkinson This, a meeting between teams 17th and 13th in the Premier League, says it all. Marco Silva has been drinking in The Last Chance Saloon for a while and the consensus is the under-pressure Everton manager is almost out of time. That\u2019s despite two wins from his past three matches, though the latter came against his former club, Watford, in the cup in midweek. Shove Silva\u2019s results under the microscope and the picture is bleak, with Everton hovering above the bottom three having won just three league games this season \u2013 against the division\u2019s three W\u2019s: Watford, Wolves and West Ham. If there is any consolation for Silva it is that each of those victories have come at Goodison Park, where they take on Tottenham determined to arrest their slump. \u201cWe need to change it as you can\u2019t have two faces \u2013 one when you play at home and one completely different away,\u201d Silva said. Things are not entirely rosy for Mauricio Pochettino either, with the Spurs manager picking up just one win from his past five matches. Spurs, scarred from shellackings by Bayern Munich and then Brighton, have struggled to strike any form of balance or consistency, particularly on the road \u2013 they have yielded a single away win in the league since January \u2013 but Pochettino will hope his team take this opportunity to prove they are out of the woods. \u201cAt the moment we struggle a little bit in our confidence,\u201d said Pochettino, whose side are winless in their past 11 away games. \u201cThe most important is how we are going to finish, it\u2019s not nice to see you in the middle of the table but that is a reality we need to accept. If you don\u2019t accept the reality you are going to struggle. We know very well that we need time, to be strong, be solid and start to win because that is going to be the best thing for us.\u201d Kick-off: 4.30pm (GMT)",

      "bodyText": "British and American officials have begun talks to explore the possible extradition of the suspect in the death of Harry Dunn, the Guardian has learned. The suspect, Anne Sacoolas, went to the US while under investigation after a car she was driving struck a motorcycle ridden by the 19-year-old outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire in August. British police travelled to the US last week and interviewed Sacoolas. The final part of the evidence detectives from Northamptonshire police were compiling was the transcripts of the interview with Sacoolas. They have now submitted evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which is expected soon to make a decision about charging the suspect. One charge under consideration is death by dangerous driving and Dunn\u2019s family want Sacoolas to face justice. The discussions about extradition so far have been informal, a source said, and exploratory. Lawyers who handle extradition at the CPS are understood to be aware of the case. But formal proceedings can only start once the CPS, who is the prosecution service in England and Wales, decides to bring a criminal charge which is punishable in both Britain and the US by a sentence of more than 12 months imprisonment. Sacoolas, who is married to a US intelligence official who was based at the RAF base, claimed diplomatic immunity. The British government said that she no longer had diplomatic immunity. Dunn\u2019s family believe she may never have had immunity. Mark Stephens, solicitor for the Dunn family, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t think she has ever had diplomatic immunity and there is no bar to extradition.

She cooperated with police and was breathalysed at the scene but left the UK three weeks after the accident aboard a US air force plane. Dunn\u2019s parents were not told that the suspect in their son\u2019s death had left the UK for over a week. Stephens said Sacoolas returning to the UK to face any charges would help ease the pain of Dunn\u2019s family: \u201cIt would be a way for everybody to get closure.

But whatever impetus Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side had beforehand vanished in the south-coast squalls as United lost 1-0.</p> <p>The M word was also heard in baseball circles last week after the Washington Nationals recovered from a 19-31 start to the regular season to win a first World Series. How else to explain the victory without resorting to one of sport\u2019s great articles of faith? But while it is hard to find a player or coach who doesn\u2019t believe in momentum with the zeal of a 17th century puritan, most academics regard it as nothing more than a trick of the mind.</p> <p>The hot hand in basketball? <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028585900106\" title=\"\">A famous study published by the psychologists Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky in 1985 tore that one to shreds</a>. After examining Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 shooting data, the academics showed successful streaks and failures were indistinguishable from the sequences of heads and tails one would expect from flipping a coin time and again. The hot hand was, they argued, \u201ca powerful and widely shared cognitive illusion\u201d. While the original 1985 research has <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2627354\">recently been challenged</a>, other studies have also found that our minds are often duped by patterns in randomness.</p> <p>What about football? A few years ago the economists Stephen Dobson and John Goddard examined every English league match between 1970 and 2009 \u2013 81,258 games \u2013 to see whether longer winning, unbeaten and losing runs were observed more often than would be expected by chance. After accounting for team and opposition strength they found that, on average, sequences of consecutive wins and matches without a win end sooner than expected. In other words the momentum effect was negative \u2013 perhaps because teams played differently to preserve an unbeaten record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeborg/v149y2018icp137-168.html\" title=\"\">Another study, published last year,</a> looked at whether scoring a goal just before half-time benefited teams more than at other times. The results were again conclusive. \u201cWe do not find any evidence of an effect of timing toward the end of the half,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThe performance in the second half of teams scoring late in the first half is very similar to the performance of the teams scoring at other times in the half.\u201d</p> <p>Yet an intriguing new study <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/10/22/1908320116.short?rss=1\" title=\"\">by academics at Duke University in North Carolina</a> suggests a momentum effect may be a factor in individual sports \u2013 if a player feels psychologically threatened by an opponent climbing the rankings. When researchers analysed nearly 60,000 tennis matches between 1992 and 2016, they found players typically won fewer points and matches than otherwise would be expected when facing an opponent who had recently shot up the ATP or WTA world rankings.</p> <p>These players also committed more double faults than expected against players with upward momentum, which the researchers suggest shows they felt more mental pressure in such matches. When the academics sifted through data from 2.7m chess matches there were similar findings. Even when competitors were evenly matched, players performed worse against an opponent they knew had been climbing in Elo points.</p> <p>How to explain it? According to Hemant Kakkar, an assistant professor of management and organisations at Duke University, \u201cOur experiments suggest players do mental calculations about a competitor. They tend to think, yeah, this person will keep moving up. Because of this, they start feeling threatened and their performance tends to suffer.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"960cb9dc1c7f6327d8ad6b697521a6a76036bf59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/960cb9dc1c7f6327d8ad6b697521a6a76036bf59/0_71_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Washington Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo kisses the Commissioners Trophy in front of fans along the World Series victory parade in downtown Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Washington Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo kisses the Commissioners Trophy in front of fans along the World Series victory parade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Corum/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems plausible enough.

      "bodyText": "\u201cNever underestimate the value of momentum.\u201d That\u2019s what Sir Clive Woodward advised after England\u2019s rugby players lacerated Australia a fortnight ago. And how wise those words seemed when New Zealand were also scattered and flayed, and it seemed England\u2019s name was all but engraved on the Webb Ellis Cup. And then, without warning, the team\u2019s hot hand turned Arctic and the World Cup was ripped from their grasp by South Africa. \u201cMomentum is so important in football.\u201d That\u2019s what Dimitar Berbatov told us on Friday, before predicting Manchester United would win their fourth match on the bounce against a Bournemouth side without a victory since September. But whatever impetus Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side had beforehand vanished in the south-coast squalls as United lost 1-0. The M word was also heard in baseball circles last week after the Washington Nationals recovered from a 19-31 start to the regular season to win a first World Series. How else to explain the victory without resorting to one of sport\u2019s great articles of faith? But while it is hard to find a player or coach who doesn\u2019t believe in momentum with the zeal of a 17th century puritan, most academics regard it as nothing more than a trick of the mind. The hot hand in basketball? A famous study published by the psychologists Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky in 1985 tore that one to shreds. After examining Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 shooting data, the academics showed successful streaks and failures were indistinguishable from the sequences of heads and tails one would expect from flipping a coin time and again. The hot hand was, they argued, \u201ca powerful and widely shared cognitive illusion\u201d. While the original 1985 research has recently been challenged, other studies have also found that our minds are often duped by patterns in randomness. What about football? A few years ago the economists Stephen Dobson and John Goddard examined every English league match between 1970 and 2009 \u2013 81,258 games \u2013 to see whether longer winning, unbeaten and losing runs were observed more often than would be expected by chance. After accounting for team and opposition strength they found that, on average, sequences of consecutive wins and matches without a win end sooner than expected. In other words the momentum effect was negative \u2013 perhaps because teams played differently to preserve an unbeaten record. Another study, published last year, looked at whether scoring a goal just before half-time benefited teams more than at other times. The results were again conclusive. \u201cWe do not find any evidence of an effect of timing toward the end of the half,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThe performance in the second half of teams scoring late in the first half is very similar to the performance of the teams scoring at other times in the half.\u201d Yet an intriguing new study by academics at Duke University in North Carolina suggests a momentum effect may be a factor in individual sports \u2013 if a player feels psychologically threatened by an opponent climbing the rankings. When researchers analysed nearly 60,000 tennis matches between 1992 and 2016, they found players typically won fewer points and matches than otherwise would be expected when facing an opponent who had recently shot up the ATP or WTA world rankings. These players also committed more double faults than expected against players with upward momentum, which the researchers suggest shows they felt more mental pressure in such matches. When the academics sifted through data from 2.7m chess matches there were similar findings. Even when competitors were evenly matched, players performed worse against an opponent they knew had been climbing in Elo points. How to explain it? According to Hemant Kakkar, an assistant professor of management and organisations at Duke University, \u201cOur experiments suggest players do mental calculations about a competitor. They tend to think, yeah, this person will keep moving up. Because of this, they start feeling threatened and their performance tends to suffer.\u201d It seems plausible enough. The researchers tested their theory with four non-sport studies on over 1,800 participants that measured how worried they felt in various scenarios. The results again showed that people were more threatened by upwardly mobile opponents than those with the same rank who lacked momentum. There was an antidote, however. When a person found a reason to doubt an opponent\u2019s momentum in the tests \u2013 or practised affirmations of their own abilities \u2013 they were less threatened and did better in the tests. But this is only study and finding proof of positive momentum in team sports remains elusive. The latest study I saw, published in July, looked at players who had made the last shot of an NBA match to take the game into overtime \u2013 and then tracked how they did after that, with surprising results. Sporting wisdom would suggest those who scored the equaliser before the buzzer would be more confident, while those who missed the last shot before overtime would be more down. In fact the researchers found that after scoring the last shot in the fourth quarter, players\u2019 field goal percentage dropped 12.14% points on average \u2013 whereas the field goal percentage of players who missed the last shot rose 10.09% points on average In other words, individuals reacted with a drop in performance after success and an increase in performance after failure. This was probably because players who scored on the buzzer believed they had a hot hand and took relatively more shots in overtime from sub-optimal positions. So much for the value and importance of momentum, then \u2013 whatever Woodward, Berbatov and the rest of sport may think.",

      "bodyText": "Leading politicians from major parties have signed a pledge to avoid hateful language during the general election campaign, as a growing number of MPs cite relentless abuse as their reason for stepping down from parliament. The group Compassion in Politics has launched #StopTheNastiness, which aims to encourage candidates to \u201ccampaign with respect, call out hate, and promote compassion\u201d over the next six weeks. It also urges the public to contact their local representatives and ask them to back the pledge, and calls on the media to avoid exacerbating abuse. Matt Hawkins, who co-founded the group, said it hoped to instil ideas about decency and compassion at the heart of British politics, which has become increasingly divided since the Brexit referendum. He said one particular focus was to stop the abuse of female MPs who have said they feel their lives are in danger when they go out campaigning. Hawkins accepted there were times when forceful language is justified \u201cif you\u2019re coming from a place where it\u2019s concern for humanity\u201d, such as when a politician highlights links between austerity policies and the deaths of vulnerable individuals, but said the aim should always be to win others around to your argument rather than being needlessly abusive. The campaign has received cross-party support, including politicians from Labour, the Conservatives, the Greens and the SNP in addition to faith groups such as the Muslim Council of Britain and Jewish Council for Race Equality. Members of the public will also be encouraged to call out hate online by using the hashtag #StopTheNastiness, and the campaign group will also distribute badges and stickers carrying the slogan while campaigning. The Archbishop of Canterbury has also said that strong language by MPs risks \u201cpouring petrol\u201d on the current political situation, and a growing number of female politicians have talked about the vitriol they receive and its impact. The departing Conservative cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said she had decided not to stand again in part because of the level of abuse she received. Rosie Duffield, the Labour MP for Canterbury who is standing again, said she had been shocked by what she had encountered in her first two years in parliament. \u201cBehaviour that is tolerated in politics would be considered obscene in any other walk of life,\u201d she said. \u201cVerbal and physical threats, xenophobia, sexism, bullying and intimidation, we were meant to be wiping these from the face of our society. Instead we\u2019ve allowed politics to become their breeding ground.\u201d The campaign may face a challenge in an election expected to be high on emotion and an increasingly partisan media environment. Leading politicians have been accused of stoking divisions by using inflammatory language, notably when Boris Johnson described death threats against MPs as \u201chumbug\u201d. A recent analysis by the Financial Times suggested there was a direct correlation between the language used in parliament during that debate and the volume of toxic tweets from both sides of the Brexit divide.",

There was also a healthy Tory vote in 2017 (around 10,000) and whether this dies away will be a true indication of how the Conservatives fare in Scotland with Boris Johnson as their figurehead compared to the charismatic former leader Ruth Davidson who refused to back a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Hastings and Rye \u2013 Tory/Labour marginal</strong><br>Held by: Independent, Amber Rudd.

Rudd\u2019s marginal seat \u2013 346 votes in it \u2013 was oft cited as a reason she did not propel herself forward for the Tory leadership in the summer. It is a leave voting area and a traditional working class seat and exactly the type of constituency the Conservatives must win to secure a majority. Rudd is stepping down.<br><br><strong>Canterbury \u2013 Labour/Tory marginal</strong><br>Held by: Labour, Rosie Duffield<br>Who wants it? Tories<br>2017 result: Labour 25,572, Tory 25,385<br>Majority: 185<br>Remain or leave: remain 54%</p> <p>This was a shock result of the 2017 election and broke a 185-year stretch of Tory dominance in the seat. Tory Julian Brazier\u2019s ousting was put down to the student vote, however Labour\u2019s campaign group Momentum was also particularly active on the ground and there was a strong social media campaign. It forms part of Labour\u2019s now regular election campaigning line that they defied the polls in unexpected areas. The Tories will be ploughing in substantial resources to try and win this seat back.</p> <p><strong>Workington \u2013 Labour/Tory marginal</strong><br>Held by: Labour, Sue Hayman, shadow environment secretary<br>Who wants it?

He is described as an older, white, non-graduate and male living in a rugby league town in the north who voted leave in the EU referendum and who typically votes Labour. These kind of seats are vital to try and offset expected losses in Scotland, according to thinktank Onward. The Brexit party might not have a straightforward ride here as although Ukip got a sizeable chunk of the vote in 2015, their candidate from that election is now the Tory party member and local councillor going up against Hayman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/targetseats-zip/giv-3902MjLnU099yY1r/\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/targetseats-zip/giv-3902MjLnU099yY1r/\">.</a> <figcaption>.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bolsover \u2013 Labour heartland</strong><br>Held by: Labour, Dennis Skinner<br>Who wants it?

They will undoubtedly split the vote, eating into both parties, which has led to criticism from the left on social media with revived mantra: \u201cVote Lib Dem, get Tory\u201d.

Tories<br>2017 result: Labour 25,928, Tory 25,880<br>Majority: 48<br>Remain or leave: leave 60%</p> <p>A classic Labour-held marginal that Johnson must win to secure a majority. The Tories held this seat between 2008 from a byelection following the death of Gwyneth Dunwoody to 2017, when former-teacher Laura Smith ousted junior minister Edward Timpson.

It was one of the most recent examples of a progressive and remain based alliance working to back one candidate as Plaid Cymru and the Green party pulled out the race to give the Liberal Democrats a shot. It is thought their actions secured the win for the Lib Dems.

Chalk supported remain at the 2016 referendum and campaigned against a no-deal Brexit however he may find himself at the receiving end of a protest vote about Brexit and Johnson\u2019s deal.

      "body": "<p>A second and final term can free a leader, as Joko Widodo has acknowledged. The question is how he will use his new liberty. Five years ago, he was widely hailed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/joko-widodo-how-indonesias-obama-failed-to-live-up-to-the-hype\" title=\"\">\u201cIndonesia\u2019s Obama\u201d</a>. His rise was seen as another step forward for the world\u2019s fourth most populous country and biggest Muslim-majority nation. Its transition from dictatorship two decades ago had already made it an important and much-needed model of democracy in the region and to the Muslim world. But Jokowi, as he is popularly known, was also an outsider, the first president from a humble background. Unconnected to the authoritarian era, he had earned a reputation as a clean politician as governor of Jakarta. Like Mr Obama he stood for hope in a sullied political world.</p> <p>Now he has begun his second term. His campaign slogan was \u201cIndonesia advancing\u201d. But many of those who once cheered him now see a country backsliding on critical issues including human rights, religious tolerance and the general quality of its democracy.</p> <p>Though his progress in building infrastructure and commitment to developing social welfare has been applauded, he has been attacked for failing to tackle corruption and abuses, and for giving ground to hardline Islamic groups rather than challenging them. The president seems to regard getting to grips with such concerns as a hindrance to his economic programme. The new vice-president, Ma\u2019ruf Amin, is a powerful conservative Islamic cleric with a history of intolerance towards religious minorities and LGBT people. </p> <p>Now suspicion and anger have been reignited by his decision to appoint the opponent he defeated twice, Prabowo Subianto, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/indonesia-joko-widodo-appoints-arch-rival-as-defence-minister-prabowo-subianto\" title=\"\">as defence minister</a>. The former general, the son-in-law of the late dictator Suharto, was allegedly involved in the kidnapping and torture of pro-democracy activists in 1998, a claim he has consistently denied.</p> <p>Indonesian politics has always depended on bringing political rivals into the tent \u2013 with patronage and related opportunities keeping opponents there. Indeed, one concern is that the ruling coalition now controls almost three-quarters of the seats in the house of representatives, leaving a much-reduced opposition.</p> <p>Nor is this appointment an unprecedented move by the president. In 2016, he chose as security minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/indonesia-security-minister-wiranto-stabbed-by-suspected-isis-radical\" title=\"\">Wiranto</a>, a former army chief who was indicted for crimes against humanity by a UN-backed tribunal (though he denies the offences and never stood trial). Nonetheless, this disturbing new appointment has rightly engendered real fear among activists and others in the country, and reinforced concerns about its direction. At the most fundamental level, it has left some voters wondering what the election was for.</p> <p>So has his decision to keep on the forest and environment minister and the justice minister \u2013 weeks after tens of thousands of students protested against the government\u2019s failure to tackle the country\u2019s forest fires and against a draconian new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/indonesias-criminal-code-what-is-it-why-does-it-matter-and-will-it-be-passed\" title=\"\">criminal code</a> which opponents warned endangered press freedoms and criminalised abortion, and the weakening of an <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Indonesia-law-change-sparks-fears-Jokowi-is-going-soft-on-corruption\" title=\"\">anti-corruption body</a>.</p> <p>The hopes were always unwisely inflated: the president could not have met them all. But it is clearer than ever that he cannot be depended on to defend basic rights. It is also clear that citizens should not expect any one politician to be seen as a saviour. Real pressure for reform, and real opposition can only come from outside parliament. Civil society in Indonesia needs all the help it can get.</p>",

Unconnected to the authoritarian era, he had earned a reputation as a clean politician as governor of Jakarta. Like Mr Obama he stood for hope in a sullied political world. Now he has begun his second term. His campaign slogan was \u201cIndonesia advancing\u201d. But many of those who once cheered him now see a country backsliding on critical issues including human rights, religious tolerance and the general quality of its democracy. Though his progress in building infrastructure and commitment to developing social welfare has been applauded, he has been attacked for failing to tackle corruption and abuses, and for giving ground to hardline Islamic groups rather than challenging them. The president seems to regard getting to grips with such concerns as a hindrance to his economic programme. The new vice-president, Ma\u2019ruf Amin, is a powerful conservative Islamic cleric with a history of intolerance towards religious minorities and LGBT people. Now suspicion and anger have been reignited by his decision to appoint the opponent he defeated twice, Prabowo Subianto, as defence minister. The former general, the son-in-law of the late dictator Suharto, was allegedly involved in the kidnapping and torture of pro-democracy activists in 1998, a claim he has consistently denied. Indonesian politics has always depended on bringing political rivals into the tent \u2013 with patronage and related opportunities keeping opponents there. Indeed, one concern is that the ruling coalition now controls almost three-quarters of the seats in the house of representatives, leaving a much-reduced opposition. Nor is this appointment an unprecedented move by the president. In 2016, he chose as security minister Wiranto, a former army chief who was indicted for crimes against humanity by a UN-backed tribunal (though he denies the offences and never stood trial). Nonetheless, this disturbing new appointment has rightly engendered real fear among activists and others in the country, and reinforced concerns about its direction. At the most fundamental level, it has left some voters wondering what the election was for. So has his decision to keep on the forest and environment minister and the justice minister \u2013 weeks after tens of thousands of students protested against the government\u2019s failure to tackle the country\u2019s forest fires and against a draconian new criminal code which opponents warned endangered press freedoms and criminalised abortion, and the weakening of an anti-corruption body. The hopes were always unwisely inflated: the president could not have met them all. But it is clearer than ever that he cannot be depended on to defend basic rights. It is also clear that citizens should not expect any one politician to be seen as a saviour. Real pressure for reform, and real opposition can only come from outside parliament. Civil society in Indonesia needs all the help it can get.",

It could be made illegal to make financial gain from advising on, or creating, avoidance schemes \u2013 and the honours system could be reformed to exclude tax avoiders and people working in companies avoiding tax.

Russell Prett Sydenham, London \u2022 Nicholas Shaxson\u2019s article on the scale of tax avoidance globally, and the harm it inflicts, is a timely reminder for Labour on how taxation should be at the heart of its election campaign (To defeat the world\u2019s crooks, shrink the City, 29 October). With Britain the biggest player in the tax haven game, Jeremy Corbyn and his team must realise that bland promises about tackling tax evasion and avoidance will not suffice. Voters have heard this many times from all parties with no real effect. In order to have an impact, the Labour manifesto should include precise details which then have to be repeated at every opportunity by every candidate. He or she should have the exact same figures to hand, from how much is lost every year in the UK to how many tax inspector jobs in HMRC will be created after the Tory and Lib Dem cull. John McDonnell has already promised \u201cthe most comprehensive plan ever seen in the UK\u201d to tackle the problem, with legislation necessary to force tax transparency on UK crown dependencies, to reveal the owners of companies hiding assets. More voter-friendly policies can be added. The distinction between tax avoidance and evasion could be ended, with both being made criminal offences. It could be made illegal to make financial gain from advising on, or creating, avoidance schemes \u2013 and the honours system could be reformed to exclude tax avoiders and people working in companies avoiding tax. Almost three-quarters of companies given major contracts by recent Tory governments have operations based in tax havens: Labour could promise that any such companies will be refused any government contracts. Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 I was disappointed to read your article (\u2018The privileged few\u2019: five super-rich figures in opposition\u2019s sights, 1 November). While it is of course important to highlight Labour\u2019s policies and Corbyn\u2019s speeches, there is no need to accentuate what is clearly an inappropriate thirst for individuals\u2019 blood. It is not the government\u2019s job to go after individuals, it is its job to regulate and ensure laws are obeyed. The individuals listed in your article may indeed be insalubrious, but that is not the point. They are citizens of this country who, like all of us, take advantage of the laws as they currently stand. We should of course seek to prevent the ills that they perpetuate (zero-hours contracts, the reduction in social housing) but to demonise them on a personal basis is inappropriate, unhelpful and \u2013 more worryingly \u2013 injurious to civil debate. In short, you are legitimising a witch-hunt. Rose Grey London \u2022 Boris Johnson may use casual rhetoric about dying in a ditch, but for some people, the possibility of premature death is all too real. Ministry of Justice figures confirm that suicides are on the rise among offenders by a significant number (Report, 1 October). Austerity and damaging government decisions have wrecked public and voluntary services. Offenders and others who live with poverty, homelessness and mental health problems are left without support, unable to reintegrate into society. Tory policies have not only led to hardship but desperation and death \u2013 see your articles in September and October on the homeless deaths of Aimee Teese, Jake Humm, Kane Walker, Gyula Remes and Catherine Kenny. The Brexit debate must not obscure the urgent need to end this callous indifference to people with difficult lives.

The move from disability living allowance (DLA) to personal independence payment (PIP) for people of working age is in essence an extension of this government\u2019s hostile environment to include those who need support in their daily lives.</p> <p>In my work I regularly help people complete applications for PIP and also attendance allowance (for those of state pension age). One aspect that commonly occurs is that people make adjustments in their lives in order to manage, but do not always see these as indicators that they could use some help, so do not make them explicit in their application.</p> <p>One point that Palk made was that, at his assessment, he tried to be calm and friendly, and not display his problems. The assessor judges on what they see (and can make assumptions based on that), so such efforts can, sadly, backfire.</p> <p>There are many organisations and charities that offer help with form-filling and appeals. Citizens Advice is one, and offers fully confidential advice and support.<br><strong>Sue Fallows</strong><br><em>Gittisham, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 To attend my PIP tribunal I had to pass through airport-type security. A guard checked my bag, lurking within which was my deadly knitting (a jumper for my grandson). This was confiscated and I was given a receipt. Then a bottle of water was discovered, cleverly concealed on the top of my bag. It could only be returned to me if I took a large swig, and presumably did not keel over having ingested some noxious substance.

The move from disability living allowance (DLA) to personal independence payment (PIP) for people of working age is in essence an extension of this government\u2019s hostile environment to include those who need support in their daily lives. In my work I regularly help people complete applications for PIP and also attendance allowance (for those of state pension age). One aspect that commonly occurs is that people make adjustments in their lives in order to manage, but do not always see these as indicators that they could use some help, so do not make them explicit in their application. One point that Palk made was that, at his assessment, he tried to be calm and friendly, and not display his problems. The assessor judges on what they see (and can make assumptions based on that), so such efforts can, sadly, backfire. There are many organisations and charities that offer help with form-filling and appeals. Citizens Advice is one, and offers fully confidential advice and support. Sue Fallows Gittisham, Devon \u2022 To attend my PIP tribunal I had to pass through airport-type security. A guard checked my bag, lurking within which was my deadly knitting (a jumper for my grandson). This was confiscated and I was given a receipt. Then a bottle of water was discovered, cleverly concealed on the top of my bag. It could only be returned to me if I took a large swig, and presumably did not keel over having ingested some noxious substance. It took me quite a while to recover from all this. It also took a while to recover my knitting \u2013 mercifully intact.

      "bodyText": "Women and girls who attach themselves to Islamic State are driven by a complex combination of factors beyond just love or marriage, including feelings of social exclusion and the appeal of sisterhood, according to research by a counter-extremism thinktank. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) has put together guidance to help people working with women and girls who have returned from Isis-held territories. The guidance, based on interviews with intervention providers who have collectively worked with more 250 radicalised women and girls in the UK and the Netherlands, says there is a mainstream perception that women and girls affiliated with Isis \u2013 often called \u201cjihadi brides\u201d \u2013 are motivated only by love or marriage. It has been reported that around 100 British women and girls left the UK to join Isis, making up 12% of all British citizens who travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the group. Judges are considering the Home Office\u2019s decision to revoke the citizenship of one such woman, Shamima Begum. The guidance says marriage is a factor in many cases but adds: \u201cA simplistic view of the motivations of women and girls affiliated with Islamist extremism can reinforce misleading stereotypes and biases that suggest that women are passive followers rather than active, ideological supporters.\u201d There are broad and varied reasons for radicalisation, the guidance says, including the appeal of \u201csisterhood\u201d, a desire to be part of the state-building effort of Isis or to be part of something \u201cbigger and divine\u201d. Travelling to the proclaimed caliphate was perceived by some to be an aspect of living a \u201ctrue and pure Islamic life\u201d, while others were driven by feelings of social exclusion or experiences of discrimination. The guidance also says rebellion against society and parents sometime played a factor, along with female empowerment and a rejection of \u201cwestern feminism\u201d. Since surfacing at a refugee camp in February, Begum has made it clear she wants to return to the UK but she is unable to do so as her citizenship was revoked. Begum fled to Syria with two fellow pupils from Bethnal Green Academy, now Mulberry Academy Shoreditch, in east London in February 2015. She married Yago Riedijk, 27, a Dutch convert to Islam, shortly after arriving in the country. She has had three children, all of whom died. At a partially secret hearing before the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) last month, lawyers for Begum, who is now 20, attempted to challenge a decision by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, to revoke her British citizenship. The British government has argued she has a claim to dual nationality as her parents were born in Bangladesh, which Begum and her lawyers deny. She further claims she would be hanged if forced to go there.",

The team will give out the drug and train people in how to use it. The pilot will run for 12 weeks and is supported by Cleveland police. Addaction plans to roll out the scheme in all its services across the UK \u2013 the first national treatment charity to do so. George Charlton, an independent trainer and consultant, who has teamed up with Addaction to launch the project, said: \u201cPeer-to-peer naloxone is about more than not restricting naloxone to bricks and mortar. It\u2019s about empowering people with a history of drug abuse to help their friends and show they have a positive role to play in society. When we use naloxone people get to see their kids grow up, they get to take care of the people they love. The only thing it enables is breathing.\u201d The official figures on drug-related deaths revealed that the north-east registered the highest number, with 96.3 deaths per million people, compared with 39.4 in London, where the rate was lowest. The figures for Wales, the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber were also high. Drug treatment experts, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, reacted angrily to the data, accusing the government of putting people\u2019s lives at risk by cutting the funding of vital treatments services. Studies have shown that councils have responded to central government cuts by slashing spending on drug treatment services by about 27% since 2015\u201316, and by more than 50% in some areas. Scotland is grappling with a similar crisis with the drug-related death toll increasing by 27% over the past year to reach a record high of 1,187, according to data released in July, putting the country on a par with the US in per capita terms.",

      "body": "<p>I had one of the most surreal nights of my life a couple of weeks ago. A friend of mine invited me to attend an event for emerging actors \u2013 a space to collaborate, network and support other artists doing the work we all have chosen to devote our lives to. We were promised an evening of exciting new work, raw and vulnerable comedy performances and \u201cendless networking\u201d. Instead, we were met with Hollywood\u2019s most notorious alleged serial rapist, Harvey Weinstein. More daunting than that, though, was that we were met with a room full of artists who prioritised the comfort of a suspected abuser over the safety of the community they claimed to uplift.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a smile stretched across his face all I could think of was the faces of the abusers I\u2019ve encountered in my own life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Weinstein sat in a plush booth reserved for industry elites, surrounded by a cadre of beautiful women, men in business suits and bodyguards. He wasn\u2019t hiding; he had no reason to hide. He was a welcome guest.</p> <p>At first I couldn\u2019t believe it was him. I couldn\u2019t imagine a world in which this man would be allowed into a space for young actors. The room seemed casual, as though nothing was wrong, and so rather than trust my own instincts I tried to push it out of my mind. I appealed to the authority of the crowd and I sat in silence.</p> <p>The show started, no one mentioned it, and a few acts went by. Then a comedian named Kelly Bachman, who I\u2019m now fortunate enough to consider a friend, took to the stage. In a clip of her act that has since been distributed widely, she said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/harvey-weinstein-women-confront-producer-new-york-actors-hour\" title=\"\">she would address the \u201celephant in the room\u201d</a>. Immediately the room swelled with a chorus of boos.</p> <p>I looked around for the source of the sound, but it was impossible to pinpoint, because it was coming from all directions. As I scanned the dark bar I saw the bartenders, event organisers and MC all booing. At that moment, rather than be outraged at what was happening, I immediately began questioning myself. Surely there was no way that they were booing Bachman \u2013 they must have been booing the monster in the room. I must have been confused, I told myself. I must have misunderstood. I must be wrong. I stayed silent.</p> <p>I assured myself that the organisers would say something before the next performer. That Weinstein would be removed. That this room would make things right. But instead, they rushed into the next act. On and on it went, each act followed by a smattering of applause and a moment or two of transition from the MC. As the show continued I found myself staring blankly, the sounds of the performers and the room around me became a wash of white noise. Why was no one doing anything?</p> <p>I looked around, and saw Weinstein laughing. As a smile stretched across his face all I could think of was the faces of the abusers I\u2019ve encountered in my own life. The times when I felt so alienated from my own body and experiences that the ability to raise my voice and speak out wasn\u2019t even a question. All I wanted was for someone to speak out. Someone to confirm that I wasn\u2019t crazy \u2013 that this was wrong.</p> <p>It struck me that if I was feeling this way then other people must be feeling the same. So I made a promise to myself that if no one else said anything by the intermission, I would. The intermission came, and I spoke up. I walked up to his table and asked him for his name. I wanted him to say it, I wanted to know absolutely. He didn\u2019t answer.

      "bodyText": "I had one of the most surreal nights of my life a couple of weeks ago. A friend of mine invited me to attend an event for emerging actors \u2013 a space to collaborate, network and support other artists doing the work we all have chosen to devote our lives to. We were promised an evening of exciting new work, raw and vulnerable comedy performances and \u201cendless networking\u201d. Instead, we were met with Hollywood\u2019s most notorious alleged serial rapist, Harvey Weinstein. More daunting than that, though, was that we were met with a room full of artists who prioritised the comfort of a suspected abuser over the safety of the community they claimed to uplift. Weinstein sat in a plush booth reserved for industry elites, surrounded by a cadre of beautiful women, men in business suits and bodyguards. He wasn\u2019t hiding; he had no reason to hide. He was a welcome guest. At first I couldn\u2019t believe it was him. I couldn\u2019t imagine a world in which this man would be allowed into a space for young actors. The room seemed casual, as though nothing was wrong, and so rather than trust my own instincts I tried to push it out of my mind. I appealed to the authority of the crowd and I sat in silence. The show started, no one mentioned it, and a few acts went by. Then a comedian named Kelly Bachman, who I\u2019m now fortunate enough to consider a friend, took to the stage. In a clip of her act that has since been distributed widely, she said she would address the \u201celephant in the room\u201d. Immediately the room swelled with a chorus of boos. I looked around for the source of the sound, but it was impossible to pinpoint, because it was coming from all directions. As I scanned the dark bar I saw the bartenders, event organisers and MC all booing. At that moment, rather than be outraged at what was happening, I immediately began questioning myself.

Fully ban jumps racing</h2> <p>Jumps races, such as the Grand National, are banned in New South Wales and Tasmania but still conducted in Victoria and South Australia.</p> <p>A 2006 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16866197\">study by the University of Melbourne</a> found that the risk of a horse dying in a jumps race was 18.9 times that of a flat race. According to the RSPCA, at least 49 horses have died as a result of participating in jumps racing in the past 10 years.</p> <p>As well as the risk of falls, the distances are also usually longer than those favoured in flat racing, with horses asked to jump hurdles of at least one metre over a course of at least 2.8km, compared to distances of 800m to 3.2km in flat racing. This increases the likelihood of exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage, or bleeding on the lungs.</p> <p>Bleeding on the lungs is common in high-intensity equestrian sports such as polo and cross-country. According to various studies, it is found in <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evj.12368\">between 68%</a> and <a href=\"https://www.msdvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/exercise-induced-pulmonary-hemorrhage-in-horses\">90% of racehorses</a>.</p> <h2>3. End two-year-old racing</h2> <p>Horses do not fully mature until they are about five, and many equestrian disciplines do not allow horses younger than four to compete.</p> <p>Thoroughbreds are worked much younger. To train for a two-year-old race, horses are broken in as yearlings. Because all foals born in a certain year are put in the same age class, late-born foals can race when they are as young as 16 months.</p> <p>\u201cThey are literally babies,\u201d Elio Celotto, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses\u2019 campaign director, said.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2013/04/05/racing-start-for-two-year-old-thoroughbreds-not-detrimental.html\">a study by the University of Sydney in 2013</a> analysed the race records of 115,000 Australian thoroughbreds over 10 years and found that \u201cfor those thoroughbreds that have started racing at two no ill effect can be detected\u201d.</p> <p>The study still advised caution before racing a two-year-old.</p> <h2>4.

Ban tongue ties</h2> <p>A tongue tie is a rubber band that is wrapped around the horse\u2019s tongue and then around their lower jaw. It is designed to prevent the horse from getting its tongue over the bit, which makes it difficult to control, and it is commonly used in both thoroughbred and standardbred (harness) racing.</p> <p>The racing industry says it also helps keep a horse\u2019s airways clear so it can breathe more easily. A 2002 study said that ties may prevent dorsal displacement of the soft palate in individual cases <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12405720\">but is \u201cnot effective in the majority\u201d</a>. DDSP can limit oxygen intake and decrease athletic performance.</p> <p>Animal welfare groups have called for it to be banned, saying they increase stress and can cause lacerations, bruising and swelling. Germany banned their use in racing in 2018 and they are also banned by the peak global body for equestrian sports, the FEI.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Animal welfare will be in the spotlight on Melbourne Cup day after footage from a Queensland abattoir showed ex-racehorses allegedly being mistreated and slaughtered. Here are five changes that animal welfare organisations say could be instituted immediately to make racing more humane. 1. Ban the whips Under Racing Australia\u2019s rules, a jockey can only use their padded whip on the horse five times before the final 100-metres of the race, after which there are no restrictions on the number of hits. Both the RSPCA and the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses say the whip could be banned immediately without detrimentally affecting the sport, and they have found an unlikely ally in recent weeks in the leading thoroughbred owner Lloyd Williams. \u201cThe industry now needs to realise whips need to be withdrawn very soon,\u201d the six-time owner of a Melbourne Cup winner told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program, which showed the alleged mistreatment of racehorses in abattoirs. The Australian Jockey Club, which has long maintained that the whip is an issue of safety because it can be used to help \u201cguide the animal,\u201d told Nine newspapers it would not support a ban. Norway banned the use of whips in 1982, except in two-year-old races where they are carried but cannot be used to make the horse go faster. 2. Fully ban jumps racing Jumps races, such as the Grand National, are banned in New South Wales and Tasmania but still conducted in Victoria and South Australia. A 2006 study by the University of Melbourne found that the risk of a horse dying in a jumps race was 18.9 times that of a flat race. According to the RSPCA, at least 49 horses have died as a result of participating in jumps racing in the past 10 years. As well as the risk of falls, the distances are also usually longer than those favoured in flat racing, with horses asked to jump hurdles of at least one metre over a course of at least 2.8km, compared to distances of 800m to 3.2km in flat racing. This increases the likelihood of exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage, or bleeding on the lungs. Bleeding on the lungs is common in high-intensity equestrian sports such as polo and cross-country. According to various studies, it is found in between 68% and 90% of racehorses. 3. End two-year-old racing Horses do not fully mature until they are about five, and many equestrian disciplines do not allow horses younger than four to compete. Thoroughbreds are worked much younger. To train for a two-year-old race, horses are broken in as yearlings. Because all foals born in a certain year are put in the same age class, late-born foals can race when they are as young as 16 months. \u201cThey are literally babies,\u201d Elio Celotto, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses\u2019 campaign director, said. But a study by the University of Sydney in 2013 analysed the race records of 115,000 Australian thoroughbreds over 10 years and found that \u201cfor those thoroughbreds that have started racing at two no ill effect can be detected\u201d. The study still advised caution before racing a two-year-old. 4. Improve post-racing retirement and tracking Last week Racing Victoria announced an additional $25m investment in the retirement, retraining, and humane euthanasia of racehorses. It also promised an audit of industry retirement statistics \u2013 which inaccurately state that less than 1% of racehorses go to slaughter \u2013 and supports the development of a national horse traceability register, which is currently the subject of a senate inquiry. A traceability scheme would provide accurate data on the whole-of-life trajectory for racehorses \u2013 and other horses \u2013 and provide the number and provenance of horses killed at knackeries or export slaughterhouses. It could also be used to discourage indiscriminate and excessive breeding by requiring breeders to pay a levy to register a foal at birth, and tackle what is known as \u201cwastage\u2019\u201d in the thoroughbred industry. 5. Ban tongue ties A tongue tie is a rubber band that is wrapped around the horse\u2019s tongue and then around their lower jaw. It is designed to prevent the horse from getting its tongue over the bit, which makes it difficult to control, and it is commonly used in both thoroughbred and standardbred (harness) racing. The racing industry says it also helps keep a horse\u2019s airways clear so it can breathe more easily. A 2002 study said that ties may prevent dorsal displacement of the soft palate in individual cases but is \u201cnot effective in the majority\u201d. DDSP can limit oxygen intake and decrease athletic performance. Animal welfare groups have called for it to be banned, saying they increase stress and can cause lacerations, bruising and swelling. Germany banned their use in racing in 2018 and they are also banned by the peak global body for equestrian sports, the FEI.",

In Adam Le Fondre, Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107, Kosta Barbarouses and Alex Baumjohann the Sky Blues have perhaps the most fearsome front four in the competition. After the mixed success of Siem de Jong, Jop van der Linden and Reza Ghoochannejhad, tellingly all four are proven competitors in the A-League. It\u2019s one thing relying on the tapes from overseas, it\u2019s another knowing that a player can perform week-in, week-out in Australian conditions.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, Hoolahan\u2019s injury has already torn asunder Newcastle Jets\u2019 off-season plans. A quintessentially Ernie Merrick kind of player, with an eye for both goal and pass, as well as brilliant from set pieces, Hoolahan is not just a star, but a playmaker that elevates those around him. There are plenty of willing workers in Newcastle\u2019s squad \u2013 but players like Jason Hoffman become twice as effective when fed by teammates of Hoolahan\u2019s calibre. Abdiel Arroyo has shown he\u2019s a useful target man \u2013 an essential piece of the puzzle \u2013 but he\u2019ll never be a 20-goal-a-season player without the guile of a Hoolahan, while Bobby Burns and Matt Ridenton will prove handy, but are more budget-appropriate signings than big-money x-factors.</p> <p>Offering no excuses in the finances department is the league\u2019s richest club, Melbourne Victory, who like Newcastle ran into a side over the weekend whose visa signings have already integrated brilliantly, as Mark Rudan\u2019s stars illuminated the first ever Victory-Western United derby.</p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxOeVyZUBNw\">Tim Cahill\u2019s 40m derby wonder-strike</a>, sometimes big money conjures pure magic. Alessandro Diamanti\u2019s instinctive improvised finish was of the highest quality. A world-class player elevating a contest, raising the spirits of his teammates, and sending fans home in rapture.</p> <p>While Filip Kurto\u2019s ability is well known to Rudan, it has been the performances of his three other visa signings that have Western United charging out of the blocks in their debut season.</p> <p>If Diamanti \u2013 a quixotic talent and personality that Rudan has already admitted can both delight and frustrate \u2013 is the brain, then Panagiotis Kone is the heart. More than just a box-to-box worker, he\u2019s demonstrated a cultured array of passing, excellent tempo management and a goal and assist in just four games. Behind both of those is the unsung Dario Jertec. The midfield screen to protect the defence, Jertec displays excellent game awareness as well as high technical proficiency.</p> <p>More than any other team, Rudan\u2019s four visa signings have played 98% of all possible minutes \u2013 they\u2019re not just squad contributors, they\u2019re the spine of the team.</p> <p>The same can\u2019t be said for Marco Kurz\u2019s foreign army, who after the high-profile departures of Keisuke Honda, Terry Antonis, Barbarouses, James Troisi and veteran skipper Carl Valeri, always looked like they would have big shoes to fill.</p> <p>Ola is Ola. One of the highest quality recruits the A-League has ever seen \u2013 and there\u2019s no indication that he\u2019s lost any hunger or ability over the off-season. Scoring Victory\u2019s opener, and creating their second, there\u2019s little more the skipper could have done individually.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/oct/31/david-squires-on-sydney-derby-bragging-rights-and-a-scene-investigation\">David Squires on ... Sydney derby bragging rights and a crime scene investigation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Injury to Tim Hoogland is a blow \u2013 despite solid cover in the position. But it\u2019s the midfield three of Kristijan Dobras, Migjen Basha and Jakob Poulsen that have Victory fans shifting uncomfortably.</p> <p>A debut goal albeit via deflection may help Dobras settle, but from Basha and Poulsen, despite the evident quality, it\u2019s as if Kurz has signed two halves. Put them together and you\u2019ve got a 68-year-old midfielder, commanding huge wages, while still struggling to exert half the influence of the departed Valeri.</p> <p>It\u2019s no coincidence that the top four clubs early on have done better than average business with their visa signings, with Western Sydney Wanderer\u2019s Pirmin Schwegler and Daniel Lopar already contenders for signing of the season, and \u201cder Fu\u00dfball Gott\u201d Alexander Meier showing hints of his class, despite still building fitness.</p> <p>Melbourne City are an aberration, but like Wanderers they\u2019ve been able to call on high-quality youngsters to cover injury to their foreign legion, and boast an in-form marquee in Jamie Maclaren.</p> <p>There are a host of factors that go into a successful A-League campaign, but foreign signings firing is one of the most important. It raises the playing standard on the pitch, the morale in the dressing room, and the sense of excitement on the terraces. But get it wrong and this circular and cumulation causation works in reverse.</p>",

A quintessentially Ernie Merrick kind of player, with an eye for both goal and pass, as well as brilliant from set pieces, Hoolahan is not just a star, but a playmaker that elevates those around him. There are plenty of willing workers in Newcastle\u2019s squad \u2013 but players like Jason Hoffman become twice as effective when fed by teammates of Hoolahan\u2019s calibre. Abdiel Arroyo has shown he\u2019s a useful target man \u2013 an essential piece of the puzzle \u2013 but he\u2019ll never be a 20-goal-a-season player without the guile of a Hoolahan, while Bobby Burns and Matt Ridenton will prove handy, but are more budget-appropriate signings than big-money x-factors. Offering no excuses in the finances department is the league\u2019s richest club, Melbourne Victory, who like Newcastle ran into a side over the weekend whose visa signings have already integrated brilliantly, as Mark Rudan\u2019s stars illuminated the first ever Victory-Western United derby. Like Tim Cahill\u2019s 40m derby wonder-strike, sometimes big money conjures pure magic. Alessandro Diamanti\u2019s instinctive improvised finish was of the highest quality. A world-class player elevating a contest, raising the spirits of his teammates, and sending fans home in rapture. While Filip Kurto\u2019s ability is well known to Rudan, it has been the performances of his three other visa signings that have Western United charging out of the blocks in their debut season. If Diamanti \u2013 a quixotic talent and personality that Rudan has already admitted can both delight and frustrate \u2013 is the brain, then Panagiotis Kone is the heart. More than just a box-to-box worker, he\u2019s demonstrated a cultured array of passing, excellent tempo management and a goal and assist in just four games. Behind both of those is the unsung Dario Jertec. The midfield screen to protect the defence, Jertec displays excellent game awareness as well as high technical proficiency. More than any other team, Rudan\u2019s four visa signings have played 98% of all possible minutes \u2013 they\u2019re not just squad contributors, they\u2019re the spine of the team. The same can\u2019t be said for Marco Kurz\u2019s foreign army, who after the high-profile departures of Keisuke Honda, Terry Antonis, Barbarouses, James Troisi and veteran skipper Carl Valeri, always looked like they would have big shoes to fill. Ola is Ola. One of the highest quality recruits the A-League has ever seen \u2013 and there\u2019s no indication that he\u2019s lost any hunger or ability over the off-season. Scoring Victory\u2019s opener, and creating their second, there\u2019s little more the skipper could have done individually. Injury to Tim Hoogland is a blow \u2013 despite solid cover in the position. But it\u2019s the midfield three of Kristijan Dobras, Migjen Basha and Jakob Poulsen that have Victory fans shifting uncomfortably. A debut goal albeit via deflection may help Dobras settle, but from Basha and Poulsen, despite the evident quality, it\u2019s as if Kurz has signed two halves. Put them together and you\u2019ve got a 68-year-old midfielder, commanding huge wages, while still struggling to exert half the influence of the departed Valeri. It\u2019s no coincidence that the top four clubs early on have done better than average business with their visa signings, with Western Sydney Wanderer\u2019s Pirmin Schwegler and Daniel Lopar already contenders for signing of the season, and \u201cder Fu\u00dfball Gott\u201d Alexander Meier showing hints of his class, despite still building fitness. Melbourne City are an aberration, but like Wanderers they\u2019ve been able to call on high-quality youngsters to cover injury to their foreign legion, and boast an in-form marquee in Jamie Maclaren. There are a host of factors that go into a successful A-League campaign, but foreign signings firing is one of the most important. It raises the playing standard on the pitch, the morale in the dressing room, and the sense of excitement on the terraces. But get it wrong and this circular and cumulation causation works in reverse.",

In an email sent to staff and obtained by Guardian Australia, Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy addresses what he says are \u201ca number of allegations regarding the conduct of a Treasury employee\u201d that have circulated among staff. \u201cI am taking appropriate steps to investigate the allegations,\u201d the note from Kennedy says. \u201cI want to assure you that we have robust processes and procedures, including independent reviews, to deal with such matters, and these are being closely followed.\u201d News of the investigation into Flavel was first reported by The West on Saturday. On Monday Scott Morrison was asked about the investigation, telling reporters on his visit to Bangkok that allegations regarding a public servant working for the Department of Treasury \u201cwould be\u201d a matter for the secretary. \u201cThere is a proper process that would follow in those circumstances and my job would be to ensure that I allowed those proper processes to be followed and reach their conclusions,\u201d he said. Flavel was appointed deputy secretary of Treasury\u2019s corporate services and business strategy group in July 2017, and was serving in that role until the final week of October this year. His LinkedIn profile still lists his current position as deputy secretary for Treasury, where it states he has worked for the past 16 years. Flavel was previously the head of the budget policy division, responsible for the delivery of three federal budgets. While not commenting on the nature of the allegations against Flavel, the email from Kennedy says that his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d is the welfare of staff. \u201cI want all employees to feel comfortable to raise difficult matters at any time, without fear of any adverse action. I want every Treasury employee to feel safe in the knowledge that these matters will be dealt with sensitively and respectfully.\u201d The email encourages staff to take up support through the department\u2019s \u201cwellbeing team\u201d or through an external employee assistance provider, with the assurance that conversations will be treated \u201cin strict confidence\u201d. Hansard for Senate estimates on 23 October records that Flavel was in attendance and he was still described as the deputy secretary. But when Labor senator Jenny McAllister asked Treasury officials for an updated organisational chart, the new chart omitted Flavel\u2019s name and Damien White was listed as acting deputy secretary of the corporate services group. White told Senate estimates he had taken up the role that week. Asked how long he would hold it, White replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, but according to the secretary, probably at least a month.\u201d McAllister declined to pursue the reason for the changes, instead asking officials why just nine women and 28 men had been recruited in the 2019 graduate cohort.

Emailing Flavel\u2019s Treasury account prompts an automatic reply describing him as \u201ccurrently on leave\u201d and directing inquiries to White. A Treasury spokeswoman confirmed that Flavel is still a Treasury employee but he is \u201cnot currently on duty\u201d. The spokeswoman refused to rule out that Flavel had been suspended and is subject to a disciplinary investigation, replying: \u201cFor privacy reasons, the Treasury does not comment on individual staffing matters. \u201cThe Treasury takes seriously all comments made in relation to staff and has rigorous processes in place to address staffing matters as they arise.\u201d The department refused to answer further questions about the nature of the investigation against Flavel, nor explain how it would be conducted independently.",

      "bodyText": "British schools are being offered a programme for morning assemblies that are entirely secular and free of religion for the first time. All state schools in the UK are currently required to provide an act of daily worship of a \u201cbroadly Christian character\u201d under the 1944 Education Act. But Humanists UK, the campaign group for secularism and non-religious belief, has drawn up an alternative model that takes God out of daily school assemblies, focusing instead on respect for the individual, the environment and justice for the developing world. The group says its 200 inclusive assemblies will cover 30 diverse themes in Key Stages 1 to 5. The programme, called Assemblies for All, will promote no particular religion or belief, making it suitable for all pupils regardless of their religious or non-religious background, the group claims. A website pointing teachers to scripts, presentations, videos and speaking notes which they can download in order to build their secular alternative morning assemblies is due to go live on Monday. Teaching staff are also being offered a calendar of 250 events and anniversary dates relevant to themes ranging from anti-bullying to environmental action, the group said. Humanists UK\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Copson, said: \u201cSchools are increasingly turning away from providing compulsory Christian worship despite it being required by the law, and instead want to replace it with inclusive assemblies which welcome all pupils regardless of their religious or non-religious background. Now teachers have a one-stop shop of high-quality, inclusive assemblies with hundreds of resources to draw upon. \u201cWe encourage teachers to make use of this great new hub so that they can offer truly inclusive and welcoming assemblies to their pupils.\u201d In July, Humanists UK announced it was supporting Lee and Lizanne Harris, two English parents bringing a legal case to try to make schools provide a meaningful alternative for those pupils withdrawn from collective worship. They withdrew their children from assembly at Burford primary school in Oxfordshire after their children expressed unhappiness at watching various Bible stories, including the crucifixion, being acted out as part of collective worship. The pair, whose case comes to court on 26 November, welcomed Humanist UK\u2019s initiative for alternative assemblies. They said: \u201cWe withdrew our children from assembly after discovering that they were being made to not only say prayers, but were also exposed to evangelical preachers who had some very harmful, divisive views. \u201cOurs is a state community school with no religious ethos so we were alarmed to see this level of religious interference creeping into our children\u2019s education.

Musician Stephen Morris was reunited with the 310-year old violin made by David Tecchler on Friday night after leaving it on a Southeastern train last month, prompting a nationwide appeal for its return. Tired after a long day recording at Abbey Road studios, Morris left the violin on the London Victoria to Orpington train when he got off at Penge East for his home in Sydenham. The man who picked it up was initially treated as a suspect when CCTV images of him with the violin were released by the British Transport Police (BTP) last week. After publication of the appeal last Thursday, which has since been deleted by the police, a man referring to himself as \u2018Gene\u2019 contacted Morris via Twitter to say he recognised the person in the picture. There then followed an intense period of negotiation led by Morris\u2019s friend Mike Pannett, a former Scotland Yard police officer. Morris, who met Pannett on a fly fishing trip to the Outer Hebrides in the 1990s, said his friend was the \u201cengine room\u201d of the operation to recover the violin.

He\u2019s equally effective on either side and he\u2019s playing well for us so we trust him to do a good job for us whichever side I choose to play him on.

We don\u2019t have a particularly low block.

      "bodyText": "Anyway, I\u2019ll be off. The fun doesn\u2019t stop, though: Ben Fisher is all over Everton v Tottenham like moss on a riverside boulder. Bye! I disagree with my colleague on that Evans tackle. A red card would have been extremely harsh, in my opinion. Ed Aarons was our man at Selhurst Park. Here\u2019s his match report: They couldn\u2019t do it again, could they? As Leicester supporters will tell you, stranger things have happened. Another victory for Brendan Rodgers\u2019s clinical side means they have now amassed one more point at this stage than during the title-winning season in 2015\u201116, with Caglar Soyuncu\u2019s header and Jamie Vardy\u2019s late strike ensuring they moved back above Chelsea into third spot. Yet if they are to stand a chance of keeping pace with Liverpool and Manchester City when it really matters, Rodgers must know they will need more than their fair share of luck. That was certainly the case here as Jonny Evans was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card for scything down Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 a few minutes before his defensive partner popped up with opening goal. Much more here: Jamie Vardy is not visibly excited: It was a big result. We knew it was going to be tough. We\u2019ve struggled here in the past so to get the three points and a clean sheet, we\u2019re obviously over the moon. Do you know what it is, I\u2019m just taking each game as it comes. I\u2019m getting a lot of chances fed to me by my team-mates and at the minute I\u2019m taking them. I\u2019ll knuckle down this week during training, get a little big more practice in and look forward to the game next week. 90+6 mins: It\u2019s done! Suyuncu\u2019s first goal for Leicester, and Vardy\u2019s squillionth, take the Foxes third! 90+2 mins: Leicester hit the post! Chilwell is picked out by Praet\u2019s long, lovely free-kick, his first touch is fabulous, and with Guaita already on the ground he needs only to sidefoot into the net from an acute angle! He sidefoots into the far post. 90+1 mins: There will be at least six minutes of stoppage time. It starts with Maddison applauding the away fans on his way off, and Dennis Praet coming on. Leicester pocket the points! It\u2019s a nice little move: Tielemans\u2019 pass infield to Gray, running from the centre to the left; Gray\u2019s dummy; Vardy\u2019s first-time pass; Gray\u2019s pull-back; Vardy\u2019s finish, which lacks punch but has enough precision. 87 mins: A rare non-stoppage: Tomkins\u2019 tackle on Vardy is absolute precision. 86 mins: Morgan\u2019s first impact is on Benteke\u2019s head. Free kick. 84 mins: Somehow it felt like there were very few stoppages in the first half, but the second half has been almost entirely stoppage. Leicester bring Wes Morgan on in place of Barnes. 83 mins: Cahill is bleeding from a head wound. It might be the same one he suffered back in the 66th minute, recently reopened, or a new one. It\u2019s so very hard to tell. 81 mins: Soyuncu is booked now, or a foul on McCarthy. 80 mins: Meyer takes on a defender but loses it; Barnes takes on a defender but loses it. There\u2019s been a lot of unsuccessful taking-on today. 77 mins: Palace roll the dice. James McCarthy replaces James McCarthur, confusingly, and Christian Benteke replaces Ayew. 76 mins: It remains a frustratingly scrappy game. Zaha cuts onto his left foot but Evans blocks it, and then when the ball rebounds into the air beats Ayew to that as well. 74 mins: The afternoon\u2019s first substitution sees Kouyate come off and Max Meyer come on. Leicester meanwhile take Perez off and bring on Demarai Gray. 72 mins: Zaha finds Ward on the right of the area. He cuts inside, but his left-footer from the edge of the area is held by Schmeichel (and had to be, with McArthur closing down maniacally, arms whirling in desperation). 69 mins: Palace want a penalty! A corner is headed to Schlupp on the edge of the area, whose shot comes off Chilwell. They think he used his hand. He didn\u2019t. 66 mins: Palace win a free kick just inside the Leicester half. Milivojevic tosses it into the area, where four players rise to head it and three head each other. Cahill, Kouyate and Evans all require treatment, but all appear to have survived the experience. 63 mins: Tomkins tackles Vardy as the striker threatens to run clear, and then handles to make sure he doesn\u2019t take the ball right back again. Another booking. 60 mins: Had the ball not flicked off Van Aanholt, it may well have been cleared. But the real issues took place behind him, with an emphatic lack of attention. Anyway, Van Aanholt tries to make up for it with a shot from 30 yards, but though vicious it\u2019s also off-target. Um, marking, anyone? Maddison\u2019s corner dips at the near post, skims off the head of Van Aanholt and finds Soyuncu in the middle, entirely alone, and stooping to head in from six yards. At no stage in the defender\u2019s run from the edge of the area was anyone paying him any attention whatsoever! 56 mins: Save! Maddison\u2019s corner lands on the head of Evans, eight yards out. His header is goalbound but straight down the middle, and Guaita tips it over the bar! 55 mins: It\u2019s a fine cross, but Ward heads it clear. 54 mins: The referee gets his book out again, deciding that Schlupp pulled back Pereirra. Leicester have a hand free kick on the right flank. 51 mins: Oooh! Kouyate now pops up on the right, and his low cross is missed by Ayew at the near post and then prevented from presenting a tap-in at the far by Pereira\u2019s outstretched toe. 48 mins: Kouyate nicks the ball from Ndidi on the edge of the area, then as it rolls away he gets to it again just before a Leicester player. This time Evans arrives late and leaves him emphatically flattened, Evans becoming the first player to be booked today. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! Leicester start the second half with a hearty lump down the left and into touch. The players are back out, and ready for more. Maddison emerges from the tunnel engaged in very chummy conversation with the referee. \u201cWith both sides comfortable counter attacking, do the conditions help either in this spectacle?\u201d wonders Roger Allen. \u201cI\u2019m thinking Palace edges it as the home side, enjoying showery conditions slowing the visitors up marginally. As I am following this via MBM only here in the States, I was trying to get a sense of the atmospherics.\u201d It has been raining, but not very strongly. It isn\u2019t particularly windy in London today. In short, I\u2019d say the conditions aren\u2019t making much of a difference. It hasn\u2019t been the wonderful advert for English top-flight football that we were all hoping for. A goal might liven things up, he wrote hopefully. 45+2 mins: Zaha skips away from Pereira again and the referee blows his whistle again, but this time it\u2019s for half-time! 45+1 mins: There will be one minute of stoppage time, though it\u2019s been a game of very few stoppages. 44 mins: Van Aanholt takes a very strange free kick, which Tomkins controls with his arm, and Leicester have a free kick of their own. 43 mins: Zaha is taken out with maximum cynicism by Pereira, trying to stop the winger from making it into the penalty area. He gets away without a booking, and even has the temerity to shake his head at the referee in apparent frustration. 40 mins: Palace have had a shot on target now! Zaha is tackled in the area but the ball rolls out to Schlupp, whose effort deflects into the air and would have dropped under the bar had Schmeichel not tipped it over. 39 mins: Tielemans\u2019 super pass takes out four opponents but is fractionally too long for Vardy. 35 mins: Hodgson may not think his Palace are a counter-attacking team, but they\u2019re certainly playing like one. Leicester have had 63% of possession so far, all the corners and every shot on target. 33 mins: Maddison, fouled by Ayew, lifts the free kick towards Pereira, whose last-minute dash into the box has gone untracked. It doesn\u2019t find him, but Guaita and Cahill do get into a bit of a mess about who should deal with the ball, and as a result neither of them do. It bounces wide of an empty goal. 30 mins: Tielemans shoots over from Maddison\u2019s low corner. So far we\u2019ve had lots of rushed shooting, but little precision or quality. 28 mins: Perez runs unto Vardy\u2019s header and sprints from his own half into space behind the Palace defence. Barnes is the only team-mate to offer any support, though, and he insists on running and staying offside so Perez has to go on alone, and Van Aanholt eventually gets back to tackle. 27 mins: Of greater concern to Kasper Schmeichel is the torrent of crumpled red and blue paper which is being tossed into his goalmouth by fans in the stand behind the goal. 26 mins: A succession of inaccurate crosses from Palace ends with Van Aanholt\u2019s inaccurate shot. 22 mins: At the other end McArthur cuts in from the right, scuffs his way past a couple of challenges and then shoots wide from the 18-yard line, with Zaha over to the left gesticulating and screaming in frustration and anguish at being ignored. 20 mins: Now a Leicester corner is won by Evans, who heads over from 10 yards. 19 mins: Chance for Leicester! It starts with a fabulous first-time flick from Barnes in his own half, which finds Maddison. His ball to Vardy is also great, and he hares into the left side of the area and, with Perez sprinting to offer him a crossing option, hits the goalkeeper. 17 mins: Palace win a free kick deep on the right, which Milivojevic curls over the area and out of play for a goal kick. 14 mins: Palace\u2019s 4-5-1 is frustrating Leicester so far, with the visitors failing to find any space in the attacking third (Van Aanholt dozing excepted). 12 mins: A dozing Van Aanholt has his pocket picked by Perez, and is lucky that the resulting low cross picks out a defender, and is cleared. 10 mins: And another Ayew shot! Zaha\u2019s fine pass with the outside of his right foot sets him off, but he should probably have instead tried to feed McArthur as he burst into the box. Instead he has a wild effort of his own, from 20-odd yards. 8 mins: A sniff for Palace! Ayew passes to Zaha on the left, who gives it to Schlupp, whose backheel finds Ayew again, but his shot in blocked. 8 mins: A couple of tasty challenges: Cahill\u2019s elbow smacks Perez\u2019s head on the way down from winning a header, and a few moments later Tielemans trips Ayew. Neither is worth a caution. 5 mins: Shot! Leicester burst forward on the break, Tielemans passes to Barnes on the left, and his right-footed shot from just outside the area is straight at Guaita. 5 mins: Palace work the ball into the Leicester area, but once there McArthur is swiftly dispossessed. 3 mins: Little action as yet. Leicester have had a gentle foray down the right and a half-hearted push down the left. 1 min: Peeeeep! Crystal Palace gt the game started, with the traditional hoof down the left flank. In case you\u2019re wondering why Crystal Palace\u2019s players are wearing black armbands today, the club says this is in memory of \u201cdear friend and colleague Ady, who sadly passed away yesterday\u201d. Adem Gredelj was their first team security officer. There\u2019s a tiny bit more info here. And out they come! We\u2019re just moments away from actual action now! The players are in the tunnel, Palace eschewing the modern trend of emerging in zip-up keep-warm long-sleeved training tops to just go with short sleeves from the off. I can\u2019t even begin to offer an explanation for this: On Sky, Andy Hinchliffe is then asked for his thoughts on the game. \u201cThey are a counter-attacking team, Crystal Palace,\u201d he says. Fight! Roy Hodgson also has a natter. He\u2019s feeling very chatty indeed: a couple of gentle prods from the interviewer and he\u2019s off: Wilf can play on either side, there\u2019s no problem with that at all. He\u2019s equally effective on either side and he\u2019s playing well for us so we trust him to do a good job for us whichever side I choose to play him on. The fact is we aren\u2019t blessed with a lot of goalscorers, everyone knows that. The ones we got are doing a good enough job, I think. I hear us described as a counter-attacking team but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accurate description. We don\u2019t have a particularly low block. We play quite high at the back, as high as probably any team in the league, and we are quite happy to get forward and we have midfield players who are good on the ball. So if sometimes we have been forced into counter-attacking mode it\u2019s because Man City are very good with the ball, as were Arsenal in the second half, and it\u2019s not easy to get it back sometimes. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve been delighted with that result. It\u2019s a nice thing to enjoy, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re buoyed by it and it must have done wonders for the team\u2019s confidence. But quite often this year we\u2019ll be playing a team on the back of a good result and they\u2019ll come here very confidently. It\u2019s a question of our preparation, our desire, our hunger, our preparation, our ability if you like to put the pieces of our game together that we need to put together.If we can do that I think we\u2019re in for a good game. Brendan Rodgers has a chat: The consistency of the team\u2019s important. We\u2019ve tweaked it a few times but in the main the consistency has been there. The last four games against Palace Leicester have lost, so we have an opportunity today to change that. We have a great group of players. The idea is to keep improving, keep developing. It\u2019s a game of patience.We\u2019ll need to be persistent int he game. They\u2019ve only conceded three and score four at home. So it\u2019s probably going to be a tight game. We need to work the ball, keep our patience, keep our tactical discipline. If it\u2019s tight we\u2019ve got to stay calm and if the opportunities come we need to take them. The key for us is to perform well. Today\u2019s teams are in! Leicester stick with the side that smashed Southampton, Palace bring in Schlupp against his former club, plus Guaita in goal. Townsend and Hennessey drop out: Crystal Palace: Guaita, Ward, Tomkins, Cahill, van Aanholt, Zaha, Kouyate, Milivojevic, McArthur, Schlupp, Ayew. Subs: Dann, Meyer, Hennessey, Benteke, McCarthy, Victor Camarasa, Kelly. Leicester: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell, Ndidi, Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Ward, Iheanacho, Praet. Referee: Paul Tierney. Here\u2019s the referee, Paul Tierney, performing the ancient and mystical \u201cTouching of the Ball\u201d ceremony at Selhurst Park earlier today. Hello world! Crystal Palace have run Leicester ragged over the last two seasons, doing the double over them twice and racking up 3-0, 4-1 and 5-0 wins along the way (along with a scrappy 1-0 win at Selhurst Park last December in which Luka Milivojevic scored with their only shot on target). But the day after the teams last met in February Claude Puel was sacked, and for Leicester everything has changed since. Under Brendan Rodgers this season the Foxes have lost just twice, at Old Trafford and Anfield, both times by a single (penalty) goal. So a third successive Palace double seems unlikely, but then achieving unlikely stuff is what has pushed them up to their current league position of ninth. Leicester would overtake Chelsea and go third if they win; Palace would move up one place with a draw but into fifth - fifth - if they win. Welcome all! Team news in a jiffy.",

In the heart of Boris Johnson\u2019s west London constituency, this former manor house hosted talks over the ill-fated treaty of Uxbridge in 1645, an abortive attempt to end the first English civil war, which arose from a battle between parliament and the executive and ultimately led to Charles I losing his head. Now the recently restored gastropub is about to bear witness to the consequences of another parliamentary fight: a general election with the possible prospect of a serving prime minister losing his seat. \u201cI think the youth vote will go against him and I think he\u2019s got a battle on his hands,\u201d said MaryJane Prendergast-Lister, 18, who works at the Crown and Treaty and will be a first-time voter. She said the focus would be on Brexit. For those her age, \u201cthis is their first opportunity to have their say, though maybe there\u2019s no point now,\u201d she said, dressed up for Halloween on the day Johnson had pledged that the UK would leave the EU.

The Senegal midfielder was at his rangy best throughout the match and provided the perfect opportunity for Palace to go ahead with a superb cross from the right, only for Jordan Ayew to barely make contact with the ball six yards out. It was to prove a costly miss.</p> \n<p>Having seen Guaita produce a fantastic save to tip over a bullet header from Evans moments earlier, Palace\u2019s defence should have been more alert for the next ball whipped in by Maddison. Yet a flick off the head of Patrick van Aanholt at the near post diverted the cross perfectly on to the forehead of the unmarked Soyuncu, who gleefully powered his effort home.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to win the league,\u201d sang the Leicester fans in the corner.</p> \n<p>Palace huffed and puffed but were kept at arm\u2019s length pretty comfortably before Vardy applied the <em>coup de gra\u0109e</em>, celebrating by mocking Palace supporters who had been on his back for most of the game.

That and last season\u2019s 4-1 win at the King Power Stadium in February, which prompted the sacking of Claude Puel, contributed to a 13-1 aggregate score in Palace\u2019s favour, yet this Leicester team are a different proposition altogether under Rodgers. This was always likely to be a tight affair and it took a moment of brilliant improvisation from Harvey Barnes to set up their first real chance. His backheel picked out James Maddison who played an inch-perfect pass for Vardy, only for Guaita to deny him from a tight angle. Evans headed the corner over the bar after a great delivery from Maddison. Palace also looked a threat in attack at times in the first half, although finding a way past Evans, Soyuncu and co in Leicester\u2019s defence is not easy these days. At the other end, Ricardo Pereira mysteriously decided not to head Maddison\u2019s free-kick towards the gaping goal after outjumping Gary Cahill and Guaita, otherwise the visitors could easily have taken the lead. Kasper Schmeichel was finally called into action five minutes before the break when he tipped over Schlupp\u2019s deflected shot from distance. A subdued start to the second half was brought to life when Evans could count himself lucky to escape a red card for flying in on Kouyat\u00e9 with a dangerous tackle. The Senegal midfielder was at his rangy best throughout the match and provided the perfect opportunity for Palace to go ahead with a superb cross from the right, only for Jordan Ayew to barely make contact with the ball six yards out. It was to prove a costly miss. Having seen Guaita produce a fantastic save to tip over a bullet header from Evans moments earlier, Palace\u2019s defence should have been more alert for the next ball whipped in by Maddison. Yet a flick off the head of Patrick van Aanholt at the near post diverted the cross perfectly on to the forehead of the unmarked Soyuncu, who gleefully powered his effort home. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the league,\u201d sang the Leicester fans in the corner. Palace huffed and puffed but were kept at arm\u2019s length pretty comfortably before Vardy applied the coup de gra\u0109e, celebrating by mocking Palace supporters who had been on his back for most of the game. It could have been an even bigger win had Ben Chilwell\u2019s late effort not come back off the post but Rodgers had to be satisfied with just the two goals this time. \u201cWhat they carry which unfortunately at the moment we could be accused of not carrying is a very clear goal threat,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cThat is the major difference. They are in the top four on merit because that\u2019s how well they are playing and that\u2019s how good their squad is.\u201d",

The pollution means I do not get many passengers, so going to a doctor is not affordable.\u201d</p> \n<p>The air pollution crisis is now an annual tradition in Delhi at this time of year, owing to a toxic mixture of smoke from celebration firecrackers, the burning of crop stubble by farmers in the neighbouring regions of Punjab and Haryana, and a cold shift in temperatures locking in the fumes.</p> \n<p>On Sunday the government environment monitoring agency Safar said there would no relief for at least another two days because of rain and humidity.</p> \n<p>Schools have been closed until at least Tuesday, construction work has been ordered to stop and the government has organised for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/02/five-million-pollution-masks-to-be-handed-to-delhi-residents\">5m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/02/five-million-pollution-masks-to-be-handed-to-delhi-residents\"> masks to be handed out</a>. From Monday the city will begin a trial run of a scheme in which cars with odd and even numbered licence plates can drive on alternate days. </p> \n<p>Many in Delhi say far stronger measures are needed, particularly to stop the main culprit, crop burning. Satellite imaging showed more than 3,000 incidents of stubble burning in neighbouring states last week. The practice is estimated to cause 44% of Delhi\u2019s pollution.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/sep/13/grid-giant-filters-clean-delhi-air-pollution-smog\">Could a grid of giant filters help clean up Delhi's polluted air?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rachel Rao, the vice-principal of Queen Mary\u2019s school in Delhi, said they had limited outdoor activities for pupils. \u201cOver the past 10 years the situation has been getting worse.

      "bodyText": "Pollution in Delhi has reached its worst levels so far this year, at almost 400 times the amount deemed healthy, causing planes to be diverted away from the city. A week on from Diwali, the thick brown smog that shrouded the city after the festival has shown no sign of shifting. On Friday a public health emergency was declared and Delhi\u2019s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city had turned into a \u201cgas chamber\u201d. By Sunday the air quality had deteriorated further, with the air quality index measuring over 900 in some areas, far exceeding the level of 25 deemed safe by the WHO, and well above even the 500 mark deemed \u201csevere plus\u201d. Visibility became so bad that more than 30 flights were redirected from Delhi airport. \u201cPollution has reached unbearable levels,\u201d said Kejriwal. Sachin Mathur, 31, an auto-rickshaw driver in north-west Delhi, said he had to stay outside for work and he had been struggling to breathe and could barely keep his eyes open on the roads. \u201cI have been driving auto on Delhi roads for the last three years and every year this time after Diwali, Delhi becomes like this,\u201d Mathur said. \u201cI am suffering from a throat infection and my eyes are burning. The pollution means I do not get many passengers, so going to a doctor is not affordable.\u201d The air pollution crisis is now an annual tradition in Delhi at this time of year, owing to a toxic mixture of smoke from celebration firecrackers, the burning of crop stubble by farmers in the neighbouring regions of Punjab and Haryana, and a cold shift in temperatures locking in the fumes. On Sunday the government environment monitoring agency Safar said there would no relief for at least another two days because of rain and humidity. Schools have been closed until at least Tuesday, construction work has been ordered to stop and the government has organised for 5m masks to be handed out. From Monday the city will begin a trial run of a scheme in which cars with odd and even numbered licence plates can drive on alternate days. Many in Delhi say far stronger measures are needed, particularly to stop the main culprit, crop burning. Satellite imaging showed more than 3,000 incidents of stubble burning in neighbouring states last week. The practice is estimated to cause 44% of Delhi\u2019s pollution. Rachel Rao, the vice-principal of Queen Mary\u2019s school in Delhi, said they had limited outdoor activities for pupils. \u201cOver the past 10 years the situation has been getting worse. We never used to see pollution like this,\u201d said Rao. \u201cThe past few days have been absolutely awful. We have seen many of our pupils falling sick and complaining of having difficulty breathing. \u201cBefore Diwali, we tried to spread awareness among our students about not burning firecrackers, in the hope they would bring that message back home. But the Delhi government, the Punjab government, the Haryana government and the central government should be coming up with better solutions rather than just blaming each other for the problem.\u201d Neeraj Sharma, 45, a businessman, said his 16-year-old son, a professional athlete, had been forced to stop his training this week because the pollution levels made it impossible to exercise. \u201cIt is very difficult to breathe in this weather, there is a bitter taste in the air,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cI think the government is very superficial in their approach to pollution control.

If you ask me, nothing will change, the situation will continue to go from bad to worse.\u201d Hospitals in the capital reported a surge in patients coming in with respiratory issues.

      "body": "<p>When Bernie Sanders was first asked about Beto O\u2019Rourke entering the presidential race, his reply was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanobles/status/1106362350196703232?lang=en\">dismissive</a>: \u201cFree country, anybody can run.\u201d But others thought O\u2019Rourke was a powerful new rival. The New York Times<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/us/politics/bernie-sanders-president-2020.html\">said</a> that Sanders\u2019 \u201cstronghold on the party\u2019s progressive wing has weakened\u201d because he was now \u201coutflanked on the left by rising stars\u201d like O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke debuted with a splash: a long, flattering profile in <em>Vanity Fair</em> in which O\u2019Rourke \u2013 to his later regret \u2013 said \u201cMan, I\u2019m just born to be in it.\u201d</p> <p>He was not, as it turned out, born to be in it.</p> <p>After the initial burst of publicity, Beto fizzled quickly. His poll numbers never got out of single digits, and at first he didn\u2019t seem to know what he stood for or why he stood for it. Eventually, he hit upon a signature issue: gun control. But his provocative rhetoric \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/09/12/760386808/orourke-promises-to-take-your-ar-15-but-americans-are-split-on-buybacks\">Hell yeah</a>, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15\u201d \u2013 seemed to backfire entirely, and he was accused of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/10/15/beto-orourke-gun-debate-229849\">hurting the cause</a>\u201d and even \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/politics/beto-orourke-guns-gun-control/index.html\">single-handedly dooming a gun control bill.</a>\u201d He continued to lack a following outside of Texas, a place where he could not even win a statewide election against the Senate\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/07/the-political-sociopath\">most reviled member</a>. Perhaps the only person who ever truly thought Beto O\u2019Rourke was likely to be president was Beto O\u2019Rourke.</p> <p>What, if anything, can we take from the brief, underwhelming presidential run of Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke? First, media hype does not a candidacy make. Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post<em> </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1107625123253755904\">declared</a> in March that \u201cBeto fundraising number[s] suggests Bernie now officially yesterday\u2019s news, faces stiff competition for youth vote\u201d. Indeed, Beto initially hauled in an impressive amount. But things change quickly in politics; remember that Rudy Giuliani and Jeb Bush were both once Republican frontrunners. Horse race pundits like to issue declarations and prophecies, but are just speculating. Political media is in constant need of new stories to tell, so we get a lot of \u201cCould Candidate X Be The Next Big Thing?\u201d coverage. The sensible thing to do is ignore most of this.

      "bodyText": "When Bernie Sanders was first asked about Beto O\u2019Rourke entering the presidential race, his reply was dismissive: \u201cFree country, anybody can run.\u201d But others thought O\u2019Rourke was a powerful new rival. The New York Times said that Sanders\u2019 \u201cstronghold on the party\u2019s progressive wing has weakened\u201d because he was now \u201coutflanked on the left by rising stars\u201d like O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke debuted with a splash: a long, flattering profile in Vanity Fair in which O\u2019Rourke \u2013 to his later regret \u2013 said \u201cMan, I\u2019m just born to be in it.\u201d He was not, as it turned out, born to be in it. After the initial burst of publicity, Beto fizzled quickly. His poll numbers never got out of single digits, and at first he didn\u2019t seem to know what he stood for or why he stood for it. Eventually, he hit upon a signature issue: gun control. But his provocative rhetoric \u2013 \u201cHell yeah, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15\u201d \u2013 seemed to backfire entirely, and he was accused of \u201churting the cause\u201d and even \u201csingle-handedly dooming a gun control bill.\u201d He continued to lack a following outside of Texas, a place where he could not even win a statewide election against the Senate\u2019s most reviled member. Perhaps the only person who ever truly thought Beto O\u2019Rourke was likely to be president was Beto O\u2019Rourke. What, if anything, can we take from the brief, underwhelming presidential run of Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke? First, media hype does not a candidacy make. Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post declared in March that \u201cBeto fundraising number[s] suggests Bernie now officially yesterday\u2019s news, faces stiff competition for youth vote\u201d. Indeed, Beto initially hauled in an impressive amount. But things change quickly in politics; remember that Rudy Giuliani and Jeb Bush were both once Republican frontrunners. Horse race pundits like to issue declarations and prophecies, but are just speculating. Political media is in constant need of new stories to tell, so we get a lot of \u201cCould Candidate X Be The Next Big Thing?\u201d coverage. The sensible thing to do is ignore most of this. Betomania was never likely to grip the country. We might also learn quite a simple lesson, namely that if you\u2019re going to run for president, it helps to have a good reason for it. A reason beyond being \u201cborn to be in it\u201d, that is. The Vanity Fair profile in which Beto debuted his national run was full of personal details about his life, such as his reading habits and his love of punk rock, but he didn\u2019t say much about what he wanted to do as president, beyond having the United States \u201clead the world\u201d. He also voiced uncertainty about being \u201cagainst\u201d things, saying he preferred to be \u201cfor\u201d things, which is fine if you specify the things you\u2019re for, but also a worrying sign that you\u2019re insufficiently outraged by injustice. You\u2019d think even Beto could have said he was against that, but he wouldn\u2019t even go so far as to say he was a progressive, saying he \u201c[didn\u2019t] know\u201d and was \u201cnot big on labels\u201d. Beto\u2019s campaign suffered from the same defect as Hillary Clinton\u2019s.

Most other nations do not use an adversarial system which can see children separated from their parents and lawyers via bulletproof glass in what is essentially an adult courtroom with a different sign on the door.</p>\n    <p>Officially, the focus in youth courts is on rehabilitation, tackling the underlying causes of youth offending. But although there has been an 88% drop in the number of children cautioned or convicted since 2007, reoffending rates have increased. Just over 40% of children who go to court reoffend within a year; for those sent to youth custody, that figure rises to 71.6%.</p>\n    <p>Children who end up in trouble now are disproportionately likely to be of black, Asian or minority ethnicity. They are vastly more likely to be in care and they are extremely likely to have ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and communication difficulties. This series examines how the court system deals with these vulnerable children and explores whether there is a better way to break the cycle of offending and help them build productive and fulfilling lives.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Through interviews, freedom of information requests and extensive research including a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/03/children-in-handcuffs-month-reporting-from-youth-court\">month covering every case</a> in Greater Manchester\u2019s youth court, one of England\u2019s busiest children\u2019s courtrooms, the Guardian has learned:</p> \n<p>\u2022 Cases involving children now take almost 40% longer than they did in 2010, with the slowest region, Sussex Central, taking 491 days on average to deal with a child from offence to conviction.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Reoffending rates for children are higher than they were ten years ago, with 40.9% of young people committing an offence within a year of being convicted or cautioned in 2017, compared with 28.3% of adults aged 21 or over.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-01T11:53:42/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Reoffending rates\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2019-11-01T11:53:42/embed.html\">Reoffending rates</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Looked-after children are still being prosecuted regularly for damaging their care homes or assaulting staff, contrary to justice guidelines for police and prosecutors.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The proportion of children who received a youth caution or sentence who were black, Asian or minority ethnic has almost doubled since 2010, from 14% to 27% in 2018.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Children are being brought to court in handcuffs and locked behind bulletproof glass in a secure dock after committing minor offences or breaches, despite courts being told to put only the most dangerous children in the dock.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Some children appear in court without legal representation or an appropriate adult (a parent or social worker) to support them.</p> \n<p>\u2022 So many youth courts have closed that gang members end up in the same waiting rooms as rivals from other areas, with sometimes violent results.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Thousands of children are left in limbo for months or even years when released \u201cunder investigation\u201d.

The boy scarcely remembered the assaults: perhaps because he had also been smoking cannabis and the highly addictive formerly legal high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/29/spice-so-called-zombie-drug-uk-poorest-communities\">spice</a>.</p> \n<p>The lawyer pleaded for the boy to not be sent to jail: \u201cWe are all aware of the effects on young men, particularly vulnerable young men, when they are in custody with older boys.\u201d It was then for the judge to decide whether the boy should be kept off the streets and sent to prison, where <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/proven-reoffending-statistics-july-to-september-2017\">statistics show</a> he would have a 71.6% chance of reoffending after mixing with the worst-behaved boys in the north of England, or rehabilitated in the community.

      "bodyText": "Straining to hear the judge from behind the bulletproof glass in the dock of court one, the 16-year-old pleaded guilty to a crime with the hallmarks of being committed by a child. He had burgled a McDonald\u2019s and been caught by police helping himself to a McFlurry. The other charges, all admitted, were less innocent: 12 sexual assaults, molesting younger girls from his school and youth club \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019ve got big breasts for a year 8,\u201d he told one \u2013 and groping a shopkeeper who had spotted him trying to steal another ice-cream. His lawyer stood up to address the court. There were mitigating circumstances, he told the district judge. His client had learning difficulties and was \u201csome years behind his chronological age\u201d. Last Christmas he was sectioned for a month with psychosis and had since been taking olanzapine, a drug for schizophrenia. The boy scarcely remembered the assaults: perhaps because he had also been smoking cannabis and the highly addictive formerly legal high spice. The lawyer pleaded for the boy to not be sent to jail: \u201cWe are all aware of the effects on young men, particularly vulnerable young men, when they are in custody with older boys.\u201d It was then for the judge to decide whether the boy should be kept off the streets and sent to prison, where statistics show he would have a 71.6% chance of reoffending after mixing with the worst-behaved boys in the north of England, or rehabilitated in the community. How best should a half-hour court hearing address the problems of a child with such complex needs? That question matters to everyone. But every day in youth courts across England and Wales, the fate of some of the most vulnerable \u2013 and occasionally dangerous \u2013 children in society is decided behind closed doors. The public are not allowed in, even those who accuse these young defendants of robbing, assaulting or defrauding them. Journalists rarely visit, deterred by reporting restrictions banning the identification of the young people involved. Yet the secrecy surrounding these courts masks what the children\u2019s commissioner, Anne Longfield, derides as a \u201cchaotic and dysfunctional\u201d system \u2013 an environment she believes is actively child unfriendly, which fails to rehabilitate so many of the young people who pass through it. There has been a dramatic fall in the number of children who end up in the criminal justice system, as the police and youth offending services have increasingly sought to deal informally with minor offending by children: 26,881 children aged 10-17 received a caution or conviction in England and Wales in 2018 compared with 225,000 in 2007, an 88% drop. But among this diminished cohort, children from minority ethnic backgrounds are disproportionately likely to end up in court and custody and are four times more likely than white children to be arrested, according to the latest youth justice report. Looked-after children are also vastly overrepresented, with those in care 13 times more likely to be criminalised than all other children, according to the Children\u2019s Rights Alliance for England. ADHD and autistic spectrum disorders abound, along with communication impairment and other learning difficulties.

      "bodyText": "How old are children in the youth court? Between 10 and 17. Sometimes 18-year-olds will appear if their case began before their 18th birthday or if they are accused of breaching a referral order imposed before they turned 18. Where are youth courts? Youth courts in England and Wales are held in magistrates court buildings. Some have dedicated youth courtrooms, but most use adult courts. How are youth courts different from adult courts? They are not open to the public. Unless a child is deemed particularly dangerous or has been remanded \u2013 sent to custody while awaiting trial or sentencing - they should appear in the main part of the courtroom rather than behind bulletproof glass in the dock. In practice, children often also appear in the dock if they have been arrested on a warrant and brought in from a police station overnight. Who hears the cases? Cases are either heard by a youth court bench of three or occasionally two magistrates trained in youth justice, or a district judge sitting alone. Magistrates are assisted on matters of law by a legally trained clerk who advises on the sentencing options available to them in each case. No one wears a wig or a formal gown, unlike in the adult crown court. Why do some children end up in the adult court? Children are tried at the crown court in cases of murder, serious firearms offences, some violent or sexual offences, some crimes related to terrorism or anything that would carry a realistic probability of a custodial sentence of more than two years. They also often appear in the crown court if they are accused alongside adults. What sentences can be passed in a youth court? Youth court magistrates or district judges have the power to sentence children to up to two years on a \u201cdetention and training order\u201d, which means the child spends half of the sentence in custody, in a secure training centre, secure children\u2019s home or young offenders institute; and half outside, under the supervision of the local youth justice service. Children aged 10 and 11 cannot be placed in custody, and there is a prohibition too for those aged 12 to 14 who are not persistent offenders. Custody should be used as a last resort and sentences cannot be less than four months, on the basis that short sentences are ineffective and damaging to children. Far more often, children are given a youth referral order, a community sentence in which the court \u201crefers\u201d the child to a youth offender panel convened by volunteer members of the community and held at an informal venue. For subsequent offences they can be given a more onerous youth rehabilitation order, which can include one or more of 18 requirements that the offender must comply with for up to three years. Usually this will incorporate some sort of unpaid work and will require them to take up certain activities, and they may be subject to a curfew using an electronic tag. The court can occasionally include a fostering requirement as part of the order, which will require the child or young person to reside with a local authority foster parent for up to a year. If the child has done something so serious they need to be imprisoned for longer, they will be committed for sentence at the crown court. Children cannot normally be given life sentences.

A person briefed on Jingye's thinking said the company wanted to preserve as many jobs as possible, but could not say how many of the company's 4,000 workers would keep their jobs. British Steel accounts for a third of UK production, so is seen as a key national asset in many quarters.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What went wrong at British Steel?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>When Greybull Capital bought British Steel in 2016 it promised great things. The private equity firm pledged to invest \u00a3400m and within months it was boasting of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/01/scunthorpe-steelworkers-enjoy-happy-outcome-to-act-of-faith\">return to profit and a bright future ahead</a>. Three years later it collapsed. In a letter to staff, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is Jingye?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Jingye emerged as the most likely owner after talks with Ataer, a division of the Turkish military pension fund Oyak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/british-steel-turkish-army-fund-takeover-in-danger-of-collapse\">fell through in October</a>. Founded in 1988 by a former Communist party official, Li Ganpo, the Chinese conglomerate has hotel and retail interests. However, steelmaking, which it started doing in the early 1990s, is now its primary focus: its Chinese mills produce about 15m tonnes of steel a year, exporting to 80 countries.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much is Brexit to blame?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is not the only factor in the crisis, but it is important and will remain crucial even if Jingye buys British Steel. Steel contracts are typically agreed well in advance of the product being delivered. As things stand, the UK is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/eu-agrees-brexit-extension-to-31-january-flextension\">due to leave the EU on 31 January after another delay,</a> and the terms of that separation are yet to be agreed, meaning British Steel\u2019s overseas customers do not know what tariffs will apply to steel they buy from the company. Sources close to the company said orders from customers in the EU and further afield had dried up as a result.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is the whole UK steel industry in trouble?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK steel industry has been in decline for some time because of a variety of factors such as overcapacity in EU steelmaking and Chinese state-subsidised firms flooding the global market with cheap product. An industry that employed 323,000 people in 1971 now employs less than a tenth of that, at 31,900. The closure of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/redcar-steel-plant-goes-into-liquidation\">Redcar steelworks in 2015</a>&nbsp;was a significant blow to the sector and left the UK with only two blast furnace steelworks: Scunthorpe and the Tata Steel-owned Port Talbot in south Wales.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Anna Turley, the Labour and Co-operative party MP for Redcar, who welcomed Li to British Steel\u2019s Teesside plant, said of the meeting: \u201cWe discussed the future and huge potential of British Steel, especially our proud steel community and workforce.

      "bodyText": "Preston moved to the top of the Championship table after Paul Gallagher scored from the penalty spot to give them victory at Charlton. The visitors, who had refused Stoke permission to talk to their manager, Alex Neil, on the eve of the match, earned a hard-fought win when Gallagher, on as a substitute, converted the spot-kick after Jayden Stockley was fouled. Charlton fought hard to the end of a bad-tempered match but remain in 10th place, with the defender Ben Purrington spurning a late chance to equalise after Declan Rudd failed to deal with a corner. Rudd was the first goalkeeper called into serious action, parrying an angled shot from Purrington after 16 minutes, and he was relieved when Conor Gallagher just failed to get a touch on a cross from the same player seconds later. It took Preston 21 minutes to test the Charlton keeper Dillon Phillips, who got down quickly to block a close-range shot by Tom Barkhuizen at the far post after two defenders had failed to clear Darnell Fisher\u2019s low cross from the left. After 31 minutes, Gallagher replaced the injured Daniel Johnson, and the midfielder took over the armband and started to run the game as Neil\u2019s side moved through the gears before half-time. Sean Maguire should have done better after 39 minutes when Tom Lockyer\u2019s slip allowed him a free run in from the left, but his final effort was a weak flick into the hands of Phillips. Maguire was wasteful again two minutes later, shooting high over the crossbar at the end of a quick Preston break before Barkhuizen, heading over unchallenged from Fisher\u2019s cross. Preston appealed for a penalty in the opening minutes of the second half when another cross by Fisher struck the raised arm of Jason Pearce. The visitors did get a penalty 10 minutes later, Pearce barging into Jayden Stockley as they challenged for a cross from the left. Gallagher converted in trademark style, turning his back on goal before turning and thumping the kick hard and low below the dive of Phillips. Barkhuizen nearly doubled the lead when he slid in at the far post, but was just unable to turn home Gallagher\u2019s corner. Charlton\u2019s Chuks Aneke just failed to connect with a curling free-kick from Josh Cullen after 82 minutes, but Preston went even closer to a second when Stockley headed narrowly over. Barkhuizen ran clear in stoppage time only for Phillips to save, and Charlton almost made them pay in the 95th minute, but Purrington was unable to force the ball home amid a crowd of bodies. West Brom can reclaim top spot on Monday night, when they travel to managerless Stoke.",

Completed just in time for the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fact that the majority of the \u20ac800,000 (\u00a3690,000) restoration costs were shouldered by a western German building association marks a significant moment in the long and embittered battle over the status of the East\u2019s cultural heritage in a reunified Germany.

      "body": "<p>When the Barclay brothers bought the Telegraph group for \u00a3665m in 2004, almost 1 million people read the UK\u2019s biggest selling broadsheet paper every day and a Harvard undergraduate called Mark Zuckerberg had recently changed the name of his startup to Facebook.</p> <p>Scroll forward 15 years and the fortunes of these two companies show how the media industry has been upended. Sales of the Daily Telegraph had fallen to 363,183 by the end of last year while pretax profits slumped from \u00a314m to less than \u00a31m. Just over a week ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/26/barclay-brothers-telegraph-up-for-sale-reports-claim\" title=\"\">it emerged that the billionaire twins have put the Telegraph media group up for sale</a> as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/28/telegraph-sale-could-herald-breakup-of-vast-barclays-empire\" title=\"\">a review of their business empire</a>. Offers are expected to be in the region of one third of the price the Barclays paid. Except, as ever with the media, the full story is not just about the numbers but about political power and personalities too.</p> <p>As this news emerged, Facebook was refusing to follow the lead of Twitter, its social media rival, by banning political advertising in the run up to elections on both sides of the Atlantic. Zuckerberg sniffed at the idea that this decision could be about money, saying that \u201cads from politicians\u201d would contribute less than 0.5% of the company\u2019s revenue next year. Given Facebook\u2019s $66bn (\u00a351bn) earnings in the year to September, this inconsequential amount could add up to about $330m next year \u2013 or roughly the cost of buying the entire Telegraph Media Group.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/28/telegraph-sale-could-herald-breakup-of-vast-barclays-empire\">Telegraph sale could herald breakup of vast Barclays empire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At first glance, the tale of this once venerable newspaper is a straightforward one of ageing newspaper barons attempting to sell off a fading business for financial and personal reasons. Having just turned 85, twins, Frederick and David, now have \u201cdifferent priorities\u201d for the future of the business. The former is said to be keener to sell than David, whose sons, Aidan and Howard, take an active role in TMG.</p> <p>This family dynamic partly explains why they would consider selling just a year into a corporate turnaround led by a chief executive, Nick Hugh, appointed in 2017. After years of radical cost cutting \u2013 with six daily editors in 12 years \u2013 the company hired an extra 39 journalists last year and announced a new digital investment strategy based on subscriptions. Profits were partly dented by a \u00a32.7m reorganisation cost, due to earlier redundancies and a platform development write-off.</p> <p>Operating profits have fallen as sales staff have been told to offer ever lower deals to keep readers on board \u2013 I know this as someone who tried to end her own cut-price subscription package and was given two extensions.</p> <p>Owners tend to attempt to massage their profits upwards in readiness for a sale, which suggests that this is not necessarily a fire sale by a family in need. Hence the fact that advisers have not yet been appointed officially; people close to the company suggest that any sale could take up to 24 months.</p> <p>There is a more urgent financial issue concerning the firm\u2019s online retailer Shop Direct, which needs \u00a3150m to fund claims for payment protection insurance compensation, but the Ritz hotel in London, expected to be sold for more than 10 times the \u00a375m the Barclays paid for it, would be a far more straightforward way to finance this and any other expenses.</p> <p>None of this financial engineering detracts from the fact that the Telegraph is essentially the last remaining paper of note up for sale in the UK. DMGT, the owners of the Mail, have long been buyers not sellers, (indeed, the group is said to be circling the Telegraph); Rupert Murdoch, having sold his US TV business, appears happy to keep newspapers in his family business; the Guardian\u2019s trust-style structure makes a sale almost impossible. Other important newspapers have either more recently changed hands (the Financial Times and the Independent) or merged (the Mirror and the Express).</p> <p>This position as the last big British newspaper brand to be bought was underlined when <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/ex-donald-trump-strategist-steve-bannon-considers-daily-telegraph-purchase/\">Steve Bannon was reported</a> to be bringing together a consortium to buy the Telegraph, which he described as \u201cone of the great untapped properties\u201d.</p> <p>So, if there were a cash-rich oligarch waiting to pay big for a newspaper in a politically turbulent country, this might not be the worst time for the Barclays to let it be known that they are open to offers.</p> <p>In this scenario, trade buyers from the Mail owners to former editor David Montgomery and former chief executive Murdoch MacLennan are unlikely to be able to offer enough. The Amazon billionaire and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos would be able to pay a \u201ctrophy\u201d price, but his interest last year appears to have evaporated.</p> <p>Despite its dying readers, falling revenues and sometimes ethically dubious content (think of China Watch, its supplements provided by the state-run China Daily), the Telegraph could still be seen as a trophy of sorts. The paper and its owners have a well documented and cosy relationship with the current prime minister \u2013 who was until very recently a highly paid columnist. Both have also long backed Brexit \u2013 the brothers held a party at the Ritz in honour of Nigel Farage to celebrate the 2016 EU referendum result.</p> <p>As ever with the Barclays, much of this has to be speculation.

      "bodyText": "When the Barclay brothers bought the Telegraph group for \u00a3665m in 2004, almost 1 million people read the UK\u2019s biggest selling broadsheet paper every day and a Harvard undergraduate called Mark Zuckerberg had recently changed the name of his startup to Facebook. Scroll forward 15 years and the fortunes of these two companies show how the media industry has been upended. Sales of the Daily Telegraph had fallen to 363,183 by the end of last year while pretax profits slumped from \u00a314m to less than \u00a31m. Just over a week ago it emerged that the billionaire twins have put the Telegraph media group up for sale as part of a review of their business empire. Offers are expected to be in the region of one third of the price the Barclays paid. Except, as ever with the media, the full story is not just about the numbers but about political power and personalities too. As this news emerged, Facebook was refusing to follow the lead of Twitter, its social media rival, by banning political advertising in the run up to elections on both sides of the Atlantic. Zuckerberg sniffed at the idea that this decision could be about money, saying that \u201cads from politicians\u201d would contribute less than 0.5% of the company\u2019s revenue next year. Given Facebook\u2019s $66bn (\u00a351bn) earnings in the year to September, this inconsequential amount could add up to about $330m next year \u2013 or roughly the cost of buying the entire Telegraph Media Group. At first glance, the tale of this once venerable newspaper is a straightforward one of ageing newspaper barons attempting to sell off a fading business for financial and personal reasons. Having just turned 85, twins, Frederick and David, now have \u201cdifferent priorities\u201d for the future of the business. The former is said to be keener to sell than David, whose sons, Aidan and Howard, take an active role in TMG. This family dynamic partly explains why they would consider selling just a year into a corporate turnaround led by a chief executive, Nick Hugh, appointed in 2017. After years of radical cost cutting \u2013 with six daily editors in 12 years \u2013 the company hired an extra 39 journalists last year and announced a new digital investment strategy based on subscriptions. Profits were partly dented by a \u00a32.7m reorganisation cost, due to earlier redundancies and a platform development write-off. Operating profits have fallen as sales staff have been told to offer ever lower deals to keep readers on board \u2013 I know this as someone who tried to end her own cut-price subscription package and was given two extensions. Owners tend to attempt to massage their profits upwards in readiness for a sale, which suggests that this is not necessarily a fire sale by a family in need. Hence the fact that advisers have not yet been appointed officially; people close to the company suggest that any sale could take up to 24 months. There is a more urgent financial issue concerning the firm\u2019s online retailer Shop Direct, which needs \u00a3150m to fund claims for payment protection insurance compensation, but the Ritz hotel in London, expected to be sold for more than 10 times the \u00a375m the Barclays paid for it, would be a far more straightforward way to finance this and any other expenses. None of this financial engineering detracts from the fact that the Telegraph is essentially the last remaining paper of note up for sale in the UK. DMGT, the owners of the Mail, have long been buyers not sellers, (indeed, the group is said to be circling the Telegraph); Rupert Murdoch, having sold his US TV business, appears happy to keep newspapers in his family business; the Guardian\u2019s trust-style structure makes a sale almost impossible. Other important newspapers have either more recently changed hands (the Financial Times and the Independent) or merged (the Mirror and the Express). This position as the last big British newspaper brand to be bought was underlined when Steve Bannon was reported to be bringing together a consortium to buy the Telegraph, which he described as \u201cone of the great untapped properties\u201d. So, if there were a cash-rich oligarch waiting to pay big for a newspaper in a politically turbulent country, this might not be the worst time for the Barclays to let it be known that they are open to offers. In this scenario, trade buyers from the Mail owners to former editor David Montgomery and former chief executive Murdoch MacLennan are unlikely to be able to offer enough. The Amazon billionaire and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos would be able to pay a \u201ctrophy\u201d price, but his interest last year appears to have evaporated. Despite its dying readers, falling revenues and sometimes ethically dubious content (think of China Watch, its supplements provided by the state-run China Daily), the Telegraph could still be seen as a trophy of sorts. The paper and its owners have a well documented and cosy relationship with the current prime minister \u2013 who was until very recently a highly paid columnist. Both have also long backed Brexit \u2013 the brothers held a party at the Ritz in honour of Nigel Farage to celebrate the 2016 EU referendum result. As ever with the Barclays, much of this has to be speculation. The only public-facing conversations the twins have with the outside world tend to be via lawyers. This reached new levels of farce when Sir David was ordered to pay \u20ac6,000 (\u00a35,170) in moral damages to a French playwright who wrote an obscure play satirising the lives of the Barclays, as well as \u20ac5,000 to three theatre companies and \u20ac35,000 in legal costs. To think that the Murdochs have let Succession, a show that appears to be based on their travails, be broadcast to the world for two series. But at least the reclusive Barclays do not offer lengthy gushing videos on the virtues of press freedom, unlike Sheryl Sandberg, who explained Facebook\u2019s refusal to ban political ads, regardless of whether they are true or not, because \u201cwe believe in free expression, we believe in political speech, and ads can be an important part of that\u201d. \u201cAt times of social tension there has often been an urge to pull back on free expression,\u201d she said, entirely ignoring the fact that the urge is to pull back on misleading and devious information packaged as political advertising. Facebook\u2019s decision to carry on running political ads \u2013 which have been so tainted by scandals \u2013 would be foolhardy for any company worried about the weight of public opinion. But what if the opinion of the handful of politicians who want to continue paying for promotion is worth it, not for the money, but for the power they wield when discussing legislation. Legislation about regulation of technology platforms, let\u2019s say, or even insisting on full moderation of content. We have grown used to newspapers claiming to have no sway over politicians but we are moving fast into an age when far bigger and more powerful companies are allowing even more underhand methods to influence public opinion. The Telegraph may have become the Daily Boris, and the television broadcasters may tie themselves in knots over the next six weeks trying to organise political debates but, on Facebook, political parties can send messages straight to each voter\u2019s newsfeed, without anyone shouting about bias or asking them tricky questions. And that power is worth more than its weight in gold.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me, but what an eventful first WTA finals in Shenzhen this was. Four players withdrew from the tournament, including one of the alternates, but in the end the final was contested by defending champion and world number one. Barty produced one of the best matches of her career today and at just 23 years old, this is only the beginning. Despite how dramatically her life has changed this year, Barty has been consistent throughout this year and her form hasn\u2019t dipped. Here is Barty\u2019s speech after her milestone win. She\u2019s now off to Perth for the Fed Cup final against France. More trophies to come. Ashleigh Barty defeats Elina Svitolina 6-4 6-3: Year end number one, Roland Garros champion, WTA Finals champion and she just earnt the biggest prize money in tennis history ($4.42m) with her first ever win over Elina Svitolina. She served it out to love with ease, punishing Svitolina with her first serve before Svitolina netted a forehand on match point. Take a bow, Ashleigh Barty. That was a great game with both players at their best. Barty put so much pressure on Svitolina, generating break point after a mixture of delicate hands, great defence. Svitolina fought back, first with a couple of big serves. As Svitolina ground out the long rallies, Barty patiently attacked with her forehand. One game away. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 *5-3 Elina Svitolina: Ashleigh Barty breaks and will serve for the title! Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 4-3* Elina Svitolina: Great reaction from Svitolina, who breaks back just as it seemed like the match was getting away from her. Admittedly, she got some help from Barty, who double faulted at 30-30, but she finished with a very positive mood to the net. Her forehand down the line forced Barty to come up with a passing shot on her weaker wing, and she couldn\u2019t. Back on serve. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 *4-2 Elina Svitolina: That was pretty dire from Elina Svitolina. She seemed to be heading for another hold at 30-15, but then she threw in a couple of tentative errors followed by her first double fault of the match on break point. She is feeling the pressure and the world number one won\u2019t hesitate to punish her. Svitolina\u2019s British coach Andrew Bettles was on-court at the last changeover and he offered her plenty of encouragement: Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 3-2* Elina Svitolina: Barty consolidates the break back with a slick, quick love hold. After some great serving from the Aussie, she\u2019s back in the lead. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 *2-2 Elina Svitolina: Barty breaks straight back. With Svitolina cruising up 30-0, the Aussie played three stunning points in succession to break straight back. Her slice is working wonders and her forehand is backing it up incredibly. That concentration lapse could have dragged on for a while but Barty\u2019s resilience has been so impressive this year. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 1-2* Elina Svitolina: And here\u2019s the biggest challenge of facing Svitolina. Barty has played great so far, but she just suffered a short lapse in concentration here, throwing in a couple of loose, bad errors followed by a double fault on break point. Suddenly, Svitolina is up a break and flying. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 *1-1 Elina Svitolina: Very good work from Svitolina to break Barty\u2019s run of 3 successive games. The Aussie put a lot of pressure on her throughout, but Svitolina found a big forehands at 30-30, then a service winner at deuce. Finally, a missed return from Barty brought them level. It\u2019s difficult to overstate how impressive that set was from Barty. She served well, was patient with her aggression throughout and was creative whenever she could be, throwing in the odd dropshot and net foray to keep Svitolina guessing. Svitolina served great until that final game. She has to find her first serve on the important points. Stats: Barty: 19 winners and 18 unforced errors. Svitolina: 6 winners and 6 unforced errors from Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 1-0* Elina Svitolina: Barty opens the second set as she finished the first, serving well and finding her forehand whenever she can. First set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 Elina Svitolina: Ashleigh Barty takes the first set! That was some impressive resilience. Barty moved up 0-30 with two solid returns, but then threw in a couple of routine errors. It seemed like she had missed her chance at 40-30, but she kept on attacking and slotted two forehand winners to bring up set point. Barty missed a forehand on her first set point, then Svitolina slotted a passing shot past her on the second. Finally, Barty stepped in on Svitolina\u2019s second serve and snapped a forehand return winner to take the first set. That was a brilliant set of tennis. First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-4* Elina Svitolina: The service games are getting tighter now and Barty saves break point to secure a great hold. Barty led 40-30, but then Svitolina, who is just flying around the court now, played two incredible defensive points to eventually force a couple of errors and bring up break point. A costly netted forehand from Svitolina on the break point, but Barty earnt that hold with some great serving when needed.

      "bodyText": "The Daily Telegraph has been forced to correct a column written by Boris Johnson, after he falsely claimed the UK is set to \u201cbecome the largest and most prosperous economy in this hemisphere\u201d. The newspaper said that Johnson misrepresented long-term economic projections to give the impression that the British economy would overtake Germany \u201cin our lifetimes\u201d \u2013 despite no such data existing. Instead, the Telegraph admitted the claim was based on Johnson looking at a real economic forecast from the inter-governmental OECD organisation and predicting himself how the trends would continue. As a result, the claim \u201cwas the columnist\u2019s own extrapolation of this data beyond the timeframe of the forecast\u201d, the newspaper said. In addition, the newspaper admitted that the real economic data was only based on European countries, so in any case it could not justify Johnson\u2019s claim about the UK economy outperforming all nations in the northern hemisphere. Johnson\u2019s suggestion that the UK economy would overtake Germany \u201cin our lifetimes\u201d may also be up for debate, given that the legitimate OECD forecast only looked ahead to 2060. As a result, on the current predictions, even when Johnson is 94 years old the British economy would still be lagging some way behind its continental counterpart. The false claim was made in a column Johnson wrote in June shortly before he became prime minister about the failings of the British education system. This is the third time this year that the Daily Telegraph has been forced to issue a correction to material by Johnson, its star \u00a3275,000-a-year columnist, who is currently on leave from the news outlet while he serves as prime minister. In April the newspaper was forced to correct his claim that a no-deal Brexit was the most popular option among the British public, while this summer it partially corrected his claims about a convicted drug dealer. All the corrections followed successful complaints to the press regulator Ipso. Johnson was notorious at the Daily Telegraph for writing his column during a brief window on Sunday afternoons, before sending it to the outlet for publication in Monday\u2019s print edition. His copy would often arrive shortly before the Telegraph\u2019s print deadline, leaving little time for editors to make changes and fact-check his claims, according to individuals who had to deal with it. In his absence the newspaper\u2019s owners, the Barclay brothers, have tentatively begun the process of putting the outlet up for sale, shortly after they saw its profits crash in the middle of a turnaround plan to make it a digitally-focused news outlet. The Sunday Times has reported that Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, would be interested in buying it \u2013 although such a deal is unlikely, given there is no sign that Bannon has either the money or the team required to complete such a deal. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 November 2019.

The world\u2019s biggest climate polluter, Saudi Aramco is poised to announce the world\u2019s biggest stock flotation in an ultimate marriage of carbon and capital. Any institution with tens of millions of dollars and few qualms about the environment is invited. Entry is not as exclusive as it sounds. Individuals with a lot less cash and a lot more concern may also inadvertently find themselves as guests through pension funds that automatically track the stock markets. Scientists warn that fossil fuels and money will soon need to divorce because carbon emissions must be slashed by half over the next decade if the world is to have any chance of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level of 1.5C. Despite this, Aramco expects to receive the greatest infusion of cash in history. In the modern era, no company has a bigger carbon footprint than Saudi Aramco.

      "body": "<p>While street protests and riots in Barcelona continue to grab the headlines, deep in the woods of northern Catalonia another crisis is unfolding: a scarcity of wild mushrooms that is being blamed on climate change.</p> <p>Mushroom hunting is a serious and lucrative business in Catalonia when the autumn rains come and the precious fungi appear overnight on the damp woodland floor.

      "bodyText": "While street protests and riots in Barcelona continue to grab the headlines, deep in the woods of northern Catalonia another crisis is unfolding: a scarcity of wild mushrooms that is being blamed on climate change. Mushroom hunting is a serious and lucrative business in Catalonia when the autumn rains come and the precious fungi appear overnight on the damp woodland floor. But so far this season, mushrooms have been thin on the ground in Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain. A 20-year study carried out by Sergio de Miguel Maga\u00f1a and Juan Mart\u00ednez de Arag\u00f3n of the University of Lleida shows a decrease in the number of mushrooms throughout Catalonia. What mushrooms need to thrive is moisture and warm but not high temperatures, whereas the tendency in recent years has been towards dry autumns and, in 2017, a drought. Even one of the most common and popular species, the rovell\u00f3 (Lactarius deliciosus) is scarce this year, pushing prices up to around \u20ac30 a kilo. While fungi are a victim of the climate crisis, their absence may also exacerbate it as they are involved in carbon capture through their symbiotic relationship with trees. According to the Catalan Technological Forestry Centre, in some parts of the Pyrenees the quantity of mushrooms has declined 100-fold compared with last year, and in the foothills there has been a sevenfold decrease. Wild mushrooms are a key ingredient of autumnal cuisine in northern Spain, and restaurants and markets depend almost entirely on individual mushroom hunters for their supplies. The lore of where to find the precious fungi is a well-guarded secret kept in families or small clubs of boletaires, as mushroom hunters are known in Catalonia. One retailer complained that this year \u201cthere are more boletaires than bolets [mushrooms]\u201d. The climate crisis is also affecting the mushroom season in Galicia, in north-west Spain, often known as \u201cgreen Spain\u201d because of its traditionally high rainfall. A dry summer this year meant the mushroom season began a month later than normal, and the crop is down by 50% in some areas. \u201cClimate change is having a really big effect,\u201d said Fernando Ramos, of the mycological association in A Coru\u00f1a. \u201cThe seasons aren\u2019t as clearly defined as they used to be.

      "body": "<h2>Qusay Hussein: injured by a bomb in Iraq, rescued by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</h2> <p>When I think about my childhood I think of colours. The orangey-brown mud of the family home; the deep, rich greens of the mountains on either side of our valley. Home was Abujna, a small village on the edge of Mosul, Iraq. Life changed when the war started in 2003. We were a little away from the fighting, but I saw planes shooting a car on the street next to our village. Two men and a woman were killed. Then famine hit and the farm could no longer provide for us. We moved to Hatra when I was 15 in order to find the money to survive.</p> <p>The evening of 3 August 2006 was like any other. My friends and I were playing volleyball and a crowd had gathered to cheer us on. Towards the end of the match, I noticed a small truck coming towards us. I didn\u2019t think much of it; people often drove up to watch us, and there was a place to grind wheat for flour close by. As the truck grew closer it got stuck in the sand. The driver, a man in his 50s or 60s, revved the engine heavily, and suddenly he was coming up close behind me. I jumped out of the way, as it looked as if he might crash into me. I caught his eye, he looked left and then right, and then directly at me with a smile. He pushed his hand down on the horn, and instead of honking, a whirring began.</p> <p>Everything went dark at that point: just the red of the fire as people and cars flew through the air like birds. I was thrown upwards with the explosion, falling back to earth through the smoke headfirst. All I could see was smoke, and the blood flowing from my nose. All I could think to do was run, but as I stood up I was hit by shrapnel in the head. I lost control of my body and collapsed. There and then I lost my sight.</p> <p>A few minutes later I heard my father\u2019s voice. He was crying. I told him not to leave me else I would die. At the clinic the doctor told him I would be dead within 30 minutes. Thankfully I didn\u2019t die, and soon my father was driving me to a hospital in downtown Mosul, a journey of 70 or 80 miles. En route we were stopped by American soldiers. I had no idea what was going on when they put a medical shot in my back, nor when I heard the sound of a helicopter approaching. I went into a coma for 12 days.</p> <p>When I woke up an interpreter asked my name. I told her: Qusay. She thanked God I knew it, which I didn\u2019t understand. I had no recollection of what had happened. As soon as she mentioned the explosion everything came back to me. If the shrapnel had hit my head just one hair\u2019s width differently I\u2019d have lost my entire memory. That, she told me, is why she thanked God.</p> <p>My family assumed I\u2019d died and were already in mourning. When my father received the call from the Americans 14 days later he didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d survived. He thought someone was trying to lure him towards danger. It was only when they mentioned the tattoo on my arm \u2013 my name \u2013 that he could let himself accept it.</p> <p>Neither Iraqi doctors nor the US soldiers had the resources to help me heal, so for the following months I struggled, to breathe, to eat, to live. I had no nose, no cheek, half my skull was missing. Then one day I was half-listening to the TV \u2013 an advert was calling for people injured by war to get in touch with <a href=\"https://www.msf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res</a>. I was taken to Amman, Jordan, where I spent three years rehabilitating.</p> <p>I live in Austin now. I\u2019ve been here almost seven years, and soon I\u2019ll have completed my degree at the University of Texas. I\u2019m a refugee, a product of war, but in many ways I feel lucky. Not only am I still here, but I\u2019ve started a new life doing things I could never have imagined. I\u2019m hopeful about the future. If what I\u2019ve been through has taught me anything, it is that you should take every opportunity that comes.</p> <h2>Kathy Pannozzi: former nun who found the love of her life at her local church</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c1b46842020d549b8fc0626bbcb282cf0f69be9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1b46842020d549b8fc0626bbcb282cf0f69be9/200_142_3944_4927/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Being a Sister of Mercy was a gift from God, and so, too, was Frank appearing\u2019: Kathleen Pannozzi at her home.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Being a Sister of Mercy was a gift from God, and so, too, was Frank appearing\u2019: Kathleen Pannozzi at her home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benedict Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of people were surprised when I entered the convent. I can see why. While I embraced every aspect of being a nun when I joined the Sisters of Mercy, a Catholic convent in Providence, Rhode Island in 1965, aged 18, my life before might not have suggested it. I had boyfriends in high school and I liked to talk. There\u2019s a lot of silence involved in being a nun and, of course, there are the vows: poverty, obedience and celibacy.</p> <p>To my mind, it was the best way to be of service to the world. My sixth-grade teacher, Sister Maura, was my inspiration. She was fair and smart. We stayed in touch as I grew older and she mentored me as I started my training.</p> <p>It was all very exciting at the beginning. Silence was expected for much of the day, and there were prayers, classes and chores. This was the 1960s in the United States and the Me generation was leading a revolution. I like to think becoming a nun was in its own way quite counter- cultural. After three years of living in isolation with my fellow trainees, years four and five were spent at an all-women\u2019s college. We would stay up late on campus listening to music and talking. Asking what does it mean to be a religious woman? To be of service? To be celibate? Many of the women I started with decided life as a nun just wasn\u2019t for them \u2013 they moved away, got married.</p> <p>After taking up my teaching post, I delayed taking my vows for a year or so. I wanted to make sure my decision was right. But in the end I decided to stay and commit my life to God. It was 1974, and I decided I wouldn\u2019t marry or have children. I made my vows and that was that.</p> <p>And then in the fall of 1977, a new priest arrived at my local parish. By then I lived in an apartment with other sisters, and would regularly go to his church, St Mary\u2019s. On 4 October I went to evening Mass as I often did. Frank was leading it; he seemed a nice guy, certainly good- looking. Afterwards I introduced myself and we talked for a while. I became a regular at the service, half to pray and half because of him: he gave a good sermon. He valued my thoughts and opinions. We became good friends.</p> <p>Things carried on this way for two-and-a-half years, until 26 September 1980. I got home from work to hear Sister Maura was unwell and in hospital. I was inconsolable, not just because of her condition, but bereft that I\u2019d never told her how much she meant to me; how much I valued her; that she was loved. I went to see her that night.</p> <p>The next day I was with Frank. We were alone together, which was unusual for us, picking apples in an orchard. I told him about Sister Maura and how heartbroken I was. Frank turned to look at me: \u201cKathy, that\u2019s how I feel about you.\u201d Less than a year later we would be married.</p> <p>Before then, I questioned my vows and my relationship to God. It took time, but I came to the conclusion I stick by today: being a Sister of Mercy was a gift from God, and so, too, was Frank appearing. I could take or leave either, to God it didn\u2019t matter, because God is in the people all around us. I opted for Frank and I have not one regret. It\u2019s 38 years since our wedding, and he\u2019s a gift that just keeps on giving.</p> <h2>Dwayne Fields: victim of gang crime who became an explorer and naturalist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d9a3e01fb52f0bd5fb289cb335c05d8bec59a4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d9a3e01fb52f0bd5fb289cb335c05d8bec59a4b/700_2343_4727_5906/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018One time I was walking with a friend through an estate in Tottenham and woke up waiting for an ambulance\u2019: Dwayne Fields.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One time I was walking with a friend through an estate in Tottenham and woke up waiting for an ambulance\u2019: Dwayne Fields.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve never carried a knife or a gun. But as I know too well, that doesn\u2019t guarantee freedom from their violence. I\u2019ve got two stab wounds on my body; I\u2019ve been held at gunpoint on at least three occasions. That was just my life growing up on an estate in Stoke Newington, London. It was typical. One time I was walking with a friend through an estate in Tottenham and woke up waiting for an ambulance to collect me with one stab wound in my stomach and another in my chest. After that, people around me were saying we should catch up with my attackers and get them. There was pressure to get revenge. The more I heard those voices, the more I wondered if they were right. </p> <p>By the age of 21 I\u2019d tried to move on from that incident. I built a moped myself from scratch. I let my brother take it out on a test drive around our area. He was pushed off it on a neighbouring estate and it was stolen. I\u2019ve never been as angry as I was when he returned. I marched over to where I knew I\u2019d find these guys to demand it back. I found a group of eight or nine boys busy taking it apart. I went to grab it \u2013 we got into a fight. When I looked up, a gun was pointing right at me. I pushed my brother aside and looked directly into the eyes of the holder of the weapon. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d I said, trying to stay calm.</p> <p>And then he pulled the trigger. I heard the sound. Oh shit, I thought, I\u2019ve been shot. I couldn\u2019t feel any pain. I assumed I was just numb. He pulled the trigger again. Before the shooter could go in for a third, his friends pulled him away. As I walked the 10-minute journey home I stopped to look again for a bullet hole. Could the gun really have misfired twice? My phone was filling up with texts and calls: we\u2019ve heard what happened, what are you going to do about it?</p> <p>That night I re-evaluated everything. I thought back to the kid I was in Jamaica before I moved to London when I was seven; the time spent outdoors exploring in nature. I wanted to find that person again. Making decisions to fit in with the crowd just wasn\u2019t working. I ran 10k, and completed the <a href=\"https://www.threepeakschallenge.uk/\" title=\"\">Three Peaks Challenge</a>. I applied to join James Cracknell and Ben Fogle on a trip to the South Pole. I was too late; I was offered the North Pole instead. I wasn\u2019t bothered. I\u2019m from Jamaica, man, to me they were just cold and icy. Since then I\u2019ve circumnavigated Jamaica by kayak, run ultra-marathons and trekked across the Sinai desert.</p> <p>The adventures and expeditions are great \u2013 I can see the world and <a href=\"http://www.dwayne-fields.com/\" title=\"\">tell stories</a> \u2013 but doing them also helps me show others how to live their best lives, too. I\u2019ve been given a second, third, fourth chance. You need to seize them. As I tell everyone, you never know if you\u2019ll get one again.</p> <h2>Jan Jacobs: realised she was gay at the age of 50 and started a new life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a3b3dda6fdf2f14c879cbd7738ec209d0dccbff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a3b3dda6fdf2f14c879cbd7738ec209d0dccbff/78_1099_5598_6993/801.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I heard these words coming from my mouth, as if another person inside me was speaking: \u201cI think I\u2019m gay\u201d\u2019: Jan Jacobs.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I heard these words coming from my mouth, as if another person inside me was speaking: I think I\u2019m gay\u2019: Jan Jacobs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It didn\u2019t feel a big deal when Erin, my daughter, came out as bisexual. There was no moment of revelation. It wasn\u2019t long before she set about exploring her identity, and I wanted to be there with her. We went to Cardiff Pride together in 2011 \u2013 that\u2019s the city where she was studying. I felt so comfortable, although I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time.</p> <p>There was a lot going on that year. I was about to turn 50 and my silver wedding anniversary was fast approaching. Chris, my husband, and I were already making plans, but I was sliding further and further into the abyss. I\u2019d always been unsure in myself, ever since childhood. I\u2019d lacked confidence. But I\u2019d assumed as I grew older I\u2019d feel better in myself. I was married, a mother, I worked as a teacher \u2013 a job I adored. So why was I miserable?</p> <p>I\u2019d been seeing a counsellor on and off for years, and after coming home from a weekend away with my girlfriends I went to see her. I was talking about feeling down, about loving Chris \u2013 my husband \u2013 but not feeling like I was in love with him. And then I heard these words coming from my mouth, as if another person inside me was speaking: \u201cI think I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p> <p>Where those words came from I still don\u2019t know. The minute I said them, though, it just felt right. I felt so much lighter, so much happier. I started to tell my closest friends and each time I did a weight was lifted. Something was changing, I was emerging.</p> <p>And then one morning Chris stopped me in the kitchen before work. I\u2019d been waiting for the right moment, but he could tell something was going on. I couldn\u2019t lie to him. I went off to stay with my parents for a few days. He found it difficult, I\u2019m pretty sure he still does. We shared a house for months after that, although I\u2019d spend a few nights a week at a friend\u2019s for space.</p> <p>I felt amazing, but also very alone. None of my friends were gay \u2013 I needed to find a community. There was a local lesbian support group so I went along. The first time I went, I stood outside the door, terrified. I don\u2019t like social situations at the best of times, but quickly found my place.</p> <p>A friend told me about a woman called Sarah who she\u2019d known forever. Sarah came out when she was 12, so we were introduced \u2013 she could show me the ropes. We\u2019d go for coffee as friends. I\u2019m just finding who I am, I\u2019d tell myself. I\u2019m not looking for a relationship. We were still officially \u201cfriends\u201d the first time we kissed. We were hugging goodbye on the porch at her parents\u2019 place. It just sort of happened. It felt amazing, as if I was floating. We finally admitted to each other that we were dating a few months later. Then, after a week of \u201cstaying over\u201d, she just never went home.</p> <p>My second wedding day was very different to the first. When my car pulled up to the venue, Sarah was there in her wheelchair. We just looked at each other and in that moment we knew this was how it was supposed to be. We kissed and she asked if I was sure about the marriage. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life,\u201d I replied.</p> <p>The feeling of being loved and being in love is still so special to me. I feel like the luckiest woman in the world.</p> <h2>Michelle Dorrell: was in the audience at Question Time and then decided to enter politics</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf7cdda188aa75657f956eb02327ab5664733a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf7cdda188aa75657f956eb02327ab5664733a8/333_1091_5589_6983/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I had no intention of speaking when I took my seat in the studio audience\u2019: Michelle Dorrell.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had no intention of speaking when I took my seat in the studio audience\u2019: Michelle Dorrell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We only applied to be in the audience as a joke, really. My partner \u2013 now husband \u2013 and I were watching <em>Question Time</em> on TV. At the end, the future dates and locations popped up on the screen. They were coming to Dover, just down the road from us. It was supposed to be a laugh. The thing is, I knew people like me don\u2019t get heard: we\u2019re not listened to, and we\u2019re made to feel like we don\u2019t know enough.</p> <p>The previous few years hadn\u2019t been easy. I\u2019d left school at 16 and worked in call centres until I hit 30, and by then I had four kids and a divorce. Things started to crumble when I was pregnant with number four. My employer made it impossible for me to stay in my job. At 31, I walked into a job centre for the very first time. I had no savings left; I had spent everything to try to stay afloat. I couldn\u2019t make the rent payment, I had no security. I lost all sense of self-worth. Having to tell my kids that I couldn\u2019t afford to buy them Christmas presents will forever be painfully etched into my memory.</p> <p>I had never voted before the 2015 general election rolled around, but on the day I thought, \u201cSod it!\u201d I voted Conservative. I believed David Cameron when he said \u201cWe\u2019re all in it together.\u201d I believed him when, on national television, he promised not to cut the tax credits that I relied on to survive. And then he did it anyway. I was scared and I felt so let down.</p> <p>Still, I had no intention of speaking when I took my seat in the studio audience. I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself. As the recording went on, however, the more wound up I was getting. Something just happened when Amber Rudd started speaking about bringing the country economic security. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/16/david-cameron-spokesman-respond-question-time-tax-credits-complaint\" title=\"\">A ball of anxiety and frustration and anger came flying out of my mouth</a>. I said I voted for her, that I believed their promises and they betrayed me.</p> <p>I nearly broke down. It was the first time my voice had been heard. It all just came out, live on BBC TV.</p> <p>The next few days were a blur: every newspaper, TV station and radio show was ringing, reporters showed up at my door. I didn\u2019t know whether to run and hide or to embrace it, but deep inside I knew I deserved to be listened to, just like all other working-class women; people who are struggling; single mums. When things died down I started reading, I met with politicians from different parties. I got involved in my local Labour party. I stayed on the fringes at first while I learned to believe in myself.</p> <p>That\u2019s how I ended up in a room above my local count after this year\u2019s local elections, shaking and pacing as the ballots were totted up. I had agreed to run as a candidate to be a councillor; if I was going to bemoan the lack of working-class politicians I decided I should practise what I preach. When I realised that I\u2019d been elected I burst into tears \u2013 although I made sure the Tories didn\u2019t see me crying.</p> <p>It feels so wonderful to finally feel that things I say are worth hearing. For a long time I felt worthless. Now I\u2019m making sure I, and my local community, have a voice. I wouldn\u2019t have believed a word of it if you\u2019d told me all this when we applied to be in the <em>Question Time</em> audience. It\u2019s bizarre how something so little ended up changing so much.</p> <h2>Colin Thackery: Chelsea Pensioner who won Britain\u2019s Got Talent at the age of 89</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b3771480741664b2c7b71d2d25eaa67b70f99e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b3771480741664b2c7b71d2d25eaa67b70f99e1/353_656_5164_6452/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My whole life has been turning upside down again\u2019: Colin Thackery.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My whole life has been turning upside down again\u2019: Colin Thackery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was always a joke in the family that one day I\u2019d end up at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. We would get leaflets sent to the house once in a while, selling it: \u201cRetire in style,\u201d they said. One evening I threw one on the table at dinner and told Joan, my wife, and the kids that if their mum went first, that\u2019s where I\u2019d go. It never crossed my mind it would actually happen. When she died in 2016 it felt like my life was going into reverse. After 66 years of marriage, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen. We had met at a barn dance at my army camp in County Durham while we were still kids, and we\u2019d lived all over together, before settling back with our two children in Britain. It wasn\u2019t the first time the future looked uncertain. When I retired from the army at 40, having joined at just 15, I\u2019d felt much the same. But with Joan by my side, I knew we would find a way through. This time I was less certain.</p> <p>Music had always been my passion. I\u2019d joined the Royal Artillery Band as a drummer as a teenager. I\u2019d sung in the choirs on troop ships to get out of other duties. When we moved to Norfolk, Joan and I had been part of our local operatic society. We did that together for 25 years. And so, while I worked out the move to Chelsea, I carried on singing. If I hadn\u2019t I think I\u2019d have gone barmy.</p> <p>Moving to the Royal Hospital Chelsea seemed to be the start of the end for me. I felt like I was living in an old folks\u2019 home and I was morose. But after a while a new friend and I started to entertain everyone in our social club once a month after Curry Fridays. Bill would do country and western numbers, I\u2019d take the ballads. I noticed that singing raised my spirits once again.</p> <p>Stepping off the stage one evening, a bloke came up to me. He\u2019d seen that <em>Britain\u2019s Got Talent</em> had opened auditions, and suggested I apply. I told him not to be silly, why would they want an old man like me?</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you lose it,\u201d he retorted. And then he dared me to, so I printed the form and sent it off.</p> <p>There were a few rounds of auditions before I found myself at the filmed audition in front of a packed house at the London Palladium. A harem of female family members whooped as I came on. I\u2019m sure the scarlet coat helped people get behind me. We went for a Chinese after.</p> <p>By the time it got to the final \u2013 and I was announced as the winner \u2013 I simply couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. If you watch the broadcast back you\u2019ll see me asking Dec [Declan Donnelly] what was going on. It was very noisy, you see, and I\u2019m slightly deaf. It was extraordinary, I was in a daze.</p> <p>My whole life has been turned upside down, again, although I\u2019m not complaining. The <em>Royal Variety </em><em>Show</em> is coming up this month \u2013 my aim is to sing in front of the Queen. And there\u2019s an album coming, too, apparently. I\u2019m the oldest person in the world ever to sign a record deal. </p> <p>If I was a teenager I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be hungry for a huge career, but I\u2019m just enjoying it. It\u2019s never too late, I\u2019ve learned, to do what you love. Just a few years ago I thought everything was over, and now I\u2019m a pop sensation! </p>",

      "bodyText": "Qusay Hussein: injured by a bomb in Iraq, rescued by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res When I think about my childhood I think of colours. The orangey-brown mud of the family home; the deep, rich greens of the mountains on either side of our valley. Home was Abujna, a small village on the edge of Mosul, Iraq. Life changed when the war started in 2003. We were a little away from the fighting, but I saw planes shooting a car on the street next to our village. Two men and a woman were killed. Then famine hit and the farm could no longer provide for us. We moved to Hatra when I was 15 in order to find the money to survive. The evening of 3 August 2006 was like any other. My friends and I were playing volleyball and a crowd had gathered to cheer us on. Towards the end of the match, I noticed a small truck coming towards us. I didn\u2019t think much of it; people often drove up to watch us, and there was a place to grind wheat for flour close by. As the truck grew closer it got stuck in the sand. The driver, a man in his 50s or 60s, revved the engine heavily, and suddenly he was coming up close behind me. I jumped out of the way, as it looked as if he might crash into me. I caught his eye, he looked left and then right, and then directly at me with a smile. He pushed his hand down on the horn, and instead of honking, a whirring began. Everything went dark at that point: just the red of the fire as people and cars flew through the air like birds. I was thrown upwards with the explosion, falling back to earth through the smoke headfirst. All I could see was smoke, and the blood flowing from my nose. All I could think to do was run, but as I stood up I was hit by shrapnel in the head. I lost control of my body and collapsed. There and then I lost my sight. A few minutes later I heard my father\u2019s voice. He was crying. I told him not to leave me else I would die. At the clinic the doctor told him I would be dead within 30 minutes. Thankfully I didn\u2019t die, and soon my father was driving me to a hospital in downtown Mosul, a journey of 70 or 80 miles. En route we were stopped by American soldiers. I had no idea what was going on when they put a medical shot in my back, nor when I heard the sound of a helicopter approaching. I went into a coma for 12 days. When I woke up an interpreter asked my name. I told her: Qusay. She thanked God I knew it, which I didn\u2019t understand. I had no recollection of what had happened. As soon as she mentioned the explosion everything came back to me. If the shrapnel had hit my head just one hair\u2019s width differently I\u2019d have lost my entire memory. That, she told me, is why she thanked God. My family assumed I\u2019d died and were already in mourning. When my father received the call from the Americans 14 days later he didn\u2019t believe I\u2019d survived. He thought someone was trying to lure him towards danger. It was only when they mentioned the tattoo on my arm \u2013 my name \u2013 that he could let himself accept it. Neither Iraqi doctors nor the US soldiers had the resources to help me heal, so for the following months I struggled, to breathe, to eat, to live. I had no nose, no cheek, half my skull was missing. Then one day I was half-listening to the TV \u2013 an advert was calling for people injured by war to get in touch with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. I was taken to Amman, Jordan, where I spent three years rehabilitating. I live in Austin now. I\u2019ve been here almost seven years, and soon I\u2019ll have completed my degree at the University of Texas. I\u2019m a refugee, a product of war, but in many ways I feel lucky. Not only am I still here, but I\u2019ve started a new life doing things I could never have imagined. I\u2019m hopeful about the future. If what I\u2019ve been through has taught me anything, it is that you should take every opportunity that comes. Kathy Pannozzi: former nun who found the love of her life at her local church A lot of people were surprised when I entered the convent. I can see why. While I embraced every aspect of being a nun when I joined the Sisters of Mercy, a Catholic convent in Providence, Rhode Island in 1965, aged 18, my life before might not have suggested it. I had boyfriends in high school and I liked to talk. There\u2019s a lot of silence involved in being a nun and, of course, there are the vows: poverty, obedience and celibacy. To my mind, it was the best way to be of service to the world. My sixth-grade teacher, Sister Maura, was my inspiration. She was fair and smart. We stayed in touch as I grew older and she mentored me as I started my training. It was all very exciting at the beginning. Silence was expected for much of the day, and there were prayers, classes and chores. This was the 1960s in the United States and the Me generation was leading a revolution. I like to think becoming a nun was in its own way quite counter- cultural. After three years of living in isolation with my fellow trainees, years four and five were spent at an all-women\u2019s college. We would stay up late on campus listening to music and talking. Asking what does it mean to be a religious woman? To be of service? To be celibate? Many of the women I started with decided life as a nun just wasn\u2019t for them \u2013 they moved away, got married. After taking up my teaching post, I delayed taking my vows for a year or so. I wanted to make sure my decision was right. But in the end I decided to stay and commit my life to God. It was 1974, and I decided I wouldn\u2019t marry or have children. I made my vows and that was that. And then in the fall of 1977, a new priest arrived at my local parish. By then I lived in an apartment with other sisters, and would regularly go to his church, St Mary\u2019s. On 4 October I went to evening Mass as I often did. Frank was leading it; he seemed a nice guy, certainly good- looking. Afterwards I introduced myself and we talked for a while. I became a regular at the service, half to pray and half because of him: he gave a good sermon. He valued my thoughts and opinions. We became good friends. Things carried on this way for two-and-a-half years, until 26 September 1980. I got home from work to hear Sister Maura was unwell and in hospital. I was inconsolable, not just because of her condition, but bereft that I\u2019d never told her how much she meant to me; how much I valued her; that she was loved. I went to see her that night. The next day I was with Frank. We were alone together, which was unusual for us, picking apples in an orchard. I told him about Sister Maura and how heartbroken I was. Frank turned to look at me: \u201cKathy, that\u2019s how I feel about you.\u201d Less than a year later we would be married. Before then, I questioned my vows and my relationship to God. It took time, but I came to the conclusion I stick by today: being a Sister of Mercy was a gift from God, and so, too, was Frank appearing. I could take or leave either, to God it didn\u2019t matter, because God is in the people all around us. I opted for Frank and I have not one regret. It\u2019s 38 years since our wedding, and he\u2019s a gift that just keeps on giving. Dwayne Fields: victim of gang crime who became an explorer and naturalist I\u2019ve never carried a knife or a gun. But as I know too well, that doesn\u2019t guarantee freedom from their violence. I\u2019ve got two stab wounds on my body; I\u2019ve been held at gunpoint on at least three occasions. That was just my life growing up on an estate in Stoke Newington, London. It was typical. One time I was walking with a friend through an estate in Tottenham and woke up waiting for an ambulance to collect me with one stab wound in my stomach and another in my chest. After that, people around me were saying we should catch up with my attackers and get them. There was pressure to get revenge. The more I heard those voices, the more I wondered if they were right. By the age of 21 I\u2019d tried to move on from that incident. I built a moped myself from scratch. I let my brother take it out on a test drive around our area. He was pushed off it on a neighbouring estate and it was stolen. I\u2019ve never been as angry as I was when he returned. I marched over to where I knew I\u2019d find these guys to demand it back. I found a group of eight or nine boys busy taking it apart. I went to grab it \u2013 we got into a fight. When I looked up, a gun was pointing right at me. I pushed my brother aside and looked directly into the eyes of the holder of the weapon. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d I said, trying to stay calm. And then he pulled the trigger. I heard the sound. Oh shit, I thought, I\u2019ve been shot. I couldn\u2019t feel any pain. I assumed I was just numb. He pulled the trigger again. Before the shooter could go in for a third, his friends pulled him away. As I walked the 10-minute journey home I stopped to look again for a bullet hole. Could the gun really have misfired twice? My phone was filling up with texts and calls: we\u2019ve heard what happened, what are you going to do about it? That night I re-evaluated everything. I thought back to the kid I was in Jamaica before I moved to London when I was seven; the time spent outdoors exploring in nature. I wanted to find that person again. Making decisions to fit in with the crowd just wasn\u2019t working. I ran 10k, and completed the Three Peaks Challenge. I applied to join James Cracknell and Ben Fogle on a trip to the South Pole. I was too late; I was offered the North Pole instead. I wasn\u2019t bothered. I\u2019m from Jamaica, man, to me they were just cold and icy. Since then I\u2019ve circumnavigated Jamaica by kayak, run ultra-marathons and trekked across the Sinai desert. The adventures and expeditions are great \u2013 I can see the world and tell stories \u2013 but doing them also helps me show others how to live their best lives, too. I\u2019ve been given a second, third, fourth chance. You need to seize them. As I tell everyone, you never know if you\u2019ll get one again. Jan Jacobs: realised she was gay at the age of 50 and started a new life It didn\u2019t feel a big deal when Erin, my daughter, came out as bisexual. There was no moment of revelation. It wasn\u2019t long before she set about exploring her identity, and I wanted to be there with her. We went to Cardiff Pride together in 2011 \u2013 that\u2019s the city where she was studying. I felt so comfortable, although I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. There was a lot going on that year. I was about to turn 50 and my silver wedding anniversary was fast approaching. Chris, my husband, and I were already making plans, but I was sliding further and further into the abyss. I\u2019d always been unsure in myself, ever since childhood. I\u2019d lacked confidence. But I\u2019d assumed as I grew older I\u2019d feel better in myself. I was married, a mother, I worked as a teacher \u2013 a job I adored. So why was I miserable? I\u2019d been seeing a counsellor on and off for years, and after coming home from a weekend away with my girlfriends I went to see her. I was talking about feeling down, about loving Chris \u2013 my husband \u2013 but not feeling like I was in love with him. And then I heard these words coming from my mouth, as if another person inside me was speaking: \u201cI think I\u2019m gay.\u201d Where those words came from I still don\u2019t know. The minute I said them, though, it just felt right. I felt so much lighter, so much happier. I started to tell my closest friends and each time I did a weight was lifted. Something was changing, I was emerging. And then one morning Chris stopped me in the kitchen before work. I\u2019d been waiting for the right moment, but he could tell something was going on. I couldn\u2019t lie to him. I went off to stay with my parents for a few days. He found it difficult, I\u2019m pretty sure he still does. We shared a house for months after that, although I\u2019d spend a few nights a week at a friend\u2019s for space. I felt amazing, but also very alone. None of my friends were gay \u2013 I needed to find a community. There was a local lesbian support group so I went along. The first time I went, I stood outside the door, terrified. I don\u2019t like social situations at the best of times, but quickly found my place. A friend told me about a woman called Sarah who she\u2019d known forever. Sarah came out when she was 12, so we were introduced \u2013 she could show me the ropes. We\u2019d go for coffee as friends. I\u2019m just finding who I am, I\u2019d tell myself. I\u2019m not looking for a relationship. We were still officially \u201cfriends\u201d the first time we kissed. We were hugging goodbye on the porch at her parents\u2019 place. It just sort of happened. It felt amazing, as if I was floating. We finally admitted to each other that we were dating a few months later. Then, after a week of \u201cstaying over\u201d, she just never went home. My second wedding day was very different to the first. When my car pulled up to the venue, Sarah was there in her wheelchair. We just looked at each other and in that moment we knew this was how it was supposed to be. We kissed and she asked if I was sure about the marriage. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life,\u201d I replied. The feeling of being loved and being in love is still so special to me. I feel like the luckiest woman in the world. Michelle Dorrell: was in the audience at Question Time and then decided to enter politics We only applied to be in the audience as a joke, really. My partner \u2013 now husband \u2013 and I were watching Question Time on TV. At the end, the future dates and locations popped up on the screen. They were coming to Dover, just down the road from us. It was supposed to be a laugh. The thing is, I knew people like me don\u2019t get heard: we\u2019re not listened to, and we\u2019re made to feel like we don\u2019t know enough. The previous few years hadn\u2019t been easy. I\u2019d left school at 16 and worked in call centres until I hit 30, and by then I had four kids and a divorce. Things started to crumble when I was pregnant with number four. My employer made it impossible for me to stay in my job. At 31, I walked into a job centre for the very first time. I had no savings left; I had spent everything to try to stay afloat. I couldn\u2019t make the rent payment, I had no security. I lost all sense of self-worth. Having to tell my kids that I couldn\u2019t afford to buy them Christmas presents will forever be painfully etched into my memory. I had never voted before the 2015 general election rolled around, but on the day I thought, \u201cSod it!\u201d I voted Conservative. I believed David Cameron when he said \u201cWe\u2019re all in it together.\u201d I believed him when, on national television, he promised not to cut the tax credits that I relied on to survive. And then he did it anyway. I was scared and I felt so let down. Still, I had no intention of speaking when I took my seat in the studio audience. I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself. As the recording went on, however, the more wound up I was getting. Something just happened when Amber Rudd started speaking about bringing the country economic security. A ball of anxiety and frustration and anger came flying out of my mouth. I said I voted for her, that I believed their promises and they betrayed me. I nearly broke down. It was the first time my voice had been heard. It all just came out, live on BBC TV. The next few days were a blur: every newspaper, TV station and radio show was ringing, reporters showed up at my door. I didn\u2019t know whether to run and hide or to embrace it, but deep inside I knew I deserved to be listened to, just like all other working-class women; people who are struggling; single mums. When things died down I started reading, I met with politicians from different parties. I got involved in my local Labour party. I stayed on the fringes at first while I learned to believe in myself. That\u2019s how I ended up in a room above my local count after this year\u2019s local elections, shaking and pacing as the ballots were totted up. I had agreed to run as a candidate to be a councillor; if I was going to bemoan the lack of working-class politicians I decided I should practise what I preach. When I realised that I\u2019d been elected I burst into tears \u2013 although I made sure the Tories didn\u2019t see me crying. It feels so wonderful to finally feel that things I say are worth hearing. For a long time I felt worthless. Now I\u2019m making sure I, and my local community, have a voice. I wouldn\u2019t have believed a word of it if you\u2019d told me all this when we applied to be in the Question Time audience. It\u2019s bizarre how something so little ended up changing so much. Colin Thackery: Chelsea Pensioner who won Britain\u2019s Got Talent at the age of 89 There was always a joke in the family that one day I\u2019d end up at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. We would get leaflets sent to the house once in a while, selling it: \u201cRetire in style,\u201d they said. One evening I threw one on the table at dinner and told Joan, my wife, and the kids that if their mum went first, that\u2019s where I\u2019d go. It never crossed my mind it would actually happen. When she died in 2016 it felt like my life was going into reverse. After 66 years of marriage, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen. We had met at a barn dance at my army camp in County Durham while we were still kids, and we\u2019d lived all over together, before settling back with our two children in Britain. It wasn\u2019t the first time the future looked uncertain. When I retired from the army at 40, having joined at just 15, I\u2019d felt much the same. But with Joan by my side, I knew we would find a way through. This time I was less certain. Music had always been my passion. I\u2019d joined the Royal Artillery Band as a drummer as a teenager. I\u2019d sung in the choirs on troop ships to get out of other duties. When we moved to Norfolk, Joan and I had been part of our local operatic society. We did that together for 25 years. And so, while I worked out the move to Chelsea, I carried on singing. If I hadn\u2019t I think I\u2019d have gone barmy. Moving to the Royal Hospital Chelsea seemed to be the start of the end for me. I felt like I was living in an old folks\u2019 home and I was morose. But after a while a new friend and I started to entertain everyone in our social club once a month after Curry Fridays. Bill would do country and western numbers, I\u2019d take the ballads. I noticed that singing raised my spirits once again. Stepping off the stage one evening, a bloke came up to me. He\u2019d seen that Britain\u2019s Got Talent had opened auditions, and suggested I apply. I told him not to be silly, why would they want an old man like me? \u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you lose it,\u201d he retorted. And then he dared me to, so I printed the form and sent it off. There were a few rounds of auditions before I found myself at the filmed audition in front of a packed house at the London Palladium. A harem of female family members whooped as I came on. I\u2019m sure the scarlet coat helped people get behind me. We went for a Chinese after. By the time it got to the final \u2013 and I was announced as the winner \u2013 I simply couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. If you watch the broadcast back you\u2019ll see me asking Dec [Declan Donnelly] what was going on. It was very noisy, you see, and I\u2019m slightly deaf. It was extraordinary, I was in a daze. My whole life has been turned upside down, again, although I\u2019m not complaining. The Royal Variety Show is coming up this month \u2013 my aim is to sing in front of the Queen. And there\u2019s an album coming, too, apparently. I\u2019m the oldest person in the world ever to sign a record deal. If I was a teenager I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be hungry for a huge career, but I\u2019m just enjoying it. It\u2019s never too late, I\u2019ve learned, to do what you love. Just a few years ago I thought everything was over, and now I\u2019m a pop sensation!",

The flotation documents detail the vast scale of Saudi Aramco. The company \u201clifts\u201d 11.6m barrels of oil every day and has reserves of 227bn barrels. It costs just $2.80 for the company to lift each barrel of oil, compared with the $62 price per barrel on world markets, resulting in vast profits. It said its operating cashflow in 2018 was $121bn and it would pay out dividends worth $75bn this year. In an attempt to reassure potential investors, the Saudi government said it would forego its share of dividends in the event of an oil price collapse, effectively creating a company that guarantees dividends of $75bn a year. The documents also reveal that the drone attack on Aramco\u2019s facilities in September cost it $28m, a sum that is so insignificant to the company\u2019s scale that it was not material to the accounts. The float is expected to hand a $450m windfall to a string of international banks and advisers. The banks confirmed in the IPO announcement include Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Saudi Arabia\u2019s National Commercial Bank (NCB) and Riyadh-based Samba Capital have also advised on the deal. The likely valuation of $1.5tn-$1.6tn is a defeat for the aspirations of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who proposed the market listing three years ago and signalled a $2tn valuation. Since then Bin Salman has appealed to Saudi Arabia\u2019s richest families to help support the flotation by buying up a stake in the company, and recruited a team of western banks to help support the listing. Historically Aramco \u2013 which stands for Arabian-American oil company \u2013 has had close links with US oil interests and American banks. Despite the Wall Street investment banks dominating the list of advisers, the flotation has mostly been handled by teams from the London offices. At Riyadh\u2019s King Khalid airport, it is British Airways flights to and from London Heathrow that are said to be busiest with bankers. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2019. Saudi Aramco has reserves of 227bn barrels of oil, not 227m.",

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage has announced he will not make an eighth attempt to become an MP in December\u2019s general election. Farage announced on Friday at his Brexit party\u2019s campaign launch that it was preparing to stand candidates in the vast majority of seats across Britain unless it could strike a pact with the Conservatives. On Sunday he said that while his party intended to field up to 600 candidates, he would not be one of them. \u201cI have thought very hard about this: how do I serve the cause of Brexit best,\u201d Farage told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr. \u201cDo I find a seat and try to get myself into parliament or do I serve the cause better traversing the length and breadth of the United Kingdom supporting 600 candidates, and I\u2019ve decided the latter course is the right one.\u201d At the launch on Friday, Farage urged Boris Johnson to drop his Brexit deal, which he claimed was \u201cnot Brexit\u201d and would hamper the UK\u2019s opportunities to strike free-trade deals. He suggested his party was prepared to stand aside in some seats in exchange for the Conservatives giving the Brexit party a shot at up to 150 Labour-held constituencies in the Midlands and north that it believes it can win. But Johnson is also targeting these kinds of seats and has brushed off suggestions of a leave alliance, warning that a vote for any other party than his risks putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. Farage said: \u201cI\u2019ve wanted for months for there to be a leave alliance. It seems obvious to me that no one party can own Brexit voters \u2013 there are Tory Brexit voters, there are Brexit party Brexit voters and a lot of Labour Brexit voters. \u201cI always thought that to win an election, get a big majority so we can get a proper Brexit, a coming-together would be the objective. I still hope and pray it happens, but it doesn\u2019t look like it will.\u201d In an interview with the Sunday Times, Farage suggested the Conservatives had offered him a peerage as a \u201cbauble\u201d in exchange for not targeting Tory seats at the election, and a senior party colleague had been offered the opportunity to stand in a safe Conservative seat. The Brexit party\u2019s poll rating has been significantly squeezed since Johnson came to power touting his willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit and then struck a last-minute deal in Brussels last month. Johnson will not welcome the prospect of Farage touring the country urging voters to reject his deal. In the Sunday Times, Farage compared Johnson\u2019s deal to a piece of cheese. \u201cWhen you get it out of the fridge it\u2019s really appetising and delicious for a few days, but after a couple of weeks it stinks and is inedible,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The conclusion of a disappointing Rugby World Cup for the All Blacks signalled the end of an era off the field in New Zealand rugby, one that has arguably been even more influential than anything on it, as long-time chief executive Steve Tew heads for the exit. Cambridge University-educated Mark Robinson, who moves from the board room to the executive chair in January, had long been touted as a potential successor. A nine-Test All Black between 2000 and 2002, a New Zealand Rugby board member since 2013 and one of New Zealand\u2019s representatives to World Rugby, the well-regarded Robinson will bring a quiet calm to HQ, in contrast to the occasionally stormy 12-year Tew tenancy. Tew achieved much during his reign but admitted earlier in the year that there had been the odd problem with the organisational culture on his watch. The administration\u2019s obsession with the All Blacks, seemingly at the expense of all else, has not always gone down well with the country\u2019s 26 provincial unions either. This irritation will only have been fuelled further by New Zealand\u2019s failure to either beat the British &amp; Irish Lions, or successfully defend the Rugby World Cup, in the last three years, despite much being sacrificed in provincial and Super Rugby in pursuit of those goals. New Zealand Rugby chose Robinson after a \u201cworldwide\u201d search, which brought in 84 other applications. The number who applied, many of whom were no doubt from the corporate world, suggests there was an opportunity for the board to seek a change of emphasis. In going for Robinson, it opted for largely the status quo. While the new man will bring his own ideas, he has been party to the direction the New Zealand game has headed inand so is hardly likely to instigate massive changes. Even so, he inherits the position at a testing time, with some of the challenges of his, and his governance colleagues\u2019, making. A new All Blacks coach must be appointed. This will be done prior to Christmas, and the decision will challenge the prevailing philosophy. Does the union continue, as it has in the recent past, retaining continuity within the All Black set up? If so, the job must go to the current assistant, Ian Foster. A break with that path will be tempting, given the domination of the All Black coaching positions by a select few through the last four World Cup cycles. The stranglehold of the few forced many of the country\u2019s most successful coaches to quit New Zealand in their prime, with a number going on to success guiding other nations or leading clubs, mostly in the northern hemisphere. As someone who will work closely with the incoming man, Robinson should be on the panel that makes the appointment, and the union shouldn\u2019t lack for applicants in what is probably the first genuinely contestable process for the position, free of internal politics, since John Mitchell was appointed 18 years ago. The challenges facing New Zealand Rugby, and its new chief executive, stretch far beyond rebooting the All Blacks though. Even allowing for the bumper new rights deal with Sky television (NZ), the warning light is flickering on the financial front, with player payments spiralling and revenues struggling to keep up. While (the World Cup notwithstanding) strong results in the Test, women\u2019s and Super Rugby arena are being maintained, the release of the previously iron-cast grip on the world Under-20s title is ominous. New Zealand fell to a disastrous seventh this year in a tournament it once dominated, winning the first four events following its inception in 2008. That domination was the bedrock on which the All Blacks\u2019 global supremacy through the last decade had been maintained, but performance has flatlined, with just two titles in eight years. If the production line continues to be exposed at the Baby Blacks juncture, a negative impact at the development journey\u2019s final stop with the All Blacks is inevitable. Worryingly, player numbers are declining among teenagers, which is a difficult trend to address given the numerous leisure options available and the tendency of that age group to flock together. Robinson and his team must also find a way to redeem both Super Rugby and the domestic provincial championship in the eyes of a public who have walked away in large numbers. Attendances have dropped steadily and significantly for both competitions, to the extent that some facilities were left closed at bigger venues during the recent national provincial championship because it was uneconomic for the stadiums to operate at full capacity. Tew, backed by the board of which Robinson was a part, gave the All Black hierarchy the loudest voice in most areas pertaining to the organising and playing of the game itself. Players were rotated in and out of a Super Rugby competition that became bloated with poor quality teams and games, while the NPC (now Mitre 10 Cup), for so long the provider of the country\u2019s competitive advantage at international level, is now almost an All Black exclusion zone. Both are trends New Zealand Rugby must find a way of reversing, if it is to prevent further customer disengagement, and start to reconnect casual fans with their local teams. Addressing the number of players at middle management level who are leaving well before their time is also a priority, especially with possible domestic expansion in Japan threatening to become a further drain on New Zealand\u2019s resources. While the All Black jersey has always been central to New Zealand rugby as a powerful and emotive unifying force, the benefits of the supposed \u201ctrickle down theory\u201d, which holds that the rest of the game is enhanced by success at the top, are becoming harder to find with resources slimming while public engagement dims.

And so it came to pass, thanks to The Young Offenders, the hit Irish comedy whose second series is airing on BBC Three. Two bonehead bicycle thieves cheated death as they outpedalled garda\u00ed through a Cork shopping centre.

What makes Principal Walsh angry is that Jock is the child\u2019s father \u2013 understandably angry, given that Jock is a teenage rampage of a ne\u2019er-do-well, and not prepared for the responsibility of fatherhood.

Just as Self\u2019s championing of cynical, difficult, white modernism feels increasingly out of place in our current cultural climate, which is at once global, frothy and moralising, it seems like a bizarre time to write a book about taking heroin in the 1980s.

      "body": "<p>Dear Charles, we share, I think, some fundamental values and beliefs: in freedom, democracy, justice, the rule of law, also in the value of education, knowledge and art. Yet these beliefs lead us to opposite conclusions about contemporary issues such as Europe, climate change, the position of Islam in western culture and the versions of conservatism now being practised by leaders of the UK and the US. I find these differences intriguing, sometimes mystifying, sometimes troubling. I\u2019d like to get to the bottom of them.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/27/margaret-thatcher-charles-moore-review\" title=\"\">your biography of Margaret Thatcher</a> you describe her versions of these beliefs, about her faith in \u201ceconomic liberty\u201d, her \u201coverall philosophy of everyone having a stake\u201d, also about her occupation of the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d. You could say that she made a promise \u2013 that if you work hard, play by the rules and trust in the market you will be rewarded \u2013 but that the 2008 crash shattered that promise. It seemed that one \u2013 rich and privileged \u2013 group of society was entitled to break rules and get away with it, and that everyone else had to pay the price.</p> <p>Since Thatcher left power in 1990 this country has been ruled either by Conservatives or by Labour prime ministers strongly influenced by her. Do you think they have achieved her ambition, as one of her policy advisers put it, \u201cto liberate people to do things\u201d?</p> <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>I agree with you about what we agree about! I am not, in my ultimate beliefs, a liberal; but I strongly believe in a liberal order, with the elements you describe, as the most civilised way of governing a country.</p> <p>I also agree that many people (I include myself) feel cheated as a result of the credit crunch of 2008, for the reasons you state. I would not agree that much of this should be laid at Mrs Thatcher\u2019s door, 18 years after she left office. </p> <p>In assessing a political leader fairly, one must understand what problems they had to confront. In 1979, in the economic sphere, Mrs Thatcher had to confront inflation, overmighty trade union leaders, loss-making nationalised industries and a lack of openness to world markets. Broadly speaking \u2013 and with significant mistakes along the way \u2013 she confronted them successfully.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b357adf0-d069-41cc-aa33-aaa8b32b9634\"         data-atom-type=\"profile\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>When you free up any area, that freedom includes the likelihood that some things will go wrong. The Thatcher government\u2019s abolition of exchange controls in 1979 transformed the capacity of the world to invest in this country, because at last outsiders had the guarantee that money could move freely in and out. This action probably contributed a bit to the financial overheating of the 21st century, but if she had not done what she did, she would have missed her best chance to create a more liberal economic order.</p> <p>Similarly, she <em>had</em> to face down the miners\u2019 strike of 1984-5. If she had not won, trade union boss power would have continued to dominate our economy and our politics, with terrible results for prosperity, liberty and democracy. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent\" title=\"\">In 1979, 29.4m working days were lost to strikes</a>. In 1990, the year she left, the figure was below 2m. The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacedisputesandworkingconditions/articles/labourdisputes/2018\" title=\"\">figure in 2018 was 273,000</a> working days lost. This \u201cdivisive\u201d character brought industrial peace, which continues to this day.</p> <p>It is to the discredit of people who think of themselves as liberals that most of them did not support Mrs Thatcher in this, but evaded the issue by moaning about her confrontational style. After she had won they quietly pocketed the gains. Many self-styled liberals hate taking responsibility for unpopular decisions. They seem more preoccupied with the display of virtue than with doing what is right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b80698544bd04c0718052edf569116a0a06cd942\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b80698544bd04c0718052edf569116a0a06cd942/0_0_2864_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s official biographer, with the former prime minister in 1995.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s authorised biographer, with the former prime minister in 1995.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Rogers/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Rowan:</h2> <p>Are you saying that a truly Thatcherite government, if it had stayed in power all that time, would have managed to avoid a crisis like that of 2008? What would it have done differently from Major and Blair? If you felt cheated by 2008, what policies or politicians offer, for you, redress?</p> <p>Given that the problem is not now overmighty trades unions, how might a Thatcher of the past decade \u2013 responding, as you say, to the issues of the time \u2013 have responded to the problems we now have: the loss of security and stagnation of prospects for large sections of the population, compared with the concentration of wealth among a very small percentage?</p> <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>I make it a rule not to speculate about what Mrs Thatcher would do nowadays. What I know she did worry about, however, especially, in her last couple of years in office, was the way that what was then the European Community (later the EU) offered much clearer benefit to its leaders and officials than to its citizens. She worried about the loss of identity, sovereignty, national independence and democratic accountability under an ever-centralising EU.</p> <p>She also worried about the excessive power of bankers and central bankers \u2013 opposing, unlike her followers, an independent Bank of England, on the grounds that key financial decisions affecting the lives of all citizens should not ultimately be taken by technical experts but by democratically answerable politicians.</p> <p>She was ahead of her time about these matters. The alienation of general European populations from those who rule them has emerged very strongly after the creation of the euro (for reasons she predicted), and because of the 2008 crash and has spread throughout the EU.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The current right adopts tough-sounding and offensive positions on the basis that their very offensiveness and toughness must make them right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Rowan:</h2> <p>Except that we are now finding out that the EU does have clear benefits to its citizens \u2013 frictionless borders, the single market, cooperation on security and medicine, freedom of movement, peace. We\u2019ll miss them when they\u2019ve gone. The alienation of populations from government has hardly been unique to the eurozone, or the EU.</p> <p>The argument for the EU is not that it is perfect, or even that it is perfectible, but that, like individuals, nations can make themselves stronger by working with others. A lot of anti-EU positions conceive a zero-sum game, in which anything that goes to the EU is automatically a loss to us, and they magnify the disadvantages and minimise the benefits to an absurd degree.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/09/margaret-thatcher-herself-alone-volume-three-biography-charles-moore-review\" title=\"\">In volume three of your biography</a> there are some striking insights into the Euroscepticism of Thatcher\u2019s last years in power. What also comes across vividly is the way in which the bitterness of her removal from office, of which disagreement about Europe was the catalyst but not the only cause, has infected the issue ever since. A lot of the European debate has been a domestic drama in the Conservative party, to which the rest of us are obliged to listen.</p> <p>This history matters to our current situation. It contributes to the absolutist positions, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/12/brexiters-adoption-war-language-will-stop-britain-finding-peace\" title=\"\">quasi-military language</a> and the tribalism of the current debate, and the branding (for example) of legitimate critics of the process of enabling the referendum result as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30a70af016f9c6540bdfd6ce8e00bdd1b7ed0338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30a70af016f9c6540bdfd6ce8e00bdd1b7ed0338/0_0_1280_819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Moore family, including mother Ann and father Richard, campaigning for the Liberal party in 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Moore family, including mother Ann and father Richard, campaigning for the Liberal party in 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Charlotte Moore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>I quite agree that the EU brings some benefits for its citizens. It would be incredible if, after so much expense and so many treaties, it did not; but it does not \u2013 by its own theology, cannot \u2013 deal with the questions I raise. It explicitly opposes national sovereignty and with it the idea that a country can choose and kick out the people who ultimately rule it. It is therefore undemocratic. The European parliament can make little headway against this problem, because there is no European demos.</p> <p>If it is true that national sovereignty means little in the modern world, then democracy is also an illusion. Democracy does not mean merely the right to vote, but the fact that the vote is decisive, rather than advisory: government is formed by the wishes of the people. The Brexit debate has brought out with frightening clarity that large numbers of Remainers dislike democratic power.</p> <p>This behaviour has brought out my fundamental worry about people who think of themselves as \u201cliberal\u201d. They seem terribly motivated by disapproval. They look down on people who are less well educated, and fight culture wars that they cast as enlightenment versus barbarism. This makes them intolerant, which is perhaps the least truly liberal of all dispositions.</p> <p>Take, for example, the widespread belief among liberals that opposition to mass immigration is racist. This is a <em>de haut en bas</em> attitude which grossly misrepresents the attitudes of millions of people. Nowadays almost all \u201cliberal\u201d arguments \u2013 about race, LGBT, sexism, the environment, abortion etc \u2013 are framed thus. The consequence is intolerance; hence the justified popular revolt against \u201cmetropolitan elites\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On climate change, the aim of the large numbers of alarmists is unprecedented government control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Rowan:</h2> <p>You\u2019re making some assumptions here. First that the EU are/were our rulers and that the British electorate and its representatives are therefore powerless. In practice Mrs Thatcher\u2019s fear that, for example, Britain would be forced to join the single currency did not come true: after due political process the British government made the sovereign decision not to join. Speaking for myself, I don\u2019t think that the era of national sovereignty is dead, but I also think that sovereignty is capable of many versions and interpretations.</p> <p>Second, there\u2019s the belief that the Brexit debate can be framed as one of Remainer elites against the Leave-voting \u201cpeople\u201d. I\u2019d suggest that what actually happened after the referendum was this: what you might call the Leave elites exerted their influence over Theresa May\u2019s government (which included several prominent Leavers) to exclude possibilities such as remaining in the customs union and the single market that members of the Leave campaign had explicitly said would be possible after a \u201cno\u201d vote. This disrespected both Remain voters and those Leave voters who didn\u2019t want a hard Brexit. Most of the agonies of the past few months \u2013 the Commons votes, the court cases \u2013 are due to opposition to what is an arrogant and dangerous position.</p> <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>Who are these Leaver elites? No British institutions were dominated by Leavers in 2016, with the exception of a few national newspapers. This dominance has scarcely moved since.</p> <p>All others \u2013 main political parties, House of Commons, House of Lords, Bank of England, Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, civil service, BBC, <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>Economist</em>, all of academia, supreme court, bishops, Scottish government, Welsh government \u2013 are dominated by Remainers. Even the <em>Daily Mail</em> moved Paul Dacre because he was too pro-Brexit. Remainers controlled our government until Boris Johnson became prime minister just over 100 days ago.</p> <p>Obviously Remain was a legitimate point of view and commanded widespread support in the referendum. But the reaction of the elites to the result shocked me and shocks me still. With frequent expressions of contempt, they are still trying to frustrate the largest vote for anything in British history, a vote that defied all their leadership and all their pressure.

But it\u2019s insulting to them to assume that those sympathies colour all their actions. A lot of Remainer MPs voted more than once to leave the EU \u2013 it was with the help of European Research Group votes that we stayed in for so long. Theresa May made a sincere if not very competent attempt to respect the referendum result. The BBC it seems to me tries agonisingly hard to maintain balance \u2013 you can certainly find plenty on the left who feel it is biased against them.

That is the adoption of tough-sounding and offensive positions on the basis that their very offensiveness and toughness must make them right. Boris Johnson\u2019s article comparing Muslim women to letterboxes and bankrobbers is one manifestation. His game here seems to be to provoke liberal outrage by using racist language while disingenuously sheltering behind the defence that he wasn\u2019t actually calling for a ban on face-coverings. Should he or anyone else be playing games with people\u2019s lives like this?</p> <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>Like you, I hate both vice- and virtue-signalling, but I do feel oppressed by a culture war in which liberal people with privileges disdain the less fortunate, particularly those people who declare themselves proud to be British.

There\u2019s a tendency on the right to go easy on him, and on Trump\u2019s complicity with him. Perhaps because both Putin and Trump are somehow seen as defenders of traditional values.</p> <p>You speak in quite general terms, which makes it hard to address your points. I know what you mean by liberal intolerance. I also believe in free speech and question the urge to manage it with legislation. At the same time, racism is real. In cases where \u201cfree speech\u201d serves no purpose but to incite violence against minorities, workable legislation against it shouldn\u2019t be ruled out.</p> <p>But I would like to know what you think conservatism is now. Do you subscribe to the conservative philosopher Michael Oakeshott\u2019s saying that conservatism is about preferring such things as the familiar to the unknown, fact to mystery, the convenient to the perfect? It seems to me that a figure like a Dominic Cummings \u2013 an idealist who likes smashing things up \u2013 is the opposite of this. We currently have a Conservative party that, unlike its forebears, opposes itself to a lot of business, to agriculture, to the judiciary, and which has lost its interest in balancing budgets.</p> <p>This is a version of what is happening in the US, where Republicans support a president clearly hostile to the constitution, who breaks the law, and is unconcerned about running up a huge deficit. Do you think that is a price worth paying for his push\u2011back against liberalism?</p> <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>I do feel as Oakeshott does, very much, but I don\u2019t see Brexit as a smashing of old ways. It is a restoration of national independence and democratic rights which the EU has undermined. Oakeshott opposed EEC membership for this reason, by the way.</p> <p>Cummings is trying to stand up for the democratically dispossessed.</p> <p>Boris has not violated the constitution. His arguably unwise attempt at prorogation was, as David Cameron put it, \u201csharp practice\u201d, but no worse than that. He felt driven to it by Speaker John Bercow\u2019s far greater subversion in which he destroyed the doctrine of the crown in parliament on which our constitution rests. We have had parliament pretending to be the government, delaying a general election and thus making our system unworkable. Any prime minister has to try to overcome that, especially when all these efforts by the elites are aimed to frustrate the result of the largest popular vote ever. So Boris is quite right to call this election.</p> <p>Refusing to accept the result of the referendum is just as bad as refusing to accept an unwelcome general election result, an outrage we have never attempted in our history.</p> <h2>Rowan:</h2> <p>If the referendum were a general election it would have been rerun because of the Leave campaign\u2019s breaches of electoral law (about which Cummings put himself in contempt of parliament by refusing to answer questions \u2013 how is that conservative?).</p> <p>The point also remains that the right wing of the Conservative party keeps pushing for a version of Brexit for which there has never been a popular majority. Most of the agonies of parliament, including Bercow\u2019s interventions, relate to that.</p> <p>I\u2019d still be interested to know if you think Trump is conservative. I\u2019d also like to understand your position on climate change.</p> <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>Sorry, but no discovery of electoral malpractice has ever overturned a margin of 1,300,000 votes. It is important not to get into the \u201cLeave didn\u2019t really win\u201d frame of mind, not only because it isn\u2019t true, but also because it avoids the need to take Leave feeling seriously.</p> <p>The key question for the liberals who were defeated is: \u201cHow, with your massive in-built advantages, did you manage to lose?\u201d You must, collectively, have been astonishingly out of touch. Check your privilege, as they say in PC circles.</p> <p>As for Trump, no, I don\u2019t believe he is a conservative. His essential message is \u201cTrump first\u201d. The only thing I like about him is his refusal to be cowed by the self-righteousness of his opponents.</p> <p>On climate change, I resist what I see as a political viewpoint masquerading as \u201cthe science\u201d. The aim of the large numbers of alarmists is unprecedented government control and the relative impoverishment of western societies. Cheap energy is one of the greatest emancipations produced by our civilisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a6bb0b456a8a01381d6c01eceb1acf98957fe87e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6bb0b456a8a01381d6c01eceb1acf98957fe87e/0_224_3182_3978/800.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at the launch party for the first volume of Charles Moore\u2019s Thatcher biography, 2013.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at the launch party for the first volume of Charles Moore\u2019s Thatcher biography, 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You asked about the current state of conservatism. Pretty bad, I would say \u2013 uncreative and negative. A mirror image, almost, of the state of liberalism.</p> <p>When I said at the beginning that I am not ultimately a liberal, I meant that liberalism lacks content because it has no teleology. When it sticks to its core idea of freedom, however, it is a vital element of a good society. I wish it would let the bird of freedom \u2013 particularly our country\u2019s democratic independence \u2013 soar, instead of pursing its lips in disapproval.</p> <h2>Rowan:</h2> <p>I\u2019m sure if the malpractice had been on the Remain side you would be crying foul.</p> <p>Re Trump: I wish you and your fellow conservatives would express your criticism more plainly.</p> <p>Yes, I do take the Leave vote seriously. But it was a narrow vote after a flawed campaign that has been taken as a licence for whatever Brexiter politicians want it to mean. The missed opportunity was to unite the country around a way of leaving the EU that most people would be happy with. I believe Boris Johnson argued for such a thing at the time.</p> <p>Re climate: if conservatives like yourself don\u2019t want the issue used against you, perhaps you should try harder to show how capitalism can be reconciled with protecting the environment. Thirty years after Mrs Thatcher raised the issue the noises from the right seem to be saying \u201cit\u2019s not really happening\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not that bad\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ll muddle through\u201d.</p> <p>What I find really striking is how strongly you feel that the world is against you and likeminded people, and unfairly so. What I see is 40 years in which the Conservatives have mostly been in power (without ever winning a majority of the vote, thanks to our electoral system), in which Thatcherism has been hugely influential, and in which the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> has, with an amazing blurring of editorial and news, helped to put your fellow columnist into Downing Street.</p> <p>Of course, if you think you are wrongly oppressed anything is allowable \u2013 Cummings\u2019s rulebreaking, Johnson\u2019s lies and betrayals \u2013 but I would ask you, too, to check your privilege.</p> <p>However, you have given me a clearer idea of how liberal assumptions can sound from the outside. I intend to watch myself when I fall into the lazy habits that can go with my worldview. I hope you \u2013 or anyone else who feels like it \u2013 will point them out to me.</p> <p>As for teleology, that\u2019s a discussion for another day.</p> <h2>Charles:</h2> <p>Snap: we both feel oppressed! But I must add that I do not feel personally so at all. I have been lucky. My worry is that normal British people are scorned by many liberals for the non-crime of believing in democratic self-government.</p> <p>Perhaps we at least agree that it would be much better if a more liberal disposition \u2013 which is not the same as a liberal ideology \u2013 prevailed on both sides of the Brexit divide.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dear Charles, we share, I think, some fundamental values and beliefs: in freedom, democracy, justice, the rule of law, also in the value of education, knowledge and art. Yet these beliefs lead us to opposite conclusions about contemporary issues such as Europe, climate change, the position of Islam in western culture and the versions of conservatism now being practised by leaders of the UK and the US. I find these differences intriguing, sometimes mystifying, sometimes troubling. I\u2019d like to get to the bottom of them. In your biography of Margaret Thatcher you describe her versions of these beliefs, about her faith in \u201ceconomic liberty\u201d, her \u201coverall philosophy of everyone having a stake\u201d, also about her occupation of the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d. You could say that she made a promise \u2013 that if you work hard, play by the rules and trust in the market you will be rewarded \u2013 but that the 2008 crash shattered that promise. It seemed that one \u2013 rich and privileged \u2013 group of society was entitled to break rules and get away with it, and that everyone else had to pay the price. Since Thatcher left power in 1990 this country has been ruled either by Conservatives or by Labour prime ministers strongly influenced by her. Do you think they have achieved her ambition, as one of her policy advisers put it, \u201cto liberate people to do things\u201d? Charles: I agree with you about what we agree about! I am not, in my ultimate beliefs, a liberal; but I strongly believe in a liberal order, with the elements you describe, as the most civilised way of governing a country. I also agree that many people (I include myself) feel cheated as a result of the credit crunch of 2008, for the reasons you state. I would not agree that much of this should be laid at Mrs Thatcher\u2019s door, 18 years after she left office. In assessing a political leader fairly, one must understand what problems they had to confront. In 1979, in the economic sphere, Mrs Thatcher had to confront inflation, overmighty trade union leaders, loss-making nationalised industries and a lack of openness to world markets. Broadly speaking \u2013 and with significant mistakes along the way \u2013 she confronted them successfully. When you free up any area, that freedom includes the likelihood that some things will go wrong. The Thatcher government\u2019s abolition of exchange controls in 1979 transformed the capacity of the world to invest in this country, because at last outsiders had the guarantee that money could move freely in and out. This action probably contributed a bit to the financial overheating of the 21st century, but if she had not done what she did, she would have missed her best chance to create a more liberal economic order. Similarly, she had to face down the miners\u2019 strike of 1984-5. If she had not won, trade union boss power would have continued to dominate our economy and our politics, with terrible results for prosperity, liberty and democracy. In 1979, 29.4m working days were lost to strikes. In 1990, the year she left, the figure was below 2m. The figure in 2018 was 273,000 working days lost. This \u201cdivisive\u201d character brought industrial peace, which continues to this day. It is to the discredit of people who think of themselves as liberals that most of them did not support Mrs Thatcher in this, but evaded the issue by moaning about her confrontational style. After she had won they quietly pocketed the gains. Many self-styled liberals hate taking responsibility for unpopular decisions. They seem more preoccupied with the display of virtue than with doing what is right. Rowan: Are you saying that a truly Thatcherite government, if it had stayed in power all that time, would have managed to avoid a crisis like that of 2008? What would it have done differently from Major and Blair? If you felt cheated by 2008, what policies or politicians offer, for you, redress? Given that the problem is not now overmighty trades unions, how might a Thatcher of the past decade \u2013 responding, as you say, to the issues of the time \u2013 have responded to the problems we now have: the loss of security and stagnation of prospects for large sections of the population, compared with the concentration of wealth among a very small percentage? Charles: I make it a rule not to speculate about what Mrs Thatcher would do nowadays. What I know she did worry about, however, especially, in her last couple of years in office, was the way that what was then the European Community (later the EU) offered much clearer benefit to its leaders and officials than to its citizens. She worried about the loss of identity, sovereignty, national independence and democratic accountability under an ever-centralising EU. She also worried about the excessive power of bankers and central bankers \u2013 opposing, unlike her followers, an independent Bank of England, on the grounds that key financial decisions affecting the lives of all citizens should not ultimately be taken by technical experts but by democratically answerable politicians. She was ahead of her time about these matters. The alienation of general European populations from those who rule them has emerged very strongly after the creation of the euro (for reasons she predicted), and because of the 2008 crash and has spread throughout the EU. Rowan: Except that we are now finding out that the EU does have clear benefits to its citizens \u2013 frictionless borders, the single market, cooperation on security and medicine, freedom of movement, peace. We\u2019ll miss them when they\u2019ve gone. The alienation of populations from government has hardly been unique to the eurozone, or the EU. The argument for the EU is not that it is perfect, or even that it is perfectible, but that, like individuals, nations can make themselves stronger by working with others. A lot of anti-EU positions conceive a zero-sum game, in which anything that goes to the EU is automatically a loss to us, and they magnify the disadvantages and minimise the benefits to an absurd degree. In volume three of your biography there are some striking insights into the Euroscepticism of Thatcher\u2019s last years in power. What also comes across vividly is the way in which the bitterness of her removal from office, of which disagreement about Europe was the catalyst but not the only cause, has infected the issue ever since. A lot of the European debate has been a domestic drama in the Conservative party, to which the rest of us are obliged to listen. This history matters to our current situation. It contributes to the absolutist positions, the quasi-military language and the tribalism of the current debate, and the branding (for example) of legitimate critics of the process of enabling the referendum result as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. Charles: I quite agree that the EU brings some benefits for its citizens. It would be incredible if, after so much expense and so many treaties, it did not; but it does not \u2013 by its own theology, cannot \u2013 deal with the questions I raise. It explicitly opposes national sovereignty and with it the idea that a country can choose and kick out the people who ultimately rule it. It is therefore undemocratic. The European parliament can make little headway against this problem, because there is no European demos. If it is true that national sovereignty means little in the modern world, then democracy is also an illusion. Democracy does not mean merely the right to vote, but the fact that the vote is decisive, rather than advisory: government is formed by the wishes of the people. The Brexit debate has brought out with frightening clarity that large numbers of Remainers dislike democratic power. This behaviour has brought out my fundamental worry about people who think of themselves as \u201cliberal\u201d. They seem terribly motivated by disapproval. They look down on people who are less well educated, and fight culture wars that they cast as enlightenment versus barbarism. This makes them intolerant, which is perhaps the least truly liberal of all dispositions. Take, for example, the widespread belief among liberals that opposition to mass immigration is racist. This is a de haut en bas attitude which grossly misrepresents the attitudes of millions of people. Nowadays almost all \u201cliberal\u201d arguments \u2013 about race, LGBT, sexism, the environment, abortion etc \u2013 are framed thus. The consequence is intolerance; hence the justified popular revolt against \u201cmetropolitan elites\u201d. Rowan: You\u2019re making some assumptions here. First that the EU are/were our rulers and that the British electorate and its representatives are therefore powerless. In practice Mrs Thatcher\u2019s fear that, for example, Britain would be forced to join the single currency did not come true: after due political process the British government made the sovereign decision not to join. Speaking for myself, I don\u2019t think that the era of national sovereignty is dead, but I also think that sovereignty is capable of many versions and interpretations. Second, there\u2019s the belief that the Brexit debate can be framed as one of Remainer elites against the Leave-voting \u201cpeople\u201d. I\u2019d suggest that what actually happened after the referendum was this: what you might call the Leave elites exerted their influence over Theresa May\u2019s government (which included several prominent Leavers) to exclude possibilities such as remaining in the customs union and the single market that members of the Leave campaign had explicitly said would be possible after a \u201cno\u201d vote. This disrespected both Remain voters and those Leave voters who didn\u2019t want a hard Brexit. Most of the agonies of the past few months \u2013 the Commons votes, the court cases \u2013 are due to opposition to what is an arrogant and dangerous position. Charles: Who are these Leaver elites? No British institutions were dominated by Leavers in 2016, with the exception of a few national newspapers. This dominance has scarcely moved since. All others \u2013 main political parties, House of Commons, House of Lords, Bank of England, Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, civil service, BBC, Financial Times, Economist, all of academia, supreme court, bishops, Scottish government, Welsh government \u2013 are dominated by Remainers. Even the Daily Mail moved Paul Dacre because he was too pro-Brexit. Remainers controlled our government until Boris Johnson became prime minister just over 100 days ago. Obviously Remain was a legitimate point of view and commanded widespread support in the referendum. But the reaction of the elites to the result shocked me and shocks me still. With frequent expressions of contempt, they are still trying to frustrate the largest vote for anything in British history, a vote that defied all their leadership and all their pressure. Don\u2019t any of them think they might have got something wrong? Rowan: Wow. We really do see the world in different ways. I see an immensely powerful coalition of most of the national press with politicians who now form the cabinet. You see a plucky band of rebels opposing a phalanx of institutions. Charles: Do you disagree that any of the institutions I named are dominated by Remainers? Rowan: I expect that most people in those institutions have Remainer sympathies. But it\u2019s insulting to them to assume that those sympathies colour all their actions. A lot of Remainer MPs voted more than once to leave the EU \u2013 it was with the help of European Research Group votes that we stayed in for so long. Theresa May made a sincere if not very competent attempt to respect the referendum result. The BBC it seems to me tries agonisingly hard to maintain balance \u2013 you can certainly find plenty on the left who feel it is biased against them. The unanimous decision of the supreme court was a case of the justices reading the law as they saw it \u2013 ie doing their job. In the same way that the Queen was doing her job (arguably) in assenting to Johnson\u2019s request for prorogation \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make her part of a leaver conspiracy. To speak more generally about elites and populism: yes, there is such a thing as virtue-signalling, as well as the genuine and justified speaking out for minorities who, as a matter of fact, continue to suffer from prejudice and discrimination. But I\u2019d question the view that members of conservative elites such as yourself seem to have of \u201cthe people\u201d as being inherently conservative on social issues and immigration. The current right practises what has fairly been called vice-signalling. That is the adoption of tough-sounding and offensive positions on the basis that their very offensiveness and toughness must make them right. Boris Johnson\u2019s article comparing Muslim women to letterboxes and bankrobbers is one manifestation. His game here seems to be to provoke liberal outrage by using racist language while disingenuously sheltering behind the defence that he wasn\u2019t actually calling for a ban on face-coverings. Should he or anyone else be playing games with people\u2019s lives like this? Charles: Like you, I hate both vice- and virtue-signalling, but I do feel oppressed by a culture war in which liberal people with privileges disdain the less fortunate, particularly those people who declare themselves proud to be British. By the way, the late, great Deborah Orr wrote about the Muslim veil with views very similar to those of Boris. It is indeed important to speak out for minorities, but the selection process is interesting. Which liberals speak out for Christians? Also, modern liberal doctrines that are supposed to embody tolerance often operate intolerantly. Take the word \u201cdiversity\u201d. In practice, it means \u201cuniformity\u201d \u2013 a set of contestable opinions to which you must subscribe if you wish to work in the public service. Rowan: Your mention of Christianity is significant. I get the impression that you feel that something fundamental to western society is endangered, both by critics within and non-Christian societies outside. Am I right? Charles: I do feel that something fundamental to western society is endangered, but much more by critics within than by non-Christian societies outside. The main exterior threats are the rise of China, the belligerence of Putin\u2019s Russia and global Islamist extremism (sometimes known as \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d), but all of these are containable if our elites would defend the western way of life. My late friend [former Spectator editor] Frank Johnson observed 25 years ago that: \u201cThe left, having failed to nationalise the economy, is nationalising people.\u201d Nowadays, liberal thought is barely distinguishable from the left.

They are also actively hostile to orthodox Christian belief (and mainstream Jewish teaching too). Rowan: I\u2019m glad you include Putin on your list of threats. There\u2019s a tendency on the right to go easy on him, and on Trump\u2019s complicity with him. Perhaps because both Putin and Trump are somehow seen as defenders of traditional values. You speak in quite general terms, which makes it hard to address your points. I know what you mean by liberal intolerance. I also believe in free speech and question the urge to manage it with legislation. At the same time, racism is real. In cases where \u201cfree speech\u201d serves no purpose but to incite violence against minorities, workable legislation against it shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. But I would like to know what you think conservatism is now. Do you subscribe to the conservative philosopher Michael Oakeshott\u2019s saying that conservatism is about preferring such things as the familiar to the unknown, fact to mystery, the convenient to the perfect? It seems to me that a figure like a Dominic Cummings \u2013 an idealist who likes smashing things up \u2013 is the opposite of this. We currently have a Conservative party that, unlike its forebears, opposes itself to a lot of business, to agriculture, to the judiciary, and which has lost its interest in balancing budgets. This is a version of what is happening in the US, where Republicans support a president clearly hostile to the constitution, who breaks the law, and is unconcerned about running up a huge deficit. Do you think that is a price worth paying for his push\u2011back against liberalism? Charles: I do feel as Oakeshott does, very much, but I don\u2019t see Brexit as a smashing of old ways. It is a restoration of national independence and democratic rights which the EU has undermined. Oakeshott opposed EEC membership for this reason, by the way. Cummings is trying to stand up for the democratically dispossessed. Boris has not violated the constitution. His arguably unwise attempt at prorogation was, as David Cameron put it, \u201csharp practice\u201d, but no worse than that. He felt driven to it by Speaker John Bercow\u2019s far greater subversion in which he destroyed the doctrine of the crown in parliament on which our constitution rests. We have had parliament pretending to be the government, delaying a general election and thus making our system unworkable. Any prime minister has to try to overcome that, especially when all these efforts by the elites are aimed to frustrate the result of the largest popular vote ever. So Boris is quite right to call this election. Refusing to accept the result of the referendum is just as bad as refusing to accept an unwelcome general election result, an outrage we have never attempted in our history. Rowan: If the referendum were a general election it would have been rerun because of the Leave campaign\u2019s breaches of electoral law (about which Cummings put himself in contempt of parliament by refusing to answer questions \u2013 how is that conservative?). The point also remains that the right wing of the Conservative party keeps pushing for a version of Brexit for which there has never been a popular majority. Most of the agonies of parliament, including Bercow\u2019s interventions, relate to that. I\u2019d still be interested to know if you think Trump is conservative. I\u2019d also like to understand your position on climate change. Charles: Sorry, but no discovery of electoral malpractice has ever overturned a margin of 1,300,000 votes. It is important not to get into the \u201cLeave didn\u2019t really win\u201d frame of mind, not only because it isn\u2019t true, but also because it avoids the need to take Leave feeling seriously. The key question for the liberals who were defeated is: \u201cHow, with your massive in-built advantages, did you manage to lose?\u201d You must, collectively, have been astonishingly out of touch. Check your privilege, as they say in PC circles. As for Trump, no, I don\u2019t believe he is a conservative. His essential message is \u201cTrump first\u201d. The only thing I like about him is his refusal to be cowed by the self-righteousness of his opponents. On climate change, I resist what I see as a political viewpoint masquerading as \u201cthe science\u201d. The aim of the large numbers of alarmists is unprecedented government control and the relative impoverishment of western societies. Cheap energy is one of the greatest emancipations produced by our civilisation. You asked about the current state of conservatism. Pretty bad, I would say \u2013 uncreative and negative. A mirror image, almost, of the state of liberalism. When I said at the beginning that I am not ultimately a liberal, I meant that liberalism lacks content because it has no teleology. When it sticks to its core idea of freedom, however, it is a vital element of a good society. I wish it would let the bird of freedom \u2013 particularly our country\u2019s democratic independence \u2013 soar, instead of pursing its lips in disapproval. Rowan: I\u2019m sure if the malpractice had been on the Remain side you would be crying foul. Re Trump: I wish you and your fellow conservatives would express your criticism more plainly. Yes, I do take the Leave vote seriously. But it was a narrow vote after a flawed campaign that has been taken as a licence for whatever Brexiter politicians want it to mean. The missed opportunity was to unite the country around a way of leaving the EU that most people would be happy with. I believe Boris Johnson argued for such a thing at the time. Re climate: if conservatives like yourself don\u2019t want the issue used against you, perhaps you should try harder to show how capitalism can be reconciled with protecting the environment. Thirty years after Mrs Thatcher raised the issue the noises from the right seem to be saying \u201cit\u2019s not really happening\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not that bad\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019ll muddle through\u201d. What I find really striking is how strongly you feel that the world is against you and likeminded people, and unfairly so. What I see is 40 years in which the Conservatives have mostly been in power (without ever winning a majority of the vote, thanks to our electoral system), in which Thatcherism has been hugely influential, and in which the Daily Telegraph has, with an amazing blurring of editorial and news, helped to put your fellow columnist into Downing Street. Of course, if you think you are wrongly oppressed anything is allowable \u2013 Cummings\u2019s rulebreaking, Johnson\u2019s lies and betrayals \u2013 but I would ask you, too, to check your privilege. However, you have given me a clearer idea of how liberal assumptions can sound from the outside. I intend to watch myself when I fall into the lazy habits that can go with my worldview. I hope you \u2013 or anyone else who feels like it \u2013 will point them out to me. As for teleology, that\u2019s a discussion for another day. Charles: Snap: we both feel oppressed! But I must add that I do not feel personally so at all. I have been lucky. My worry is that normal British people are scorned by many liberals for the non-crime of believing in democratic self-government. Perhaps we at least agree that it would be much better if a more liberal disposition \u2013 which is not the same as a liberal ideology \u2013 prevailed on both sides of the Brexit divide.",

Then, four times a year, she would go to Brighton \u201cand the benefits would keep me going for the next few months \u2013 so I didn\u2019t get into a place of being overwhelmed or stressed, just keeping myself topped up\u201d. The coast does seem to be especially effective, however. White suggests this is due to the ebb and flow of the tides. He points out that rumination \u2013 focusing on negative thoughts about one\u2019s distress \u2013 is an established factor in depression. \u201cWhat we find is that spending time walking on the beach, there\u2019s a transition towards thinking outwards towards the environment, thinking about those patterns \u2013 putting your life in perspective, if you like.\u201d When you are sailing, surfing or swimming, says White, \u201cyou\u2019re really in tune with natural forces there \u2013 you have to understand the motion of the wind, the movement of the water\u201d. By being forced to concentrate on the qualities of the environment, we access a cognitive state honed over millennia. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of getting back in touch with our historical heritage, cognitively.\u201d Water is, quite literally, immersive. As well as an academic, Kelly is a wellness practitioner who teaches classes in \u201cmindfulness by the sea\u201d. She says the sea has a meditative quality \u2013 whether it is crashing or still, or you are in the water or observing from the shore. \u201cYou can immerse yourself in it, which you can\u2019t really do with a green space. You\u2019re present in that moment, you\u2019re looking at something with intention, and whether that\u2019s for two minutes or half an hour, it gives you the benefits in that moment.\u201d In the future, she believes time in blue space will be a mainstream, formalised response. \u201cThe mental health crisis isn\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she says. Rees says support for the idea of \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d prescriptions for individuals is growing. A \u201csurfing for mental health\u201d group in north Devon is one example she gives of how \u201cnature-based interventions\u201d can work. By working to characterise and quantify benefits, BlueHealth\u2019s cross-disciplinary team hopes to establish how \u201cblue infrastructure\u201d \u2013 the coast, rivers, inland lakes \u2013 can help tackle major public health challenges such as obesity, physical inactivity and mental health disorders. A 2016 paper \u2013 which White co-authored \u2013 put the monetary value of the health benefit of engaging with the marine environment at \u00a3176m. Harnessing the power of blue space could also potentially help to alleviate inequality. \u201cOne of our recent papers finds that the benefits of coastal living are strongest for people living in the poorest areas,\u201d says Elliott. For that reason, it is crucial to ensure everyone has access. With proximity to water associated with at least a 10% premium in house prices, White is concerned by the exclusivity of seaside urban development. \u201cWhat will happen is you\u2019ll get this kind of gentrification, where the people who benefit most will get squeezed inland.\u201d Access provisions under the revised Marine and Coastal Access Act, which is due to be completed next year, will help, says White. But seaside communities are particularly vulnerable, imminently from seasonal fluctuations in income and environmental degradation, and, in the longer term, sea level rise and extreme weather due to climate change. Rees says that the benefits of marine environments for our wellbeing are tied to the health of those environments, and that conservation efforts need to factor in the \u201cnatural capital\u201d of blue space in supporting our wellbeing. Kelly\u2019s work has found a link between a sense of personal connection to the sea and environmentally friendly behaviours; researchers hope that we may be more inclined to protect blue space if the health benefits are proven. \u201cTo go to the sea is synonymous with letting go,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cIt could be lying on a beach or somebody handing you a cocktail. For somebody else, it could be a wild, empty coast. But there is this really human sense of: \u2018Oh, look, there\u2019s the sea\u2019 \u2013 and the shoulders drop.\u201d",

It\u2019s the Twilight Derby, which I\u2019m fairly certain used to be at the end of the card as the name suggests, but now it\u2019s run at 11am local time. Go figure, as they say. </p> <p>After that, it\u2019s on to the nine Breeders\u2019 Cup races, kicking off with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint. The races will come up thick and fast once we get going, so here\u2019s some video form to peruse as the minutes count down to post time. </p> <p>The market leaders for this race - which, somewhat confusingly for Europeans, is run over seven furlongs - are <strong>Covfefe</strong> - named after one of Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/31/what-is-covfefe-donald-trump-baffles-twitter-post\">bizarre Twitter bloopers</a> - <strong>Come Dancing</strong> and <strong>Spiced Perfection. </strong>First up, Covfefe, getting the better of a fantastic stretch duel with Serengeti Empress at Saratoga.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYLdDV42pVo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dYLdDV42pVo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Covfefe</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbd9f4d8f08d669cdab1b3f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-02T18:02:43.651Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to Santa Anita in Arcadia, Los Angeles, for day two of the 2019 Breeders\u2019 Cup (or welcome back, if you were here on Friday as Europe\u2019s challenge for the juvenile events <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y6njlkxs\">was comprehensively dismissed</a> by the American-trained two-year-olds).</p> <p>That was a disappointing way for the travelling contingent to start the weekend, but Saturday\u2019s card is where the real riches and glory lie and there are European runners with big chances in three of the four turf events. <strong>Anthony Van Dyck</strong>, the Derby winner, attempts to win his first race since in the Turf where <strong>Old Persian</strong> is also strongly fancied, and <strong>Circus Maximus,</strong> the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes winner, is the probable favourite for the Mile. And there are also five ultra-competitive races on the main track which will have fans of dirt racing queuing up at the betting windows in the hope of retrieving just a little of what they left behind on Friday.</p> <p>There were some unexpected results here yesterday to say the least, above all in the feature event, the Juvenile, where all three of the eight horses that were showing at single-figure odds at the off finished out of the frame. </p> <p>The \u201call-sources handle\u201d for yesterday\u2019s 10-race card, including five Breeders\u2019 Cup events, was a new record for the first day of the meeting at $56.5m [\u00a346m], so somebody definitely went home happy. Form-followers, though, will hope that the racing redistributes wealth a little more even-handedly this afternoon.</p> <p>The first three Breeders\u2019 Cup races are all-American affairs after Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s two entries in the Turf Sprint (19.33) failed to make it onto the plane. The action starts at 18.55GMT with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint - and rolls all the way to one of the most open renewals of the Classic that I can remember at 00.44GMT. McKinzie, Vino Rosso, Code Of Honor, Yoshida and Elate are all priced up at between 4-1 and 7-1 by Britain\u2019s bookmakers and the fans here at Santa Anita may face an equally tricky task in separating them when the time comes around seven hours from now.</p> <p>The best news after yesterday\u2019s opening card was that all the runners returned safe and well after their races.</p> <p>This Breeders\u2019 Cup is being staged under unprecedented scrutiny after the much-publicised deaths of 36 horses at this track while either racing or training since the start of the year.</p> <p>The track has initiated a number of reforms in an attempt to address the issue and, so far, the rate of fatal injuries has dropped sharply since racing resumed here after the summer break at the end of September. Management and fans will still approach today\u2019s action with some apprehension, however, as there is a low level of inherent risk in horse racing and no amount of effort will ever get the injury rate down to zero. Around 997 of every 1,000 starters here do not suffer a fatal injury, but an incident-free Breeders\u2019 Cup would certainly help to underline the point. And even then, there are still deep structural issues in American racing which need to be addressed, as this <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/yxnhxrtl\">excellent analysis</a> by Mark Irby of Animal Wellness Action points out.</p> <p>Santa Anita\u2019s new regime on veterinary inspections of all runners has had a significant impact on the European challenge today, as both Fleeting (Filly &amp; Mare Turf) and Suedois (Mile) have been ruled out after being found to be slightly lame when inspected this morning.</p> <p>Other non-runners from the original declarations are Thais, the probable pace-maker in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, who was ruled out by vets a couple of days ago, and Imperial Hint, who was scratched from the Sprint after his morning inspection.</p> <p>The main card at the Breeders\u2019 Cup is one of the best racing days of the year, the action gets underway in just over an hour and there will be video form and more for all the races in this space as the day goes on. Let\u2019s do this! </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "No, the news is now through. Mongolian Groom has been put down as his injuries meant that he could not be saved. After what had been to that point an excellent and injury-free two days of racing, it is a truly miserable way to end the meeting and one that is likely to reverberate for days, weeks and potentially months to come. The only name that is likely to be widely remembered from this Breeders\u2019 Cup is that of the horse that did not cross the line. Grim news. This is Greg Wood at Santa Anita, signing off. No further news on Mongolian Groom for almost an hour now. He remains under observation at Santa Anita\u2019s equine hospital and it could be some time before there is anything more to report. The Paulick Report website reports that X-rays show Mongolian Groom has fractures in the lower part of his cannon-bone and the upper part of his pastern, and quotes veterinary surgeon Dr Al Ruggles. In the interview room, one of the owners of Vino Rosso is pointing out that the horse spent the first couple of years of his life alongside Justify, last year\u2019s Triple Crown winner, at the farm of breeder John Gunther. Some crop, that. Latest news on Mongolian Groom from a Santa Anita spokesperson: Mongolian Groom was pulled up at the top of the stretch ... with a serious injury to his left hind ankle. The injury is serious and at this point they [veterinary staff] are trying to work with connections on what treatment options they would like to pursue. Fearing the worst for Mongolian Groom. It had been an injury-free meeting until the final furlong of the final race, what a desperate way to conclude if the news is as bad as it seems. There are chants of \u201cVi-no, Vi-no\u201d in the winner\u2019s enclosure as Todd Pletcher\u2019s 13th runner in the Classic proves to be the one that gives him a first success. Mongolian Groom appeared to suffer a leg injury and has been taken straight to the track\u2019s hospital for assessment. McKinzie was sat in ideal position turning in but Vino Rosso came up with an irresistible charge down the stretch to put the race to bed half a furlong from the line. Higher Power, Elate and Math Wizard filled the next three places. A hugely exciting race but there is, possibly, the post-script no-one wanted. Mongolian Groom appeared to break down in the stretch and was taken away in the ambulance. More news as it arrives. 1 VINO ROSSO, 2 McKinzie, 3 Higher Power A stretch duel and then it goes the way of Vino Rosso! McKinzie second, Higher Power third. McKinzie in front but here comes Vino Rosso Three are clear at the moment, McKinzie included Favourite going ominously well McKinzie running free, half-checked by the leader but sits second War Of Will leads early McKinzie broke well, Code Of Honor held up Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic! The runners are going behind. A big cheer as the track announcer says that it\u2019s post time for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic! I\u2019d take a picture to show you how beautiful the San Gabriel mountains look in the sunset, but no photo could do them justice. Three minutes to the off in the Classic. Almost $4m in the win pool, and more than $1m for the place. McKinzie is showing at 5-2 on the tote, with Code Of Honor 7-2. Vino Rosso is 9-2, Yoshida is 5-1, Elate and Higher Power are both 9-1. Six of the 11, in other words, at shorter than 10-1. So, as the sun sinks lower in the Californian sky and the runners start to come out onto the track, it\u2019s time to make your pick in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic. My 1-2-3: Code Of Honor, Elate, McKinzie. And don\u2019t forget Higher Power in a remarkably open Classic. He was below his best last time out but would have every chance on his win in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar. The mare Elate is another live runner. She has finished close behind Blue Prize and Midnight Bisou, the 1-2 in teh Distaff, on her last two starts and also won the Delaware Handicap at Del Mar earlier this year. Spurned by Baffert, Mike Smith is now on Yoshida, a regular in the big Grade 1 events and fourth at Churchill 12 months ago. He was within two lengths of McKinzie at Saratoga but is without a top-flight win since last year\u2019s Woodward. Vino Rosso was first past the post in the Jockey Club Gold Cup but (rightly, I think) lost the race to Code Of Honor in the stewards\u2019 room. But he\u2019s a big runner too, and has Grade 1 winning form over track and trip earlier this year. I reckon Code Of Honor will give McKinzie plenty to think about. The runner-up in the Kentucky Derby has won three times since, including the Travers at Saratoga and the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont. Post time for the Classic is in 36 minutes so that\u2019s plenty of time for some video form ahead of the biggest race of the day. McKinzie is the favourite, and was due to be ridden by Big Money Mike Smith until Bob Baffert jocked him off in favour of Joel Rosario a month ago. He has done most of his racing at shorter trips than today\u2019s 10 furlongs, and was only 12th of 14 when fancied for the Classic 12 months ago. His form has been a bit in and out this year too, but at his best - in the Whitney at Saratoga, for instance - he definitely looks like the one to beat. They have just shown Zenyatta\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic in 2009 on the big screen. In a game of Desert Island Races, it\u2019s the one I\u2019d hold onto if the other seven were swept away. The moment when she loomed up in the straight after looking a lost cause going past the Clubhouse first time was astonishing, thrilling and magical all at once. Just one race to go now at Breeders\u2019 Cup 2019 and while the Europeans will be returning home with just the one winner, it\u2019s been everything that the organisers could have hoped for so far in terms of the safety and welfare of the participants. There\u2019s a fair old gap until the big race - it\u2019s scheduled for 64 minutes after the turf to give NBC a good, long run at it. Old Persian was a big disappointment, he took a strong hold early on and was one of the first horses beaten. That was a performance worthy of a Horse Of The Year award from Bricks And Mortar, not least after the series of reverses for favourites at the meeting so far. Ryan Moore had to check at a vital stage in the stretch but it\u2019s very hard to argue that he might have beaten the favourite. 1 BRICKS AND MORTAR, 2 United, 3 Anthony Van Dyck Ryan Moore niggling on the Derby winner, then he\u2019s blocked in his run as Bricks and Mortar charges, and he\u2019s got there, Bricks And Mortar gets up to win! The big three are all well positioned to challenge Outsider Acclimate leads them out down the back, Bricks and Mortar fourth, Old Persian is seventh coming down the straight for the first time, Anthony Van Dyck settled against the rail in fifth Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf! Arklow getting worked up in the stalls Irad Ortiz and Bricks And Mortar will be coming out of stall nine, alongside Old Persian and William Buick in 10. Anthony Van Dyck and Ryan More are in five, and they\u2019re going in. This is what the Europeans have to contend with: Bricks And Mortar taking the Manhattan at Belmont Park in New York. Anthony Van Dyck, Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s last chance of a winner to match Joseph\u2019s, is a 6-1 chance. Old Persian is 7-2 to extend Charlie Appleby\u2019s remarkable record at the Breeders\u2019 Cup. The runners are out on the track for the Turf. Bricks And Mortar, on a six-race winning streak to here, is the hot favourite. Midnight Bisou was on a six-race winning streak. So was Sistercharlie. Some punters are starting to sense a pattern here ... We\u2019re now heading towards the climax of the meeting: the Turf in 10 minutes\u2019 time and then the Classic. Here\u2019s the replay of the Distaff: As expected, Smith is taking plenty of flak on social media. In his defence, Midnight Bisou did not break all that well and had to face plenty of kickback against the rail. But even so, it did not look good. Blue Prize has run her last race and now retires to the paddocks. Midnight Bisou, however, will be kept in training at five, presumably with the Distaff at Keeneland next year as the long-term target. For the second time today, Big Money Mike Smith has become Lose Money Mike Smith for the backers, again finishing fast but too late on one of the shortest-priced favourites at the meeting. Midnight Bisou had three lengths to make up just to reach the fourth-placed horse turning for home. She did her best, but faced an impossible task to run down the winner. Smith is the winning-most jockey in Breeders\u2019 Cup history, but that will not count for much with favourite-backers right now. 1 BLUE PRIZE, 2 Midnight Bisou, 3 Serengeti Empress Chasing but not catching, Blue Prize wins with Midnight Bisou only second. Another big favourite beaten. Blue Prize in front, Midnight Bisou chasing Here she comes but too late? Midnight Bisou has work to do Paradise Woods also close up Midnight Bisou against the rail in seventh, Serengeti Empress still leads, halfway down the back Serengeti Empress quickly away, Mo See Cal chasing, Midnight BIsou mid division Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Distaff! Midnight Bisou was third behind Monomoy Girl in last year\u2019s Distaff but she has taken her form to a new level at four. Dunbar Road, a Grade 1 winner at Saratoga in the summer, and Blue Prize, who beat her in the Spinster last time, are the only other horses at single figure odds. This is all about Midnight Bisou, who will be a huge contender for Horse Of The Year if she can get the win here. It has been a tricky meeting for the punters overall but Mitole was a popular winner of the Sprint earlier, for this backer in particular. Here\u2019s Uni\u2019s win in the Mile via Twitter: Two heavy favourites have been beaten already today in Sistercharlie and Omaha Beach. Now here comes another: Midnight Bisou, market leader for the Distaff. She\u2019s showing at 4-5 to complete an unbeaten eight-race season having started her campaign on 27 January at Sam Houston Park. This is her most recent win, in the Beldame Stakes at Belmont Park. Rosario lost a lot of ground making his challenge as he did, but there was never going to be anything getting in his way in the stretch. He was tracking Circus Maximus until the turn out of the back but left him standing on his charge for glory. Circus Maximus was only a nose behind Without Parole in fourth but that\u2019s another sweep of the places for the Americans. Uni made a huge move around the outside on the turn for home and ended up five wide entering the the stretch as a result, but it turned out to be a winning decision by Joel Rosario. He was in front with about half a furlong to run and was going away again at the line. 1 UNI, 2 Got Stormy, 3 Without Parole Big outside move by Uni, Frankie getting swamped, Uni goes on to win, with Got Stormy next Circus Maximus about sixth on theoutside El Tormenta next, Frankie setting a good clip Frankie gets across to lead from 13 on Hey Gaman Approaching the stalls ... starting to load ... Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Mile! If one of the other runners here sound familiar, by the way, it should. Without Parole won last year\u2019s St James\u2019s Palace Stakes for John Gosden and started the season in Newmarket before a switch to Chad Brown\u2019s US stable. Four minutes to post in the Mile. Joseph O\u2019Brien has a slice of history already, now his dad Aidan will try to add another. I\u2019ve not had time to check, but I think the chances of there having been a father and son saddling winners on the same day at the Breeders\u2019 Cup before are somewhat remote. They are in the paddock for the Mile. In the meantime, here\u2019s Joseph O\u2019Brien winning the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf on St Nicholas Abbey as an 18-year-old. What\u2019s really scary is that he\u2019s only 26 now. Yesterday was tough for the Europeans but Iridessa\u2019s has instilled a bit more confidence and there are several runners with a chance in the Mile, up next in 20 minutes. Circus Maximus, a Royal Ascot winner, is the obvious team leader but Space Traveller and Danny Tudhope are worth a second look - I tipped them, as it happens - while the popular grey Lord Glitters and James\u2019s Tate\u2019s Hey Gaman, with Frankie aboard, are not just here to make up the numbers. Leading the home side is Get Stormy from the Mark Casse stable. He\u2019s the narrow 5-2 favourite on the tote at the moment with Circus Maximus next at 7-2. Space Traveller is currently 25-1 by the way if you have access to the US pools. Just as he did in the Amsterdam, Shancelot absolutely blitzed through the opening quarter and he still looked good for the win turning in. But Ricardo Santana had got it just right on Mitole and as the leader started to tire, he ran him down to win with something to spare. He just couldn\u2019t dominate the whole of a Grade 1 field as he did at Grade 2 level. 1 MITOLE, 2 Shancelot, 3 Whitmore Can he keep it up? they\u2019re turning in, Shancelot still here comes Mitole, getting to him a sub 22 second quarter Shancelot is burning along Catalina Cruiser slowly away, Shancelot quickly in front Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Sprint! Joseph O\u2019Brien is presumably heading straight on to Melbourne tonight, but you wouldn\u2019t put it past him to call in at Cork on the way ... Impressive stuff, but then you see Shancelot\u2019s win in the Grade Two Amsterdam Stakes and all you can say is wow. They were strung out like washing after two furlongs as Shancelot set outstanding fractions, but at no stage did he ever look like stopping in front. He\u2019s not backed it up since but has been beaten only narrowly, including by Omaha Beach here at Santa Anita. A return to that form would make him very hard to beat and he\u2019s favourite at 9-5. Give the Amsterdam a watch: The runners for the Sprint have come into the paddock amid all the excitement. It\u2019s a shame that Imperial Hint is out but this is still a really interesting renewal of this race, with three big contenders in Catalina Cruiser, Shancelot and Mitole. Mitole has been beaten only once in nine starts, when second to Imperial Hint in a race at Saratoga that was run in record time. This is his excellent win in the Forego Stakes: Joseph O\u2019Brien is in the interview room, talking about Iridessa: We thought she was a legitimate contender. We had a good draw and Wayne gave her a fantastic ride, it\u2019s a special day And here, while I\u2019ve got a moment, is the vid of Spun To Run\u2019s defeat of Omaha Beach earlier on. O\u2019Brien and Lordan will be in the interview room soon. In the meantime, here\u2019s the replay of her victory via the Breeders\u2019 Cup Twitter feed: Some day for Joseph O\u2019Brien, who has now had winners at Flemington in Australia, Down Royal in Ireland and Santa Anita in California. That was a fantastic ride by Wayne Lordan. He knew, of course, that Mirth would come back to the field but he would not have been human if a few doubts hadn\u2019t started to creep in as they left the back stretch. He then timed his run to perfection in the stretch, having made sure he was right on Vasilika\u2019s tail turning in. He then had just enough left to edge past Flavien Prat for the win at 13-1. 1 IRIDESSA 2 Vasilika 3 Sistercharlie Iridess wins for Joseph O\u2019Brien and Wayne Lordan, O\u2019Brien is the second person - after Freddy Head - to both ride and train a Breeders\u2019 Cup winner. Iridessa is in front, closing stages ... she goes past locked with Vasilika Castle Lady goes after her, the lead is shrinking Mirth eight lengths clear going down the back, Vasilika still in pursuit Mirth is a clear leader from Vasilika Iridessa third going past the stands, Sistercharlie fifth Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf! Sistercharlie is even money. Vasillika is second choice at 5-1, Billesdon Brook - a 1,000 Guineas winner, no less - is 18-1 and Iridessa is 14-1. Frankie has got some backers though, despite a wide draw, and Fanny Logan is showing at around 7-1. Two minutes to post time! Another interesting runner, meanwhile, is Dan Ward\u2019s Vasilika, in more ways than one. Until recently, she was trained by Hall of Famer Jerry Hollendorfer, who was banned from Santa Anita in June after a fourth horse in his care suffered a fatal injury while racing since the start of the year. Janet Hollendorfer, his wife, is one of Vasilika\u2019s co-owners and there could be some fireworks in the interview room if she prevails. Iridessa\u2019s Group One wins include the Matron Stakes: Sistercharlie is showing at 4-5 on the tote and she will be a very tough nut to crack. Here she is winning the Beverly D Stakes earlier this year: Frankie Dettori has been discussing his ride on Fanny Logan with Nick Luck, 25 years after his first Breeders\u2019 Cup win in the same colours on Barathea. That really wasn\u2019t Mike Smith\u2019s finest hour, though praise is also due to Irad Ortiz jnr who rode a perfect race from the front, taking charge from an early stage and getting his opponents to dance to his tune. Another hot favourite goes down, and another coming up. Sistercharlie defends her crown in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf in 17 minutes\u2019 time, vs European challengers Iridessa, Billesdon Brook, Just Wonderful and Fanny Logan. As expected, Mike Smith\u2019s effort there did not find favour with many of Omaha Beach\u2019s punters. Most tweets are unsuitable for a family audience, this is one of the few without at least half a dozen very rude words. Talking of Twitter, here\u2019s a take on Covfefe\u2019s win earlier: Twitter, I sense, is not going to be kind to \u201cBig Money\u201d Mike Smith after that ride on Omaha Beach. The pace is holding up very well at Santa Anita this afternoon. Spun To Run is another all-the-way winner, sent straight into a lead he never looked likely to surrender by Irad Ortiz jnr. It was soft lead too - they covered the half-mile in 46.51sec - and Mike Smith gave him too much rope on Omaha Beach. He closed from the home turn but he was always going to run out of track. 1 SPUN TO RUN, 2 Omaha Beach, 3 Blue Chipper He\u2019s going to come up short, Spun To Run hangs on, Omaha Beach second Spun To Run still in front, here comes the favourite Omaha Beach still plenty to do but starting to make progress Blue Chipper is second Omaha Beach mid division, five lengths off the lead Spun To Run leads into the first turn Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile! This race starts right in front of the stand, can\u2019t beat the sound of the gates crashing open. One minute to post time. The punters are not convinced by that form, however, and are very much siding with Omaha Beach. He could well be the first, perhaps only, odds-on shot on the card and is currently showing at 4-5. The main challengers to Omaha Beach are expected to be Improbable and Mr Money, who both ran in the Pennsylvania Derby earlier in the year, finishing fourth and second respectively. Omaha Beach had been off the track for six months, however, when he returned to action with a victory in the Santa Anita Sprint Championship. That gives him the unusual record coming into today\u2019s race of having won his last two starts, both Grade 1 events, at nine furlongs and then six furlongs. There is a British-trained runner in the race in Jane Chapple-Hyam\u2019s Ambassadorial with Jamie Spencer in the plate. He\u2019s the only European runner on the dirt at the meeting, and a big outsider at 60-1. The favourite is Omaha Beach, who was also favourite for the Kentucky Derby earlier in the year until he was scratched three days before the race due to a breathing problem. He was the favourite for the Derby after winning the Arkansas Derby: More on the Turf Sprint as it arrives, but now it\u2019s getting towards time for what is without doubt the most entertaining/intriguing/bizarre* name for a race on the card all night: the Big Ass Fans Dirt Mile. (*delete according to taste). The new sponsors of the Dirt Mile make fans. Very big fans, in fact. And their logo is an Ass. Hence, Big Ass Fans. Another winner on the tight turf track here that made most or all of the running. Belvoir Bay was a 15-1 shot but never seemed likely to be reeled in after somehow managing to get to the lead from his wide draw in stall 12. Eddie Haskell beat only one home, Totally Boss was away well enough from his inside draw but last and beaten with two furlongs to run. Stormy Liberal was in fourth turning in but soon faded. 1 BELVOIR BAY, 2 Om, 3 Shekky Shebaz But they\u2019re not going to get there, Belvoir Bay makes all Belvoir Bay leads at the turn, here comes Shekky Shebaz and Om Totally Boss is last Belvoir Bay prominent, Shekky Shebaz close up Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint! They are out on the track for the Turf Sprint, six minutes to post time. Shekky Shebaz is popular with the local players, he was 12-1 on the morning line but is currently 5-1 here. He took the Lucky Coin Stakes at Saratoga. Totally Boss is also fancied, along with Imprimis, the first of Frankie Dettori\u2019s rides today. Here\u2019s Totally Boss winning at Kentucky Downs, in a race that also includes the super-busy Stormy Liberal and Imprimis, who can be seen getting little luck in running on the way to finishing fourth. Next up here is the Turf Sprint, in which the admirably durable Stormy Liberal will attempt to complete a hat-trick of wins having taken the same event at both Del Mar and Churchill Downs over the last two years. He\u2019s not the favourite, though (current 13-1, in fact). Eddie Haskell was the morning-line favourite at 9-2 and can be seen here finishing second in the Eddie D Stakes, with Stormy Liberal in third. Covfefe was sent off at 3-2 and won by three-quarters of a length. Spiced Perfection was fourth, and Come Dancing was sixth. A very smooth success for Joel Rosario on Brad Cox\u2019s three-year-old, pretty much Plan A all the way. He was settled in third down the back, took over on the home turn and stayed on well as only Bellafina of the market leaders managed to raise a challenge. 1 COVFEFE, 2 Bellafina, 3 Dawn The Destroyer Covfefe leads, Bellafina chasing in the stretch Covfefe best placed of the market leaders turning in Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Sprint! Covfefe was the favourite on the morning line but it looks like Come Dancing will go off as favourite, though only narrowly. One minute to post time for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Filly &amp; Mare Sprint. It would be stretching things to say that my tips for yesterday\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup races covered themselves in glory. Unabashed, however, I present my picks for today\u2019s nine races, which will no doubt include one or more reasons for deep embarrassment in six hours\u2019 time. 18.55 Covfefe 19.33 Totally Boss 20.10 Omaha Beach 20.54 Iridessa (nb) 21.36 Shancelot 22.20 Space Traveller 23.00 Midnight Bisou 23.40 Old Persian (nap) 0.44 Code Of Honour Come Dancing is the early favourite for the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint (this isn\u2019t really Donald Trump territory, after all). She\u2019s 7-5 on the tote, with Covfefe on 5-2 and Spiced Perfection on 7-1. Bellafina, trained by British-born Simon Callaghan, also finding backers. She\u2019s 5-1, and can be seen here winning the Santa Anita Oaks. A truly immense American flag is currently being carried out onto the track, ready for the rendition of the Star Spangled Banner without which no sporting occasion here is complete. And finally, Spiced Perfection landing the Thoroughbred Club of America Stakes, a Grade 2. And here\u2019s Come Dancing, winning - somewhat appropriately - the Grade 1 Ballerina Stakes. The final race before the Breeders\u2019 Cup events is due off in 10 minutes. It\u2019s the Twilight Derby, which I\u2019m fairly certain used to be at the end of the card as the name suggests, but now it\u2019s run at 11am local time. Go figure, as they say. After that, it\u2019s on to the nine Breeders\u2019 Cup races, kicking off with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint. The races will come up thick and fast once we get going, so here\u2019s some video form to peruse as the minutes count down to post time. The market leaders for this race - which, somewhat confusingly for Europeans, is run over seven furlongs - are Covfefe - named after one of Donald Trump\u2019s bizarre Twitter bloopers - Come Dancing and Spiced Perfection. First up, Covfefe, getting the better of a fantastic stretch duel with Serengeti Empress at Saratoga. Hello and welcome to Santa Anita in Arcadia, Los Angeles, for day two of the 2019 Breeders\u2019 Cup (or welcome back, if you were here on Friday as Europe\u2019s challenge for the juvenile events was comprehensively dismissed by the American-trained two-year-olds). That was a disappointing way for the travelling contingent to start the weekend, but Saturday\u2019s card is where the real riches and glory lie and there are European runners with big chances in three of the four turf events. Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner, attempts to win his first race since in the Turf where Old Persian is also strongly fancied, and Circus Maximus, the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes winner, is the probable favourite for the Mile. And there are also five ultra-competitive races on the main track which will have fans of dirt racing queuing up at the betting windows in the hope of retrieving just a little of what they left behind on Friday. There were some unexpected results here yesterday to say the least, above all in the feature event, the Juvenile, where all three of the eight horses that were showing at single-figure odds at the off finished out of the frame. The \u201call-sources handle\u201d for yesterday\u2019s 10-race card, including five Breeders\u2019 Cup events, was a new record for the first day of the meeting at $56.5m [\u00a346m], so somebody definitely went home happy. Form-followers, though, will hope that the racing redistributes wealth a little more even-handedly this afternoon. The first three Breeders\u2019 Cup races are all-American affairs after Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s two entries in the Turf Sprint (19.33) failed to make it onto the plane. The action starts at 18.55GMT with the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint - and rolls all the way to one of the most open renewals of the Classic that I can remember at 00.44GMT. McKinzie, Vino Rosso, Code Of Honor, Yoshida and Elate are all priced up at between 4-1 and 7-1 by Britain\u2019s bookmakers and the fans here at Santa Anita may face an equally tricky task in separating them when the time comes around seven hours from now. The best news after yesterday\u2019s opening card was that all the runners returned safe and well after their races. This Breeders\u2019 Cup is being staged under unprecedented scrutiny after the much-publicised deaths of 36 horses at this track while either racing or training since the start of the year. The track has initiated a number of reforms in an attempt to address the issue and, so far, the rate of fatal injuries has dropped sharply since racing resumed here after the summer break at the end of September. Management and fans will still approach today\u2019s action with some apprehension, however, as there is a low level of inherent risk in horse racing and no amount of effort will ever get the injury rate down to zero. Around 997 of every 1,000 starters here do not suffer a fatal injury, but an incident-free Breeders\u2019 Cup would certainly help to underline the point. And even then, there are still deep structural issues in American racing which need to be addressed, as this excellent analysis by Mark Irby of Animal Wellness Action points out. Santa Anita\u2019s new regime on veterinary inspections of all runners has had a significant impact on the European challenge today, as both Fleeting (Filly &amp; Mare Turf) and Suedois (Mile) have been ruled out after being found to be slightly lame when inspected this morning. Other non-runners from the original declarations are Thais, the probable pace-maker in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, who was ruled out by vets a couple of days ago, and Imperial Hint, who was scratched from the Sprint after his morning inspection. The main card at the Breeders\u2019 Cup is one of the best racing days of the year, the action gets underway in just over an hour and there will be video form and more for all the races in this space as the day goes on. Let\u2019s do this!",

She is the first RBS boss since the crash of 2008-09 who is not taking on the top job at a time when the overwhelming priority is to clear up the mess created by that meltdown.</p> <p>Stephen Hester, who joined RBS in November 2008, used to describe his job as defusing the biggest balance-sheet time bomb in history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/ross-mcewan-rbs-new-chief-executive\" title=\"\">Ross McEwan</a>, who took over in 2013, had the mammoth task of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/12/rbs-fine-us-loan-misselling-scandal-federal-housing-finance-agency\" title=\"\">settling with US authorities</a> over mis-sold mortgage securities. He also had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/24/rbs-cuts-price-citizens-bank-sell-off-us\" title=\"\">sell the US\u2019s Citizens Bank</a>, repair the pension fund and manage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/fca-report-into-rbs-branded-complete-whitewash\" title=\"\">the scandal of GRG</a>, RBS\u2019s small business restructuring unit.</p> <p>RBS is not free of challenges, as the share price indicates: at 215p, it is still less than half the level seen when the bank was part-nationalised. But the sense of emergency has abated. Rose, a 27-year RBS veteran, has the relative luxury of being able to breathe and think differently.</p> <p>She started OK on Friday. She spouted too many platitudes \u2013 RBS will be \u201cpurpose-led\u201d, will \u201cembrace the future\u201d and wants to \u201cchampion customers\u201d \u2013 but as a signalling exercise it was fine. The details were always scheduled for next February.</p> <p>That\u2019s when Rose will have to provide substance. Her most interesting remarks on day one were about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/rbs-boss-alison-rose-bold-action-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">tackling climate change</a> and helping finance the UK\u2019s transition to a lower-carbon economy. On that front, RBS is already ahead of many rivals \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/29/rbs-cuts-lending-to-new-coal-and-arctic-oil-projects\" title=\"\">it won\u2019t fund Arctic oil projects and has pledged to cut lending to firms profiting largely from coal</a>.</p> <p>But there is potential to go further. There is scope for RBS to reinvent itself as the bank that takes the climate emergency most seriously. Honeymoon periods for chief executives only last about a year. Rose should be radical from the off.</p> <h2>The case for fracking was never strong. A ban is the right decision</h2> <p>Political cynicism as a general election approaches, or a triumph for common sense? The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/02/fracking-banned-in-uk-as-government-makes-major-u-turn\" title=\"\">ban on fracking in the UK</a> is probably a mixture of both. Either way, it is very welcome. Dogged anti-fracking activists should congratulate themselves on a supremely effective campaign of resistance.</p> <p>The official trigger for the government\u2019s U-turn was a report from the Oil and Gas Authority which concluded that it was not possible to rule out \u201cunacceptable\u201d consequences for people living near fracking sites. Ministers could still have opted to extend a policy of \u201cproceed with caution\u201d but have instead imposed a moratorium.</p> <p>Therein lies the suspicion of naked political opportunism. The Tories are targeting seats in the north-west of England, where opposition to the UK\u2019s only active fracking site, Preston New Road in Lancashire, has been intense. Prime minister Boris Johnson, who once described fracking as \u201cglorious news for humanity\u201d, can thus temper one local source of resentment.</p> <p>Contrary to Johnson\u2019s original thesis, fracking always looked like a dead-end in the UK. American shale firms can drill under wide open spaces; the UK is densely populated with citizens who resent earth tremors, even minor ones.</p> <p>Nor did the industry\u2019s big claims for shale as a transitional source of energy on the road to a lower-carbon future ever read convincingly. The fracking process is dirty and intensive \u2013 it involves pumping water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure \u2013 and has been overtaken by events. The exciting energy story in the UK over the past half-decade has been offshore wind, where prices have plunged. It is more sensible to encourage windfarms, which the market will supply readily, than fiddle around with fracking\u2019s uncertain economics. As for gas supply, imports look secure.</p> <p>In short, the politics of fracking were terrible and the business case was weak. The end should have come a long time ago.</p>",

Attacking the billionaire class is a smart move for Labour, allowing it to sidestep accusations that the party is anti-aspiration. Most people agree that at some level wealth starts to become repulsive. Growing fantastically rich may be an ambition for many, but it is reached by few. Billionaire status is out of the reach of almost everyone, including even successful entrepreneurs. Even if they didn\u2019t pay tax or spend a penny of their earnings, the time it would take a worker on the average UK salary \u2013 about \u00a325,000 \u2013 to earn their way to billionaire status is more than 40,000 years \u2013 a period equivalent to the entire existence of Homo sapiens in Britain. Boris Johnson has framed the election as parliament versus people. Labour would prefer the debate to be people versus the elite. With an argument about billionaires, Corbyn and Labour are on fertile ground. RBS\u2019s new chief must capitalise on its green potential Alison Rose at Royal Bank of Scotland is the first woman to become chief executive of a Big Four bank in the UK but she\u2019s different in another way. She is the first RBS boss since the crash of 2008-09 who is not taking on the top job at a time when the overwhelming priority is to clear up the mess created by that meltdown. Stephen Hester, who joined RBS in November 2008, used to describe his job as defusing the biggest balance-sheet time bomb in history. Ross McEwan, who took over in 2013, had the mammoth task of settling with US authorities over mis-sold mortgage securities. He also had to sell the US\u2019s Citizens Bank, repair the pension fund and manage the scandal of GRG, RBS\u2019s small business restructuring unit. RBS is not free of challenges, as the share price indicates: at 215p, it is still less than half the level seen when the bank was part-nationalised. But the sense of emergency has abated. Rose, a 27-year RBS veteran, has the relative luxury of being able to breathe and think differently. She started OK on Friday. She spouted too many platitudes \u2013 RBS will be \u201cpurpose-led\u201d, will \u201cembrace the future\u201d and wants to \u201cchampion customers\u201d \u2013 but as a signalling exercise it was fine. The details were always scheduled for next February. That\u2019s when Rose will have to provide substance. Her most interesting remarks on day one were about tackling climate change and helping finance the UK\u2019s transition to a lower-carbon economy. On that front, RBS is already ahead of many rivals \u2013 it won\u2019t fund Arctic oil projects and has pledged to cut lending to firms profiting largely from coal. But there is potential to go further. There is scope for RBS to reinvent itself as the bank that takes the climate emergency most seriously. Honeymoon periods for chief executives only last about a year. Rose should be radical from the off. The case for fracking was never strong. A ban is the right decision Political cynicism as a general election approaches, or a triumph for common sense? The government\u2019s ban on fracking in the UK is probably a mixture of both. Either way, it is very welcome. Dogged anti-fracking activists should congratulate themselves on a supremely effective campaign of resistance. The official trigger for the government\u2019s U-turn was a report from the Oil and Gas Authority which concluded that it was not possible to rule out \u201cunacceptable\u201d consequences for people living near fracking sites. Ministers could still have opted to extend a policy of \u201cproceed with caution\u201d but have instead imposed a moratorium. Therein lies the suspicion of naked political opportunism. The Tories are targeting seats in the north-west of England, where opposition to the UK\u2019s only active fracking site, Preston New Road in Lancashire, has been intense. Prime minister Boris Johnson, who once described fracking as \u201cglorious news for humanity\u201d, can thus temper one local source of resentment. Contrary to Johnson\u2019s original thesis, fracking always looked like a dead-end in the UK. American shale firms can drill under wide open spaces; the UK is densely populated with citizens who resent earth tremors, even minor ones. Nor did the industry\u2019s big claims for shale as a transitional source of energy on the road to a lower-carbon future ever read convincingly. The fracking process is dirty and intensive \u2013 it involves pumping water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure \u2013 and has been overtaken by events. The exciting energy story in the UK over the past half-decade has been offshore wind, where prices have plunged. It is more sensible to encourage windfarms, which the market will supply readily, than fiddle around with fracking\u2019s uncertain economics. As for gas supply, imports look secure. In short, the politics of fracking were terrible and the business case was weak. The end should have come a long time ago.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re diagnosing me as fat?\u201d quips Brittany (Jillian Bell) to her doctor. The 28-year-old is 5ft 6in, 13st 8lb and medically overweight. \u201cI feel like you completely missed the point of those Dove ads,\u201d she drolly tells him. In writer-director Paul Downs Colaizzo\u2019s indie comedy, based on one of his friends, Brittany is spurred by this humiliating encounter into getting fit and training for a marathon. She laces up her trainers; the proudly plus-size popstar Lizzo\u2019s empowerment anthem <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xa-XAvErw\" title=\"\">Good as Hell</a> plays over the ensuing weight-loss montage. It\u2019s a red flag.</p> <p>The film struggles to square its protagonist\u2019s weight loss with the pressure to present a body-positive position and ensure it doesn\u2019t alienate the very female audience it courts. One minute it\u2019s wryly poking fun at the expense and inaccessibility of gyms, the next it\u2019s fetishistically cataloguing the shrinking number on Brittany\u2019s scales. Indeed, as her body transforms, so does her life. She finds a new job, and supportive friends in her running club; men begin to notice her. Yet Brittany still battles with her body issues, unable to shed her identity as \u201ca fat girl\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cSo you\u2019re diagnosing me as fat?\u201d quips Brittany (Jillian Bell) to her doctor. The 28-year-old is 5ft 6in, 13st 8lb and medically overweight. \u201cI feel like you completely missed the point of those Dove ads,\u201d she drolly tells him. In writer-director Paul Downs Colaizzo\u2019s indie comedy, based on one of his friends, Brittany is spurred by this humiliating encounter into getting fit and training for a marathon. She laces up her trainers; the proudly plus-size popstar Lizzo\u2019s empowerment anthem Good as Hell plays over the ensuing weight-loss montage. It\u2019s a red flag. The film struggles to square its protagonist\u2019s weight loss with the pressure to present a body-positive position and ensure it doesn\u2019t alienate the very female audience it courts. One minute it\u2019s wryly poking fun at the expense and inaccessibility of gyms, the next it\u2019s fetishistically cataloguing the shrinking number on Brittany\u2019s scales. Indeed, as her body transforms, so does her life. She finds a new job, and supportive friends in her running club; men begin to notice her. Yet Brittany still battles with her body issues, unable to shed her identity as \u201ca fat girl\u201d. There\u2019s a note of truth in Bell\u2019s finely tuned performance as a character whose insecurities have calcified over the years, hardening her to genuine goodwill, which she frequently misreads as pity. However, a feelgood fairytale ending wraps up Brittany\u2019s story a little too neatly, with Colaizzo insistent on giving the audience a runner\u2019s high.",

      "body": "<p>In her new book <em>Why Trust Science?</em> Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University, argues that if more people heard scientists talk personally about their values, it would help turn back the creeping tide of anti-science sentiment. The former geologist recently gave evidence both to a US House of Representatives subcommittee hearing, \u201cExamining the Oil Industry\u2019s Efforts to Suppress the Truth about Climate Change\u201d, and a Senate Democrats special committee hearing looking at \u201cDark Money and Barriers to Climate Action\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Your previous book, </strong><em><strong>Merchants of Doubt</strong></em><strong>, chronicled tactics used by professional climate </strong><strong>deniers. What inspired this one? </strong><br>During public lectures I would explain there was a scientific consensus on climate change and the contrarians were either outliers within the scientific community or paid shills of the fossil fuel industry. People would say: \u201cWell that\u2019s fine, but why should we trust the science?\u201d I thought that was a legitimate question.</p> <p><strong>Do we have a crisis of public trust in science? </strong><br>There has been exaggeration and even panic about this. Public opinion polls in the US consistently show that most people still trust science. And far more than they trust government or industry. However, there are certain areas \u2013 for example climate change, vaccination and evolution \u2013 where there is a high level of public suspicion. In these areas, people resist accepting what the evidence shows because of their values. The science can be seen to clash with their political, moral or religious worldviews, or their economic interests.</p> <p>Discrediting science is also a political strategy \u2013 for example, the fossil fuel industry creating the impression that the science on climate change is unsettled stops action. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s fashionable to\u00a0be sceptical of experts but we rely on them: dentists fix our teeth, plumbers unclog our drains</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You could say the US </strong><strong>president doesn\u2019t trust science. Trump denies the climate crisis and has argued against vaccination in the past, and his </strong><strong>vice</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>president, Mike Pence, demurs on evolution. How detrimental is this? </strong><br>It is deeply problematic if the leadership of the US government is rejecting science, because it sends a signal to the American people and to business leaders that it is fine to reject science, and even to ride roughshod over scientists. It is also proof positive that this is not a question of people who simply don\u2019t have access to good scientific information. The US president has access to more scientific information than probably anybody on the planet \u2013 but he actively rejects it on a number of issues because it conflicts with his own interests.</p> <p><strong>Why should we trust science? Is it because there is a \u201cscientific method\u201d that scientists follow? </strong><br>There isn\u2019t a single magic formula that guarantees results. We should trust science because it has a rigorous process for vetting claims. That includes the formal peer review of papers submitted to academic journals but also things like scientists discussing their preliminary results in conferences and workshops. Crucially, these practices are social in character. Consensus is key to when a scientific matter has been settled, and therefore when knowledge is likely to be trustworthy. We should also trust science because it is done by people who are experts in studying the natural world. It\u2019s fashionable to be sceptical of experts but we rely on trained people every day for all kinds of things: dentists fix our teeth and plumbers unclog our drains. Science also has a substantial record of success \u2013 think of our medicines and technologies \u2013 suggesting scientists are doing something right. <br></p> <p><strong>You say we can learn from science gone awry. One example in the book is the </strong><strong>eugenics movement, the odious crusade in the early part of the last century arguing for the improvement of the genetics of the human race by restricting the reproduction of \u201cunfit\u201d people</strong><strong>, which particularly targeted the mentally ill and the poor\u2026 </strong><br>Climate change deniers love to claim that because scientists were once wrong about eugenics, they may be wrong now about climate change. But I looked closely and there never was any consensus among scientists on eugenics. British geneticists and evolutionary biologists in particular \u2013 famous names like JBS Haldane and Julian Huxley \u2013 who also happened to be socialists called out eugenics for its class bias targeting working-class people. It shows how diversity in science, in this case political diversity, can lead to assumptions being pointed out that otherwise would go unnoticed.</p> <p><strong>You also look at why it took so long for scientists to study whether the contraceptive pill can have mental health side-effects like depression.</strong><strong> </strong><br>A few years ago a big study came out that associated being on the pill with depression and it generated a lot of media attention. But we\u2019ve known this for a very long time because millions of women have been telling us. Their self-reports were often discounted as unreliable by medical science. Lots of psychiatrists going back to the 1960s were aware and some took it seriously. But gynaecologists generally resisted that evidence for two reasons. One was because the pill really does work, so a lot were eager to prescribe it. But also, these were female patients and there is a long history of male doctors in particular discounting their reports. The lesson is scientists shouldn\u2019t discount evidence simply because it\u2019s not in their preferred form.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60ca92415eb5b5fb8d453c4a18d7df3c0fc8caf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60ca92415eb5b5fb8d453c4a18d7df3c0fc8caf6/0_143_4074_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Do the benefits of flossing your teeth have scientific backing?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Do the benefits of flossing your teeth have scientific backing?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You use a 2016 </strong><strong>controversy</strong><strong> around the effectiveness of </strong><strong>flossing teeth as an example not of flawed science, but flawed journalism</strong><strong>. What happened? </strong><br>The background is the US government took the view that its dietary guidelines should focus on diet and so removed a recommendation to floss. A journalist from the Associated Press noticed and decided to look at flossing\u2019s scientific basis for preventing gum disease and cavities. He found that if you took the gold standard of evidence \u2013 the double-blind randomised controlled trial \u2013 it was lacking. But you can\u2019t do that kind of trial: you know if your teeth are being flossed or not. If you make that the standard then, necessarily, there won\u2019t be \u201chard\u201d evidence to support flossing. There is a kind of fetishism about RCTs. But there are cases including in nutrition and exercise when you can\u2019t do them, or it would be unethical. In those cases, other types of studies, like population or animal studies, can be valuable. Or if you have some other kind of information \u2013 for example dentists\u2019 and our own experience that flossing does a lot of good for our teeth and gums \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be discounted.</p> <p><strong>How can we increase trust in science where it is warranted? </strong><br>It isn\u2019t by giving people more scientific information. Rather scientists need to talk about the values that motivate them and shape the science they do. In many cases, scientists\u2019 values are less different from the people who are rejecting science than you might think. And where values overlap, trust can be built. We may think of people who reject vaccination as being \u201con the other side\u201d but we all love our children. A scientist\u2019s \u201cbiodiversity\u201d might be a religious believer\u2019s \u201cCreation\u201d, but they are cherishing the same thing. Scientists being willing to talk about themselves and their experiences can also go a long way. In my book, I talk about something deeply personal: my own experiences with the contraceptive pill and depression. It may not be persuasive to everyone, but people are much more likely to accept factual information from those they can relate to or have a human connection with.</p> <p><strong>Lots of scientists work for oil, energy, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics companies, and can bury unwelcome results, massage their studies and so on \u2013 how do you feel about these people and are they contributing to the cynicism about science in the public? </strong><br>This is a big question, hard to answer in a soundbite. In the early 20th century, a good deal of important science was done in industrial laboratories, for example at Westinghouse, General Electric, Bell Labs, and Eastman Chemicals. But after the war, many large corporations cut back on their support of basic research, and some \u2013 most famously the tobacco industry \u2013 became involved in product defence and distracting research. A good deal of product defence research is now channelled through academia, and this is deeply problematic. I know from my email and Twitter feed that this has stoked distrust among some people, and rightly so.</p> <p>Many scientific journals and universities have been very sloppy about taking steps to ensure the integrity of academic findings, for example by having and enforcing full disclosure. Academics have to be very clear about the soures of their support, and they should never agree to non-disclosure agreements. It is essential in science that we let the chips fall as they may.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve recently been testifying in Congress. What\u2019s the message you most want to send to politicians? </strong><br>Human-induced climate change is under way. It\u2019s no longer a matter of trust; our scientists have been shown to be right. Climate change deniers have run out of excuses.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Why Trust Science?</em> by Naomi Oreskes is published by Princeton University Press (\u00a322).

Your previous book, Merchants of Doubt, chronicled tactics used by professional climate deniers. What inspired this one? During public lectures I would explain there was a scientific consensus on climate change and the contrarians were either outliers within the scientific community or paid shills of the fossil fuel industry. People would say: \u201cWell that\u2019s fine, but why should we trust the science?\u201d I thought that was a legitimate question. Do we have a crisis of public trust in science? There has been exaggeration and even panic about this. Public opinion polls in the US consistently show that most people still trust science. And far more than they trust government or industry. However, there are certain areas \u2013 for example climate change, vaccination and evolution \u2013 where there is a high level of public suspicion. In these areas, people resist accepting what the evidence shows because of their values. The science can be seen to clash with their political, moral or religious worldviews, or their economic interests. Discrediting science is also a political strategy \u2013 for example, the fossil fuel industry creating the impression that the science on climate change is unsettled stops action. You could say the US president doesn\u2019t trust science. Trump denies the climate crisis and has argued against vaccination in the past, and his vice-president, Mike Pence, demurs on evolution. How detrimental is this? It is deeply problematic if the leadership of the US government is rejecting science, because it sends a signal to the American people and to business leaders that it is fine to reject science, and even to ride roughshod over scientists. It is also proof positive that this is not a question of people who simply don\u2019t have access to good scientific information. The US president has access to more scientific information than probably anybody on the planet \u2013 but he actively rejects it on a number of issues because it conflicts with his own interests. Why should we trust science? Is it because there is a \u201cscientific method\u201d that scientists follow? There isn\u2019t a single magic formula that guarantees results. We should trust science because it has a rigorous process for vetting claims. That includes the formal peer review of papers submitted to academic journals but also things like scientists discussing their preliminary results in conferences and workshops. Crucially, these practices are social in character. Consensus is key to when a scientific matter has been settled, and therefore when knowledge is likely to be trustworthy. We should also trust science because it is done by people who are experts in studying the natural world. It\u2019s fashionable to be sceptical of experts but we rely on trained people every day for all kinds of things: dentists fix our teeth and plumbers unclog our drains. Science also has a substantial record of success \u2013 think of our medicines and technologies \u2013 suggesting scientists are doing something right. You say we can learn from science gone awry. One example in the book is the eugenics movement, the odious crusade in the early part of the last century arguing for the improvement of the genetics of the human race by restricting the reproduction of \u201cunfit\u201d people, which particularly targeted the mentally ill and the poor\u2026 Climate change deniers love to claim that because scientists were once wrong about eugenics, they may be wrong now about climate change. But I looked closely and there never was any consensus among scientists on eugenics. British geneticists and evolutionary biologists in particular \u2013 famous names like JBS Haldane and Julian Huxley \u2013 who also happened to be socialists called out eugenics for its class bias targeting working-class people. It shows how diversity in science, in this case political diversity, can lead to assumptions being pointed out that otherwise would go unnoticed. You also look at why it took so long for scientists to study whether the contraceptive pill can have mental health side-effects like depression. A few years ago a big study came out that associated being on the pill with depression and it generated a lot of media attention. But we\u2019ve known this for a very long time because millions of women have been telling us. Their self-reports were often discounted as unreliable by medical science. Lots of psychiatrists going back to the 1960s were aware and some took it seriously. But gynaecologists generally resisted that evidence for two reasons. One was because the pill really does work, so a lot were eager to prescribe it. But also, these were female patients and there is a long history of male doctors in particular discounting their reports. The lesson is scientists shouldn\u2019t discount evidence simply because it\u2019s not in their preferred form. You use a 2016 controversy around the effectiveness of flossing teeth as an example not of flawed science, but flawed journalism. What happened? The background is the US government took the view that its dietary guidelines should focus on diet and so removed a recommendation to floss. A journalist from the Associated Press noticed and decided to look at flossing\u2019s scientific basis for preventing gum disease and cavities. He found that if you took the gold standard of evidence \u2013 the double-blind randomised controlled trial \u2013 it was lacking. But you can\u2019t do that kind of trial: you know if your teeth are being flossed or not. If you make that the standard then, necessarily, there won\u2019t be \u201chard\u201d evidence to support flossing. There is a kind of fetishism about RCTs. But there are cases including in nutrition and exercise when you can\u2019t do them, or it would be unethical. In those cases, other types of studies, like population or animal studies, can be valuable. Or if you have some other kind of information \u2013 for example dentists\u2019 and our own experience that flossing does a lot of good for our teeth and gums \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be discounted. How can we increase trust in science where it is warranted? It isn\u2019t by giving people more scientific information. Rather scientists need to talk about the values that motivate them and shape the science they do. In many cases, scientists\u2019 values are less different from the people who are rejecting science than you might think. And where values overlap, trust can be built. We may think of people who reject vaccination as being \u201con the other side\u201d but we all love our children. A scientist\u2019s \u201cbiodiversity\u201d might be a religious believer\u2019s \u201cCreation\u201d, but they are cherishing the same thing. Scientists being willing to talk about themselves and their experiences can also go a long way. In my book, I talk about something deeply personal: my own experiences with the contraceptive pill and depression. It may not be persuasive to everyone, but people are much more likely to accept factual information from those they can relate to or have a human connection with. Lots of scientists work for oil, energy, pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics companies, and can bury unwelcome results, massage their studies and so on \u2013 how do you feel about these people and are they contributing to the cynicism about science in the public? This is a big question, hard to answer in a soundbite. In the early 20th century, a good deal of important science was done in industrial laboratories, for example at Westinghouse, General Electric, Bell Labs, and Eastman Chemicals. But after the war, many large corporations cut back on their support of basic research, and some \u2013 most famously the tobacco industry \u2013 became involved in product defence and distracting research. A good deal of product defence research is now channelled through academia, and this is deeply problematic. I know from my email and Twitter feed that this has stoked distrust among some people, and rightly so. Many scientific journals and universities have been very sloppy about taking steps to ensure the integrity of academic findings, for example by having and enforcing full disclosure. Academics have to be very clear about the soures of their support, and they should never agree to non-disclosure agreements. It is essential in science that we let the chips fall as they may. You\u2019ve recently been testifying in Congress. What\u2019s the message you most want to send to politicians? Human-induced climate change is under way. It\u2019s no longer a matter of trust; our scientists have been shown to be right. Climate change deniers have run out of excuses. \u2022 Why Trust Science? by Naomi Oreskes is published by Princeton University Press (\u00a322). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

      "body": "<p>When I heard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">Greta Thunberg</a> say that being different was a superpower, I had to replay her saying it. Several times. I was diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/asperger.aspx\" title=\"\">Asperger\u2019s syndrome</a> at 42 and, seven years on, I\u2019m still far from sure what that means. Are those of us with autistic spectrum conditions disabled or different? Are we, by definition, deficient human beings, or are there compensations that come with our condition? Are there any circumstances in which autism could be considered, not merely an acceptable difference, but a superpower?</p> <p>Thunberg\u2019s comment some two months ago was her robust response to commentators who had sought to use her Asperger\u2019s to discredit her, claiming she must be a nave puppet and calling her a \u201cweirdo\u201d with a \u201cmonotone voice\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI have Asperger\u2019s and that means I\u2019m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And \u2013 given the right circumstances \u2013 being different is a superpower. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/aspiepower?lang=en\" title=\"\">#aspiepower</a>.\u201d</p> <p>As a fellow autist, I find myself stuck in the middle of these two incompatible views: on the one hand, autistic people are disturbed, na\u00efve individuals who are incapable of knowing their own minds or speaking credibly; on the other, autistic people are superhumans with a preternatural ability to see the truth of things and to articulate it without equivocation. The world would be better without us; the world would be lost without us.</p> <p>Food writer and campaigner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jack-monroe\" title=\"\">Jack Monroe</a>, too, has written that learning to harness her own autistic traits has enabled her to see them \u201cas a kind of superpower\u201d. Novelist <a href=\"http://katherine-may.com/\" title=\"\">Katherine May</a> is more ambiguous: \u201cMy autism brings some things I really value \u2013 the flood of words I experience, the ability to fixate on a subject and burrow deep into it, and an intense relationship with the natural world. But there are other bits I\u2019d get rid of. I break things and hurt myself all the time; and I hate the way that I don\u2019t remember faces and so come across as rude.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52e54a1fc28447b6615e8d88c1ffd0f0225acff3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e54a1fc28447b6615e8d88c1ffd0f0225acff3/0_159_7105_4265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Would non-autistic me ever have had the focus to persevere in the isolating, all-consuming business of writing?\u2019 Joanne Limburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Would non-autistic me ever have had the focus to persevere in the isolating, all-consuming business of writing?\u2019 Joanne Limburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/24/charlotte-moore-autistic-sons\" title=\"\">Charlotte Moore</a>, who has written about bringing up two autistic sons with high support needs, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t see my sons\u2019 autism as a disability, exactly. In the right environment, they can (and mainly do) lead happy, healthy lives. So I prefer the word \u2018difference\u2019 to \u2018disability\u2019.\u201d She continued: \u201cCan autism be a superpower? Probably, yes, in a few cases \u2013 some autistic people do have extreme abilities \u2013 but the popular belief that all autistic people are really geniuses isn\u2019t helpful to parents or carers struggling with autistic people with no speech and self-harming behaviours, meltdowns or sensory overload.\u201d</p> <p>When I received my own diagnosis, I wanted to find out what it meant. I learned that Asperger\u2019s syndrome is a controversial condition, sometimes set apart from other forms of autism. Since 2013 it has no longer been recognised as a stand-alone diagnosis in the United States, now falling under the umbrella term <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/about/diagnosis.aspx?gclid=CjwKCAjw9L_tBRBXEiwAOWVVCagrfLPOrdHX_RN6GkcI9o1onR9g4LUSNAUn0tsbV7QluzSOCcetyxoCQfwQAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</a>, but it still is in the UK.</p> <p>The opposing views of autism \u2013 disability or difference \u2013 may owe their origins to two different models of autism outlined by two different psychiatrists. On the one hand, there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/30/leo-kanner-discovery-of-autism-was-not-independent-of-hans-asperger\" title=\"\">Leo Kanner</a>\u2019s autism, first described in the US in the late 1940s. It is characterised by repetitive movement, little or no speech and high support needs. On the other hand, there is Asperger\u2019s syndrome, named after Hans Asperger, the child psychologist and eugenicist who published the first definition of the condition in 1944, describing the children he encountered in his clinic in wartime Vienna as \u201clittle professors\u201d. He famously said: \u201cIt seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.\u201d</p> <p>For a long time, it was the Kanner view that prevailed. Autism was considered a severe disability \u2013 and a rare one. Then, in 1976, the British psychiatrist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/24/autistic-spectrum-disorder-lorna-wing\" title=\"\">Lorna Wing</a> coined the term Asperger\u2019s syndrome and a new group of patients \u2013 mostly children, overwhelmingly male \u2013 began to receive this diagnosis. Autism is no longer considered rare. According to the National Autistic Society, just over 1% of the population is autistic. Other estimates are higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49f6336afad70799792594faee82caeca2dafce8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49f6336afad70799792594faee82caeca2dafce8/167_340_5388_3233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Learning to harness her autistic traits has enabled her to see them \u2018as a kind of superpower\u2019: Jack Monroe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Learning to harness her autistic traits has enabled her to see them \u2018as a kind of superpower\u2019: Jack Monroe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nic Serpell-Rand/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Asperger\u2019s syndrome is no longer recognised in the United States, there are people who have grown up with it as their identity and they are sticking with it. Others have abandoned it in favour of the broader ASD. Controversy over Hans Asperger\u2019s possible involvement in the Nazis\u2019 eugenics programme led some to drop the term. Many, like me, use autism and Asperger\u2019s interchangeably. I usually define myself as \u201cautistic\u201d, because I don\u2019t recognise any essential difference between myself and non-speaking autistic people.</p> <p>I tried to figure out what autism might explain in my own life, including some of its negative aspects. I\u2019d had long experience of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/04/joanne-limburg-poet-depression-miscarriage\" title=\"\">depression, anxiety and OCD</a>. Had they arisen directly from a glitchy abnormal brain? Had they come about as a response to the adverse life experiences that accompany any difference, or might hypothetical non-autistic me have had them, too? And what about the more positive aspects? Would non-autistic me ever have had the focus or determination to persevere in the financially insecure, isolating, all-consuming business of writing?</p> <p>I have always loved words and books. At the age of three, I would take my whole library to bed with me. My mother described me as a \u201cnot very childish\u201d child, who preferred to talk to adults rather than other children. When I was nine, a teacher read a poem I\u2019d written to the class, and I decided then and there to be a writer. That was a rare happy moment at primary school. Like many parents of autistic children, my parents found themselves with a child that mainstream education refused to accommodate. Their solution (not one open to everybody) was to re-mortgage the house and send me to private school. For my parents, my autism, literally, came at a great cost.</p> <p>If I picture myself at Thunberg\u2019s age, I see certain similarities. I was idealistic, passionate about what I believed, blunt in the expression of my ideas. I was uninterested in makeup or any other aspect of what my mother called \u201cmaking the best of myself\u201d. I was a vegetarian, because two years earlier Morrissey had said that meat was murder. I didn\u2019t go in much for what people think of as normal teenage socialising. Instead, I pursued my own interests \u2013 and I pursued them single-mindedly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d8884bbad0f8c3aaa9496c402e53a24f22086d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d8884bbad0f8c3aaa9496c402e53a24f22086d6/41_170_2305_1381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An audience of one: comedian Hannah Gadsby finds it easier to speak in public than in private.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An audience of one: comedian Hannah Gadsby finds it easier to speak in public than in private.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My passions were writing, the Beatles and feminism. I read my way through the Women\u2019s Studies section of Edgware Library, and passed <em>The Female Eunuch</em> round the sixth form at my all-girls\u2019 school, to raise the consciousness of the sisterhood. I announced to my mother that I was not going to go to university, because to do so would only mean following a patriarchal curriculum. Mum told me to stop being so silly. I went to university, but I took Greer and De Beauvoir with me.</p> <p>So that was how I was 33 years ago: intellectually curious, idealistic and articulate. I could even be funny sometimes, but I was also intense and sullen, with few social graces. Asperger\u2019s wasn\u2019t available to me as a diagnosis in the 1980s, but people found other words for me. They said \u201cmoody\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u2019 or \u201cthinks too much\u201d. I still find it painfully difficult to maintain a conversation with more than one or two people at once. I have to overcome a wagon-load of inertia in order to clean my teeth, wash and dress. On a bad day, it seems to me that everything I have managed to do as an adult \u2013 earn money, find a partner, raise a child \u2013 has only been possible because I have learned to suppress my autism.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not to say I see no advantages. Like Greta Thunberg and the comedian <a href=\"http://hannahgadsby.com.au/\" title=\"\">Hannah Gadsby</a>, I find public speaking easier than casual conversation. In her brilliant <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/hannah_gadsby\" title=\"\">Ted talk</a>, Gadsby asks how she can be so good at something \u2013 talking \u2013 she knows she is so bad at. The answer is that standup has none of the pitfalls conversation brings for autistic people. When she is on stage, Gadsby does not have to listen as well as speak, she does not have to figure out how to respond to what she hears, she does not have to do all the exhausting parallel processing that an autistic person has to consciously engage in during everyday conversation. She has figured out what she wants to say and she can just say it, without distraction or interruption. Perfect.</p> <p>And I can add from personal experience, that when you have to perform almost every time you interact, performing in front of 1,000 people isn\u2019t very different to performing in front of three. To a non-autistic person, who finds conversation easy but public speaking unnerving, this may well look like a superpower.</p> <p>Another trait that we have on our side is the intensity of focus with which we pursue our passions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-packham\" title=\"\">Chris Packham</a>, naturalist and environmentalist and ambassador for the <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Autistic Society,</a> explained how the strength of his sensory response to the world around him enables him to \u201cengage with the natural world with greater clarity and ease\u201d. Packham said that from an early age, he could \u201csee things which others couldn\u2019t in nature\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9531721a8a349ab124d4463ea0d3de392842db0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9531721a8a349ab124d4463ea0d3de392842db0b/0_201_3004_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From an early age he could \u2018see things which others couldn\u2019t in nature\u2019: Chris Packham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From an early age he could \u2018see things which others couldn\u2019t in nature\u2019: Chris Packham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a third trait associated with Asperger\u2019s syndrome that Packham shares with Thunberg and which makes them both such effective activists. It is a certain moral single-mindedness, sometimes pathologised as \u201crigidity of thought\u201d, but at other times framed more positively as \u201ca strong sense of justice\u201d. Thunberg has spoken of her ability to see things \u201cin black and white\u201d \u2013 for her, this is not rigidity, but clarity. Autistic people, in general, feel the pull of the truth more powerfully than we do the pull of fitting in. We are not inclined to accept reassurance that has no facts behind it.</p> <p>Sometimes I do pretend to accept it. I\u2019ve changed since I was a teenager: softened, become more pragmatic. It makes me easier to get on with, but when I watch Thunberg, I wonder what I might have done if I hadn\u2019t spent so much energy learning how to smile when I talked.</p> <p>I asked Steve Silberman, author of <em>NeuroTribes: the Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity</em>, whether he agreed with Thunberg. \u201cAutism,\u201d he said, \u201cis a disability that can have advantages in the right situation, and with the right support. Greta\u2019s intense focus and disregard for others\u2019 opinions of her are \u2018superpowers\u2019 in that they help her ignore the fossil-fuel industry\u2019s lies, take on the facts of climate change, and organise her peers to change the world.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps we can change the world, if we don\u2019t let it change us too much. Packham has suggested that: \u201cHumanity has prospered because of people with autistic traits. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t have put a man on the Moon or be running software programmes. If we wiped out all the autistic people on the planet, I don\u2019t know how much longer the human race would last.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, there are some autistic people who see no advantage in it, and would gladly take a cure. There are some parents so desperate to believe in a cure that they put their faith in bogus treatments, sometimes with terrible consequences.</p> <p>So, what do I have \u2013 a disability or a difference? I asked developmental psychologist Professor Uta Frith the question: \u201cBoth points of view are valid and should be respected,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe might avoid confusion by dividing the spectrum into subgroups, but where the boundaries would be is far from clear. We need more research to tell us what autism really is.\u201d </p> <p>There\u2019s no telling where the boundaries are between a person\u2019s autism and the autistic person. As far as I can tell, everything I am, I am autistically. If you took the autism away you would take me with it. And, regardless of whether autistic people have superpowers or not, when the world gives us the support we need, we thrive, and give the best of ourselves in return. You\u2019ve not seen the best of us yet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When I heard Greta Thunberg say that being different was a superpower, I had to replay her saying it. Several times. I was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome at 42 and, seven years on, I\u2019m still far from sure what that means. Are those of us with autistic spectrum conditions disabled or different? Are we, by definition, deficient human beings, or are there compensations that come with our condition? Are there any circumstances in which autism could be considered, not merely an acceptable difference, but a superpower? Thunberg\u2019s comment some two months ago was her robust response to commentators who had sought to use her Asperger\u2019s to discredit her, claiming she must be a nave puppet and calling her a \u201cweirdo\u201d with a \u201cmonotone voice\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI have Asperger\u2019s and that means I\u2019m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And \u2013 given the right circumstances \u2013 being different is a superpower. #aspiepower.\u201d As a fellow autist, I find myself stuck in the middle of these two incompatible views: on the one hand, autistic people are disturbed, na\u00efve individuals who are incapable of knowing their own minds or speaking credibly; on the other, autistic people are superhumans with a preternatural ability to see the truth of things and to articulate it without equivocation. The world would be better without us; the world would be lost without us. Food writer and campaigner Jack Monroe, too, has written that learning to harness her own autistic traits has enabled her to see them \u201cas a kind of superpower\u201d. Novelist Katherine May is more ambiguous: \u201cMy autism brings some things I really value \u2013 the flood of words I experience, the ability to fixate on a subject and burrow deep into it, and an intense relationship with the natural world. But there are other bits I\u2019d get rid of. I break things and hurt myself all the time; and I hate the way that I don\u2019t remember faces and so come across as rude.\u201d Charlotte Moore, who has written about bringing up two autistic sons with high support needs, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t see my sons\u2019 autism as a disability, exactly. In the right environment, they can (and mainly do) lead happy, healthy lives. So I prefer the word \u2018difference\u2019 to \u2018disability\u2019.\u201d She continued: \u201cCan autism be a superpower? Probably, yes, in a few cases \u2013 some autistic people do have extreme abilities \u2013 but the popular belief that all autistic people are really geniuses isn\u2019t helpful to parents or carers struggling with autistic people with no speech and self-harming behaviours, meltdowns or sensory overload.\u201d When I received my own diagnosis, I wanted to find out what it meant. I learned that Asperger\u2019s syndrome is a controversial condition, sometimes set apart from other forms of autism. Since 2013 it has no longer been recognised as a stand-alone diagnosis in the United States, now falling under the umbrella term autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but it still is in the UK. The opposing views of autism \u2013 disability or difference \u2013 may owe their origins to two different models of autism outlined by two different psychiatrists. On the one hand, there is Leo Kanner\u2019s autism, first described in the US in the late 1940s. It is characterised by repetitive movement, little or no speech and high support needs. On the other hand, there is Asperger\u2019s syndrome, named after Hans Asperger, the child psychologist and eugenicist who published the first definition of the condition in 1944, describing the children he encountered in his clinic in wartime Vienna as \u201clittle professors\u201d. He famously said: \u201cIt seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.\u201d For a long time, it was the Kanner view that prevailed. Autism was considered a severe disability \u2013 and a rare one. Then, in 1976, the British psychiatrist Lorna Wing coined the term Asperger\u2019s syndrome and a new group of patients \u2013 mostly children, overwhelmingly male \u2013 began to receive this diagnosis. Autism is no longer considered rare. According to the National Autistic Society, just over 1% of the population is autistic. Other estimates are higher. Although Asperger\u2019s syndrome is no longer recognised in the United States, there are people who have grown up with it as their identity and they are sticking with it. Others have abandoned it in favour of the broader ASD. Controversy over Hans Asperger\u2019s possible involvement in the Nazis\u2019 eugenics programme led some to drop the term. Many, like me, use autism and Asperger\u2019s interchangeably. I usually define myself as \u201cautistic\u201d, because I don\u2019t recognise any essential difference between myself and non-speaking autistic people. I tried to figure out what autism might explain in my own life, including some of its negative aspects. I\u2019d had long experience of depression, anxiety and OCD. Had they arisen directly from a glitchy abnormal brain? Had they come about as a response to the adverse life experiences that accompany any difference, or might hypothetical non-autistic me have had them, too? And what about the more positive aspects? Would non-autistic me ever have had the focus or determination to persevere in the financially insecure, isolating, all-consuming business of writing? I have always loved words and books. At the age of three, I would take my whole library to bed with me. My mother described me as a \u201cnot very childish\u201d child, who preferred to talk to adults rather than other children. When I was nine, a teacher read a poem I\u2019d written to the class, and I decided then and there to be a writer. That was a rare happy moment at primary school. Like many parents of autistic children, my parents found themselves with a child that mainstream education refused to accommodate. Their solution (not one open to everybody) was to re-mortgage the house and send me to private school. For my parents, my autism, literally, came at a great cost. If I picture myself at Thunberg\u2019s age, I see certain similarities. I was idealistic, passionate about what I believed, blunt in the expression of my ideas. I was uninterested in makeup or any other aspect of what my mother called \u201cmaking the best of myself\u201d. I was a vegetarian, because two years earlier Morrissey had said that meat was murder. I didn\u2019t go in much for what people think of as normal teenage socialising. Instead, I pursued my own interests \u2013 and I pursued them single-mindedly. My passions were writing, the Beatles and feminism. I read my way through the Women\u2019s Studies section of Edgware Library, and passed The Female Eunuch round the sixth form at my all-girls\u2019 school, to raise the consciousness of the sisterhood. I announced to my mother that I was not going to go to university, because to do so would only mean following a patriarchal curriculum. Mum told me to stop being so silly. I went to university, but I took Greer and De Beauvoir with me. So that was how I was 33 years ago: intellectually curious, idealistic and articulate. I could even be funny sometimes, but I was also intense and sullen, with few social graces. Asperger\u2019s wasn\u2019t available to me as a diagnosis in the 1980s, but people found other words for me. They said \u201cmoody\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u2019 or \u201cthinks too much\u201d. I still find it painfully difficult to maintain a conversation with more than one or two people at once. I have to overcome a wagon-load of inertia in order to clean my teeth, wash and dress. On a bad day, it seems to me that everything I have managed to do as an adult \u2013 earn money, find a partner, raise a child \u2013 has only been possible because I have learned to suppress my autism. But that\u2019s not to say I see no advantages. Like Greta Thunberg and the comedian Hannah Gadsby, I find public speaking easier than casual conversation. In her brilliant Ted talk, Gadsby asks how she can be so good at something \u2013 talking \u2013 she knows she is so bad at. The answer is that standup has none of the pitfalls conversation brings for autistic people. When she is on stage, Gadsby does not have to listen as well as speak, she does not have to figure out how to respond to what she hears, she does not have to do all the exhausting parallel processing that an autistic person has to consciously engage in during everyday conversation. She has figured out what she wants to say and she can just say it, without distraction or interruption. Perfect. And I can add from personal experience, that when you have to perform almost every time you interact, performing in front of 1,000 people isn\u2019t very different to performing in front of three. To a non-autistic person, who finds conversation easy but public speaking unnerving, this may well look like a superpower. Another trait that we have on our side is the intensity of focus with which we pursue our passions. Chris Packham, naturalist and environmentalist and ambassador for the National Autistic Society, explained how the strength of his sensory response to the world around him enables him to \u201cengage with the natural world with greater clarity and ease\u201d. Packham said that from an early age, he could \u201csee things which others couldn\u2019t in nature\u201d. There is a third trait associated with Asperger\u2019s syndrome that Packham shares with Thunberg and which makes them both such effective activists. It is a certain moral single-mindedness, sometimes pathologised as \u201crigidity of thought\u201d, but at other times framed more positively as \u201ca strong sense of justice\u201d. Thunberg has spoken of her ability to see things \u201cin black and white\u201d \u2013 for her, this is not rigidity, but clarity. Autistic people, in general, feel the pull of the truth more powerfully than we do the pull of fitting in. We are not inclined to accept reassurance that has no facts behind it. Sometimes I do pretend to accept it. I\u2019ve changed since I was a teenager: softened, become more pragmatic. It makes me easier to get on with, but when I watch Thunberg, I wonder what I might have done if I hadn\u2019t spent so much energy learning how to smile when I talked. I asked Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes: the Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity, whether he agreed with Thunberg. \u201cAutism,\u201d he said, \u201cis a disability that can have advantages in the right situation, and with the right support. Greta\u2019s intense focus and disregard for others\u2019 opinions of her are \u2018superpowers\u2019 in that they help her ignore the fossil-fuel industry\u2019s lies, take on the facts of climate change, and organise her peers to change the world.\u201d Perhaps we can change the world, if we don\u2019t let it change us too much. Packham has suggested that: \u201cHumanity has prospered because of people with autistic traits. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t have put a man on the Moon or be running software programmes. If we wiped out all the autistic people on the planet, I don\u2019t know how much longer the human race would last.\u201d At the same time, there are some autistic people who see no advantage in it, and would gladly take a cure. There are some parents so desperate to believe in a cure that they put their faith in bogus treatments, sometimes with terrible consequences. So, what do I have \u2013 a disability or a difference? I asked developmental psychologist Professor Uta Frith the question: \u201cBoth points of view are valid and should be respected,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe might avoid confusion by dividing the spectrum into subgroups, but where the boundaries would be is far from clear. We need more research to tell us what autism really is.\u201d There\u2019s no telling where the boundaries are between a person\u2019s autism and the autistic person. As far as I can tell, everything I am, I am autistically. If you took the autism away you would take me with it. And, regardless of whether autistic people have superpowers or not, when the world gives us the support we need, we thrive, and give the best of ourselves in return. You\u2019ve not seen the best of us yet.",

The internet, now a sort of digital camera obscura, showed me a clip where, as a prank, the American comedian <a href=\"http://www.davidspade.com/\" title=\"\">David Spade</a> had secured Bin Laden\u2019s assassin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3zW9LaONAc\" title=\"\">a slot at </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3zW9LaONAc\" title=\"\">the Comedy Store</a>. He and another American comedian, Whitney Cummings, fed the likable former Seal lines through an earpiece (like Frankie Boyle and Russell Howard, O\u2019Neill used writers), and secretly filmed the show. This was the very same performance Kobek had attended.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill tells the crowd he shot Bin Laden because he was \u201ctired of taking my shoes off at the fucking airport\u201d. In his military service, O\u2019Neill continues, he got \u201ctwo silver stars, four bronze stars of valour and a ton of pussy\u201d. While trading on a certain amount of jingoism, the act also works, perhaps unintentionally, as a parody of normal comedy. How, for example, would the SAS man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/01/ira-killings-gibraltar-sas-1988\" title=\"\">shot three IRA members in Gibraltar</a> describe his experiences, were he obliged to do so on <em><a href=\"https://chrisramseycomedy.com/watch\" title=\"\">Live at the Apollo</a></em><a href=\"https://chrisramseycomedy.com/watch\" title=\"\"> in the style of Chris Ramsey?</a></p> <p>In closing, O\u2019Neill\u2019s puppeteers allow him the blackly comic observation: \u201cMy favourite thing about killing Osama bin Laden is that it finally ended all the wars in the Middle East.\u201d One wonders if, as O\u2019Neill exits past a bewildered looking Kobek sporting a Guns N\u2019 Roses T-shirt, he is at all traumatised by his past and whether his assassination-induced celebrity acts as any kind of balm? Perhaps Spade and Cummings intended to explore this idea. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t feel culturally equipped to decode whatever was going on and no criticism of the piece is intended.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in a White House press conference on the subject of the hero dog, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/mark-esper-sworn-in-as-us-defense-secretary-following-record-vacancy\" title=\"\">defence </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/23/mark-esper-sworn-in-as-us-defense-secretary-following-record-vacancy\" title=\"\">secretary, Mark Esper</a>, who will tour the animal sex farms with the national canine gigolo, said the assassin hound could be guaranteed to \u201cperform a tremendous service\u201d.

The internet, now a sort of digital camera obscura, showed me a clip where, as a prank, the American comedian David Spade had secured Bin Laden\u2019s assassin a slot at the Comedy Store. He and another American comedian, Whitney Cummings, fed the likable former Seal lines through an earpiece (like Frankie Boyle and Russell Howard, O\u2019Neill used writers), and secretly filmed the show. This was the very same performance Kobek had attended. O\u2019Neill tells the crowd he shot Bin Laden because he was \u201ctired of taking my shoes off at the fucking airport\u201d. In his military service, O\u2019Neill continues, he got \u201ctwo silver stars, four bronze stars of valour and a ton of pussy\u201d. While trading on a certain amount of jingoism, the act also works, perhaps unintentionally, as a parody of normal comedy. How, for example, would the SAS man who shot three IRA members in Gibraltar describe his experiences, were he obliged to do so on Live at the Apollo in the style of Chris Ramsey? In closing, O\u2019Neill\u2019s puppeteers allow him the blackly comic observation: \u201cMy favourite thing about killing Osama bin Laden is that it finally ended all the wars in the Middle East.\u201d One wonders if, as O\u2019Neill exits past a bewildered looking Kobek sporting a Guns N\u2019 Roses T-shirt, he is at all traumatised by his past and whether his assassination-induced celebrity acts as any kind of balm? Perhaps Spade and Cummings intended to explore this idea. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t feel culturally equipped to decode whatever was going on and no criticism of the piece is intended. Meanwhile, in a White House press conference on the subject of the hero dog, defence secretary, Mark Esper, who will tour the animal sex farms with the national canine gigolo, said the assassin hound could be guaranteed to \u201cperform a tremendous service\u201d. And in the unlikely event that America\u2019s sex-dog is unable to rise to the occasion, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has confirmed that he will personally hand-milk the malfunctioning malinois into whatever receptacle the customers provide and that he will get the job done however long it takes. God bless America!! We are through the looking glass here, people!!!

I\u2019d like him to say that to my face as I pick cotton buds out of my plug hole for the fifth time this week but, to be honest, he\u2019s right, and we haven\u2019t tried to train him out of it yet. There\u2019s little to clean up anyhow, since we have long since stopped putting rubbish in it. The wicker bin is his, free for use in this bizarre nightly ritual. If nothing else, our bathroom waste has been reduced to whatever can be collated into a plastic bag affixed to a doorknob. Perhaps that was his point all along \u2013 to promote more ecological behaviour among his parents, like some kind of toddler Greta Thunberg, but one who doesn\u2019t eat his dinner and hates public displays of affection. Gazing at our little eco-warrior, as he stares in turn at the wicker bin floating in the bath, my wife and I feel a surge of confusion, pride and love. It would be nice to hug right now but, perhaps we should quit while we\u2019re ahead. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

In this, he\u2019s not alone. Most of us, these days, acquire our information by similar means, but he is as concerned about the medium as he is by its message.</p> <p>\u201cAs someone who doesn\u2019t say much on social media, I\u2019m nevertheless so aware of it, aware of the passing rages and injustices, and injustices caused by other people\u2019s sense of injustice on the internet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"844f74a4af3eb2016641118f57b853b6b199cdac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/844f74a4af3eb2016641118f57b853b6b199cdac/353_0_2021_2021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Shakespeare in Ben Elton\u2019s BBC sitcom Upstart Crow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Shakespeare in Ben Elton\u2019s BBC sitcom Upstart Crow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Hutton/BBC/Colin Hutton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/23/how-social-media-echo-chambers-fuelled-the-rise-of-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">echo chambers of social outrage</a>, rather than the cause of the outrage, that appear to bother him most. As much as he is ardently in favour of remaining in the EU, what really troubles him is the toxic nature of the debate, and the manner in which division has become embedded in mutual animosity. By nature, he\u2019s a polite chap, alive to the other\u2019s point of view. That said, there is one person for whom he is inclined to suspend his more nuanced rules of engagement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/22/golden-toilets-golden-arches-as-for-david-cameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron really seems to get his goat</a>. Why him, in particular?</p> <p>\u201cThe Brexit referendum is the worst thing he\u2019s done,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t like him before that. He\u2019s a really interesting symptom to look at. He\u2019s the sort of symptom from which a diagnosis can be derived. Obviously, he\u2019s not an idiot, but the mixture of the poshness, the plausibility, the central slipperiness \u2013 he\u2019s the worst person to be in a position of supreme power in a trillion-dollar economy. His referendum plan elevated the importance of Tory party unity over the prosperity of Britain and the stability of Europe. We\u2019ve got to not have the system that rewards that behaviour and that sort of instinct.\u201d</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t help that the former Tory leader was educated at Eton, an institution for which Mitchell, himself the product of a minor public school, once felt a certain fondness.</p> <p>\u201cI used to like old-fashioned things like classic cars,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine because when they\u2019re fading into the past and the future is perhaps less picturesque but fairer, then you can enjoy reminiscing about the picturesque.\u201d</p> <p>When Britain had a series of state-educated prime ministers, from Harold Wilson to John Major, Eton, by his reckoning, became a harmless school. \u201cBut now,\u201d he says, \u201cthat period feels like a weird phase of meritocracy.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron- and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/23/eton-schools-inequality-elite-social-immobility\" title=\"\">Eton-bashing</a> aside, Mitchell is not someone who usually places a target in his sights. Instead he tends to construct elaborate works of lateral thinking in his columns, moving from the general to the particular and back again, in amused pursuit of the perfect riff. While he likes to be right as much as the next opinionated person, in this age of political turbulence and Twitterstorms he prefers to be funny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a04d4953000bd58332da4b957a074cc81731af1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a04d4953000bd58332da4b957a074cc81731af1/15_25_2266_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Webb and Mitchell in their Cambridge days, mid-90s.

The picture was taken for the poster advertising their first two-man show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of David Mitchell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, he increasingly questions why he\u2019s writing a column after 11 years on the job. What he continues to savour, though, is the immediacy and reliability of a column by comparison with television, where most ideas die a long and anonymous death, never seeing the light of an audience\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIt goes down well in the TV world if you\u2019ve got a column,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re aware that they haven\u2019t got complete monopoly on your ability to express yourself publicly.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell, it must be said, has seldom suffered a shortage of public expression on television. For the past 20 years he\u2019s barely been off our screens. His first big break came in 2000 in a sketch show called <em>Bruiser</em>, in which he appeared alongside Webb and their old Cambridge Footlights friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/olivia-colman-15-things\" title=\"\">Olivia Colman</a>, star of, well, <em>everything</em>. Also present was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/mar/31/martin-freeman-desert-island-discs-talking-about-sherlock-ex-partner-life\" title=\"\">Martin Freeman</a>, of <em>Sherlock </em>and Bilbo Baggins fame.</p> <p>Another of Mitchell\u2019s Footlights contemporaries was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/24/john-oliver-audiences-not-liking-us-tv-comedian-dustin-hoffman\" title=\"\">satirist John Oliver</a>. There\u2019s nothing like globally successful friends to put your own achievements in perspective. But he does not envy them their stratospheric rises. Unusually, perhaps, for someone who has attained a high level of recognition, Mitchell doesn\u2019t want to go any higher. That said, he acknowledges that it\u2019s politic to affect ever greater ambition, to be seen always to want more, if only in order to \u201ccling on\u201d to what you\u2019ve got.</p> <p>He calls the idea that if you\u2019re not moving forward, you\u2019re moving backwards \u201cbusiness bullshit speak\u201d. The truth, he says, is that if you\u2019re not moving forward, you might just be stationary.</p> <p>\u201cAny physicist would accept that. And I wish to remain stationary. My ambition as a teenager was to do what I do for a job in almost exactly the way I do it. And that\u2019s what I want to continue to do as a job until I retire. I don\u2019t want to be a film star and I don\u2019t want to go to Hollywood.\u201d</p> <p>So he has reached a rare state of professional contentment, except in his case it\u2019s an anxious kind of contentment because he is fundamentally an anxious kind of person. For many years he controlled his various irrational fears through analysing statistical likelihood. \u201cI managed to get myself to a place where the thing I was frightened of didn\u2019t have to be impossible \u2013 I could console myself with the thought that it was just vanishingly unlikely.\u201d</p> <p>That worked until he had a child, his and Coren\u2019s four-year-old daughter, Barbara. Now, he says, he\u2019s back to \u201cneeding the bad thing to be absolutely impossible\u201d. </p> <p>Perhaps because he\u2019s such a natural observational comedian, he talks easily about his private life, while conscientiously registering a desire for privacy. A further problem is that he\u2019s spoken in the past with striking candour about the details of his personal life, as well as writing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/19/david-mitchell-victoria-coren-engagement\" title=\"\">superior celebrity memoir, <em>Back Story</em></a>.</p> <p>The unglamorous bachelor flat where he used to live in Kilburn, north-west London, became a staple reference in interviews, in which he would reflect on loneliness, his lack of experience with girlfriends and much else that most celebrities would carefully excise from the business of image projection.</p> <p>He did it partly because he\u2019s an incurable anecdotalist but also to play up his comic persona \u2013 the one most fully embodied by Mark Corrigan, his character in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/nov/20/peep-show-mitchell-webb\" title=\"\">long-running Channel 4 comedy <em>Peep Show</em></a>: single, nerdy, desperate, prone to brilliant comic tirades. But the distance between the image and the reality was uncomfortably close.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"34e4cb37e99ec094a0684f251d7493114a8dfcf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34e4cb37e99ec094a0684f251d7493114a8dfcf5/0_0_2991_4487/667.jpg\" alt=\"Mitchell with his wife, Victoria, at the premiere of Greed in London last month.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell with his wife, Victoria, at the premiere of Greed in London last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then he met Coren, fell in love, and realised he\u2019d met his soulmate. She was keen, too, but in a difficult period in her life, she went out with someone else. He waited for three years, until she realised that Mitchell was the man for her. What impresses about that story is the waiting. It sounds like something from a distant era, many lifetimes before the instant gratification of the internet.</p> <p>It\u2019s more like something out of a medieval tale of courtly love, a moral of romantic struggle and triumphant belief. From being the lovable square that people secretly pitied, he became a partner in a fine romance that others openly envied. He\u2019s not unaware of the transition or how he and Coren are perceived.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the start, people I didn\u2019t know were very warm about Victoria and I being together, and that\u2019s a lovely feeling. A performer is warmed on a deeper level by strangers\u2019 approval because that\u2019s why we got into it. But neither of us wants to live our relationship in the public eye. We\u2019re happily married but don\u2019t want to project that to people like, look, we\u2019ve got something right!\u201d</p> <p>Nonetheless it\u2019s clear that he, like Coren, remains deeply in love, seven years on from their wedding. As celebrity marriages are like dog years \u2013 you have to multiply them by seven \u2013 they\u2019re practically about to celebrate their golden anniversary. And with two sitcoms on the go \u2013 Simon Blackwell\u2019s <em>Back</em>, in which he stars alongside Webb once more, and Ben Elton\u2019s Shakespearean farce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/25/david-mitchell-ben-elton-upstart-crow-shakespeare-sitcom-stage-show\" title=\"\"><em>Upstart Crow</em></a> (which opens in the West End in a stage version next year) \u2013 and a busy panel-show profile, he is, by his own estimation, tremendously happy at the moment.</p> <p>But as any pessimist knows, there\u2019s only one place to go from tremendously happy. \u201cExactly!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous point on the narrative arc.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell is not slow to recognise his good luck, and perhaps because he is such an obvious enthusiast, someone who\u2019s not interested in playing it cool or affecting indifference, he\u2019s not resented for it, either. My guess is that he will remain where he is, highly visible and cheeringly happy.

His was the pedantic, put-upon conservative with a small \u201cc\u201d, frustrated with the superficiality of modern trends, comically thwarted and superbly enraged. It was as if he had skipped the young, free and single years and gone straight to a dyspeptic midlife crisis \u2013 albeit an ironic one. But now the world has caught up with him and, in Mitchell\u2019s words, it is in \u201cmoral and economic decline\u201d. He wishes the internet didn\u2019t exist, and he reckons proportional representation, a steep hike in MPs\u2019 pay and stiff taxes on carbon-producing activities are the solutions to the current malaise. He apologises in the book\u2019s opening essay for his presumption in writing a \u201ctrite manifesto\u201d, but argues it\u2019s the least he can do if he\u2019s going to continue moaning. \u201cAnd my resolve to do that,\u201d he adds, \u201cis unshakeable.\u201d Given that he lives a very comfortable life in a leafy corner of north London where the infamous metropolitan liberal elite tend to congregate, and is professionally successful, happily married to his fellow panel show regular and former Observer columnist Victoria Coren, and the proud father of a young daughter, does he really feel the angst that he describes? \u201cFundamentally, I think I do feel it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s true that as I walk out of my house in a nice quiet street and go to a nice cafe five minutes\u2019 walk away, I have no reason to have these apocalyptic musings.\u201d However, he says that his sense of the external world is shaped not by experience but by the news and social media. In this, he\u2019s not alone. Most of us, these days, acquire our information by similar means, but he is as concerned about the medium as he is by its message. \u201cAs someone who doesn\u2019t say much on social media, I\u2019m nevertheless so aware of it, aware of the passing rages and injustices, and injustices caused by other people\u2019s sense of injustice on the internet.\u201d It\u2019s these echo chambers of social outrage, rather than the cause of the outrage, that appear to bother him most. As much as he is ardently in favour of remaining in the EU, what really troubles him is the toxic nature of the debate, and the manner in which division has become embedded in mutual animosity. By nature, he\u2019s a polite chap, alive to the other\u2019s point of view. That said, there is one person for whom he is inclined to suspend his more nuanced rules of engagement. David Cameron really seems to get his goat. Why him, in particular? \u201cThe Brexit referendum is the worst thing he\u2019s done,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t like him before that. He\u2019s a really interesting symptom to look at. He\u2019s the sort of symptom from which a diagnosis can be derived. Obviously, he\u2019s not an idiot, but the mixture of the poshness, the plausibility, the central slipperiness \u2013 he\u2019s the worst person to be in a position of supreme power in a trillion-dollar economy. His referendum plan elevated the importance of Tory party unity over the prosperity of Britain and the stability of Europe. We\u2019ve got to not have the system that rewards that behaviour and that sort of instinct.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that the former Tory leader was educated at Eton, an institution for which Mitchell, himself the product of a minor public school, once felt a certain fondness. \u201cI used to like old-fashioned things like classic cars,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s fine because when they\u2019re fading into the past and the future is perhaps less picturesque but fairer, then you can enjoy reminiscing about the picturesque.\u201d When Britain had a series of state-educated prime ministers, from Harold Wilson to John Major, Eton, by his reckoning, became a harmless school. \u201cBut now,\u201d he says, \u201cthat period feels like a weird phase of meritocracy.\u201d Cameron- and Eton-bashing aside, Mitchell is not someone who usually places a target in his sights. Instead he tends to construct elaborate works of lateral thinking in his columns, moving from the general to the particular and back again, in amused pursuit of the perfect riff. While he likes to be right as much as the next opinionated person, in this age of political turbulence and Twitterstorms he prefers to be funny. Still, he increasingly questions why he\u2019s writing a column after 11 years on the job. What he continues to savour, though, is the immediacy and reliability of a column by comparison with television, where most ideas die a long and anonymous death, never seeing the light of an audience\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt goes down well in the TV world if you\u2019ve got a column,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re aware that they haven\u2019t got complete monopoly on your ability to express yourself publicly.\u201d Mitchell, it must be said, has seldom suffered a shortage of public expression on television. For the past 20 years he\u2019s barely been off our screens. His first big break came in 2000 in a sketch show called Bruiser, in which he appeared alongside Webb and their old Cambridge Footlights friend Olivia Colman, star of, well, everything. Also present was Martin Freeman, of Sherlock and Bilbo Baggins fame. Another of Mitchell\u2019s Footlights contemporaries was the satirist John Oliver. There\u2019s nothing like globally successful friends to put your own achievements in perspective. But he does not envy them their stratospheric rises. Unusually, perhaps, for someone who has attained a high level of recognition, Mitchell doesn\u2019t want to go any higher. That said, he acknowledges that it\u2019s politic to affect ever greater ambition, to be seen always to want more, if only in order to \u201ccling on\u201d to what you\u2019ve got. He calls the idea that if you\u2019re not moving forward, you\u2019re moving backwards \u201cbusiness bullshit speak\u201d. The truth, he says, is that if you\u2019re not moving forward, you might just be stationary. \u201cAny physicist would accept that. And I wish to remain stationary. My ambition as a teenager was to do what I do for a job in almost exactly the way I do it. And that\u2019s what I want to continue to do as a job until I retire. I don\u2019t want to be a film star and I don\u2019t want to go to Hollywood.\u201d So he has reached a rare state of professional contentment, except in his case it\u2019s an anxious kind of contentment because he is fundamentally an anxious kind of person. For many years he controlled his various irrational fears through analysing statistical likelihood. \u201cI managed to get myself to a place where the thing I was frightened of didn\u2019t have to be impossible \u2013 I could console myself with the thought that it was just vanishingly unlikely.\u201d That worked until he had a child, his and Coren\u2019s four-year-old daughter, Barbara. Now, he says, he\u2019s back to \u201cneeding the bad thing to be absolutely impossible\u201d. Perhaps because he\u2019s such a natural observational comedian, he talks easily about his private life, while conscientiously registering a desire for privacy. A further problem is that he\u2019s spoken in the past with striking candour about the details of his personal life, as well as writing a superior celebrity memoir, Back Story. The unglamorous bachelor flat where he used to live in Kilburn, north-west London, became a staple reference in interviews, in which he would reflect on loneliness, his lack of experience with girlfriends and much else that most celebrities would carefully excise from the business of image projection. He did it partly because he\u2019s an incurable anecdotalist but also to play up his comic persona \u2013 the one most fully embodied by Mark Corrigan, his character in the long-running Channel 4 comedy Peep Show: single, nerdy, desperate, prone to brilliant comic tirades. But the distance between the image and the reality was uncomfortably close. And then he met Coren, fell in love, and realised he\u2019d met his soulmate. She was keen, too, but in a difficult period in her life, she went out with someone else. He waited for three years, until she realised that Mitchell was the man for her. What impresses about that story is the waiting. It sounds like something from a distant era, many lifetimes before the instant gratification of the internet. It\u2019s more like something out of a medieval tale of courtly love, a moral of romantic struggle and triumphant belief. From being the lovable square that people secretly pitied, he became a partner in a fine romance that others openly envied. He\u2019s not unaware of the transition or how he and Coren are perceived. \u201cFrom the start, people I didn\u2019t know were very warm about Victoria and I being together, and that\u2019s a lovely feeling. A performer is warmed on a deeper level by strangers\u2019 approval because that\u2019s why we got into it. But neither of us wants to live our relationship in the public eye. We\u2019re happily married but don\u2019t want to project that to people like, look, we\u2019ve got something right!\u201d Nonetheless it\u2019s clear that he, like Coren, remains deeply in love, seven years on from their wedding. As celebrity marriages are like dog years \u2013 you have to multiply them by seven \u2013 they\u2019re practically about to celebrate their golden anniversary. And with two sitcoms on the go \u2013 Simon Blackwell\u2019s Back, in which he stars alongside Webb once more, and Ben Elton\u2019s Shakespearean farce Upstart Crow (which opens in the West End in a stage version next year) \u2013 and a busy panel-show profile, he is, by his own estimation, tremendously happy at the moment. But as any pessimist knows, there\u2019s only one place to go from tremendously happy. \u201cExactly!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous point on the narrative arc.\u201d Mitchell is not slow to recognise his good luck, and perhaps because he is such an obvious enthusiast, someone who\u2019s not interested in playing it cool or affecting indifference, he\u2019s not resented for it, either. My guess is that he will remain where he is, highly visible and cheeringly happy. After all, any physicist would accept that. \u2022 Dishonesty Is the Second-Best Policy is published by Faber (\u00a320). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

I\u2019m saying that maybe there won\u2019t ever be a big nuclear war, which leaves the field clear for smartphones to wreak their slightly less dramatic form of havoc in a way that will eclipse the harm done, so far, by nuclear bombs. Hooray!</p> <p>One of the advantages of nuclear weapons, as disastrous things to invent go, is that they were immediately obviously a disastrous thing to invent. Nobody\u2019s going to be fooled for a second into thinking they\u2019re going to democratise anything, except possibly death, which is pretty democratised already.</p> <p>Conversely, the smartphone/internet combination is in the cigarettes and plastic straws school of disastrous invention.

They seemed like they\u2019d be useful. And they are useful. It\u2019s very useful to be able to communicate instantly and globally, to be able to find things out, buy things and be entertained by things without having to move, or while moving around doing something else which currently can\u2019t be achieved online, such as gardening or attending funerals.</p> <p>It\u2019s extremely useful to be able to do all that. The only fly in the utility ointment is that <em>everyone</em> can do it. Frankly, that spoils it. If you were the only person with smartphone powers \u2013 able to shop, watch TV, write and receive correspondence, make phone calls, access more data than the Library of Congress wherever you were \u2013 that would be brilliant. So labour saving! You\u2019d never have to go to work. But when everyone can do it, it effectively means you never <em>leave</em> work \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky enough to be in work, that is, which, if your area of expertise involves shops, restaurants, pubs or any of the old media, you\u2019re much less likely to be post-internet.

Plus, people don\u2019t keep appointments any more because they can just text and say they\u2019re running late. It\u2019s all fucking terrible! Who knows what the ultimate outcome of all this will be but, anecdotally at least, it doesn\u2019t look like happiness.</p> <p>Most insidious of all is the effect on truth. Suddenly it feels so flimsy. My whole view of existence is predicated on the notion that, in the end, the truth will out. Possibly long after the protagonists of any controversy have died, but eventually, and for the eternal knowledge of posterity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e19522daaa91a7e356c6562e18dc963293229208\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e19522daaa91a7e356c6562e18dc963293229208/0_0_756_1102/686.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari of smartphones stacked like a house of cards\" width=\"686\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: David Foldvari/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s how you get taught history at school. Tudor propagandists added a hunched back to Richard III\u2019s portrait, but we now know he only had scoliosis. The crucial phrase is \u201cwe now know\u201d. But what if the blizzard of words and imagery that the internet generates about everything, often manipulated by malign interest groups, makes the truth impossible ever to discern? It\u2019s in that haystack somewhere, but it\u2019s just one of the pieces of hay. Suddenly the whole of human existence is like an episode of Poirot in which the murder remains unsolved.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just the bare-faced lying that scares me but all the subjectivity. In the online world, which has become such a high percentage of many people\u2019s experience of existence, almost everything we see has been curated for us: the adverts that appear, the political claims that are made, the people we interact with, the products that are suggested to us when we search for something and the news that we\u2019re told about. It\u2019s all been tailored according to what we\u2019re likely to respond to. No two people see the same thing.</p> <p>Even the BBC News website is at it. It\u2019s taken to asking me if I want to \u201cchange nation\u201d. Considering the Brexit situation, I bloody do. Sadly, the only options are England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is a bit of a samey range if you ask me. But it\u2019s not really offering to change my nationality; it\u2019s telling me that it will report stories from where I live, or where I\u2019m most interested in, more prominently. I hate that. I just want to look at the BBC News website. I want to see the same one as everyone else, just like I would if I\u2019d bought a newspaper in a shop.</p> <p>I can seek out the subjects I particularly want to find out about by myself. I want to be able to find them, but I don\u2019t want them pushed towards me. The level of interest an algorithm thinks I\u2019m likely to show in any given news report is not a meaningful gauge of how important it actually is. If I only want to read stories about, say, cricket, I\u2019ll go to a cricket website or buy a cricket magazine. I don\u2019t want all my news feeds to suddenly start banging on exclusively about cricket because some machine has worked out I\u2019m into it, thereby giving me the illusion that the most important global events are all cricket-related.</p> <p>No wonder we talk about our online echo chambers, where everyone seems to agree with each other and any transgression from a range of approved views is jumped upon and the transgressor shamed. Social media corrals people into interacting solely with those who share their viewpoint more effectively than the court of Versailles in the last days of the Bourbons.</p> <p>This already dangerous situation is exacerbated by the fact that the only news, adverts or products that each echo chamber will get to see are specifically designed to attract the attention of its members \u2013 and so inevitably to confirm them in their opinions and prejudices. How else can the censorious and admonitory extreme political correctness of some university campuses coexist in the same world as the unabashed rise of crypto-fascism?</p> <p>The fact is that, virtually speaking, they don\u2019t exist in the same world. There is no unified reality, and that really might be a disaster. Objective truth may always have been unattainable, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth striving for.</p> <p>If we all just settle into small, mutually ignorant online support groups exchanging comforting half-truths, then civilisation is in for a rough ride. No one will know what is really going on, and working out what is really going on has, for most of history, been humankind\u2019s main purpose. Losing that is a high price to pay for being able to order pizza without speaking to anyone.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> This is an edited extract from <em>Dishonesty Is the Second-Best Policy</em>, published by Faber (\u00a320).

Plus, people don\u2019t keep appointments any more because they can just text and say they\u2019re running late. It\u2019s all fucking terrible! Who knows what the ultimate outcome of all this will be but, anecdotally at least, it doesn\u2019t look like happiness. Most insidious of all is the effect on truth. Suddenly it feels so flimsy. My whole view of existence is predicated on the notion that, in the end, the truth will out. Possibly long after the protagonists of any controversy have died, but eventually, and for the eternal knowledge of posterity. That\u2019s how you get taught history at school. Tudor propagandists added a hunched back to Richard III\u2019s portrait, but we now know he only had scoliosis. The crucial phrase is \u201cwe now know\u201d. But what if the blizzard of words and imagery that the internet generates about everything, often manipulated by malign interest groups, makes the truth impossible ever to discern? It\u2019s in that haystack somewhere, but it\u2019s just one of the pieces of hay. Suddenly the whole of human existence is like an episode of Poirot in which the murder remains unsolved. And it\u2019s not just the bare-faced lying that scares me but all the subjectivity. In the online world, which has become such a high percentage of many people\u2019s experience of existence, almost everything we see has been curated for us: the adverts that appear, the political claims that are made, the people we interact with, the products that are suggested to us when we search for something and the news that we\u2019re told about. It\u2019s all been tailored according to what we\u2019re likely to respond to. No two people see the same thing. Even the BBC News website is at it. It\u2019s taken to asking me if I want to \u201cchange nation\u201d. Considering the Brexit situation, I bloody do. Sadly, the only options are England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is a bit of a samey range if you ask me. But it\u2019s not really offering to change my nationality; it\u2019s telling me that it will report stories from where I live, or where I\u2019m most interested in, more prominently. I hate that. I just want to look at the BBC News website. I want to see the same one as everyone else, just like I would if I\u2019d bought a newspaper in a shop. I can seek out the subjects I particularly want to find out about by myself. I want to be able to find them, but I don\u2019t want them pushed towards me. The level of interest an algorithm thinks I\u2019m likely to show in any given news report is not a meaningful gauge of how important it actually is. If I only want to read stories about, say, cricket, I\u2019ll go to a cricket website or buy a cricket magazine. I don\u2019t want all my news feeds to suddenly start banging on exclusively about cricket because some machine has worked out I\u2019m into it, thereby giving me the illusion that the most important global events are all cricket-related. No wonder we talk about our online echo chambers, where everyone seems to agree with each other and any transgression from a range of approved views is jumped upon and the transgressor shamed. Social media corrals people into interacting solely with those who share their viewpoint more effectively than the court of Versailles in the last days of the Bourbons. This already dangerous situation is exacerbated by the fact that the only news, adverts or products that each echo chamber will get to see are specifically designed to attract the attention of its members \u2013 and so inevitably to confirm them in their opinions and prejudices. How else can the censorious and admonitory extreme political correctness of some university campuses coexist in the same world as the unabashed rise of crypto-fascism? The fact is that, virtually speaking, they don\u2019t exist in the same world. There is no unified reality, and that really might be a disaster. Objective truth may always have been unattainable, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth striving for. If we all just settle into small, mutually ignorant online support groups exchanging comforting half-truths, then civilisation is in for a rough ride. No one will know what is really going on, and working out what is really going on has, for most of history, been humankind\u2019s main purpose. Losing that is a high price to pay for being able to order pizza without speaking to anyone. \u2022 This is an edited extract from Dishonesty Is the Second-Best Policy, published by Faber (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>As a child, I cavorted in Oxford colleges, rode atop armoured bears and swanned off to Svalbard to witness the majesty of the northern lights \u2013 all while remaining within the walls of an Edwardian terrace in Cardiff.</p> <p>No, I wasn\u2019t a fantasist. Or, at least, the fantasy wasn\u2019t mine alone. The escapades were thanks to my compulsive reading of Philip Pullman\u2019s <em>His Dark Materials</em>. <em>Northern Lights</em>, the first book in the <em>His Dark Materials</em> trilogy, was published in 1995, when I was four, so it was a few years after it came out that I fell for Pullman\u2019s writing. But when I finally did \u2026 boy, did I fall hard. I zoned out of sleepovers with friends, family dinners, and \u2013 on one occasion \u2013 my brother\u2019s wedding as I joined Pullman\u2019s heroine, Lyra, on thrilling Arctic voyages and skirmishes in parallel universes.</p> <p>If I detailed all the reasons I loved the trilogy, I\u2019d take up the whole newspaper. But it comes down to three things. First, I loved Lyra who, thanks to her daring and mischief, allowed me to glimpse what life would be like were I not such a timid teacher\u2019s pet. Second, there were Pullman\u2019s irresistible \u201cdaemons\u201d \u2013 a kind of animal self. A companion who could shape-shift from seal to snow leopard seemed an improvement on my drab imaginary friend, Cheryl. And third, it felt \u2026 rebellious. I had a cosy Church of Wales upbringing where the history of Christianity was presented as an uninterrupted stretch of benevolence. Pullman\u2019s scrutiny of the authoritarian side of religion was as invigorating as a blast of the Arctic air I\u2019d read about in his books.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b9e5ea52ad8c88966758b15e8258e652fbec86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b9e5ea52ad8c88966758b15e8258e652fbec86/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children\u2019s author Philip Pullman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children\u2019s author Philip Pullman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Gilbert/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up, and finally consented to read a few other books \u2013 but my devotion to Pullman never diminished. Which is why I\u2019m positively writhing with excitement about the all-star TV adaptation which kicks off on Sunday night on BBC One.</p> <p>The palpable hype among my generation is proof of something I\u2019ve always suspected: that the books we encounter as children are the ones to which we\u2019re most attached. After all, while it\u2019s not inconceivable that one would throw a viewing party for a TV adaptation of the work of a writer discovered in adulthood, it seems more likely to happen with a children\u2019s author. (My flat. 8pm. \u201cArmoured bear\u201d makes a good cold weather costume.)</p> <p>So what\u2019s behind our heightened connection with children\u2019s books? The journalist Lucy Mangan offers some clues in her memoir of childhood reading, <em>Bookworm</em>. She suggests that children\u2019s tendency towards re-reading is not only healthy but necessary, given the wealth of new information books convey. \u201cYou are learning about people, about relationships, about the variety of responses available to them [the characters] and in many more situations and circumstances \u2026 than one single real life permits,\u201d she writes. \u201cEach book is a world entire.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d argue, then, that our fondness for children\u2019s books not only comes from the familiarity forged through re-reading but from the reason we re-read, too. As Mangan says, children\u2019s books are where we first encounter myriad aspects of life. Such intense periods of discovery tend to lodge in the memory.</p> <p>There\u2019s also another factor: time. In youth, entire days are spent in uninterrupted stretches of reading. It\u2019s harder when you have a job and WhatsApp. Mangan also notes that higher expectations mean these \u201cdays of effortless immersion\u201d are harder to come by in adulthood. \u201cAs an adult, your tastes (and/or prejudices) are more developed, your time is more precious and your critical faculties are harder to switch off.\u201d Children, on the other hand, are joyously uninhibited when they read \u2013 in other words, they\u2019re not fretting about whether the book will fit with their #personalbrand on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1975c1e2f06d43963cae6211225d220dfc95143\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1975c1e2f06d43963cae6211225d220dfc95143/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dafne Keen plays Philip Pullman\u2019s heroine, Lyra, in His Dark Materials.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dafne Keen plays Philip Pullman\u2019s heroine, Lyra, in His Dark Materials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, author Katherine Rundell has suggested that children\u2019s books work on two levels, simultaneously satisfying kids\u2019 thirst for adventure and incorporating the adult author\u2019s awareness of the knottier aspects of life. Indeed, they\u2019re required to operate on two planes if they\u2019re to avoid boring parents who are reading to their offspring. So, in a way, children\u2019s books work harder than books for adults, conveying many-layered meaning with the sort of lightness required to hold short attention spans. Such finesse doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by readers.</p> <p>All of this is why, when someone inquires about your favourite book and you insist it\u2019s a toss-up between Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Booker prize-winning <em>Girl, Woman, Other</em> and Virginia Woolf\u2019s <em>To The Lighthouse</em>, they\u2019ll know you\u2019re lying. Neither of these can be your favourite book \u2013 or, at least, the book that has had the greatest influence on you. The books that mark us most profoundly \u2013 that burrow into our psyches and shape how we see the world \u2013 are the ones we read as children.</p> <p>Of course, some sneer that children\u2019s books are rife with nostalgia. But the nostalgia in question isn\u2019t a \u201ctake back control\u201d yearning for a simpler time \u2013 but for a simpler way of seeing.

      "bodyText": "As a child, I cavorted in Oxford colleges, rode atop armoured bears and swanned off to Svalbard to witness the majesty of the northern lights \u2013 all while remaining within the walls of an Edwardian terrace in Cardiff. No, I wasn\u2019t a fantasist. Or, at least, the fantasy wasn\u2019t mine alone. The escapades were thanks to my compulsive reading of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials. Northern Lights, the first book in the His Dark Materials trilogy, was published in 1995, when I was four, so it was a few years after it came out that I fell for Pullman\u2019s writing. But when I finally did \u2026 boy, did I fall hard. I zoned out of sleepovers with friends, family dinners, and \u2013 on one occasion \u2013 my brother\u2019s wedding as I joined Pullman\u2019s heroine, Lyra, on thrilling Arctic voyages and skirmishes in parallel universes. If I detailed all the reasons I loved the trilogy, I\u2019d take up the whole newspaper. But it comes down to three things. First, I loved Lyra who, thanks to her daring and mischief, allowed me to glimpse what life would be like were I not such a timid teacher\u2019s pet. Second, there were Pullman\u2019s irresistible \u201cdaemons\u201d \u2013 a kind of animal self. A companion who could shape-shift from seal to snow leopard seemed an improvement on my drab imaginary friend, Cheryl. And third, it felt \u2026 rebellious. I had a cosy Church of Wales upbringing where the history of Christianity was presented as an uninterrupted stretch of benevolence. Pullman\u2019s scrutiny of the authoritarian side of religion was as invigorating as a blast of the Arctic air I\u2019d read about in his books. I grew up, and finally consented to read a few other books \u2013 but my devotion to Pullman never diminished. Which is why I\u2019m positively writhing with excitement about the all-star TV adaptation which kicks off on Sunday night on BBC One. The palpable hype among my generation is proof of something I\u2019ve always suspected: that the books we encounter as children are the ones to which we\u2019re most attached. After all, while it\u2019s not inconceivable that one would throw a viewing party for a TV adaptation of the work of a writer discovered in adulthood, it seems more likely to happen with a children\u2019s author. (My flat. 8pm. \u201cArmoured bear\u201d makes a good cold weather costume.) So what\u2019s behind our heightened connection with children\u2019s books? The journalist Lucy Mangan offers some clues in her memoir of childhood reading, Bookworm. She suggests that children\u2019s tendency towards re-reading is not only healthy but necessary, given the wealth of new information books convey. \u201cYou are learning about people, about relationships, about the variety of responses available to them [the characters] and in many more situations and circumstances \u2026 than one single real life permits,\u201d she writes. \u201cEach book is a world entire.\u201d I\u2019d argue, then, that our fondness for children\u2019s books not only comes from the familiarity forged through re-reading but from the reason we re-read, too. As Mangan says, children\u2019s books are where we first encounter myriad aspects of life. Such intense periods of discovery tend to lodge in the memory. There\u2019s also another factor: time. In youth, entire days are spent in uninterrupted stretches of reading. It\u2019s harder when you have a job and WhatsApp. Mangan also notes that higher expectations mean these \u201cdays of effortless immersion\u201d are harder to come by in adulthood. \u201cAs an adult, your tastes (and/or prejudices) are more developed, your time is more precious and your critical faculties are harder to switch off.\u201d Children, on the other hand, are joyously uninhibited when they read \u2013 in other words, they\u2019re not fretting about whether the book will fit with their #personalbrand on Instagram. In addition, author Katherine Rundell has suggested that children\u2019s books work on two levels, simultaneously satisfying kids\u2019 thirst for adventure and incorporating the adult author\u2019s awareness of the knottier aspects of life. Indeed, they\u2019re required to operate on two planes if they\u2019re to avoid boring parents who are reading to their offspring. So, in a way, children\u2019s books work harder than books for adults, conveying many-layered meaning with the sort of lightness required to hold short attention spans. Such finesse doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by readers. All of this is why, when someone inquires about your favourite book and you insist it\u2019s a toss-up between Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s Booker prize-winning Girl, Woman, Other and Virginia Woolf\u2019s To The Lighthouse, they\u2019ll know you\u2019re lying. Neither of these can be your favourite book \u2013 or, at least, the book that has had the greatest influence on you. The books that mark us most profoundly \u2013 that burrow into our psyches and shape how we see the world \u2013 are the ones we read as children. Of course, some sneer that children\u2019s books are rife with nostalgia. But the nostalgia in question isn\u2019t a \u201ctake back control\u201d yearning for a simpler time \u2013 but for a simpler way of seeing. Childhood reading overlaps with a period where the future seems wide open. What we\u2019re looking to resurrect through kids\u2019 books isn\u2019t the past, but this beguilingly cheery perspective. Besides, the great gift of Pullman\u2019s stories set in Lyra\u2019s universe is that they\u2019re part of the present as much as the past. Along with the TV series, anyone who\u2019s been in a bookshop recently will know Pullman is still adding to the series \u2013 The Secret Commonwealth, the second book in The Book of Dust trilogy (which is interlinked with His Dark Materials) was published last month.

Findlay\u2019s proposed legislation is welcome and long overdue. but if we were serious about ending access to these streams, we might go further and prevent former prime ministers and ministers of state from monetising their tenures for a reasonable period after they are over. It would be like draining a swamp with a plunger, though. Four years ago, a senior Scottish Labour MP chastised me for suggesting during a radio show that he and some of his colleagues all too eagerly threw themselves into the lucrative arms of high finance after their 2015 election apocalypse. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I could have been earning hundreds of thousands during the time I was at Westminster,\u201d he said, looking genuinely hurt. From a population of 65.5 million, it must be possible to find 650 MPs and 129 MSPs who are happy to forfeit outside financial interests in exchange for a remuneration package more than twice the average wage and not expect to be hailed as heroes for their sacrifice. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

Her plea was taken up by the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s medical correspondent Christine Doyle, who wrote a feature, The Sad, Quiet Epidemic, which outlined Kayman\u2019s plight \u2013 and her plans.</p> <p>It was the only press response to her letter but it produced an extraordinary reaction. Within days, Kayman \u2013 who was 45 at the time \u2013 was contacted by other people who had been considering similar projects.

Today, we are squaring up to the condition and are recognising its existence. And thanks to the lead the Alzheimer\u2019s Society has given, people touched by dementia are at least provided with help and community support. I always think: thank God I picked up that pen and paper and wrote that letter.\u201d</p> <p>This point was confirmed by Professor Gordon Wilcock, of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing. He was also closely involved in the setting up of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society (or to be precise, the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Society as it was known until 1999 when its name was simplified). \u201cWe have made enormous strides since 1979. At that time it took a vast effort just to get a grant of \u00a320,000 from the NHS to run the society for its first two years,\u201d Wilcock told the <em>Observer</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa34aa3530d7af51603854bec7989e18537f11c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa34aa3530d7af51603854bec7989e18537f11c0/0_0_415_640/324.jpg\" alt=\"Morella Kayman as she is today.\" width=\"324\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morella Kayman as she is today.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morella Kayman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society has a budget of more than \u00a3100m and is helping to alleviate a great deal of suffering caused by the condition. \u201cWe are also funding important biomedical research that will hopefully lead to the development of drugs and treatments that can halt or even reverse the condition,\u201d added Wilcock. \u201cFor good measure, we put pressure on the NHS to ensure it provides proper care for patients and families, and we have played a major role in helping to remove the stigma that was once associated with dementia.\u201d</p> <p>It is thought there are about 850,000 people with dementia in the UK. The vast majority have Alzheimer\u2019s, while about 150,000 have vascular dementia. In addition, there are other less common forms, such as frontotemporal dementia. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society exists to support people with all forms of the condition.</p> <p>A crucial, and cruel, feature of dementia is its impact on families and carers. As Doyle wrote, presciently, in her feature: \u201cFor close relatives and friends, the suffering is probably greater than for the victim, who is commonly unaware of his or her condition and often content in a childlike way.\u201d There was no support for carers in 1979. Today, the impact of the disease on families and partners is well understood, and the society exists to press the NHS to provide full support. \u201cWe don\u2019t have seamless provision of social care and medical treatment for the condition as yet but it is something that we are urgently pursuing,\u201d said Wilcock.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a society in which people do not have to sell their houses to ensure they get care when they start to show symptoms of dementia but at least there is an awareness of dementia today that was lacking 40 years ago. We know what we have to do.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, breakthroughs have been made in understanding the causes of Alzheimer\u2019s, although new drugs to combat the condition remain elusive. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/10/22/Biogen-seeks-FDA-approval-for-drug-targeting-Alzheimers-disease/6161571755536/\" title=\"\">US company Biogen</a> revealed it was seeking regulatory approval to licence the drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/31/tantalising-signs-that-new-alzheimers-drug-could-benefit-early-stage-patients-aducanumab\" title=\"\">aducanumab</a> to treat early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. Wilcock remains cautious, pointing out that the drug had failed previous trials. \u201cReally, we need more government commitment to the development of drugs to treat dementia. At present, it gives about \u00a385m a year. We need three times that amount. That would bring dementia research to a level where it gets the same as cancer research. Many cancers are treatable today but people living with dementia have nothing.\u201d</p> <p>This point is backed up by Kayman, who is 85 now and is still closely involved in the work of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. \u201cUltimately, we are not looking at something that will merely alleviate dementia,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cWe are looking for a cure.\u201d</p>",

At that time it took a vast effort just to get a grant of \u00a320,000 from the NHS to run the society for its first two years,\u201d Wilcock told the Observer. Today, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society has a budget of more than \u00a3100m and is helping to alleviate a great deal of suffering caused by the condition. \u201cWe are also funding important biomedical research that will hopefully lead to the development of drugs and treatments that can halt or even reverse the condition,\u201d added Wilcock. \u201cFor good measure, we put pressure on the NHS to ensure it provides proper care for patients and families, and we have played a major role in helping to remove the stigma that was once associated with dementia.\u201d It is thought there are about 850,000 people with dementia in the UK. The vast majority have Alzheimer\u2019s, while about 150,000 have vascular dementia. In addition, there are other less common forms, such as frontotemporal dementia. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society exists to support people with all forms of the condition. A crucial, and cruel, feature of dementia is its impact on families and carers. As Doyle wrote, presciently, in her feature: \u201cFor close relatives and friends, the suffering is probably greater than for the victim, who is commonly unaware of his or her condition and often content in a childlike way.\u201d There was no support for carers in 1979. Today, the impact of the disease on families and partners is well understood, and the society exists to press the NHS to provide full support. \u201cWe don\u2019t have seamless provision of social care and medical treatment for the condition as yet but it is something that we are urgently pursuing,\u201d said Wilcock. \u201cWe need a society in which people do not have to sell their houses to ensure they get care when they start to show symptoms of dementia but at least there is an awareness of dementia today that was lacking 40 years ago. We know what we have to do.\u201d In addition, breakthroughs have been made in understanding the causes of Alzheimer\u2019s, although new drugs to combat the condition remain elusive. Last week, US company Biogen revealed it was seeking regulatory approval to licence the drug aducanumab to treat early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. Wilcock remains cautious, pointing out that the drug had failed previous trials. \u201cReally, we need more government commitment to the development of drugs to treat dementia. At present, it gives about \u00a385m a year. We need three times that amount. That would bring dementia research to a level where it gets the same as cancer research. Many cancers are treatable today but people living with dementia have nothing.\u201d This point is backed up by Kayman, who is 85 now and is still closely involved in the work of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. \u201cUltimately, we are not looking at something that will merely alleviate dementia,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cWe are looking for a cure.\u201d",

But over the decades, hundreds of thousands of war dead who served Britain in the first world war have been written out of the story. Both the first and last shots in that war were fired not on the western front but in Africa, where British and German empires fought for colonial territories.</p> <p>In addition to soldiers, Britain recruited an army of porters to carry ammunition and supplies to the front line. Conditions were appalling and many faced what amounted to a death march. It was an operation of such a scale that, to this day, former mustering points in Kenya and Tanzania are known as Kariakoo after the Carrier Corps.</p> <p>Antonny Wachira Kimani is the caretaker for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/epitaphs-for-first-world-war-fallen-offer-glimpse-of-unprecedented-loss\" title=\"\">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> (CWGC) cemetery in Voi in southern Kenya, maintaining rows of graves near hills that lead south towards Tanzania. Paying my respects to the fallen, I read names of British captains and corporals who died far from home. I ask Kimani where the bodies of the Africans are buried. He points beyond the perimeter fence of the immaculately kept grounds into the bush, where homeless locals sometimes sleep in the undergrowth and dogs pee among rubbish.</p> <p>Official records put the death toll of the Africans who served Britain in the East Africa campaign at around 100,000, but many historians estimate it at up to three times that. Kimani shows me where some of them lie. Outside the fence. No names, no graves, no dignity.</p> <p>But this is not the result of Kimani neglecting his duties but of a political decision taken thousands of miles away at the highest levels of the British establishment. I had to accept that one of the British institutions I always admired, the CWGC, was hiding a scandal.</p> <p>A letter uncovered in the commission\u2019s archives, from the early 1920s, shows the rationale of those who decreed this morbid form of apartheid. It is written by the colonial secretary to the governors of the British protectorates, explaining policy that applied to the burial of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/how-colonial-violence-came-home-the-ugly-truth-of-the-first-world-war\" title=\"\">\u201cnatives\u201d who had served Britain</a>. Unlike memorials to those who died in Europe or were white, \u201cthe commission would not erect individual headstones but a central memorial in some suitable locality to be selected by the [British colonial] government concerned\u201d. The letter writer knew the policy well. He was the former secretary of state for war and chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission. He concludes: \u201cI have the honour to be, sir, your most obedient humble servant, Winston S Churchill\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2db37fcd443bda30f8f26fddd40cf0fcbac360e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2db37fcd443bda30f8f26fddd40cf0fcbac360e3/0_95_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mwamkono Mwavaka and his wife in their garden in Kenya.

His grandfather, who died in the first world war, has no known grave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uplands TV/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His letter was found among bundles of incriminating documents in the archives of the CWGC, thanks to the determination of Prof Mich\u00e8le Barrett of Queen Mary University of London, an expert on the history of dehumanisation. \u201cFor a long time, the War Graves Commission claimed to have acted with complete equality, and they didn\u2019t,\u201d Barrett explains. She has 15 years of research to back up her claims, much of it conducted in a clandestine way in the CWGC\u2019s own archives. A decade or more ago she sent the commission an article she had published, inviting it to collaborate with her on further funded research. The response was silence. </p> <p>Perhaps the CWGC had been sold the same fictitious version of history as I had. As a teenager, I visited the battlefields of the western front, then moved on to the cemeteries where Britain commemorates the bloody conflict. The Americans repatriate the bodies of their \u201cfallen\u201d, but Britain realised during the first world war that to do so would be an impractical and morale-lowering undertaking. So instead, the then Imperial War Graves Commission buried the men near where they died, with individual graves, according to the principle that \u201cevery one regardless of their rank or position in civil life shall be treated with equality\u201d. When Barrett discovered that this was mainly a western front policy and didn\u2019t apply to Africans, she resolved to call it out.</p> <p>In a CWGC document, African soldiers and carriers are referred to as \u201csemi-savage\u201d. Another suggests \u201cthey are hardly in such a state of civilisation as to appreciate such a memorial\u201d and \u201cthe erection of individual memorials would represent a waste of public money\u201d. So across East Africa there are just three memorials to all of those who died, in Nairobi, Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. I reached one by clambering over a chain fence in the middle of a busy roundabout. On it is the silky verse of Kipling, \u201cEven if you die, your sons will remember your name\u201d.</p> <p>Barrett\u2019s detective work led us to some wasteland. She had found references to \u201cvast Carrier Corps cemeteries\u201d in Dar es Salaam. We were standing in one. It was entirely unmarked; no plaque, let alone a gravestone, was anywhere in sight. Beneath our feet were as many as 10,000 Africans who had served Britain. Unremembered.</p> <p>A memo of a meeting between the War Graves Commission and the British colonial governor recorded: \u201c[He] did not care to contemplate the statistics of the native African lives lost in trying to overcome the transportation difficulties of the campaign in East Africa.\u201d Appallingly, it adds that Carrier Corps cemeteries \u201cshould be allowed to revert to nature as soon as possible\u201d. That\u2019s how this happened. Even today, across the world, great care is taken to track down, identify and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/first-world-wars-pompeii-burial-for-british-soldiers-found-in-flemish-field\" title=\"\">bury British war dead</a>. This month there will be more new burial services by the commission for recently discovered bodies. But not in Africa.</p> <p>I showed Nairobi university students photographs of African soldiers and carriers from the first world war and also the manicured cemeteries for Europeans and those few Africans deemed worthy of commemoration because they were believed to be Christian. In the classroom there was bitterness. \u201cThese were brothers, uncles, fathers,\u201d one student said. </p> <p>The CWGC took part in the documentary I\u2019m presenting for Channel 4. I met the director general, Victoria Wallace, who acknowledged that in the past the commission did not act with the kind of equality you would want to see today. </p> <p>This needs to be put right, with archives scoured for names. Also the CWGC needs to start telling the story of why so many of those who served Britain are not named and not remembered as <em>individuals</em>.</p> <p>I think the commission should start by looking at what Prof Barrett tried to insist on more than a decade ago.

      "bodyText": "Next week marks the centenary of the first Remembrance Sunday. But over the decades, hundreds of thousands of war dead who served Britain in the first world war have been written out of the story. Both the first and last shots in that war were fired not on the western front but in Africa, where British and German empires fought for colonial territories. In addition to soldiers, Britain recruited an army of porters to carry ammunition and supplies to the front line. Conditions were appalling and many faced what amounted to a death march. It was an operation of such a scale that, to this day, former mustering points in Kenya and Tanzania are known as Kariakoo after the Carrier Corps. Antonny Wachira Kimani is the caretaker for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) cemetery in Voi in southern Kenya, maintaining rows of graves near hills that lead south towards Tanzania. Paying my respects to the fallen, I read names of British captains and corporals who died far from home. I ask Kimani where the bodies of the Africans are buried. He points beyond the perimeter fence of the immaculately kept grounds into the bush, where homeless locals sometimes sleep in the undergrowth and dogs pee among rubbish. Official records put the death toll of the Africans who served Britain in the East Africa campaign at around 100,000, but many historians estimate it at up to three times that. Kimani shows me where some of them lie. Outside the fence. No names, no graves, no dignity. But this is not the result of Kimani neglecting his duties but of a political decision taken thousands of miles away at the highest levels of the British establishment. I had to accept that one of the British institutions I always admired, the CWGC, was hiding a scandal. A letter uncovered in the commission\u2019s archives, from the early 1920s, shows the rationale of those who decreed this morbid form of apartheid. It is written by the colonial secretary to the governors of the British protectorates, explaining policy that applied to the burial of \u201cnatives\u201d who had served Britain. Unlike memorials to those who died in Europe or were white, \u201cthe commission would not erect individual headstones but a central memorial in some suitable locality to be selected by the [British colonial] government concerned\u201d. The letter writer knew the policy well. He was the former secretary of state for war and chairman of the Imperial War Graves Commission. He concludes: \u201cI have the honour to be, sir, your most obedient humble servant, Winston S Churchill\u201d. His letter was found among bundles of incriminating documents in the archives of the CWGC, thanks to the determination of Prof Mich\u00e8le Barrett of Queen Mary University of London, an expert on the history of dehumanisation. \u201cFor a long time, the War Graves Commission claimed to have acted with complete equality, and they didn\u2019t,\u201d Barrett explains. She has 15 years of research to back up her claims, much of it conducted in a clandestine way in the CWGC\u2019s own archives. A decade or more ago she sent the commission an article she had published, inviting it to collaborate with her on further funded research. The response was silence. Perhaps the CWGC had been sold the same fictitious version of history as I had. As a teenager, I visited the battlefields of the western front, then moved on to the cemeteries where Britain commemorates the bloody conflict. The Americans repatriate the bodies of their \u201cfallen\u201d, but Britain realised during the first world war that to do so would be an impractical and morale-lowering undertaking. So instead, the then Imperial War Graves Commission buried the men near where they died, with individual graves, according to the principle that \u201cevery one regardless of their rank or position in civil life shall be treated with equality\u201d. When Barrett discovered that this was mainly a western front policy and didn\u2019t apply to Africans, she resolved to call it out. In a CWGC document, African soldiers and carriers are referred to as \u201csemi-savage\u201d. Another suggests \u201cthey are hardly in such a state of civilisation as to appreciate such a memorial\u201d and \u201cthe erection of individual memorials would represent a waste of public money\u201d. So across East Africa there are just three memorials to all of those who died, in Nairobi, Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. I reached one by clambering over a chain fence in the middle of a busy roundabout. On it is the silky verse of Kipling, \u201cEven if you die, your sons will remember your name\u201d. Barrett\u2019s detective work led us to some wasteland. She had found references to \u201cvast Carrier Corps cemeteries\u201d in Dar es Salaam. We were standing in one. It was entirely unmarked; no plaque, let alone a gravestone, was anywhere in sight. Beneath our feet were as many as 10,000 Africans who had served Britain. Unremembered. A memo of a meeting between the War Graves Commission and the British colonial governor recorded: \u201c[He] did not care to contemplate the statistics of the native African lives lost in trying to overcome the transportation difficulties of the campaign in East Africa.\u201d Appallingly, it adds that Carrier Corps cemeteries \u201cshould be allowed to revert to nature as soon as possible\u201d. That\u2019s how this happened. Even today, across the world, great care is taken to track down, identify and bury British war dead. This month there will be more new burial services by the commission for recently discovered bodies. But not in Africa. I showed Nairobi university students photographs of African soldiers and carriers from the first world war and also the manicured cemeteries for Europeans and those few Africans deemed worthy of commemoration because they were believed to be Christian. In the classroom there was bitterness. \u201cThese were brothers, uncles, fathers,\u201d one student said. The CWGC took part in the documentary I\u2019m presenting for Channel 4. I met the director general, Victoria Wallace, who acknowledged that in the past the commission did not act with the kind of equality you would want to see today. This needs to be put right, with archives scoured for names. Also the CWGC needs to start telling the story of why so many of those who served Britain are not named and not remembered as individuals. I think the commission should start by looking at what Prof Barrett tried to insist on more than a decade ago. I\u2019m calling for it to establish a formal group. As well as officials from the CWGC, this should include the defence secretary and representatives from the British armed forces and from Kenya, Tanzania and other former colonies. This is the model that institutions looking to decolonise their past have embraced \u2013 accepting that the present must deal with this legacy. In a year\u2019s time, I don\u2019t think the CWGC website should be telling us that it has always held up a policy of equality. Because when it comes to Africa, that simply isn\u2019t the case. This is a story that forces us in Britain to rethink our deeply held traditions that come to the front of our minds this week and still have the power to affect our national mood, including the capacity to soothe, even momentarily, the chaos and fractures of Brexit Britain. We can\u2019t say that we remember all our war dead with honour and dignity and yet exclude a third of a million people who died in their own continent serving Britain.

Her case follows the Carrie Gracie dispute, which eventually led to some female presenters, such as Sarah Montague and Jane Garvey, rightly getting their salaries upped. But this is not the only example of incompetent handling of money matters by the BBC. For more than two-and-a-half years, hundreds of radio presenters, from some of the biggest names to those on local stations, have been arguing about pay and contracts.</p> <p>This follows the corporation telling them to abandon being set up as \u201ccompanies\u201d for receiving their wages, a wheeze that the BBC had earlier requested so it could avoid paying national insurance contributions.

      "bodyText": "Who would turn down the chance to exhibit historical treasures just dug up in north-west Turkey? Well, the British Museum did in the 1870s. The collection went instead to the new kid on the block, the V&amp;A. Now the BM is making amends with more than 300 remarkable items in Troy: Myth and Reality, opening on 21 November. Quite a few come from the museum itself, with others on loan from around the world, including Berlin, which holds many objects unearthed by the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann nearly 150 years ago. Troy was of course made famous by Homer and Virgil\u2019s heroic stories of Helen, Paris and the wooden horse. It was a great yarn. But Schliemann was a brilliant spin doctor, claiming his objects actually belonged to these, well, fictional characters, to ensure that his discoveries, themselves genuinely ancient, fitted his desired narrative. The BM exhibition will kick off with the myth of Troy before telling the story of Schliemann\u2019s excavation and, finally, the cultural legacy of characters such as Helen. And the horse? Well the BM is constructing its own, a skeleton-like beast through which the public can walk. But there will be a rival. The BP or Not BP? protest organisation, furious as ever about sponsorship by the oil giant, are crowdfunding their own Trojan horse. Maybe to be parked, like some proverbial tank, outside the museum? BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed last week began an equal pay fight at an employment tribunal. Her case follows the Carrie Gracie dispute, which eventually led to some female presenters, such as Sarah Montague and Jane Garvey, rightly getting their salaries upped. But this is not the only example of incompetent handling of money matters by the BBC. For more than two-and-a-half years, hundreds of radio presenters, from some of the biggest names to those on local stations, have been arguing about pay and contracts. This follows the corporation telling them to abandon being set up as \u201ccompanies\u201d for receiving their wages, a wheeze that the BBC had earlier requested so it could avoid paying national insurance contributions. The Inland Revenue was not amused when it found out. Now the BBC wants to give these presenters so-called worker contracts, taxed at source but without benefits such as holiday and sick pay. The money on offer is also often lower than before. It\u2019s yet another example of the BBC\u2019s bad management, like last month\u2019s Naga Munchetty case, which should urgently be addressed by its board. But its government-appointed chairman, David Clementi, a City banker, is known for near-invisibility and not wishing to rock the boat. Opening on 7 November in Belfast is Abomination: A DUP Opera, inspired by a radio interview a decade ago with former DUP politician Iris Robinson, who called homosexuality \u201can abomination\u201d. The opera, a co-production between the Belfast Ensemble and Outburst Arts, opens the 2019 Outburst Queer Arts festival, now in its 13th year. The law may have just been changed to allow same sex marriage, but this opera is a reminder that some of Northern Ireland remains stuck in a time warp of prejudice.",

With Rafael M\u00e1rquez, Dani Alves and \u00c9ric Abidal unavailable, and where every other human would have played Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres or Marc Muniesa \u2013 both centre-backs \u2013 at centre-back, Guardiola picked Yaya Tour\u00e9, a midfielder, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/27/manchester-united-barcelona-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">Manchester United were beaten 2-0</a>.</p> <p>When Tour\u00e9 departed in 2010, Guardiola replaced him with Javier Mascherano, whom he soon relocated to defence. The attraction was clear: players who pass quickly start attacks quickly and, in football as in all sports, speed kills. Sure enough, Bar\u00e7a won their third consecutive league title, then produced one of the most dominant big-game performances in history to humiliate United in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/28/barcelona-manchester-united-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">the 2011 Champions League final</a>.</p> <p>In 2013 Guardiola took over at Bayern Munich. Immediately he moved Javi Mart\u00ednez back into defence, and again won three consecutive league titles as well as two cups. But in Europe his team were undressed by Real Madrid and Barcelona, conceding five times against each, before being edged by the underdogs of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.</p> <p>At Manchester City things have continued in a similar vein: Guardiola has bought defenders and goalkeepers on account of their creative capacity, delivering two titles, various cups and numerous records. But in Europe, where the pressure is higher and margin for error lower, this approach has cost them. City have been eliminated by markedly inferior teams in three consecutive seasons despite being Europe\u2019s best side \u2013 by far \u2013 in two of them.</p> <p>In such a context it has become clich\u00e9 to observe that Guardiola has not won the Champions League without the genius of Lionel Messi, but that is a fact, not a truth. In 2009 and 2011 United\u2019s attack could have comprised Messi, Maradona and Yahweh himself and they would still have lost, because they could not get the ball off Sergio Busquets, Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta in midfield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335d70ef1c6cd50e890962f90e3e6b026a1e0897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335d70ef1c6cd50e890962f90e3e6b026a1e0897/0_74_2547_1528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi and Barcelona hit the heights in the 2011 Champions League final against Manchester United.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Messi and Barcelona hit the heights in the 2011 Champions League final against Manchester United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Juinen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without Messi but with that trio Spain won the World Cup and European Championship without conceding a knockout goal; with Messi but without that trio Argentina won nothing. It is an imperfect proof, granted, but it is unarguable that there had been nothing like them before, there is nothing like them now and there will never be anything like them again. Yet Guardiola, who knows this better than anyone, has nonetheless refused to recalibrate his method.</p> <p>Whether at work, in love or on a night out, we have all experienced the blinding thrill of monomania and know far too well how football consumes a person, so Guardiola\u2019s intractability is not hard to grasp. When he joined Barcelona at 13 he was indoctrinated into an implacable and glorious ethic, then lived it daily as a player before coaching some of the greatest talents of all time into probably the greatest team of all time. How could he possibly aim lower thereafter?</p> <p>But it is not just about tactics. Guardiola drills fast, agile, impressionable teams to the point of automation, which explains the murderous beatings and unparalleled points tallies: their best is the best, so when things go well no opponent can keep up. But when they do not \u2013 when circumstance forces his players to work things out for themselves and on the hoof \u2013 they are capable of collapse.</p> <p>Against Liverpool in 2018 City conceded three goals in nine minutes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/14/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in the league</a> and three goals in 19 minutes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/04/liverpool-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">in the Champions League</a>; against Manchester United, seeking to clinch that season\u2019s league title against their local rivals, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">conceded three goals in 16 minutes</a>; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/17/manchester-city-tottenham-hotspur-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">against Spurs in last season\u2019s Champions League</a> they conceded twice in three minutes. This is partly down to inadequate defending but also reflects the absence of bloody-minded bastards, men who can be harnessed but never controlled.</p> <p>Over the past decade Guardiola has fallen out with Tour\u00e9, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto\u2019o and, though there are on-pitch justifications for that, attitude and personality are common factors. There is an emotional criticism to be made here \u2013 the clinical perfection of Guardiola\u2019s teams does not move those who like their football hot not cold \u2013 but a practical one too. Winning teams tend to incorporate a range of personalities, which helps them deal with the range of eventualities that can unfold during the course of a chaotic competition. Had Guardiola compromised his ideals just slightly, he might have been even more successful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/02/manchester-city-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kyle Walker sink brave Southampton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Part of him appreciates this point; during last season\u2019s run-in, he relied on Vincent Kompany, his strongest character. But when Kompany left in the summer, rather than replace him, Guardiola spent his budget on Rodri \u2013 another skilful, clever, coachable midfielder he could not bear to be without.</p> <p>Ultimately Guardiola will not change because to him his style of football is not simply a style of football but something more profound: a religious imperative and moral standard that represents where he is from, what he has done and who he is. Which might help explain why Tito Vilanova, when he had cancer, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/barcelona-feud-tito-vilanova-says-pep-guardiola-wasnt-there-for-me-8711309.html\" title=\"\">felt Guardiola was not enough of a friend</a>; why, after three years competing against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Guardiola was so exhausted he needed a sabbatical; how he can preach the righteousness of Catalan independence but work for human rights abusers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/25/guardiola-defends-bernardo-silva-mendy-tweet-fa-manchester-city\" title=\"\">defend Bernardo Silva\u2019s Twitter post</a>.

In 2009 and 2011 United\u2019s attack could have comprised Messi, Maradona and Yahweh himself and they would still have lost, because they could not get the ball off Sergio Busquets, Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta in midfield. Without Messi but with that trio Spain won the World Cup and European Championship without conceding a knockout goal; with Messi but without that trio Argentina won nothing. It is an imperfect proof, granted, but it is unarguable that there had been nothing like them before, there is nothing like them now and there will never be anything like them again. Yet Guardiola, who knows this better than anyone, has nonetheless refused to recalibrate his method. Whether at work, in love or on a night out, we have all experienced the blinding thrill of monomania and know far too well how football consumes a person, so Guardiola\u2019s intractability is not hard to grasp. When he joined Barcelona at 13 he was indoctrinated into an implacable and glorious ethic, then lived it daily as a player before coaching some of the greatest talents of all time into probably the greatest team of all time. How could he possibly aim lower thereafter? But it is not just about tactics. Guardiola drills fast, agile, impressionable teams to the point of automation, which explains the murderous beatings and unparalleled points tallies: their best is the best, so when things go well no opponent can keep up. But when they do not \u2013 when circumstance forces his players to work things out for themselves and on the hoof \u2013 they are capable of collapse. Against Liverpool in 2018 City conceded three goals in nine minutes in the league and three goals in 19 minutes in the Champions League; against Manchester United, seeking to clinch that season\u2019s league title against their local rivals, they conceded three goals in 16 minutes; and against Spurs in last season\u2019s Champions League they conceded twice in three minutes. This is partly down to inadequate defending but also reflects the absence of bloody-minded bastards, men who can be harnessed but never controlled. Over the past decade Guardiola has fallen out with Tour\u00e9, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto\u2019o and, though there are on-pitch justifications for that, attitude and personality are common factors. There is an emotional criticism to be made here \u2013 the clinical perfection of Guardiola\u2019s teams does not move those who like their football hot not cold \u2013 but a practical one too. Winning teams tend to incorporate a range of personalities, which helps them deal with the range of eventualities that can unfold during the course of a chaotic competition. Had Guardiola compromised his ideals just slightly, he might have been even more successful. Part of him appreciates this point; during last season\u2019s run-in, he relied on Vincent Kompany, his strongest character. But when Kompany left in the summer, rather than replace him, Guardiola spent his budget on Rodri \u2013 another skilful, clever, coachable midfielder he could not bear to be without. Ultimately Guardiola will not change because to him his style of football is not simply a style of football but something more profound: a religious imperative and moral standard that represents where he is from, what he has done and who he is. Which might help explain why Tito Vilanova, when he had cancer, felt Guardiola was not enough of a friend; why, after three years competing against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Guardiola was so exhausted he needed a sabbatical; how he can preach the righteousness of Catalan independence but work for human rights abusers and defend Bernardo Silva\u2019s Twitter post. For Pep Guardiola everything \u2013 everything \u2013 must bow to the glory of Pep Guardiola\u2019s football, for good and for bad.",

      "bodyText": "Dubliners know the Georgian townhouse on the Liffey quays by a macabre-sounding nickname: the House of the Dead. In fact it is \u2013 or was thought to be \u2013 immortal, left forever as the setting of James Joyce\u2019s The Dead, a masterpiece considered one of the greatest short stories in the English language. In the 1890s the writer\u2019s maternal great-aunts ran a music school at the four-storey house, 15 Usher\u2019s Island, and hosted Christmas parties that Joyce used as the scene for the story, a meditation on love, loss and identity. Evergreen themes, it turns out, because last week city authorities announced a plan to turn the House of the Dead into a 54-room hostel, prompting an outcry that property deals were trashing culture and zombifying Ireland\u2019s capital to make way for foreign tourists, students and tech workers. \u201cIt\u2019s a great travesty,\u201d said PJ Murphy, who runs Sweny\u2019s, a former pharmacy that features in another Joyce masterwork, Ulysses, and is now a museum trust lined with Joyce tomes. \u201cIt should remain a place to visit by people who have read Joyce. To turn it into a hostel is a great tragedy.\u201d Artists, academics and others echoed the sentiment. \u201cDublin can build all the hotel/hostel rooms it likes, but if it continues to disregard and demolish its unique cultural heritage it will obliterate what remains of the heart of the city and there will be little left for visitors or indeed for Dubliners themselves to appreciate,\u201d John McCourt, a professor of English literature, wrote in the Irish Times. \u201cThese endless hostels and hotels are symptoms of a whiskey and leprechaun version of Ireland \u2026 which ignores climate change and the need to appeal to locals as well as those arriving, shamrock-eyed, via long-haul flights,\u201d tweeted novelist Paula McGrath. The row is the latest twist in a venerable debate about the nurturing \u2013 and crushing \u2013 of art. Joyce himself framed it best: \u201cIreland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\u201d The line, uttered by his alter ego Stephen Dedalus in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, alluded to the parochialism and spiritual impoverishment that prompted Joyce\u2019s self-exile to continental Europe in 1904. More than a century later, Ireland is culturally unrecognisable \u2013 tolerant, open, ethnically diverse. But artists \u2013 and artistic legacy \u2013 now face a threat from hotels, hostels and offices that are popping up like toast across Dublin. Each month seems to augur fresh expansions by Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and other tech giants that have their European headquarters here. More than 80 new hotel projects with names like Aloft, Central, Hyatt, Grafton, Hard Rock, Iveagh Garden, Marlin, Mayson, Radisson and Wetherspoon are at various stages of development. The influx has brought jobs and money but also increased the cost of living. This has worsened a homelessness crisis \u2013 3,873 children are in emergency accommodation in Ireland, it emerged last week, the state\u2019s highest ever level \u2013 and forced musicians, writers and other creatives to leave. Others, like Stephen James Smith, Dublin\u2019s unofficial poet laureate, survive by couch-surfing. Bohemian musical venues are shutting, unable to pay rents, a trend replicated in San Francisco. The County Wicklow musician Hozier was among the many who mourned the closure of the Bernard Shaw pub. Dublin city councillors recently voted to cap new hotels to halt the \u201cincreasing erosion of cultural life and space\u201d. The vote has questionable legal and political force. The council and the Office of Public Work, after all, had ample opportunity to buy the protected property that Joyce called the \u201cdark gaunt house on Usher\u2019s Island\u201d when it came on the market two years ago. They didn\u2019t. Instead two private investors, Fergus McCabe and Brian Stynes, snapped it up for \u20ac650,000 (\u00a3560,000). According to an official notice posted outside the gate last week they now seek planning permission to turn it into a 54-room hostel with a cafe. Not everyone is horrified. Eugene Lewan, a tourist from Washington state, reckoned the business could respect the legacy. \u201cIf the hostel was themed around Joyce that might be OK.\u201d All the cries of cultural vandalism, of defilement of literature\u2019s great temple, cloud a melancholy fact: the building is already vandalised, already defiled, victim of a century of neglect. Built in about 1775 on the south bank of the Liffey for a grain merchant, Joshua Pim, the structure is largely unchanged from the time Joyce\u2019s great-aunts occupied it. Publication of The Dead in 1914 \u2013 included in the short story collection Dubliners \u2013 made the house famous. But it fell into disuse and decay, its roof broken, its interiors ravaged by squatters, the whole building almost destroyed by fire in the mid-1990s. A Joyce-loving barrister, Brendan Kilty, bought and tried to rescue it. He refurbished the ground floor, restored period decor, hosted literary events and reenacted the Christmas dinner scene, only to end up filing for bankruptcy and selling the property in 2017. When the Observer visited last week there was nothing to indicate the building\u2019s significance, not even a plaque. It looked abandoned: there was litter outside, weeds clogging the basement steps, the windows grubby, the facade chipped and peeling \u2013 a sad version of the elegant home featured in the 1987 film version of The Dead directed by John Huston. Neighbouring buildings have fared little better. This is a rundown part of Dublin you don\u2019t see on postcards. Last week two Italian tourists were mugged at gunpoint up the road. \u201cThe amount of Americans that come here looking for the Joyce house \u2013 I tell them it\u2019s the derelict looking one with weeds,\u201d said Mark Farrell, 53, who runs a nearby scooter rental business. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rack and ruin.

      "body": "<p>The Conservative party is Britain\u2019s oldest and most successful political party. It has been the party of the land but also the party of the city; the party of little England and the party of empire; the party of protectionism and the party of the free market; the nasty party and the party of gay marriage; the party of Europe and the party of Brexit.</p> <p>The list of its many mutations is a long one. But will the election of 2019 be the final act in reshaping the Conservative party as an English nationalist Brexit party? The pro-European strand that used to dominate the party has lost the civil war, and many of them are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/amber-rudd-to-step-down-as-mp\" title=\"\">stepping down as MPs</a>. Some have joined other parties. After the 2019 election there will be very few pro-European one-nation Conservatives left in the cabinet or in the parliamentary party, and many fewer women.</p> <p>Conservatives dreaded the coming of universal suffrage and often fought against it. But in the 101 years since democracy was conceded the Conservatives have governed either alone or in coalition for two-thirds of them. To do that they have always had to draw much of their support from working-class voters.</p> <p>Opponents have often wondered why the party has been so successful, in marked contrast to many other parties of the European centre-right. How has this party of property and privilege won so many elections?</p> <p>Part of the answer lies in the ability of the party to reinvent itself, not to allow itself to get stuck in a ditch, always to be pragmatic and flexible. This has meant giving priority to statecraft and the pursuit of power rather than to ideology. As Trollope remarked about the 19th-century Tory party (he might have been writing about Boris Johnson): \u201cNo reform, no innovation \u2026 no revolution stinks so foully in the nostrils of an English Tory as to be absolutely irreconcilable to him. When taken in the refreshing waters of office any such pill can be swallowed.\u201d</p> <p>The classic Tory one-nation formula for government was set out by Disraeli when he said at Crystal Palace in 1872 that the three great objects of the Conservative party were to maintain the institutions of the country, to uphold the empire of England, and to elevate the condition of the people. How best to do this and build an electoral coalition sufficient to keep the Conservatives in government has always preoccupied Conservative leaders.</p> <p>Now Boris Johnson has the election he wanted, he cannot afford to repeat the experience of 2017 when the Conservatives threw away their poll lead and lost their majority. Johnson needs a decisive victory to secure his leadership and crush his opponents. He dreams of governing for a decade, but this means gaining a majority for the Conservatives in excess of 50 seats. The last time the Conservatives won such a majority was in 1987, the third of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s emphatic wins. Since 2010 the Conservatives have fought three elections, but only won an outright majority once, in 2015, and then a small one. Johnson wants to win big, and is happy taking risks and creating chaos, reshaping the Conservative party and British politics as he does so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b90f3fc19324a4cbbab992f14ee780a4c5a51d82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b90f3fc19324a4cbbab992f14ee780a4c5a51d82/106_133_1957_2917/671.jpg\" alt=\"Macmillan won the general election in 1959 by adapting to the Labour postwar settlement.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harold Macmillan won the general election in 1959 by adapting to the Labour postwar settlement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Conservative Party Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson\u2019s aim in this election of persuading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/02/workington-man-cumbria-brexit-labour-bellwether-town-general-election\" title=\"\">Leave voters in northern working-class Labour seats</a> to vote Conservative is not a new problem, even if the context created by Brexit is new. It has been what the Conservatives have always had to do. The dominant party of the 20th century was built around the pillars of union, empire, the rule of law, property and welfare. Conservatives were traditionally the party of the establishment, the crown, the aristocracy, the armed services and the police, the law, the church, the public schools, Oxford and Cambridge. They supported the empire and the union, protectionism against free trade, the gradual improvement of welfare services, and state intervention when necessary to protect citizens from hardship.</p> <p>This tradition of pragmatic one-nation Conservatism was associated with Baldwin and Chamberlain in the 1930s, and then with Churchill, Eden and Macmillan in the 1950s. Edward Heath tried to continue it, but his government suffered a spectacular shipwreck and in the ensuing chaos Margaret Thatcher seized the leadership in 1975. She was responsible for another hugely significant reinvention of the Conservatives as the party of the free market, ending its interventionist and collectivist Chamberlainite tradition.</p> <p>Thatcher\u2019s legacy has been mixed for the Conservative party. She transformed its electoral and governing fortunes, allowing the Conservatives to win four elections and rule for 18 years. She broke the Labour postwar settlement that most Conservatives had come to accept, and many of its institutional bases, and set the UK political economy on a new path.</p> <p>But the way she governed ultimately undermined many of the pillars that had supported Conservatism for so long, and paved the way for Labour\u2019s longest-ever period in government, under Tony Blair. Her social background and her gender made Thatcher an outsider in the party, and even when prime minister she still thought of herself as an outsider fighting against the government and the establishment. This populist (and very un-Conservative) pose of being anti-establishment and for the people against the \u201celites\u201d is one which Brexiters, including Johnson, have tried to copy, not very convincingly. It is hard to pose as an outsider when you have been educated at Eton.</p> <p>In forging her new electoral coalition Thatcher lost an older one. The Conservative and Unionist party used to be able to claim that it represented all parts of the country. It won a majority of the seats and more than 50% of the vote in Scotland in 1955. It had a significant presence in all the big industrial cities, and for a long time dominated the politics of Birmingham and Liverpool. But all that has gone. Conservative support collapsed in Scotland (in 1997 the party failed to win a single seat) and also in northern cities. Thatcher bequeathed a party which had become predominantly an English party, its vote disproportionately concentrated in the south and south-east.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4857a065017a44368c499f9a341f69ccd8595b71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4857a065017a44368c499f9a341f69ccd8595b71/90_222_3558_4447/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ted Heath\u2019s \u2018who governs Britain?\u2019 election in 1974 backfired spectacularly and heralded the end of the one-nation tradition.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ted Heath\u2019s \u2018who governs Britain?\u2019 election in 1974 backfired spectacularly and heralded the end of the one-nation tradition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time the party stopped being a mass-membership organisation. Those members that remain are disproportionately elderly, white and middle-class, unrepresentative either of Conservative voters or of the wider electorate, and are not being replaced by the recruitment of sufficient younger voters. At the beginning of 2019 official membership had dropped to about 120,000. This figure rose to 180,000 just before the party leadership election held last July, due largely, according to the Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks, to the enrolment of Brexit party members, anxious to make sure a Leaver was elected.</p> <p>The small size of the membership makes the party vulnerable to such entryism. When the Conservatives did have a mass membership, the members had no role in choosing the leader, something they only acquired in 2001. There are now many constituencies where there are hardly any Conservative members at all.</p> <p>Since Thatcher was ousted, members have often been out of step with the party leadership, particularly on Europe. Under John Major two-thirds of the parliamentary party were pro-Europe, one third anti-Europe. In the constituencies it was the other way round. Iain Duncan Smith defeated Kenneth Clarke for the leadership in 2001 because of Clarke\u2019s pro-European views. Boris Johnson always calculated that, as long as he could get to the membership stage of the leadership ballot, the anti-EU credentials he had honed over many years would carry him to victory. The membership has also had an increasing hand in deciding the shape of the parliamentary party by selecting anti-EU candidates.</p> <p>This was one front in the civil war that has raged in the party over Europe for six decades, but which became particularly virulent in the 1990s at the time of the passage of the Maastricht treaty (founding the EU), and again under David Cameron and Theresa May.</p> <p>This great schism, which now has on one side John Major, Michael Heseltine, Kenneth Clarke, Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond, and on the other Norman Tebbit, Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel, has become unbridgeable. When he was prime minister, Major withdrew the whip from nine of the Maastricht rebels because they were making his task of governing impossible, but later relented.</p> <p>Theresa May never did the same for the European Research Group rebels who refused to pass her withdrawal agreement, because of her unwillingness to split her party. Boris Johnson chose differently. In expelling 21 MPs, including two former chancellors, in September, Johnson signalled that he was happy for a formal split to take place and that only those in favour of a hard Brexit were welcome in the party.</p> <p>Europe is the third great major schism in the history of the Conservative party over Britain\u2019s place in the world. The first was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/07/tories-face-a-corn-law-moment-but-catharsis-is-nowhere-in-sight\" title=\"\">1846, when Robert Peel repealed the Corn Laws</a> with the support of opposition MPs. Two-thirds of his own MPs voted against him. The Conservative party lost the battle on free trade and did not form a majority government for almost 30 years.</p> <p>A second great schism took place at the start of the 20th century over free trade and tariff reform. The Conservatives became the party of tariff reform, seeking to transform the far-flung British empire into a cohesive economic bloc to rival the continental empires of Germany and the United States. Conservative MPs who did not support reform were purged by their constituencies. Winston Churchill crossed the floor of the house and joined the Liberals. By 1910 there were very few supporters of free trade and liberal imperialism left in the Conservative party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78bc53fc4952076f0bdee4d9fe1e2b78e228e508\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78bc53fc4952076f0bdee4d9fe1e2b78e228e508/0_172_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 2016 referendum has dragged the party\u2019s civil war over Europe into its closing stages.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 2016 referendum has dragged the party\u2019s civil war over Europe into its closing stages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1960s, with the end of empire approaching, the Conservative party pivoted to become the party of Europe. Harold Macmillan saw the pooling of sovereignty in Europe and the economic and political cooperation it made possible as the new framework that would give Britain influence, security and prosperity.</p> <p>But the decision was always contested, and the opposition never entirely went away, even after Britain successfully signed the Treaty of Rome and joined the community in 1973, and after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/25/britains-1975-europe-referendum-what-was-it-like-last-time\" title=\"\">1975 referendum</a> confirmed that decision with a two-to-one majority. Under Thatcher the leadership became divided over the desirability of further integration. Thatcher herself was the architect of one of the most far-reaching acts of integration, the single market, but she balked at the further stages of integration that were planned, especially the idea of a social Europe.</p> <p>This ignited the civil war which is only now nearing its end. In the course of it the Conservative party has been transformed. As Duncan Smith said last week: \u201cThe Tory party is now the Brexit party.\u201d There is no room for Remainers in its ranks. Long vilified by the Conservative press as traitors and wreckers, it is time for them to depart. <em>Daily Telegraph</em> columnists have been repeatedly calling for a purge, and the exodus is gathering pace.</p> <p>Johnson won the referendum and then the leadership by siding firmly with the Brexiters in the party, and has reshaped the cabinet and the parliamentary party accordingly. The party risks shedding a large part of its base among moderate Conservative Remain voters, and is seeking to replace them with Labour working-class Leave voters. Johnson\u2019s strategy is all about England. It treats the union as dispensable. The Conservative recovery in Remain-voting Scotland under Ruth Davidson is going into reverse, and Davidson has departed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/16/the-irish-sea-border-what-does-it-mean-for-businesses-brexit\" title=\"\">new withdrawal agreement</a> with the EU has been achieved by betraying the Conservatives\u2019 DUP allies in Northern Ireland. In 1912 the Conservatives became the Conservative and Unionist party. It does not seem very appropriate any longer. Perhaps it is time for a new name: the Conservative and Brexit party.</p> <p><em>Andrew Gamble is professor of politics at Sheffield University.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party is Britain\u2019s oldest and most successful political party. It has been the party of the land but also the party of the city; the party of little England and the party of empire; the party of protectionism and the party of the free market; the nasty party and the party of gay marriage; the party of Europe and the party of Brexit. The list of its many mutations is a long one. But will the election of 2019 be the final act in reshaping the Conservative party as an English nationalist Brexit party? The pro-European strand that used to dominate the party has lost the civil war, and many of them are stepping down as MPs. Some have joined other parties. After the 2019 election there will be very few pro-European one-nation Conservatives left in the cabinet or in the parliamentary party, and many fewer women. Conservatives dreaded the coming of universal suffrage and often fought against it. But in the 101 years since democracy was conceded the Conservatives have governed either alone or in coalition for two-thirds of them. To do that they have always had to draw much of their support from working-class voters. Opponents have often wondered why the party has been so successful, in marked contrast to many other parties of the European centre-right. How has this party of property and privilege won so many elections? Part of the answer lies in the ability of the party to reinvent itself, not to allow itself to get stuck in a ditch, always to be pragmatic and flexible. This has meant giving priority to statecraft and the pursuit of power rather than to ideology. As Trollope remarked about the 19th-century Tory party (he might have been writing about Boris Johnson): \u201cNo reform, no innovation \u2026 no revolution stinks so foully in the nostrils of an English Tory as to be absolutely irreconcilable to him. When taken in the refreshing waters of office any such pill can be swallowed.\u201d The classic Tory one-nation formula for government was set out by Disraeli when he said at Crystal Palace in 1872 that the three great objects of the Conservative party were to maintain the institutions of the country, to uphold the empire of England, and to elevate the condition of the people. How best to do this and build an electoral coalition sufficient to keep the Conservatives in government has always preoccupied Conservative leaders. Now Boris Johnson has the election he wanted, he cannot afford to repeat the experience of 2017 when the Conservatives threw away their poll lead and lost their majority. Johnson needs a decisive victory to secure his leadership and crush his opponents. He dreams of governing for a decade, but this means gaining a majority for the Conservatives in excess of 50 seats. The last time the Conservatives won such a majority was in 1987, the third of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s emphatic wins. Since 2010 the Conservatives have fought three elections, but only won an outright majority once, in 2015, and then a small one. Johnson wants to win big, and is happy taking risks and creating chaos, reshaping the Conservative party and British politics as he does so. Johnson\u2019s aim in this election of persuading Leave voters in northern working-class Labour seats to vote Conservative is not a new problem, even if the context created by Brexit is new. It has been what the Conservatives have always had to do. The dominant party of the 20th century was built around the pillars of union, empire, the rule of law, property and welfare. Conservatives were traditionally the party of the establishment, the crown, the aristocracy, the armed services and the police, the law, the church, the public schools, Oxford and Cambridge. They supported the empire and the union, protectionism against free trade, the gradual improvement of welfare services, and state intervention when necessary to protect citizens from hardship. This tradition of pragmatic one-nation Conservatism was associated with Baldwin and Chamberlain in the 1930s, and then with Churchill, Eden and Macmillan in the 1950s. Edward Heath tried to continue it, but his government suffered a spectacular shipwreck and in the ensuing chaos Margaret Thatcher seized the leadership in 1975. She was responsible for another hugely significant reinvention of the Conservatives as the party of the free market, ending its interventionist and collectivist Chamberlainite tradition. Thatcher\u2019s legacy has been mixed for the Conservative party. She transformed its electoral and governing fortunes, allowing the Conservatives to win four elections and rule for 18 years. She broke the Labour postwar settlement that most Conservatives had come to accept, and many of its institutional bases, and set the UK political economy on a new path. But the way she governed ultimately undermined many of the pillars that had supported Conservatism for so long, and paved the way for Labour\u2019s longest-ever period in government, under Tony Blair. Her social background and her gender made Thatcher an outsider in the party, and even when prime minister she still thought of herself as an outsider fighting against the government and the establishment. This populist (and very un-Conservative) pose of being anti-establishment and for the people against the \u201celites\u201d is one which Brexiters, including Johnson, have tried to copy, not very convincingly. It is hard to pose as an outsider when you have been educated at Eton. In forging her new electoral coalition Thatcher lost an older one. The Conservative and Unionist party used to be able to claim that it represented all parts of the country. It won a majority of the seats and more than 50% of the vote in Scotland in 1955. It had a significant presence in all the big industrial cities, and for a long time dominated the politics of Birmingham and Liverpool. But all that has gone. Conservative support collapsed in Scotland (in 1997 the party failed to win a single seat) and also in northern cities. Thatcher bequeathed a party which had become predominantly an English party, its vote disproportionately concentrated in the south and south-east. At the same time the party stopped being a mass-membership organisation. Those members that remain are disproportionately elderly, white and middle-class, unrepresentative either of Conservative voters or of the wider electorate, and are not being replaced by the recruitment of sufficient younger voters. At the beginning of 2019 official membership had dropped to about 120,000. This figure rose to 180,000 just before the party leadership election held last July, due largely, according to the Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks, to the enrolment of Brexit party members, anxious to make sure a Leaver was elected. The small size of the membership makes the party vulnerable to such entryism. When the Conservatives did have a mass membership, the members had no role in choosing the leader, something they only acquired in 2001. There are now many constituencies where there are hardly any Conservative members at all. Since Thatcher was ousted, members have often been out of step with the party leadership, particularly on Europe. Under John Major two-thirds of the parliamentary party were pro-Europe, one third anti-Europe. In the constituencies it was the other way round. Iain Duncan Smith defeated Kenneth Clarke for the leadership in 2001 because of Clarke\u2019s pro-European views. Boris Johnson always calculated that, as long as he could get to the membership stage of the leadership ballot, the anti-EU credentials he had honed over many years would carry him to victory. The membership has also had an increasing hand in deciding the shape of the parliamentary party by selecting anti-EU candidates. This was one front in the civil war that has raged in the party over Europe for six decades, but which became particularly virulent in the 1990s at the time of the passage of the Maastricht treaty (founding the EU), and again under David Cameron and Theresa May. This great schism, which now has on one side John Major, Michael Heseltine, Kenneth Clarke, Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond, and on the other Norman Tebbit, Iain Duncan Smith, John Redwood, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel, has become unbridgeable. When he was prime minister, Major withdrew the whip from nine of the Maastricht rebels because they were making his task of governing impossible, but later relented. Theresa May never did the same for the European Research Group rebels who refused to pass her withdrawal agreement, because of her unwillingness to split her party. Boris Johnson chose differently. In expelling 21 MPs, including two former chancellors, in September, Johnson signalled that he was happy for a formal split to take place and that only those in favour of a hard Brexit were welcome in the party. Europe is the third great major schism in the history of the Conservative party over Britain\u2019s place in the world. The first was in 1846, when Robert Peel repealed the Corn Laws with the support of opposition MPs. Two-thirds of his own MPs voted against him. The Conservative party lost the battle on free trade and did not form a majority government for almost 30 years. A second great schism took place at the start of the 20th century over free trade and tariff reform. The Conservatives became the party of tariff reform, seeking to transform the far-flung British empire into a cohesive economic bloc to rival the continental empires of Germany and the United States. Conservative MPs who did not support reform were purged by their constituencies. Winston Churchill crossed the floor of the house and joined the Liberals. By 1910 there were very few supporters of free trade and liberal imperialism left in the Conservative party. In the 1960s, with the end of empire approaching, the Conservative party pivoted to become the party of Europe. Harold Macmillan saw the pooling of sovereignty in Europe and the economic and political cooperation it made possible as the new framework that would give Britain influence, security and prosperity. But the decision was always contested, and the opposition never entirely went away, even after Britain successfully signed the Treaty of Rome and joined the community in 1973, and after the 1975 referendum confirmed that decision with a two-to-one majority. Under Thatcher the leadership became divided over the desirability of further integration. Thatcher herself was the architect of one of the most far-reaching acts of integration, the single market, but she balked at the further stages of integration that were planned, especially the idea of a social Europe. This ignited the civil war which is only now nearing its end. In the course of it the Conservative party has been transformed. As Duncan Smith said last week: \u201cThe Tory party is now the Brexit party.\u201d There is no room for Remainers in its ranks. Long vilified by the Conservative press as traitors and wreckers, it is time for them to depart. Daily Telegraph columnists have been repeatedly calling for a purge, and the exodus is gathering pace. Johnson won the referendum and then the leadership by siding firmly with the Brexiters in the party, and has reshaped the cabinet and the parliamentary party accordingly. The party risks shedding a large part of its base among moderate Conservative Remain voters, and is seeking to replace them with Labour working-class Leave voters. Johnson\u2019s strategy is all about England. It treats the union as dispensable. The Conservative recovery in Remain-voting Scotland under Ruth Davidson is going into reverse, and Davidson has departed. The new withdrawal agreement with the EU has been achieved by betraying the Conservatives\u2019 DUP allies in Northern Ireland. In 1912 the Conservatives became the Conservative and Unionist party. It does not seem very appropriate any longer. Perhaps it is time for a new name: the Conservative and Brexit party. Andrew Gamble is professor of politics at Sheffield University.

It said \u201ccurrent research is limited and of low quality\u201d, and added that clinical trials had shown a high level of adverse responses.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a clear need for more evidence to support prescribing and funding decisions, and we are working hard with the health system, industry and researchers to improve the knowledge base,\u201d a Department of Health spokesman said.</p> <p>Now, in an attempt to break the deadlock, a group of scientists \u2013 backed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists \u2013 will this Thursday announce that they are to conduct Europe\u2019s largest study into the effects of medical cannabis. About 20,000 patients will receive heavily subsidised products to help treat a range of disorders including epilepsy, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post traumatic stress disorder and other chronic conditions.</p> <p>That the UK currently lacks this knowledge base seems perverse: it is the largest producer of medical cannabis in the world. According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, in 2016 the <a href=\"https://transformdrugs.org/press-release-new-un-report-reveals-uk-is-worlds-biggest-producer-of-medical-cannabis/\" title=\"\">UK produced 44% of global cannabis plants</a> intended for medicine and scientific research. Much of this is exported to other countries who turn it into medicinal products, which the UK subjects to hefty import restrictions.</p> <p>Those firms wanting to bring products into the UK must apply to the Home Office for a licence. Under the current system, it takes eight to 10 weeks for a product to be made available to patients after they have been issued with a prescription, with the result that the prescriptions often expire before the drug can be sourced.</p> <p>Tellingly, the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-15/the-u-k-just-got-its-first-bulk-shipment-of-medical-cannabis\" title=\"\">first shipment of medical cannabis</a> did not arrive \u2013 from the Netherlands \u2013 until February 2019, four months after it was legalised.</p> <p>Campaigners claim the time lag limits the supply of medicinal cannabis into the UK, forcing patients into taking a break in their medication. This is a problem: smooth supply is critical during the titration phase of taking a medicinal cannabis product \u2013 when the concentration a patient requires is established.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the CBMP industry is not beating a path to the UK\u2019s door: the market is just too small, too inaccessible compared to other European countries such as Germany where 142,000 prescriptions were issued in 2018. Companies such as Cannamedical, which profitably sells medicinal cannabis to pharmacies in Germany for \u20ac10 (\u00a38.60) a gram, must sell it for \u00a330 a gram in the UK to achieve a similar profit margin.</p> <p>\u201cThe system isn\u2019t working and is failing patients who need it,\u201d said Marc Davis, an investor and expert on the cannabis market. \u201cThis vicious cycle not only puts patients at risk but also spurs crime and impacts the economy in terms of lost tax revenue.\u201d</p> <p>Currently Stafford can obtain products made by only one company in the Netherlands. She is waiting on an order for products from Canada to be approved.</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of different flowers and oils out there,\u201d she said. \u201cPatients need access to a wide variety, but at the moment, due to all the restrictions on importing, it makes it so expensive and offers such limited choice.\u201d</p> <p>There are signs things are changing, albeit slowly. In the summer Ignite, the company founded by the social media celebrity Dan Bilzerian, known for hosting parties with scantily clad models, launched the UK\u2019s first major campaign promoting cannabidiol, better known as CBD, the non-psychoactive component of cannabis which, it is claimed, improves mood and concentration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d25475228ec39731000b858b4035be72aa671dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d25475228ec39731000b858b4035be72aa671dc/429_57_1441_1802/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cannabis entrepreneur and social media celebrity Dan Bilzerian.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cannabis entrepreneur and social media celebrity Dan Bilzerian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there remains a sense that the UK is lagging behind.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost a year ago hopes were high after the law was changed, and yet implementation has been characterised by dither and delay,\u201d said Tonia Antoniazzi MP, co-chair of the all- party parliamentary group on medical cannabis under prescription.</p> <p>The law change followed several high-profile cases involving young children, notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/01/mother-says-cannabis-oil-has-been-saviour-for-epileptic-son-alfie\" title=\"\">eight-year-old Alfie Dingley</a>, whose mother claimed medicinal cannabis helped combat his severe epilepsy.</p> <p>But in September, 10 families marched on Downing Street protesting that not one of them had received an NHS prescription for such medicines despite promises to the contrary from health secretary Matt Hancock.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a frustrating year for families like ours,\u201d said Dingley\u2019s mother, Hannah Deacon. \u201cEven after our high-profile case, my son still can\u2019t access all of the medicinal cannabis products that would truly help his intractable epilepsy. That situation needs to change. For us and for thousands of others whose cases aren\u2019t as well known as ours.\u201d</p> <p>However, some fear that emotive cases are swaying a debate that must be led by science, not the heart. England\u2019s former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said earlier this year: \u201cI think we have opened a Pandora\u2019s box and there is a belief that it works for many conditions. I do have concerns about safety.\u201d</p> <p>The levels of THC \u2013 the psychoactive element in cannabis \u2013 in Stafford\u2019s cannabis products touch 22%, which is higher than most skunk sold on the streets.</p> <p>But Stafford said it was wrong to make the comparison. \u201cWhen it\u2019s in place of fentanyl, it doesn\u2019t have the effect for me that it would probably have on a recreational user. It relaxes my body and makes my body bearable.\u201d</p> <p>Fears that medical cannabis prescriptions will be exploited to circumvent existing drug laws are also misplaced, according to Dr Rebecca Moore, a former consultant psychiatrist with the NHS who now works at the Medical Cannabis Clinic in London. She said desperate patients were travelling up to 400 miles for a consultation. \u201cThis is a last resort for patients who have tried everything else.\u201d</p> <p>Stafford is a volunteer at the United Patients Alliance which campaigns for medical cannabis to be made available on the NHS. She says that every day its Facebook discussion page carries posts from people saying that taking the drug has helped them get out of bed for the first time in months or to start exercising.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a video from someone with Tourette\u2019s and he filmed himself before and after medicating and it\u2019s such an unbelievable difference,\u201d Stafford said.</p> <p>Prohibition Partners\u2019 Curley suggested that 1% of the UK population could be medical cannabis patients by 2028. \u201cData from the \u200bBritish Medical Journal\u200b on patient numbers for 52 conditions potentially treatable with medical cannabis indicate an estimated patient base of over 4 million people,\u201d she said. \u201cThose numbers cannot and should not be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Her consultancy predicts that the medical cannabis market in the UK, currently worth just \u00a310m, could balloon to \u00a31bn by 2024 \u2013 if NHS doctors start to emulate their counterparts in countries such as Germany and Canada and start prescribing.</p> <p>But until then, Lucy Stafford, like many others, faces a dilemma: rack up debt or turn criminal. A return to fentanyl, though, is not an option.</p> <p>\u201cI was on opiates for seven years of my life. I could never imagine going back on to them now. The thought of that absolutely terrifies me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/27/minister-told-mother-to-flout-cannabis-law-for-epileptic-son\">Minister \u2018told mother to flout cannabis law\u2019 for son with epilepsy</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Who would it help?</h2> <p><strong><em>The number of people in the UK suffering from conditions that are said to be alleviated by medical cannabis</em></strong></p> <p>Anxiety and depression<strong><em> One in four people (source: Mental Health Foundation)</em></strong></p> <p>Cancer<strong><em> 360,000 new cases </em></strong><strong><em>each year (Cancer Research) </em></strong></p> <p>Crohn\u2019s disease <strong><em>146,000 (Crohn\u2019s &amp; Colitis UK)</em></strong></p> <p>Dementia (including Alzheimer\u2019s) <strong><em>850,000 (Alzheimer\u2019s Society)</em></strong></p> <p>Epilepsy <strong><em>More than 500,000</em></strong></p> <p>Fibromyalgia<strong><em> 1.5-2 million </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>(Fibromyalgia Action UK)</em></strong></p> <p>HIV/Aids<strong><em> 100,000 </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>(National Aids Trust)</em></strong></p> <p>Parkinson\u2019s<strong><em> 145,000 (Parkinson\u2019s UK)</em></strong></p> <p>Rheumatoid arthritis<strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>400,000 (National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society)</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Like most teenagers, Lucy Stafford has plans. Normal plans. The plans anyone makes as they progress into adulthood. She wants to complete her degree, spend time with friends and family, and explore her independence. But, unlike most teenagers, the 19-year-old from Cambridge has a rare and debilitating medical condition \u2013 Ehlers Danlos syndrome \u2013 that affects her connective tissue, causing her limbs to dislocate and muscles to spasm. When the Observer interviewed her last week she had dislocated her shoulder that morning, a common occurrence. And yet she was disarmingly, joyously upbeat. The reason? She is one of the very few people in the UK to have been issued with a private prescription for medical cannabis since the drug was legalised a year ago last Friday, something that she and her doctor claim has transformed her life. Having suffered lengthy bouts of chronic pain since she was 10, Stafford has spent most of her teenage years on strong opiates, most recently fentanyl, the synthetic analgesic 50 times more potent than heroin. Down the years, she has had numerous operations and treatments for lower-back pain, including steroid injections, and has been prescribed courses of the powerful painkiller tramadol, to which she became physically dependent. Her vomiting was so severe she was admitted to hospital for intravenous rehydration. She has endured multiple sepsis and urinary tract infections and for much of her life has needed a catheter. Long stays in hospital have been common. \u201cComing off fentanyl was the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d said Stafford, who since she started taking medical cannabis has begun studying with the Open University. \u201cThis prescription saved my life.\u201d She talked about dislocating her shoulder as if she had stubbed her toe. \u201cBefore cannabis I would have had to take a large amount of opiates. I would have been \u2026 crying in pain for most of it, whereas now I am able to function. Sure I need to rest and take it easy but it has made living with my condition manageable and lets me function and have a life, something I never expected to have.\u201d It was when attempts to surgically fix her constantly dislocating jaw failed, causing it to go into spasm for two months, that Stafford\u2019s NHS pain-management specialist tried to prescribe her the cannabis-based medicine Sativex, normally used to treat people with multiple sclerosis. \u201cIt was an act of desperation, they couldn\u2019t increase my fentanyl any more,\u201d Stafford said. Her local NHS Trust refused to pay for the medicine, so she tried self-medicating with illegal cannabis. Worried about being arrested, she paid for a private consultation and is currently one of only about 100 people in the UK to have a private prescription for medical cannabis. Experimenting with different strains of cannabis, oils and vapes has produced life-changing results. When her joints dislocate, Stafford claims that vaporising cannabis reduces her pain levels from a 10 to four within minutes. And she sleeps. Properly. For the first time in years. \u201cChronic pain means you don\u2019t sleep, you can\u2019t meet friends, be with your family, you can\u2019t think, you don\u2019t have your brain and then when you add in opiates you become zombified. A year ago I was a very, very different person. On my medical notes my doctor described me as having transformed. After so many years of being on opiates and in uncontrollable pain, I accepted that I was going to be in so much pain for ever. I had lost so much of myself. I had no ambition for what I would do. All I did was exist.\u201d She speaks with almost childish wonder at the change in her fortunes. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become myself for the first time in my life. It\u2019s absolutely unbelievable. I\u2019m at university, I\u2019m living my life, I\u2019m seeing friends and just doing all the things that I hoped I would do. If you had told me my life would have been like this a year ago I would have laughed.\u201d But a huge problem looms on the horizon: Stafford\u2019s new life is financially unsustainable. She paid \u00a3250 for a private pain consultant to write her the prescription for medical cannabis, a significant sum for a student. But this is nothing compared with the \u00a31,500 a month she was initially paying for her various cannabis products. Since then the price she pays for her medicines and oils has come down to \u00a3800 a month but it is still a huge amount to find. She is outraged at having to pay so much money for something that she believes should be provided on the NHS. \u201cThe law changed a year ago and you would expect some patients would by now have access [to medicinal cannabis on the NHS] but literally nobody has, unless they are willing to go into debt for it. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d When the law was changed 12 months ago, scientists, researchers and campaigners hailed it as a \u201clandmark victory\u201d. The then home secretary, Sajid Javid, said: \u201cWe have now delivered on our promises \u2026 we will work with the NHS to help support specialists in making the right prescribing decisions.\u201d But, in Stafford\u2019s summation: \u201cOur hopes have been dashed, nothing has happened.\u201d Department of Health figures confirm that in the first eight months since medical cannabis was legalised, just 12 prescriptions were issued for unlicensed cannabis medicines \u2013those other than Sativex, or Nabilone, which is given to patients undergoing chemotherapy, both of which have been subject to randomised control trials. \u201cThe people who benefit the most from the new regulations are those who can afford private healthcare,\u201d said Alexandra Curley, head of insights at Prohibition Partners, a consultancy set up to \u201cadvance the global cannabis industry\u201d. \u201cRestrictions and lack of availability is creating a two-tier system of access for patients.\u201d The alternative is to buy illicit cannabis.

Future generations will look back in disbelief at our callousness.\u201d The claim that medical cannabis will save the NHS a fortune is beguiling. Stafford estimates she was costing the NHS \u00a3150 a day on specialist nutrition, \u00a31,000 a month on medication, \u00a3188 a month on catheters, and this is before hospital admissions and nursing costs are factored in. But most NHS doctors are still reluctant to write prescriptions for medical cannabis. Many are wary of the hyperbolic claims being made for it. \u201cThe law was changed but there\u2019s been no education, no trials,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cDoctors have been taught for decades that cannabis is a dangerous recreational drug. There\u2019s been no effort to try to increase understanding of medical cannabis \u2013 it\u2019s been completely lost.\u201d In August the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published an interim review that said medical cannabis should not be prescribed for a range of conditions including chronic pain. Nice said there was a need for more research into the use of cannabis-based medical products (CBMP). It said \u201ccurrent research is limited and of low quality\u201d, and added that clinical trials had shown a high level of adverse responses. \u201cThere is a clear need for more evidence to support prescribing and funding decisions, and we are working hard with the health system, industry and researchers to improve the knowledge base,\u201d a Department of Health spokesman said. Now, in an attempt to break the deadlock, a group of scientists \u2013 backed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists \u2013 will this Thursday announce that they are to conduct Europe\u2019s largest study into the effects of medical cannabis. About 20,000 patients will receive heavily subsidised products to help treat a range of disorders including epilepsy, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post traumatic stress disorder and other chronic conditions. That the UK currently lacks this knowledge base seems perverse: it is the largest producer of medical cannabis in the world. According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, in 2016 the UK produced 44% of global cannabis plants intended for medicine and scientific research. Much of this is exported to other countries who turn it into medicinal products, which the UK subjects to hefty import restrictions. Those firms wanting to bring products into the UK must apply to the Home Office for a licence. Under the current system, it takes eight to 10 weeks for a product to be made available to patients after they have been issued with a prescription, with the result that the prescriptions often expire before the drug can be sourced. Tellingly, the first shipment of medical cannabis did not arrive \u2013 from the Netherlands \u2013 until February 2019, four months after it was legalised. Campaigners claim the time lag limits the supply of medicinal cannabis into the UK, forcing patients into taking a break in their medication. This is a problem: smooth supply is critical during the titration phase of taking a medicinal cannabis product \u2013 when the concentration a patient requires is established. Unsurprisingly, the CBMP industry is not beating a path to the UK\u2019s door: the market is just too small, too inaccessible compared to other European countries such as Germany where 142,000 prescriptions were issued in 2018. Companies such as Cannamedical, which profitably sells medicinal cannabis to pharmacies in Germany for \u20ac10 (\u00a38.60) a gram, must sell it for \u00a330 a gram in the UK to achieve a similar profit margin. \u201cThe system isn\u2019t working and is failing patients who need it,\u201d said Marc Davis, an investor and expert on the cannabis market. \u201cThis vicious cycle not only puts patients at risk but also spurs crime and impacts the economy in terms of lost tax revenue.\u201d Currently Stafford can obtain products made by only one company in the Netherlands. She is waiting on an order for products from Canada to be approved. \u201cThere are lots of different flowers and oils out there,\u201d she said. \u201cPatients need access to a wide variety, but at the moment, due to all the restrictions on importing, it makes it so expensive and offers such limited choice.\u201d There are signs things are changing, albeit slowly. In the summer Ignite, the company founded by the social media celebrity Dan Bilzerian, known for hosting parties with scantily clad models, launched the UK\u2019s first major campaign promoting cannabidiol, better known as CBD, the non-psychoactive component of cannabis which, it is claimed, improves mood and concentration. But there remains a sense that the UK is lagging behind. \u201cAlmost a year ago hopes were high after the law was changed, and yet implementation has been characterised by dither and delay,\u201d said Tonia Antoniazzi MP, co-chair of the all- party parliamentary group on medical cannabis under prescription. The law change followed several high-profile cases involving young children, notably eight-year-old Alfie Dingley, whose mother claimed medicinal cannabis helped combat his severe epilepsy. But in September, 10 families marched on Downing Street protesting that not one of them had received an NHS prescription for such medicines despite promises to the contrary from health secretary Matt Hancock. \u201cIt has been a frustrating year for families like ours,\u201d said Dingley\u2019s mother, Hannah Deacon. \u201cEven after our high-profile case, my son still can\u2019t access all of the medicinal cannabis products that would truly help his intractable epilepsy. That situation needs to change. For us and for thousands of others whose cases aren\u2019t as well known as ours.\u201d However, some fear that emotive cases are swaying a debate that must be led by science, not the heart. England\u2019s former chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said earlier this year: \u201cI think we have opened a Pandora\u2019s box and there is a belief that it works for many conditions. I do have concerns about safety.\u201d The levels of THC \u2013 the psychoactive element in cannabis \u2013 in Stafford\u2019s cannabis products touch 22%, which is higher than most skunk sold on the streets. But Stafford said it was wrong to make the comparison. \u201cWhen it\u2019s in place of fentanyl, it doesn\u2019t have the effect for me that it would probably have on a recreational user. It relaxes my body and makes my body bearable.\u201d Fears that medical cannabis prescriptions will be exploited to circumvent existing drug laws are also misplaced, according to Dr Rebecca Moore, a former consultant psychiatrist with the NHS who now works at the Medical Cannabis Clinic in London. She said desperate patients were travelling up to 400 miles for a consultation. \u201cThis is a last resort for patients who have tried everything else.\u201d Stafford is a volunteer at the United Patients Alliance which campaigns for medical cannabis to be made available on the NHS. She says that every day its Facebook discussion page carries posts from people saying that taking the drug has helped them get out of bed for the first time in months or to start exercising. \u201cWe had a video from someone with Tourette\u2019s and he filmed himself before and after medicating and it\u2019s such an unbelievable difference,\u201d Stafford said. Prohibition Partners\u2019 Curley suggested that 1% of the UK population could be medical cannabis patients by 2028. \u201cData from the British Medical Journal on patient numbers for 52 conditions potentially treatable with medical cannabis indicate an estimated patient base of over 4 million people,\u201d she said. \u201cThose numbers cannot and should not be ignored.\u201d Her consultancy predicts that the medical cannabis market in the UK, currently worth just \u00a310m, could balloon to \u00a31bn by 2024 \u2013 if NHS doctors start to emulate their counterparts in countries such as Germany and Canada and start prescribing. But until then, Lucy Stafford, like many others, faces a dilemma: rack up debt or turn criminal. A return to fentanyl, though, is not an option. \u201cI was on opiates for seven years of my life. I could never imagine going back on to them now. The thought of that absolutely terrifies me.\u201d Who would it help?

It is also worth remarking that the Conservatives are not a popular government and Mr Johnson is not a well-rated prime minister. The vote share indicated by polling is down on what Mrs May achieved in her humiliating victory of two years ago.</p> <p>The Tory leader owes his lead to the dismal ratings for Labour. Few Labour MPs think Jeremy Corbyn can win this contest and history suggests that they are correct. It is not so much the headline number that says this, but underlying metrics. No opposition leader has ever removed the incumbent and become prime minister when the challenger is less well regarded as a candidate for the premiership and his party is rated inferior on economic competence. You can fail on one of these tests and still become prime minister. Margaret Thatcher did that in 1979. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39748185\" title=\"\">She was less rated</a> as a candidate for Number 10 than Jim Callaghan, but the Tories led on economic competence. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/opinion_polls/newsid_1306000/1306664.stm\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> did it in 1997.

That still leaves a substantial segment of the electorate whose choice will not be determined by Brexit alone. There\u2019s some hope in that for Labour, a party that will prefer to talk about anything but its tortured position on Brexit and its leader\u2019s continuing refusal to say whether he is for or against it.

      "bodyText": "Snatching the prize for the first gaffe of the campaign, the Tory propaganda unit posted video footage of Boris Johnson in the back of a car explaining why we need an election while apparently not wearing a seatbelt. That\u2019s appropriate because the Tory leader is taking a spin on a foggy and potholed electoral highway not fitted with the usual safety features and in winter, when surfaces can be very slippery. Even the most bullish Tories privately acknowledge that this election is a huge roll of the dice. The range of plausible results is wide and the Brexit-scrambling of traditional party allegiances has rendered the old blue-red swingometer a near-useless instrument of prediction. The potential outcomes include Mr Johnson returning to Number 10 with the chunky majority and personal mandate that he craves, and another hung parliament in which every other party has said they will not co-operate with the Conservatives even if they are again the largest cohort. The campaign begins with most of the opinion polls awarding the Tories a hefty lead. This is not as much of a comfort as it would once have been. When one newspaper klaxoned \u201cBoris soars into 17-point poll lead\u201d, it was not Labour candidates who were made most jumpy \u2013 it was Tory ones.

An initial legal assessment of last week\u2019s 856-page report by Sir Martin Moore-Bick into the 2017 blaze has concluded that the prospect of individual or corporate prosecutions is now far more likely. Paul Ridge, a partner at Bindmans, which represents 200 bereaved relatives and survivors of the fire that killed 72 people, said Moore-Bick\u2019s finding that Grenfell\u2019s facade was \u201cnot compliant with building regulations\u201d was a game-changer. Ridge said: \u201cHe\u2019s saying that the building is effectively unlawful. Immediately the spotlight has been turned on to the designers, the constructors and the materials. The only question now is who was responsible. The chances of criminal prosecutions have increased significantly.\u201d The legal team was also encouraged by Moore-Bick\u2019s use of the report to criticise companies linked with a refurbishment of the tower a year before the fire. Arconic, the US firm that made the Grenfell cladding, had urged the inquiry to wait to decide if the tower broke building regulations. However, Moore-Bick dismissed the firm\u2019s requests and revealed it had not even offered a \u201creasoned argument\u201d for how the facade might comply with building regulations. He added: \u201cIt is clear that the walls [of the tower] didn\u2019t resist the spread of fire.

The second phase of the inquiry will largely focus on the chain of events and decision-making leading up to the refurbishment, which added the tower\u2019s flammable cladding in 2016, and the corporate testing regime that allowed Grenfell to be wrapped in such materials. Towards the end of his report, Moore-Bick states he will investigate the \u201cregime for testing materials intended for use in external walls and [whether] the regulations governing their use were, and are, adequate to identify and control the potential dangers\u201d. He also intends to investigate the corporate construction trade and its relationship with government officials and what they knew about the risks involved in using highly combustible thermoplastic polymers in the cladding. \u201cI shall also examine what was and should have been known, both by those in the construction industry and by those in central government responsible for setting fire safety standards, about the particular dangers posed by thermoplastic polymers,\u201d he states. Scotland Yard is investigating the fire, but has stated it will not bring any criminal charges until Moore-Bick\u2019s inquiry is complete, which could take another two years at least.",

With my 500 houseplants, for example, I am watering once every two to three days in summer to beat the heat, but in winter I have left them for as long as a fortnight at a time with no visible signs of stress.

These not only help boost plant immunity, but can act as physical deterrents to pests, without the need to deploy conventional pesticides. </p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",

After reports of torture and abuse in detention centres, and wanting to stop the flow of people across the Mediterranean, the European Union has since 2016 poured more than \u00a3110m into improving conditions for migrants in Libya. But things are now worse than before.</p> <p>Among the inmates is Mohammed, from Ghana. In July, he survived an air strike on another centre, in Tajoura on the capital\u2019s south-western outskirts, that killed 53 of his fellow migrants. After surviving on the streets, last month he got a place on a rickety smuggler boat heading for Europe. But it was intercepted by the coastguard. Mohammed fell into the sea and was brought back to this camp. His blue jumper is still stained by sea salt. He is desperate to get word to his wife. \u201cThe last time we spoke was the night I tried to cross the sea,\u201d he says. \u201cThe soldiers took my money and phone. My wife does not know where I am, whether I am alive or dead.\u201d</p> <p>Triq-al-Sikka\u2019s conditions are harsh, but other centres are worse.

Triq-al-Sikka is home to 300 men penned into nightmare conditions. Several who are sick lie motionless on dirty mattresses in the yard, left to die or recover in their own time. Three of the six toilets are blocked with sewage, and for many detainees, escape is out of the question as they have no shoes. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. After reports of torture and abuse in detention centres, and wanting to stop the flow of people across the Mediterranean, the European Union has since 2016 poured more than \u00a3110m into improving conditions for migrants in Libya. But things are now worse than before. Among the inmates is Mohammed, from Ghana. In July, he survived an air strike on another centre, in Tajoura on the capital\u2019s south-western outskirts, that killed 53 of his fellow migrants. After surviving on the streets, last month he got a place on a rickety smuggler boat heading for Europe. But it was intercepted by the coastguard. Mohammed fell into the sea and was brought back to this camp. His blue jumper is still stained by sea salt. He is desperate to get word to his wife. \u201cThe last time we spoke was the night I tried to cross the sea,\u201d he says. \u201cThe soldiers took my money and phone. My wife does not know where I am, whether I am alive or dead.\u201d Triq-al-Sikka\u2019s conditions are harsh, but other centres are worse. Inmates tell of camps where militias storm in at night, dragging migrants away to be ransomed back to their families. Tens of thousands of migrants are spread across this city, many sleeping in the streets. Dozens bed down each night under the arches of the city centre\u2019s freeway. Since April, in a sharp escalation of the civil war, eastern warlord Khalifa Haftar has been trying to batter his way into the city in fighting that has left more than 1,000 dead and left tens of thousands of citizens homeless. Libya has known nothing but chaos since the 2011 revolution that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. In 2014, a multi-sided civil war broke out. Taking advantage of this chaos, smugglers transformed Libya into a hub for migrants from three continents trying to reach Europe.

However, many critics believe the technology is not suitable for the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cFracking is utterly incompatible with our aims of ending the burning of fossil fuels in this country in a couple of decades,\u201d said geologist Professor Stuart Haszeldine, of Edinburgh University. \u201cPursuing the technology of fracking while embracing the concept of having a carbon-free society is an example of national schizophrenia. It has wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money. It has also wasted a decade when we should have been pursuing other goals.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/27/climate-breakdown-austerity-green-new-deal\">The answer to climate breakdown and austerity? A green new deal | Caroline Lucas</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One such aim should have been the development of the technology of carbon capture and storage which would involve carbon dioxide being captured, liquefied and stored underground in old mines or depleted oil reservoirs, added Haszeldine. \u201cWe have lost significant leads in developing this technology over the past decade when we should have been pursuing them energetically. Instead we have wasted our time on fracking projects.\u201d</p> \n<p>This point was backed by Professor Jon Gluyas, director of the Durham Energy Institute at Durham University. \u201cThe government ban on fracking is a neat way of ignoring the now inescapable truth that the projected shale gas potential for the UK is tiny at best. We have, though, as a nation wasted a decade hoping for more gas to heat our homes rather than installing ultra-low carbon geothermal heating like that used in much of Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. However, the process can also trigger earthquakes, and although fracking was enthusiastically endorsed by Tory politicians when plans for erecting drills were first made 10 years ago their introduction has been hindered by intense local opposition. To date only three wells have attempted to frack for oil and gas in the UK.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bdb5920fd0c5510f2ab5be1d149db68d21368b4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bdb5920fd0c5510f2ab5be1d149db68d21368b4/12_0_4832_2900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-fracking banner outside Lancashire County Hall in Preston, Lancashire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-fracking banner outside Lancashire County Hall in Preston, Lancashire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Earlier this year one of these wells triggered a tremor that measured 250 times the level permitted by regulations. A subsequent review concluded that it was impossible to predict the probability or scale of earthquakes triggered by fracking.

Fracking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/03/scottish-government-extends-ban-on-fracking\" title=\"\">in Scotland</a> was suspended in 2013. The Welsh government imposed a moratorium in 2015, while there is a planning presumption against fracking in Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday dismissed the move <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/02/jeremy-corbyn-decries-fracking-suspension-as-election-stunt\" title=\"\">as an election stunt</a>. \u201cI think it\u2019s what\u2019s called euphemistically a bit of greenwash,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it sounds like fracking would come back on the 13th of December, if they [the Conservatives] were elected back into office. \u201cWe\u2019re quite clear, we will end fracking.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have been condemned for wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money in a failed attempt to introduce fracking to the UK. The bid also cost the nation a decade of effort that should have been expended on other, more environmentally friendly energy projects, scientists and activists claimed yesterday. The criticisms were made in the wake of the government\u2019s decision on Friday to impose a moratorium on fracking in the UK. A review published by the Oil and Gas Authority concluded it was impossible to predict the likelihood or scale of earthquakes triggered by fracking. The moratorium leaves the government with an option to restart fracking in future years. However, many critics believe the technology is not suitable for the UK. \u201cFracking is utterly incompatible with our aims of ending the burning of fossil fuels in this country in a couple of decades,\u201d said geologist Professor Stuart Haszeldine, of Edinburgh University. \u201cPursuing the technology of fracking while embracing the concept of having a carbon-free society is an example of national schizophrenia. It has wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money. It has also wasted a decade when we should have been pursuing other goals.\u201d One such aim should have been the development of the technology of carbon capture and storage which would involve carbon dioxide being captured, liquefied and stored underground in old mines or depleted oil reservoirs, added Haszeldine. \u201cWe have lost significant leads in developing this technology over the past decade when we should have been pursuing them energetically. Instead we have wasted our time on fracking projects.\u201d This point was backed by Professor Jon Gluyas, director of the Durham Energy Institute at Durham University. \u201cThe government ban on fracking is a neat way of ignoring the now inescapable truth that the projected shale gas potential for the UK is tiny at best. We have, though, as a nation wasted a decade hoping for more gas to heat our homes rather than installing ultra-low carbon geothermal heating like that used in much of Europe.\u201d Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. However, the process can also trigger earthquakes, and although fracking was enthusiastically endorsed by Tory politicians when plans for erecting drills were first made 10 years ago their introduction has been hindered by intense local opposition. To date only three wells have attempted to frack for oil and gas in the UK. Earlier this year one of these wells triggered a tremor that measured 250 times the level permitted by regulations. A subsequent review concluded that it was impossible to predict the probability or scale of earthquakes triggered by fracking. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom yesterday announced she was imposing a moratorium. The decision brings England into line with the rest of the UK. Fracking in Scotland was suspended in 2013. The Welsh government imposed a moratorium in 2015, while there is a planning presumption against fracking in Northern Ireland. However, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday dismissed the move as an election stunt. \u201cI think it\u2019s what\u2019s called euphemistically a bit of greenwash,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it sounds like fracking would come back on the 13th of December, if they [the Conservatives] were elected back into office. \u201cWe\u2019re quite clear, we will end fracking. We think it\u2019s unnecessary, we think it\u2019s pollutive of ground water systems, and is actually dangerous and has caused serious earth tremors.\u201d",

The NHS is going in to winter in a much worse position than at any time in recent memory.</p> <p>\u201cWe are short of capacity across the board \u2013 in mental health, ambulance and community services as well as hospital beds. And there has been another 12 months where social care and GP capacity has lagged well behind the growth in demand.</p> <p>\u201cThe NHS has over 100,000 vacancies, so there was no respite over the summer and staff are now exhausted. On top of all this, we are losing serious amounts of vital senior clinical and leadership time because of current NHS pensions problems.\u201d</p>",

Staff are already coming under extreme pressure, trolley waits are at a worryingly high level, A&amp;E targets are not being met and as such, the BMA predicts that the NHS is hurtling towards an unprecedented crisis this winter.\u201d Nagpaul added: \u201cWe need to see investment, both immediately to avert the coming winter crisis, and in the long term to address the perpetual state of crisis the NHS is now in.\u201d A mounting threat to capacity has been caused by the increasing reluctance of doctors to do extra shifts because they are being hit with huge unexpected tax bills of tens of thousands of pounds related to the rise in the value of their pensions, leading to operations being cancelled and \u201crota gaps\u201d in hospitals. Sarah Wollaston, who served as chair of the all-party select committee on health and social care in the last parliament, said the government had only itself to blame: \u201cThe pensions crisis issue is one the committee has been warning about for months, but the government has done nothing.\u201d The BMA is understood to have warned ministers in its submission for the cancelled November budget that the number of patients waiting on trolleys this winter is set to soar this winter. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer today puts the Tories on 42%, 16 points ahead of Labour on 26%, with the Liberal Democrats on 16% and the Brexit party on 9%. But with more voters citing the NHS as the most important issue facing the country (59%) than Brexit (52%) the Conservatives, who will launch their manifesto on Wednesday, are aware a crisis could provide an opportunity for Labour to claw its way back. The shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth wrote to Stevens on Saturday night demanding to have the same regular meetings and briefings as Hancock, saying he could be running the NHS after 12 December and needed to be aware of the extent of the crisis. Ashworth said: \u201cExpert after expert is warning that we\u2019re heading into the worst winter on record for the NHS. We are set to see yet again shameful scenes of our elderly and vulnerable languishing on trolleys in corridors or trapped in ambulances because A&amp;Es are so overcrowded. Estimates that trolley waits will climb as high as 300,000 \u2013 far in excess of last year \u2013 are staggering and reveal patients are set for a winter of Tory misery.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWork to prepare for winter this year is already well under way. We have invested \u00a3240m in adult social care to ease pressures this winter by getting patients home quicker and freeing up hospital beds across England, on top of an extra \u00a31bn capital funding this year to better equip our hospitals and maintain buildings in the face of rising demand. \u201cWe have also backed the NHS with an extra \u00a333.9bn a year by 2023-24 to support the long term plan and to make our health service fit for the future.\u201d Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said: \u201cThe level of concern we\u2019re hearing from frontline leaders about performance this winter is the highest we have known. The NHS is going in to winter in a much worse position than at any time in recent memory. \u201cWe are short of capacity across the board \u2013 in mental health, ambulance and community services as well as hospital beds. And there has been another 12 months where social care and GP capacity has lagged well behind the growth in demand. \u201cThe NHS has over 100,000 vacancies, so there was no respite over the summer and staff are now exhausted. On top of all this, we are losing serious amounts of vital senior clinical and leadership time because of current NHS pensions problems.\u201d",

With such a large sample, we are able to drill down into individual constituencies, many of which have changed considerably in their political weather since two years ago. Whereas the Conservatives and Labour polled 82.4% combined in 2017, the evidence is that they will struggle to get more than 66% between them this time. There are London seats that the Conservatives won in 2017, and where the Labour party came second. But our polling shows clearly that in such places as the Cities of London and Westminster, Chelsea and Fulham, and Wimbledon, the Liberal Democrats are now the party best placed to unite an anti-Conservative vote with a clear Remain message. That analysis may be inconvenient to Labour but it is the product of cold, hard, recent data. Labour remains the clear challenger in the vast majority of seats. We will update the MRP closer to polling day, to make sure we give the most accurate recommendations possible. The party machines will inevitably rail against the parts of these conclusions they least like, while embracing parts convenient to them. Fortunately for the future of the country, the electorate is far more savvy than the political parties they vote for. This Christmas election is our last chance. Banish Johnson and Brexit from our politics for 2020 with tactical voting, or put up with both for another decade without it. Naomi Smith is chief executive of Best for Britain.",

      "body": "<p>The actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/felicity-jones\" title=\"\">Felicity Jones</a>, judged by dreary national statistics, is neither tall nor short: she\u2019s a bang-on average 5ft 3in. Measured by the slightly looser gauge in her imagination, though, Jones is a <em>colossus</em>, a towering church-and-steeple of a human being. She\u2019s got a basketballer\u2019s reach and a bodyguard\u2019s doorway-filling bulk. Even in flat-soled shoes, this 36-year-old can go around plucking stranded cats out of trees. \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve always felt bigger and taller than I am.\u201d</p> <p>In the past few years especially, the actor has made good use of this inside-outside differential. Whether it was playing the pioneering American judge, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in 2018\u2019s <em>On the Basis of Sex</em>, or earning an Oscar nomination as Jane Hawking, Stephen\u2019s formidable first wife, in 2015\u2019s <em>The Theory of Everything</em>, Jones has had an instinctive sense for the pathos and humour in characters whose physical slightness tends to trick others into overlooking them. In a <em>Star Wars</em> movie, 2016\u2019s <em>Rogue One</em>, she played a watchful and almost childlike guerrilla who ultimately tough-nutted past dozens of baddies to bring down an army. In her coming movie, <em>The Aeronauts</em>, she plays a 19th-century balloonist \u2013 a figure of fun to the scientists and flight enthusiasts of Victorian London, until she has to rescue one of them from death at 37,000ft.</p> <p>Jones meets me for lunch in a pub in north London. She is early, and pumped for some roast chicken. When our meals arrive she sets about eating and talking at an equally brisk clip. Although this can lead to accidents (she points out a stain on her sweatshirt), Jones is a cool bean and has that performer\u2019s knack, just about inexplicable to me, of chatting away fluently even after forking in a mouthful of drumstick meat.</p> <p>She\u2019s interesting and eloquent about her job, stiffer when it comes to talking about herself and her personal life. First we talk about the wider world, which seems, most weeks, to be falling to pieces. \u201cThere was that old-fashioned idea, years and years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cof a movie star who was this godlike being who never deigned to talk about anything mortal. But that\u2019s long gone.\u201d All for the better, she thinks. \u201cI\u2019m a constant news-checker. You can\u2019t not be, now. There\u2019s such chaos in the world. It seems to be our duty to be informed, to be abreast of things. Particularly in my work, now, I\u2019m not shy of things that have a strong ideology, that are political.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"89c6a20351ebe7e1c81a989d8a8ca43e5be5d451\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89c6a20351ebe7e1c81a989d8a8ca43e5be5d451/142_0_4216_2531/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones flying in a hot air balloon in a scene from The Aeronauts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Up, up and away: with Eddie Redmayne in The Aeronauts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Amazon Studios/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her Ginsburg biopic had an obvious liberal bent. The politics are more subtle in the new film <em>The Aeronauts</em>, directed by Tom Harper, written by Jack Thorne and co-starring Eddie Redmayne. He plays James Glaisher, one of the world\u2019s first meteorologists, a Victorian scientist who hoped to better understand our weather and our climate. In his studies of the upper atmosphere, he took the first steps towards understanding what damage we were doing up there, even then. A timely story to tell, Jones suggests.</p> <p>I ask her what she makes of the current political situation. \u201cUh. I\u2019m pretty disappointed, to be honest. It\u2019s been sort of devastating, the last few years. It\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d She recalls the time she spent in the company of Justice Ginsburg, becoming close to the 86-year-old while preparing to portray the older woman on screen. \u201cThat was life-changing for me,\u201d she says. \u201cSpending time with her. Getting to know her well. She has such <em>integrity</em>. And, particularly now, when we look around at public figures, when their integrity seems to have been left very, very far behind, and it seems as if everyone is acting out of this horrific personal interest\u2026\u201d She widens her arms, a gesture of vague despair that I take to mean: oh, for one or two more Ginsburgs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m an instinctively open person. I\u2019m used to being quite expressive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>On the Basis of Sex</em>, which partly focused on the relationship between Ginsburg and her husband Marty, played by Armie Hammer, got a lukewarm reception when it came out last year. Jones remembers the months spent promoting the movie around America, not always to the most receptive of audiences. \u201cI felt there was an ingrained sexism, at certain points, in response to the film. Even now it\u2019s hard to put out a film like that into the world, about female triumph, female success.\u201d</p> <p>She remembers the amazed reaction people had to Marty especially, who took on a secondary role in the marriage, better to support Ruth\u2019s ambitions. Up to that point, in a varied screen career, Jones had played opposite monsters, witches, a long-dead Peter Cushing who was digitally revived by animators for her <em>Star Wars</em> film, superheroes and aliens. But it was Marty Ginsburg who audiences refused to believe in.</p> <p>\u201cI was asked: \u2018Who is this man? Could he possibly exist? Is he a fantasy?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. Maybe change happens slowly. But it\u2019s hard at times not to get disheartened.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Jones was born</strong></em> in a suburb of Birmingham, to parents who met while working on a local newspaper. They separated when she was young, and Jones has since said that the example of living with a working single mother helped instil in her a definite work ethic. Jones joined a drama group at 10 and got her first paid gig at 13, in an adventure movie, <em>The Treasure Seekers</em>, alongside a young Keira Knightley. They filmed during the school holidays. \u201cI remember liking how we were taken seriously, despite being young.\u201d At 15, she joined the cast of <em>The Archers</em> (playing Emma Carter in the radio soap until she was in her mid-20s) and put in the work while in secondary school as a magic-endowed school bully, Ethel, in a BBC adaptation of the <em>Worst Witch</em> books.</p> <p>Over lunch we talk about some of the complications associated with kids who take on adult jobs. Growing up too quickly. Missing out on parts of childhood. Jones cuts in on my examples. \u201cYou\u2019re asking, did I have the Judy Garland experience? On the uppers and downers?\u201d</p> <p>Sure, I say. How Judy were you?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d986eb082b5fc4983a5ce4810d8f450cebcdf46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d986eb082b5fc4983a5ce4810d8f450cebcdf46/0_406_4400_5194/847.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Jones, sitting on the floor holding her ankles, wearing a pink suit by Acne and a yellow shirt by Equipment.\" width=\"847\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You have peaks and troughs. Acting is an undulating experience\u2019: Felicity Jones wears suit by Acne; shirt by Equipment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Papaleo/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was quite low on the Judy scale. Partly because my parents were strong about having an education, and keeping school going alongside acting. And partly because it felt like a hobby then. It was fun. It wasn\u2019t Judy. It wasn\u2019t a <em>grind</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Jones went to Oxford and studied English. Her freshers\u2019 week was unluckily timed. She had just done an ad for zit medication, which was nationally broadcast. \u201cI was one of two girls in a bedroom, talking about a guy named Rob. We bounced around, fell back on the bed, dreamed about this guy named Rob. And then we used some face wipes.\u201d As an undergrad she appeared in some earnest, bad student plays and, after graduating, moved to the southeast to set about auditioning for real.</p> <p>\u201cI look back on that time fondly. But I remember it being hectic. Chaotic. Everything up in the air. You got sent reams and reams of scenes to learn, for auditions that were always in Soho, and which you would never get. I remember always bumping into the same actors who were going through the system.\u201d She reels off the names: Carey Mulligan, Andrea Riseborough, Eddie Redmayne, Andrew Garfield, Tom Hardy\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019d see each other constantly.\u201d</p> <p>One by one, like fireworks, these other careers began to spark and take off. \u201cWe were all <em>going for it</em>. So you were disappointed if you didn\u2019t get something, when someone else did. It was funny. People would have these moments and suddenly go stratospheric. I guess I started to realise that everyone has their own unique selling points.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask Jones what her own unique selling point is, she raises an eyebrow, ironic. Isn\u2019t it obvious? \u201cMy height. My huge stature!\u201d She apes the voice of an imaginary casting director: \u201cShe took our breath away, that tall one. We\u2019ve got to get that tall girl back.\u201d</p> <p>That gang of Soho auditionees, with careers that one by one took off \u2013 was there rivalry between them? Is there still?

She appeared in two Michael Grandage plays in the West End, and Julie Taymor cast her as Miranda in a Helen Mirren-led film of <em>The Tempest</em>. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant made her a co-lead in their curious, whimsical romcom from 2010, <em>Cemetery Junction</em>. The film that eventually cut through was an American indie, <em>Like Crazy</em>, a Sundance darling directed by Drake Doremus that came out in 2011. Jones played a British exchange student who fell in love with a Californian, played by Anton Yelchin.</p> <p>Years later, Jones\u2019s co-star Yelchin was killed in a car accident outside his home, at 27. When I ask about him, Jones loses her fluency. \u201cI mean, it takes time, to get to a point\u2026 to find some hope in some of this stuff. I think all decisions in life become more meaningful through grief. You think: \u2018How lucky I am.\u2019 Because it\u2019s\u2026 Because we\u2019re all just here in the balance.\u201d She\u2019s seems a little teary-eyed. Maybe I\u2019m imagining it. In any case we leave the subject there.</p> <p>There is a certain line in Jones\u2019s head, the stuff in life that\u2019s up for discussion, and the stuff that\u2019s not. She will squirm as this line is approached. She\u2019ll prod at her food. Talking about intimacies with a voice recorder running is, plainly, agony to her. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bumpy ride, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m an instinctively open person. I\u2019m used to being quite expressive. But I think, ultimately, you\u2019re just trying to think about people in your life who haven\u2019t chosen the public eye.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You develop a sense of detachment in order not to get too neurotic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jones recently got married to her boyfriend, the British director Charles Guard. After the wedding, pictures of the ceremony were harvested from her guests\u2019 social media accounts and published in a few tabloids. \u201cTo an extent you develop a level of detachment from yourself,\u201d Jones says. \u201cSeeing images of yourself all the time, you have to, in order not to get too neurotic. But I think in terms of family and friends and partners, you need to protect them.\u201d</p> <p>One friendship she is eager to discuss is that with Redmayne. The pair were cast in <em>The Theory of Everything</em> in the summer of 2013. During the shoot the following autumn, Jones remembers, they developed an interesting method of motivating each other. When it was one of their turns for a close-up, the other would linger off-camera, hurling abuse. \u201cI would stand there, or he would, shouting horrific things, \u2018You\u2019re hopeless, you\u2019re never going to work again,\u2019 anything to get a response. Shooting gets monotonous. You do scenes over and over and over again. To try for something a little\u2026 spicier, it helps if someone is pushing you, provoking you.\u201d Jones says the pair repeated the same trick when they reteamed for <em>The Aeronauts</em>. Every day she and Redmayne would set out to ruin the other one\u2019s day, \u201cto get a fantastic close-up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d773ebe9671ad39fc9be4ae63d9162cae645da27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d773ebe9671ad39fc9be4ae63d9162cae645da27/0_330_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso in Star Wars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Block buster: joining the Hollywood A-list as Jyn Erso in Star Wars.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Olley/Lucasfilm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When <em>The Theory of Everything</em> came out, both Jones and Redmayne were nominated for the big-deal best-acting awards \u2013 Oscars, Globes, Baftas, all of which Redmayne won. Jones missed out, beaten in every case by Julianne Moore for <em>Still Alice</em>. She remembers it, now, as a blurry, happy period of brilliant good luck. \u201cWhich at the time I <em>totally</em> took for granted. I thought it would happen in every film. \u2018See you on the next red carpet!\u2019 It\u2019s only afterwards you see how special it was. How unique, for a film to hit the zeitgeist.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Jones, what does an experience like that do to the ego? \u201cThe ego\u2026 swells. It can feel as if <em>this</em> film is the most important thing of the moment, and you lose a bit of perspective.\u201d They\u2019d been pushing and pushing to get to Oscar night on 22 February, she recalls, and on 23 February, Jones says, only exaggerating slightly, everybody moved on. \u201cThe whole thing ends. It feels like you start again. But that\u2019s the job. It\u2019s a carnival, it\u2019s a travelling show. The tent comes down. There\u2019s the constant excitement and adrenaline and next minute no one cares. You can see why actors in the past have had such horrific lives. Drugs. You have to have some stability that\u2019s already there in you. You have to be able to ground yourself \u2013 come home. Take time to let your ego un-swell.\u201d</p> <p>A few years have passed since then. Jones went on to helm the billion-dollar-grossing <em>Star Wars</em> film, <em>Rogue One</em>. She married. She played Justice Ginsburg. Recently she signed on to make a George Clooney-directed space movie, out next year. Right now she\u2019s back on the promotional circuit with Redmayne for <em>The Aeronauts</em>. A winter release date, for a film like this, would tend to suggest there are studio hopes for the big awards. Who knows? Jones says: \u201cYou start to realise you have peaks and troughs. It\u2019s an undulating experience.\u201d She\u2019s inclined to go by the theory: \u201cHave a care for what you put out in the world, and then let the world do what it will.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019ve finished our lunch and reflexively we do that ugly, uncomfortable thing in times of Big News \u2013 we check our phones for updates. Jones says she\u2019s been thinking about Stephen Hawking a lot, in these times of political upheaval, all the disagreements and double-talk. Jones befriended the physicist during the course of making <em>The Theory of Everything</em> and when Hawking died last year, she attended the funeral. She has found herself wondering what he would make of it all. \u201cHe was such an important voice,\u201d she says, standing up. \u201cI <em>miss</em> it. I don\u2019t mean his voice-voice. His voice went, of course, he had a mechanical voice. I mean, I miss his articulacy.\u201d</p> <p>His reason, I suggest.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I miss his truthfulness.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugs. Gathers her stuff. The world carries on doing what it will.</p> <p><em>The Aeronauts is </em><em>in cinemas nationwide</em></p> <p><em>Stylist by Hope Lawrie; makeup by Mary Greenwell; hair by Leigh Keates at Premier Hair and Makeup</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The actor Felicity Jones, judged by dreary national statistics, is neither tall nor short: she\u2019s a bang-on average 5ft 3in. Measured by the slightly looser gauge in her imagination, though, Jones is a colossus, a towering church-and-steeple of a human being. She\u2019s got a basketballer\u2019s reach and a bodyguard\u2019s doorway-filling bulk. Even in flat-soled shoes, this 36-year-old can go around plucking stranded cats out of trees. \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve always felt bigger and taller than I am.\u201d In the past few years especially, the actor has made good use of this inside-outside differential. Whether it was playing the pioneering American judge, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in 2018\u2019s On the Basis of Sex, or earning an Oscar nomination as Jane Hawking, Stephen\u2019s formidable first wife, in 2015\u2019s The Theory of Everything, Jones has had an instinctive sense for the pathos and humour in characters whose physical slightness tends to trick others into overlooking them. In a Star Wars movie, 2016\u2019s Rogue One, she played a watchful and almost childlike guerrilla who ultimately tough-nutted past dozens of baddies to bring down an army. In her coming movie, The Aeronauts, she plays a 19th-century balloonist \u2013 a figure of fun to the scientists and flight enthusiasts of Victorian London, until she has to rescue one of them from death at 37,000ft. Jones meets me for lunch in a pub in north London. She is early, and pumped for some roast chicken. When our meals arrive she sets about eating and talking at an equally brisk clip. Although this can lead to accidents (she points out a stain on her sweatshirt), Jones is a cool bean and has that performer\u2019s knack, just about inexplicable to me, of chatting away fluently even after forking in a mouthful of drumstick meat. She\u2019s interesting and eloquent about her job, stiffer when it comes to talking about herself and her personal life. First we talk about the wider world, which seems, most weeks, to be falling to pieces. \u201cThere was that old-fashioned idea, years and years ago,\u201d she says, \u201cof a movie star who was this godlike being who never deigned to talk about anything mortal. But that\u2019s long gone.\u201d All for the better, she thinks. \u201cI\u2019m a constant news-checker. You can\u2019t not be, now. There\u2019s such chaos in the world. It seems to be our duty to be informed, to be abreast of things. Particularly in my work, now, I\u2019m not shy of things that have a strong ideology, that are political.\u201d Her Ginsburg biopic had an obvious liberal bent. The politics are more subtle in the new film The Aeronauts, directed by Tom Harper, written by Jack Thorne and co-starring Eddie Redmayne. He plays James Glaisher, one of the world\u2019s first meteorologists, a Victorian scientist who hoped to better understand our weather and our climate. In his studies of the upper atmosphere, he took the first steps towards understanding what damage we were doing up there, even then. A timely story to tell, Jones suggests. I ask her what she makes of the current political situation. \u201cUh. I\u2019m pretty disappointed, to be honest. It\u2019s been sort of devastating, the last few years. It\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d She recalls the time she spent in the company of Justice Ginsburg, becoming close to the 86-year-old while preparing to portray the older woman on screen. \u201cThat was life-changing for me,\u201d she says. \u201cSpending time with her. Getting to know her well. She has such integrity. And, particularly now, when we look around at public figures, when their integrity seems to have been left very, very far behind, and it seems as if everyone is acting out of this horrific personal interest\u2026\u201d She widens her arms, a gesture of vague despair that I take to mean: oh, for one or two more Ginsburgs. On the Basis of Sex, which partly focused on the relationship between Ginsburg and her husband Marty, played by Armie Hammer, got a lukewarm reception when it came out last year. Jones remembers the months spent promoting the movie around America, not always to the most receptive of audiences. \u201cI felt there was an ingrained sexism, at certain points, in response to the film. Even now it\u2019s hard to put out a film like that into the world, about female triumph, female success.\u201d She remembers the amazed reaction people had to Marty especially, who took on a secondary role in the marriage, better to support Ruth\u2019s ambitions. Up to that point, in a varied screen career, Jones had played opposite monsters, witches, a long-dead Peter Cushing who was digitally revived by animators for her Star Wars film, superheroes and aliens. But it was Marty Ginsburg who audiences refused to believe in. \u201cI was asked: \u2018Who is this man? Could he possibly exist? Is he a fantasy?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. Maybe change happens slowly. But it\u2019s hard at times not to get disheartened.\u201d Jones was born in a suburb of Birmingham, to parents who met while working on a local newspaper. They separated when she was young, and Jones has since said that the example of living with a working single mother helped instil in her a definite work ethic. Jones joined a drama group at 10 and got her first paid gig at 13, in an adventure movie, The Treasure Seekers, alongside a young Keira Knightley. They filmed during the school holidays. \u201cI remember liking how we were taken seriously, despite being young.\u201d At 15, she joined the cast of The Archers (playing Emma Carter in the radio soap until she was in her mid-20s) and put in the work while in secondary school as a magic-endowed school bully, Ethel, in a BBC adaptation of the Worst Witch books. Over lunch we talk about some of the complications associated with kids who take on adult jobs. Growing up too quickly. Missing out on parts of childhood. Jones cuts in on my examples. \u201cYou\u2019re asking, did I have the Judy Garland experience? On the uppers and downers?\u201d Sure, I say. How Judy were you? \u201cI was quite low on the Judy scale. Partly because my parents were strong about having an education, and keeping school going alongside acting. And partly because it felt like a hobby then. It was fun. It wasn\u2019t Judy. It wasn\u2019t a grind.\u201d Jones went to Oxford and studied English. Her freshers\u2019 week was unluckily timed. She had just done an ad for zit medication, which was nationally broadcast. \u201cI was one of two girls in a bedroom, talking about a guy named Rob. We bounced around, fell back on the bed, dreamed about this guy named Rob. And then we used some face wipes.\u201d As an undergrad she appeared in some earnest, bad student plays and, after graduating, moved to the southeast to set about auditioning for real. \u201cI look back on that time fondly. But I remember it being hectic. Chaotic. Everything up in the air. You got sent reams and reams of scenes to learn, for auditions that were always in Soho, and which you would never get. I remember always bumping into the same actors who were going through the system.\u201d She reels off the names: Carey Mulligan, Andrea Riseborough, Eddie Redmayne, Andrew Garfield, Tom Hardy\u2026 \u201cWe\u2019d see each other constantly.\u201d One by one, like fireworks, these other careers began to spark and take off. \u201cWe were all going for it. So you were disappointed if you didn\u2019t get something, when someone else did. It was funny. People would have these moments and suddenly go stratospheric. I guess I started to realise that everyone has their own unique selling points.\u201d When I ask Jones what her own unique selling point is, she raises an eyebrow, ironic. Isn\u2019t it obvious? \u201cMy height. My huge stature!\u201d She apes the voice of an imaginary casting director: \u201cShe took our breath away, that tall one. We\u2019ve got to get that tall girl back.\u201d That gang of Soho auditionees, with careers that one by one took off \u2013 was there rivalry between them? Is there still? Jones tilts her head. \u201cWe\u2019re all still friends. I\u2019m always interested in what choices they make. \u2018Ooh. That is interesting. They\u2019re doing a play now are they?\u2019 It\u2019s healthy competition. And it\u2019s nice to feel hungry.\u201d In the late 2000s Jones was in a bunch of TV shows: Austen adaptation, David Morrissey drama, Doctor Who cameo. She appeared in two Michael Grandage plays in the West End, and Julie Taymor cast her as Miranda in a Helen Mirren-led film of The Tempest. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant made her a co-lead in their curious, whimsical romcom from 2010, Cemetery Junction.

      "body": "<p>Last week, Sarah Frankcom left the Royal Exchange in Manchester, where she has been artistic director for the past 11 years. Her time in the city has been forceful and fruitful: distinctively feminist and strongly cooperative. The acting talent of Maxine Peake has been central to the theatre\u2019s identity, as has the writing of Stockport-born, London-based Simon Stephens.</p> <p>For Stephens\u2019s new play, he and Frankcom travelled to places in the north of England that had echoes in the dramatist\u2019s history but which he had never before visited; they collected biographies and anecdotes and have come up with a suitable valedictory production about a family whose members are scattered but not wholly divided: an elegy to the north.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/light-falls\" title=\"\">Light Falls</a></strong> begins at the end, with a cogent note on death described not only as the moment when your tense shifts from present to past, but when you move from first to third person. Which is what happens on stage, where Naomi Dawson\u2019s imposing design, bare save for a monumental flight of steps, creates an inside-outside space: a bedroom, a graveyard, sometimes intimate, sometimes public. As Rebecca Manley (fine-voiced and delicate) reaches for a bottle of vodka in a supermarket, she haemorrhages. She tells us she can smell fried eggs and that she is gathering her family around her in her thoughts. Then she moves to the side of the stage; her children and husband take over; she is no longer \u201cI\u201d but \u201cshe\u201d. At the moment of their mother\u2019s death, one daughter wakes up with an unfamiliar chap, another struggles with her new baby, a son settles happily with his boyfriend; the about-to-be widower (Lloyd Hutchinson) goes for a threesome. Slivers of action circle around each other, gradually coming together as variations on family life.</p> <p>In the course of the evening, three characters unleash great roars of pain; Hutchinson\u2019s is particularly unsettling: like the slow creak of a huge, rusty door.</p> <p>Jarvis Cocker\u2019s original music takes up a tiny a part of the evening (the Royal Exchange cheekily bills it so prominently you almost expect a musical). Yet it supplies a wonderful focus when what had been a solo plea becomes a chorus. I wish Cocker didn\u2019t talk of \u201cnorthern blood\u201d \u2013 which smacks of nationalism. But this may be a southerner\u2019s envy speaking: it\u2019s hard to imagine an elegy to the south that would not be riddled with rightwing chauvinism.</p> <p>The American playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/24/playwright-annie-baker-the-antipodes-national-theatre\" title=\"\">Annie Baker</a> has provided some of the best \u2013 most unnerving, most acute \u2013 evenings in the theatre of the past five years. Both <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/24/the-flick-national-theatre-review-another-world-losing-our-children-islamic-state-suicide\" title=\"\">The Flick</a></em> (set in a movie house after a show) and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/24/the-flick-national-theatre-review-another-world-losing-our-children-islamic-state-suicide%0D\" title=\"\">John</a></em> (a Gettysburg B&amp;B) rewired theatrical expectation. They questioned what counts as action on stage. Her plays, though often described as slow, are not sluggish \u2013 they super-saturate each moment with interest. They make distinctions between the everyday and the supernatural look trivial. And they make set design seem animate. It\u2019s worth remembering when Rufus Norris\u2019s National is criticised, that both <em>The Flick</em> and <em>John</em> have been seen there under his artistic directorship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ec804c013e6e37508c96eb67d2c0e1b7146b02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ec804c013e6e37508c96eb67d2c0e1b7146b02/0_313_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conleth Hill, centre, and cast in Annie Baker\u2019s The Antipodes at the National.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conleth Hill, centre, and cast in Annie Baker\u2019s The Antipodes at the National.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-antipodes\" title=\"\">The Antipodes</a></strong>, first staged in New York two years ago, glints with Baker\u2019s brilliance. Yet, although it\u2019s the most opaque of her three plays put on at the National, it seems to me the least subtle and probing. The declared subject matter is storytelling. We don\u2019t know to what end the seven blokes and one woman, gathered together around an oval glass table, are encouraged by a dodgily dominant chairman to spill their beans: about early sexual encounters ( does it help to have a bent penis?), about what qualifies as a monster (no trolls allowed), about the tales that infants tell, and about ancestral creation myths.</p> <p>The group may be dreaming up a movie or an ad: that is never made plain. They seem to be part of some corporate venture, with an overseeing boss who occasionally appears on screen and a chair who, in Conleth Hill\u2019s clever performance, bullies his colleagues with rumpled mildness and victimhood. Baker co-directs with designer Chloe Lamford, with some telling choreography by Sasha Milavic Davies \u2013 the cast swivelling together on their caster chairs in group-thinking mode.</p> <p>Arthur Darvill is whippety-good; Fisayo Akinade continues to power up his talent; Imogen Doel is exquisitely funny as a hair-flicking assistant with an enviable assortment of splashy onesies and an old-fashioned cutesy manner. The trouble is that storytelling \u2013 a word that I dread hearing on the radio \u2013 has become everyone\u2019s subject everywhere and all the time. It is now barely a topic: it is the element in which we swim, so all-inclusive, so infinitely expandable, both so obviously about everything other than itself and so obviously self-referencing. I prefer my Baker less theoretical and more peculiar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d70e1756cdd33fd2357bca58a908cd1f8fab2438\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d70e1756cdd33fd2357bca58a908cd1f8fab2438/0_213_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-r) Stefan Adegbola (Poggio di Chiusi), Hiran Abeysekera (Leonardo da Vinci) and Dickie Beau (Sandro Botticelli) in Botticelli in the Fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(L-r) Stefan Adegbola (Poggio di Chiusi), Hiran Abeysekera (Leonardo da Vinci) and Dickie Beau (Sandro Botticelli) in Botticelli in the Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paintings, plague, persecution. And pants. Lots of the latter \u2013 mostly off. Jordan Tannahill\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2019/botticelli-in-the-fire/\" title=\"\">Botticelli in the Fire</a></strong>, first produced in Toronto in 2016, brings the 21st century into Renaissance Florence, with the aim of queering history. So while the artist, \u201ca voracious bottom\u201d, is painting <em>The Birth of Venus</em> and going to bed with his model, he has the hots for Leonardo da Vinci, who puts in extra hours painting Venus\u2019s feet. The two painters (I don\u2019t want to think what this is code for) end up licking peanut butter from two sides of one knife. Savonarola threatens, as does plague; populist censoriousness is on the rise. The parallels between now and then attempt to be rousing but are only approximate. This does not feel like salvaging lost homosexual history but, rather, makes it look like mere Bottycelli.</p> <p>Blanche McIntyre directs with panache. In a golden circle created by Johanna Town\u2019s lighting, Dickie Beau\u2019s frenetic Botticelli is cradled in his mother\u2019s arms as if posing for a Piet\u00e0. With no rackets or balls in sight (unusual, in this production), Christopher Shutt\u2019s sound design makes a game of squash from the noise of the impacts. But it\u2019s hard to see what piety is being usefully dismantled or what piece of history truthfully redeemed.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of five)</em><br><em>Light Falls</em> \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>The Antipodes </em>\u2605\u2605\u2605<br><em>Botticelli in the Fire</em> \u2605\u2605</p> <p><br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/light-falls\" title=\"\">Light Falls</a> is at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, until 16 November<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-antipodes\" title=\"\">The Antipodes </a>is at the Dorfman, London, until 23 November<br>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.hampsteadtheatre.com/whats-on/2019/botticelli-in-the-fire/\" title=\"\">Botticelli in the Fire</a> is at Hampstead theatre, London, until 23 November</p>",

Her plays, though often described as slow, are not sluggish \u2013 they super-saturate each moment with interest. They make distinctions between the everyday and the supernatural look trivial. And they make set design seem animate. It\u2019s worth remembering when Rufus Norris\u2019s National is criticised, that both The Flick and John have been seen there under his artistic directorship. The Antipodes, first staged in New York two years ago, glints with Baker\u2019s brilliance. Yet, although it\u2019s the most opaque of her three plays put on at the National, it seems to me the least subtle and probing. The declared subject matter is storytelling. We don\u2019t know to what end the seven blokes and one woman, gathered together around an oval glass table, are encouraged by a dodgily dominant chairman to spill their beans: about early sexual encounters ( does it help to have a bent penis?), about what qualifies as a monster (no trolls allowed), about the tales that infants tell, and about ancestral creation myths. The group may be dreaming up a movie or an ad: that is never made plain. They seem to be part of some corporate venture, with an overseeing boss who occasionally appears on screen and a chair who, in Conleth Hill\u2019s clever performance, bullies his colleagues with rumpled mildness and victimhood. Baker co-directs with designer Chloe Lamford, with some telling choreography by Sasha Milavic Davies \u2013 the cast swivelling together on their caster chairs in group-thinking mode. Arthur Darvill is whippety-good; Fisayo Akinade continues to power up his talent; Imogen Doel is exquisitely funny as a hair-flicking assistant with an enviable assortment of splashy onesies and an old-fashioned cutesy manner. The trouble is that storytelling \u2013 a word that I dread hearing on the radio \u2013 has become everyone\u2019s subject everywhere and all the time. It is now barely a topic: it is the element in which we swim, so all-inclusive, so infinitely expandable, both so obviously about everything other than itself and so obviously self-referencing. I prefer my Baker less theoretical and more peculiar. Paintings, plague, persecution. And pants. Lots of the latter \u2013 mostly off. Jordan Tannahill\u2019s Botticelli in the Fire, first produced in Toronto in 2016, brings the 21st century into Renaissance Florence, with the aim of queering history. So while the artist, \u201ca voracious bottom\u201d, is painting The Birth of Venus and going to bed with his model, he has the hots for Leonardo da Vinci, who puts in extra hours painting Venus\u2019s feet. The two painters (I don\u2019t want to think what this is code for) end up licking peanut butter from two sides of one knife. Savonarola threatens, as does plague; populist censoriousness is on the rise. The parallels between now and then attempt to be rousing but are only approximate. This does not feel like salvaging lost homosexual history but, rather, makes it look like mere Bottycelli. Blanche McIntyre directs with panache. In a golden circle created by Johanna Town\u2019s lighting, Dickie Beau\u2019s frenetic Botticelli is cradled in his mother\u2019s arms as if posing for a Piet\u00e0. With no rackets or balls in sight (unusual, in this production), Christopher Shutt\u2019s sound design makes a game of squash from the noise of the impacts. But it\u2019s hard to see what piety is being usefully dismantled or what piece of history truthfully redeemed.

She is the author of four novels, most recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/lab-rats-dan-lyons-seasonal-associate-heike-geissler-review\" title=\"\">Seasonal Associate</a>, a highly acclaimed fictionalised account of a period she spent working in an Amazon warehouse in Leipzig.</em></p> <p>Oh, it\u2019s all so long ago, isn\u2019t it? When the wall came down I was 12 years old and crazy about belongings and about the world. I was embarrassed about coming from the GDR. I was embarrassed about going into shops in West Germany and being a grey and dark-blue complex of drab timidity amidst all the colours. With my first western money I bought myself a neon-coloured rucksack and a cassette recorder. I was already more colourful when I travelled with my mother in a packed train to Oberhausen in West Germany to see the acquaintances who had for years been sending us parcels for feast days and birthdays. I ate yoghurt for the first time, and liked it, and I draped myself in colours. Autumn colours were chic at the time: purple, ochre, etc.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"700a72d59d111382ea2b3e9ed2b59f9b0799b3f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/700a72d59d111382ea2b3e9ed2b59f9b0799b3f1/329_398_3170_3962/800.jpg\" alt=\"Heike Geissler photographed near her home in Leipzig.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heike Geissler photographed near her home in Leipzig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sauer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe I\u2019d just lost interest in politics. If only I knew. At any rate Ernst Th\u00e4lmann (the leader of the Communist Party who was later shot in Buchenwald) had recently been my hero, I\u2019d wanted to be like him, and I\u2019d thought about how he had managed to fashion a little inkwell with the bread that a prison warder had given him, fill it with milk and thus have a source of invisible ink that he could eat straight away if he had to. I wondered about that, and a moment later I wondered what it would be like to live with Martin Lee Gore (of synth-pop band Depeche Mode). I papered my room with posters of him, I dreamt about him, I was, even though I wasn\u2019t quite a grown-up, Martin Lee Gore\u2019s wife.</p> <p>You probably didn\u2019t know that before, but now you do. What I didn\u2019t know for a long time: I was a torment to my parents, because capitalism now gripped me as firmly by the hand as the Pioneer Organisation had done before. As soon as it was there I was its willing talking doll, its passionate advocate, and I was right at the front of the queue of people buying and coveting consumer goods. I appropriated externals as if nothing else existed, and spent all my time observing who had what, and who had more, and established without much difficulty that we had less. To be precise, that was how things had seemed to me even before the wall came down, but now the differences were getting bigger. I couldn\u2019t see what was being lost. I\u2019ve only come to see it recently. I could see only what I didn\u2019t have, and I was busy making demands and seeing those demands become reality. I never made any political demands, so for example I never complained in a public place about the new and much more visible distribution of money and opportunities; instead all my demands were made on my parents.</p> <p>So I think I spent the years of growth after the fall of the GDR shopping. I barely knew how to do anything else but seek out those swiftly erected tent constructions full of cardboard boxes that contained all kinds of wonderful and desirable-looking cheap clothes, and later the new branches of large chains, afternoon after afternoon, and looking, wanting, buying. In retrospect I hold my hand up in front of my nose, because it smells of smoke. I remember that the nearby block where the Vietnamese guest-workers lived was said to be on fire. It\u2019s clear in my memory that the fire had been started deliberately. I see people running, I see the excitement, I sense it, but perhaps it wasn\u2019t even on fire, I\u2019m not sure. But I remember very clearly that something was on fire somewhere for a while.</p> <p>Forgive me, I wanted to talk about my behaviour as a consumer and how it changed, but I got distracted.</p> <p>Forgive me again. I worked out that I didn\u2019t want to say anything more about my behaviour as a consumer, because what is there to say about it that you yourself haven\u2019t known for ages? So for the first few years after the fall of the wall I became a master at falling into every single consumer trap put in my way, over and over again. I am, and perhaps you need to know this, the child of determined players of the lottery. What we lived on, what fed us, was the hope of a big win, never the hope of political change. I am the daughter of a mother who rationalised herself out of her own job in 1992 whether out of negligence or honesty or both, I\u2019m not sure. I am the daughter of a father who dreamt of reaching the age of retirement years before he actually retired. I see my father sitting in the living-room in the morning. The living room in this low-rise on the edge of the forest looks like a diorama with a set that could have been made for a post-wall museum: Father (38) on short time sitting silently in his armchair. The armchair is turned towards the television. The television is off. There is no sound in the living-room. The father is the silent type anyway. The daughter stands on the edge of the diorama, between the dining area and the corridor, looking at the father; her mouth is half-open and she is dreaming about the world, and secretly of being a global star, although nothing came of it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7cfc7aa963e84e77db431ad00d7d1e27872420e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7cfc7aa963e84e77db431ad00d7d1e27872420e/0_14_2896_1847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A German policeman with flowers on his uniform mingles with the celebrating crowds\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A German policeman with flowers on his uniform mingles with the celebrating crowds, November 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Emotional though it might sound, what\u2019s needed is exchange rather than boundaries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m a writer, I was born in the former GDR, I live in the state of Saxony, notorious for its strong rightwing scene. You could describe me as an east German, but I place no value on that, I\u2019m not comfortable with the term, and I\u2019m not trying to become comfortable with it either. When I think east German and at the same time think west German, I immediately think about how my country was sold off piecemeal, about how lives were devalued, about how conversations were curtailed, and I think about solutions other than the unification of the two German states. Solutions which were discussed, which could have happened and which, from the perspective of the present day \u2013 when for example all needs can be satisfied with a small amount of money and when pretty much all properties are sold and all districts gentrified \u2013 seem more exciting and worthwhile than the status quo, which everybody I know finds extremely tiring. The term east German triggers unpleasant memories about my own greed, about GDR citizens\u2019 desire for the Deutschmark, and their urging towards the unification of the two German states. It\u2019s a phrase that also conjures up injustices. I\u2019m thinking about west Germans who were eloquently and jovially able to impress, who occupied lucrative positions and transferred to us structures from their own country which I was unable to examine and question at the time. (As I said, I only ever thought about consumption.) I think about articles that still forget to mention the existence of the GDR or just mention it in self-justificatory sub-clauses to do their duty. I think of imperfection, repression and miscommunication. But I don\u2019t want to describe myself as an east German because I think that would mean getting involved in a competition for media attention and helping to set one past against another. Emotional though it might sound, what\u2019s needed is exchange rather than boundaries, so while I may have been a citizen of the GDR I\u2019m not prepared to become an east German. I\u2019m a German, because my passport tells me so. That\u2019s label and challenge enough. <strong>Translated by Shaun Whiteside</strong></p> <h2>Maxim Leo: \u2018Let me tell you a funny east German story\u2026\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d8a0d7ac6e048838a3f4c4dd9919d7365c7da2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d8a0d7ac6e048838a3f4c4dd9919d7365c7da2f/0_73_2441_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maxim Leo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"586\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Maxim Leo, 49, is a screenwriter, author and journalist. Born and raised in East Berlin, he continues to live in the city, where he is editor of the Berliner Zeitung. His memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/05/red-love-maxim-leo-review\" title=\"\">Red Love: The Story of an East German Family</a>, won the European Book prize.</em></p> <p>Germans like anniversaries; they give such a clear shape to history. At these times you can simplify complicated things a bit, smooth out the contradictions. The GDR, which repeatedly comes back to life on these dates, long ago became a kind of museum country. These days hardly anybody wants to know what the East German state was really like; instead the same stories are told over and over again, about very brave civil rights activists or very nasty Stasi people. Normal people seldom appear in these stories, and the German Democratic Republic has long since rigidified into a historical caricature.</p> <p>That is primarily because west Germans don\u2019t want to know anything at all; they simply want confirmation that they were on the right side and east Germans were on the wrong side. West Germans also like it when you\u2019re grateful to them for sharing their wealth and their constitution with us [former east Germans]. If you\u2019re not grateful enough, west Germans get angry.</p> <p>For their part, east Germans stopped explaining themselves ages go. Sometimes they still point out hesitantly that it didn\u2019t rain all the time even in the GDR, that even under a dictatorship people were able to fall in love. That a genuinely normal life was possible even in a non-normal country. But then people in the west start wailing that the dictatorship is being played down, the GDR is being nostalgically transformed. So east Germans fall silent again, because what\u2019s the point?</p> <p>I myself always feel bad on these big anniversaries, because I can\u2019t help remembering the student from D\u00fcsseldorf that I met at my first party in west Berlin shortly after the fall of the wall. I had just bought a Billy bookcase at Ikea with my DM100 welcome money. When I was assembling the shelves I\u2019d accidently hit my thumb with the hammer. My thumbnail was brown and swollen. At the party the student from D\u00fcsseldorf asked me what had happened to my thumb. I told him that in school in the GDR they hit you on the thumb with a hammer if you didn\u2019t do your homework. And because I forgot my homework a lot, after 10 years of torture my thumb was pretty much beyond saving.</p> <p>The student gave me a look full of surprise and pity. He would probably have believed me if I\u2019d told him that pupils with bad marks were shot at the end of the school year. For those young west Germans the GDR was so completely wicked anything was imaginable. I wanted to confess that evening, tell the student I\u2019d been talking nonsense, but we lost sight of each other and I never saw him again. Since then, every anniversary, I imagine the student from D\u00fcsseldorf, years later, telling his children about that strange east Berliner with the battered thumb, that torture victim of the rogue East German state. So I\u2019m not entirely innocent when it comes to the fact that the GDR only exists nowadays as a horror version of itself.</p> <p>Also regular as clockwork on the anniversary come the reports about the state of German unity. And each time there\u2019s a huge sense of disappointment because east Germans are still so different. So strange, so ungrateful, so hard to train. East Germans vote for the right, they don\u2019t like foreigners, they don\u2019t believe in God, they eat a lot of meat and hardly have any children, but they do have a higher than average amount of sex. Worst are east German men, who are seen as left behind, frustrated, aggressive, uneducated, racist, homeless, wifeless. Has there, since Gollum from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, been an uglier creature than the east German man?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fcb4afe1faa654a69838afc67506c470b8bc45f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcb4afe1faa654a69838afc67506c470b8bc45f2/0_17_1344_1967/683.jpg\" alt=\"Berliners celebrate on top of the wall as East Germans flood through into West Berlin at Potsdamer Platz.\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berliners celebrate on top of the wall as East Germans flood through into West Berlin at Potsdamer Platz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I write these lines as an aggrieved party. I\u2019ve been an east German man since I was born. And I\u2019m often asked to appear as crown witness; particularly on anniversaries I\u2019m supposed to explain myself and my odd compatriots. Last week a woman called me up from the radio. She said she\u2019d like to do an interview. With me as an east German. \u201cPerhaps you could give us a bit of an introduction to some of the peculiarities of east Germans,\u201d she said. It sounded as if I was a native of Papua New Guinea.</p> <p>A few days earlier, Deutsche Welle radio had given me a call, as had a paper from Munich and a French radio station. They all urgently need east Germans for the big anniversary. \u201cAs witty as possible\u201d, \u201cas original as possible\u201d, \u201cwith a wink, you know, Mr Leo\u201d. That\u2019s the new trend in the GDR history business. A few years ago people in the west only wanted to hear sad stories; now the tales have to be funny. No problem. Over the years I\u2019ve become a professional east German. If people want Stasi, I give them Stasi. And if people want to laugh, I\u2019ll keep chucking those funny stories at them until the earth shakes.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t planned to be a professional east German. You might say I just slipped into it. There was a great need for east German stories and, to be honest, I needed the money. Ten years ago, at the last big anniversary, I had written a book about my East German family. I did a reading tour and, after many evenings in the west German provinces, I was lying in bed in the Intercity Hotel in Celle one night, thinking about how damned ironic history is: who would have expected the GDR, of all places, to involve so much world travel?</p> <p>Recently, incidentally, I\u2019ve felt very close to the British, because so many people are disappointed by the British right now, and no one really understands the British any more. I have an idea: how about the British split from Northern Ireland and unify with east Germany instead? I see a lot of parallels and advantages there. But let\u2019s talk about that some other time, when we\u2019ve got a bit of peace and quiet. <strong>Translated by Shaun Whiteside</strong></p> <h2>Bernhard Schlink: \u2018East and West Germans were curious about each other, delighted in each other\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b64f74b5ec92af4af74f7bc9abc6040b1d5b37ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b64f74b5ec92af4af74f7bc9abc6040b1d5b37ef/189_1435_4018_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernhard Schlink\" width=\"1000\" height=\"598\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Bernhard Schlink is a writer, lawyer and academic.

Otherwise people did what they always do; they went to work, did their shopping, sat in caf\u00e9s. History is everyday life.</p> <p>But that November everyday life was light-hearted and cheerful. Rather than the low grey clouds that usually hang above the city in November, the sun was shining. Grumpy Berliners smiled. East and West Berliners exchanged greetings. The Volkspolizei were not just friendly, they were glad that they finally could be friendly. The first days, the first weeks after the fall of the wall, were a German-German love-fest. East and West Germans were curious about each other, intrigued by each other, talked to each other, delighted in each other.

I was the son of a Protestant pastor, and Protestant eastern Germany, the land of Luther and Bach and Zinzendorf, was my Germany just as much as the Catholic Rhineland was. In the 1960s I studied in West Berlin, had friends in East Berlin and went there regularly until I helped my girlfriend escape from East to West and risked arrest and imprisonment if I set foot in East Berlin again. When the relationship between the Federal Republic and the GDR normalised and I could once again travel there safely, I drove with my son through the East German cities and landscapes, poorer and greyer than their West German counterparts, sometimes in a lamentable state, but sometimes with a touching simplicity too \u2013 and, unlike West Germany, not ravaged by brutalist architecture and colourful advertising. We encountered the older Germany that could still be found there in those days and now no longer exists.</p> <p>When I came back from Berlin to Bonn, where I was professor of public law at the university, I received an enquiry about teaching in East Berlin. One of my colleagues knew a colleague at Humboldt University and had the impression they were looking for a visiting professor from the West now that the wall had fallen. He couldn\u2019t take it on himself, for he couldn\u2019t stand the winter air in East Berlin, where lignite was used for heating. I didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment, travelled back to Berlin to introduce myself at Humboldt University, realised that they didn\u2019t really want anyone from the West, but thought that they were supposed to, and I settled for that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/bernhard-schlink-germany-burden-euro-crisis\">Bernhard Schlink: being German is a huge burden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was how I ended up teaching a class on fundamental rights and another on constitutional theory in January 1990 as the first visiting professor from the Federal Republic of Germany to teach at Humboldt University. After the second session, a colleague invited me to participate as an expert in deliberations to draft a new constitution for the GDR. Over the next two months, I shared the hopes involved in drafting the new constitution. It was intended to be a free, constitutional, democratic underpinning for the GDR that would preserve the legacy of the peaceful revolution, allowing the GDR to enter into reunification negotiations with self-assurance and confidence. It was meant to be a contribution to reinventing Germany. In March, however, after the first and last free elections in the GDR, it was clear that reunification would come so quickly that plans to develop a new GDR constitution were already obsolete.</p> <p>In March, the love-fest between the two Germanies also drew to a close. The economic problems involved in reunification became apparent. Switching from life under socialism to life in a capitalist system was not easy for many East Germans, and it became clear that their experiences and knowledge were unappreciated, while the penalties imposed on those who had spied for the State Security Service affected both those who deserved them and those who did not. Advisers and visitors from the West were nicknamed \u201cBesserwessis\u201d (a pun on \u201cBesserwisser\u201d, the German term for \u201cknow-it-alls\u201d); many of them were convinced that they did indeed know better and treated the East Germans as annoying, impoverished, helpless relatives. The wounds inflicted in that period have still not fully healed.</p> <p>We did not reinvent Germany. We did not even reinvent Humboldt University, as we had hoped we would in 1990 and 1991; it has become a German university like any other. Many things have become more difficult in Germany. Often Germans from the new federal states in the east and the old federal states in the west act as if there were an awkward distance between them, reacting to their differences as if they were annoying rather than a blessing. But I have confidence in the future. Great gifts change your life and cannot just blithely be chalked up as a turn for the better; you need to get to grips with them. It remains a great gift that Germany is reunited, a gift I delight in over and over again \u2013 when I cycle through the Brandenburg Gate to Humboldt University, when I travel through Brandenburg, go hiking in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains or see the sun rise over the Baltic Sea in R\u00fcgen. <strong>Bernhard Schlink</strong></p> <h2>Norman Ohler: \u2018The fall of the wall was a source of kinetic energy that we lived off for years\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f707d85c4e11113d55b5d118f5c964700abee29d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f707d85c4e11113d55b5d118f5c964700abee29d/0_1922_4642_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Ohler, at home in Berlin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Ohler, at home in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malte Jaeger/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Norman Ohler was born in 1970 in the west German town of Zweibr\u00fccken.

Ohler lives in Berlin.</em></p> <p>It was the moment everything changed, and I became a writer.</p> <p>Before then it had still been the 80s, the cold war, and it was clearly always going to be like that: the wall, which was after all a wall in people\u2019s heads too, would never fall, and I, a politicised teenager at the time, was going to be a journalist \u2013 I would furiously attack the state of things in the progressive media: the propaganda, the cold war\u2026</p> <p>Even the day before the wall actually did come down in that moment of ecstasy, incredibly I didn\u2019t have the slightest inkling. None of us did. And then it happened. And I\u2019ll never forget how it happened. It was at about 7pm on 9 November 1989, during a really boring hour-long press conference [on live TV] by a second-rate politburo official called G\u00fcnter Schabowski. Among other things, he answered questions about a new draft GDR travel law that he said also included some transit regulations. Schabowski himself could barely get through the GDR polit-speak of the text, and rustled his papers despairingly, cleared his throat helplessly a few times and eventually, because he wanted to get it over with, announced that in his view the freedom of GDR citizens to travel to West Germany applied with immediate effect, which, in spite of the unease that suddenly spread through the room \u2013 some journalists were open-mouthed \u2013 was nothing really special as far as he was concerned, since the GDR had always described itself as a democracy, the only form of society that guaranteed the freedom of its subjects.</p> <p>The result of Schabowski\u2019s confusion was that immediately after the end of the conference \u2013 when he did finally call it a day \u2013 hundreds of thousands of people in Berlin went out and knocked down the wall that same night. A Kafkaesque momentum had been set in motion, and this time it wasn\u2019t lack of freedom that revealed itself, as usually happens in bureaucratic processes, but a fairytale breach that opened up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s this idea of possibility. This transformation of hollow phrase and hackneyed term into a magically charged space</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At that moment I was 800km away in the small West German town where I was born, but I did have access to a car, and the next morning I called in at my grammar school to announce that I was taking the day off, sped up the autobahn and, seven hours later, reached Berlin just in time.</p> <p>It was already getting dark as I climbed up on to one of those platforms that still stood around from before, from which West Germans would look over the wall into the east. Over there, everywhere I looked, a GDR soldier was kneeling on the wall and dividing the sections with a jackhammer \u2013 total rock\u2019n\u2019roll as well as an anticipation of techno \u2013 before a bulldozer came, with a kind of claw, to tear the segments individually out of the earth with military precision and then drive off with them somewhere at the back to dump them on the scrapheap of history. As each passageway was opened up it immediately filled with people who flowed in from east to west, and suddenly a young woman of 18 or so (the same age as me) was standing next to me, asking excitedly what was over there. \u201cWell, East Berlin,\u201d I replied, surprised, but she said she knew that already, she was from there, in fact, she had asked the question in a much bigger context. That was my first encounter with an East Berliner, and with her words she tore away something inside me that continues to define my life today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/02/i-had-an-intimate-knowledge-of-hitler-norman-ohler-blitzed\">'I had an intimate knowledge of Hitler's drug habit that no one else possessed'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s this idea of possibility. This transformation of hollow phrase and hackneyed term into a magically charged space \u2013 the change, for me personally, from journalist to writer and poet. The 90s began on that day, 9 November 1989, thanks to the inattentiveness of one police officer. The whole of world history was changed by a poetic moment at a press conference that was actually designed to exclude such moments. Since then anything has seemed possible to me, and my first three novels, about global revolution, the metropolises of New York, Johannesburg and indeed Berlin, emerged from the big bang that atomised the Berlin Wall. The fall of the wall gave Germany an incredible, positive boost, because for so many people who experienced it, myself included, it was a source of kinetic energy that they lived off for many years.</p> <p>Of course that energy dissipated in the end, and we are now back in a situation in Europe in which we no longer have a warm welcome for refugees who manage to get over its walls, we no longer want to learn from them. Instead Europe has slipped into a xenophobic rigidity that wants separation rather than unification. So we need new collective experiences that will give us back the strength that the politicians \u2013 as privileged people who can travel freely \u2013 have systematically tried to steal from us. We need people in the streets who will physically work for change. It wasn\u2019t capitalism that won in the fall of the Berlin Wall, but a human need for freedom. Our future is much too precious to be left to politicians and their empty words. <strong>Translated by Shaun Whiteside</strong></p> <h2>Julia Franck: \u2018Berlin today is a city of enthusiastic dreamers \u2013 with several jobs each\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"633a51e348690744604e76f9130578d20eed3e30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/633a51e348690744604e76f9130578d20eed3e30/48_195_2700_1597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Franck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"591\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Julia Franck is the author of five novels including The Blind Side of the Heart, a family drama set in postwar Germany, which won the German book prize and sold over a million copies in Germany alone.

Thanks to the curiosity of a lot of people from far away, and the hopes and dreams they brought with them, over the past 30 years this city has rapidly changed and internationalised like no other in Germany. Of all major European cities, Berlin is perhaps not only the youngest, but the one with a thousand broken bones; the craziest one, the one with the most tangible and visible scars left by wars and culture. It is like a poor, beautiful woman, dressed up and wearing makeup, but squalid and scruffy \u2013 she needs visitors, tourists and lovers to keep her going with their fantasies and money. Whether you seek a retreat into ascetic silence or anonymity, or the passionate thrill of nightlife \u2013 anything is possible here. Though Berlin\u2019s economy lies idle, tourism and foreign investors have cranked up the property market to unreachable heights. Berliners scarcely have jobs, pensions or savings that would make life in the city viable in the long term. But Berlin belongs to visionaries, dreamers and individualists from all over the place who either bring money with them or struggle, modestly and ambitiously, to survive in their particular niches. Students and artists get by, enriching the city with their inexhaustible creativity and self-exploitation, living hand to mouth while working on their concert or video or 1,000-page novel.</p> <p>Our family lived barely four kilometres from the west, with only the Spree and the wall, with its threat of deadly punishment in between. When the wall was built in 1961 and sealed with orders to shoot on sight, my uncle, 18 at the time, killed himself. In 1972, my 21-year-old aunt fled to the west in an empty fuel tanker. My single mother made her first application for an exit visa in 1974. After a ban on employment and various other kinds of chicanery, her application \u2013 for herself and her daughters, four of them at the time \u2013 was finally authorised in 1978. The five of us lived for almost nine months in a single room in Marienfelde refugee camp in west Berlin, the destination for all eastern European cold war refugees. It was a long time, even after we were granted asylum, before we felt properly integrated. The camp still exists, and has been used often in the 30 years since the fall of the wall: in the early 1990s, for emigrants from the former Soviet Union and Poland, later for war refugees from the Balkans and other parts of eastern Europe, and today for refugees from Syria and south-east Europe. In 2014 there was a surge of violence in the camp, when about 100 Muslim Chechens <a href=\"https://www.intoleranceagainstchristians.eu/index.php?id=12&amp;case=1435\" title=\"\">beat up</a> 30 Syrian Christians. The situation in camps, with people of different origin, religion and perspective, is never easy. Yet the countless people who have come to Germany from all corners of the planet over the past 30 years have enriched it hugely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"758db13407e27a5bf084b6a2d06ad16f63963179\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/758db13407e27a5bf084b6a2d06ad16f63963179/0_28_4368_2610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists pose at the replica hut on the site of Checkpoint Charlie, Berlin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"598\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists pose at the replica hut on the site of Checkpoint Charlie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the war, the divided Germans, supervised and strongly supported by the Allies, set up a new form of democratic state in west Germany and an astonishing economic miracle developed, offering those born there in the postwar period the promise of self-advancement. My generation in the west grew up with the promise that things would only get better and better. But by the mid-80s, with growing globalisation, then perestroika and the fall of the wall and reunification, it became clear that the economic miracle was over: Germany\u2019s favourite child, Federal Savings Bonds, were abolished, and after reunification the unemployment rate in some regions of the east rose to 25%, although it has been falling constantly since 2005 across the whole of Germany. There is a worsening shortage of permanent, well-paid jobs, and our generation\u2019s pension expectations have declined sharply. Despite rising numbers of high-school graduations and improvements in final exam grades, literacy rates are falling, education in schools is deteriorating and failing to promote social integration, health insurance is more and more expensive, incomes are plummeting and, as in most countries, social inequality has worsened.</p> <p>In the east, many people\u2019s careers and lives were badly affected by the fall of the wall. Whole regions of the former GDR lie abandoned, because so many went to the west in search of work. While most west Germans were able to look forward to the legacy of their economic-miracle parents, hardly anyone in east inherits anything \u2013 they didn\u2019t have private property or an economic miracle there. Instead they had the guardianship of the state \u2013 familiar from all dictatorships \u2013 whose watchful eye encouraged an attitude of entitlement and immaturity. Anyone who supported the system, anyone who worked for the Party or the Stasi, could make a career inside the system without making any great sacrifice in terms of time or intellect, and be sure of being provided for through their entire lives. With that security gone, there is no cushion for the economic downturn in the east. Such social and economic fissures, and the different forms they assume in east and west, make many people, particularly in the east, feel like the losers and victims of reunification. In the last elections people, having lost faith in both democracy and government, turned their backs on the big political parties and vented their defiance as <em>Wutb\u00fcrger</em> \u2013 furious citizens. That should be taken as an alarm signal. These people who feel left behind radicalise themselves individually or flee to politically extreme parties. Their fear of the future finds expression in rage and hatred at \u201cfake news\u201d, the government and immigration. Today some Germans in both east and west see reunification as a mistake.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/16/back-to-back-julia-franck-review\">Back to Back by Julia Franck \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berlin, though, as a formerly divided city, occupies a special place in all this. Here we see a growth in the <em>Prekariat \u2013</em> those with little purchasing power, who live a precarious existence on the poverty line. The sort of people who come to Berlin are looking more to pursue their independent social, creative or political vision than for promises of security and financial gain. \u201cYou can\u2019t want to incur losses?\u201d said my first and last financial adviser, to which I replied: \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I want and have to do.\u201d My \u20ac5,000 shares were now worth only half that, but I had to pay my rent, I\u2019d missed out on a job and I needed to finish a book.</p> <p>In spite of the crash and social and democratic crisis, we still live in one of the wealthiest and the freest countries in the world, our taps produce clean drinking water, our rubbish is full of discarded food and we live in precious peace. If I\u2019ve had 10 bikes stolen in Berlin in the past eight years, I see this irritation as a tribute to our free, wild city. I\u2019d rather have a bicycle nicked once a year than give up cycling or live in a surveillance state with gated residential communities, in houses and streets with cameras, armed security staff and the death penalty. At the moment, unemployment in Berlin is only 8%, but with all their many jobs Berliners still earn much less than people in west Germany. Rents and prices are soaring, and yet in Berlin only 14% live in their own properties, 52% of households are single occupancy, and the trend is rising. We are a city of enthusiastic dreamers who do several jobs on the side to pay the rent. We are lucky to be a diverse international metropolis, in which every language in the world is spoken and in which a culture of social tolerance means we are able to contain the conflicts that arise among us. <strong>Translated by Shaun Whiteside</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Heike Geissler: \u2018For the first few years, I fell into every single consumer trap put in my way\u2019 Heike Geissler was born in 1977 in Riesa in the former German Democratic Republic. She is the author of four novels, most recently Seasonal Associate, a highly acclaimed fictionalised account of a period she spent working in an Amazon warehouse in Leipzig. Oh, it\u2019s all so long ago, isn\u2019t it? When the wall came down I was 12 years old and crazy about belongings and about the world. I was embarrassed about coming from the GDR. I was embarrassed about going into shops in West Germany and being a grey and dark-blue complex of drab timidity amidst all the colours. With my first western money I bought myself a neon-coloured rucksack and a cassette recorder. I was already more colourful when I travelled with my mother in a packed train to Oberhausen in West Germany to see the acquaintances who had for years been sending us parcels for feast days and birthdays. I ate yoghurt for the first time, and liked it, and I draped myself in colours. Autumn colours were chic at the time: purple, ochre, etc. Maybe I\u2019d just lost interest in politics. If only I knew. At any rate Ernst Th\u00e4lmann (the leader of the Communist Party who was later shot in Buchenwald) had recently been my hero, I\u2019d wanted to be like him, and I\u2019d thought about how he had managed to fashion a little inkwell with the bread that a prison warder had given him, fill it with milk and thus have a source of invisible ink that he could eat straight away if he had to. I wondered about that, and a moment later I wondered what it would be like to live with Martin Lee Gore (of synth-pop band Depeche Mode). I papered my room with posters of him, I dreamt about him, I was, even though I wasn\u2019t quite a grown-up, Martin Lee Gore\u2019s wife. You probably didn\u2019t know that before, but now you do. What I didn\u2019t know for a long time: I was a torment to my parents, because capitalism now gripped me as firmly by the hand as the Pioneer Organisation had done before. As soon as it was there I was its willing talking doll, its passionate advocate, and I was right at the front of the queue of people buying and coveting consumer goods. I appropriated externals as if nothing else existed, and spent all my time observing who had what, and who had more, and established without much difficulty that we had less. To be precise, that was how things had seemed to me even before the wall came down, but now the differences were getting bigger. I couldn\u2019t see what was being lost. I\u2019ve only come to see it recently. I could see only what I didn\u2019t have, and I was busy making demands and seeing those demands become reality. I never made any political demands, so for example I never complained in a public place about the new and much more visible distribution of money and opportunities; instead all my demands were made on my parents. So I think I spent the years of growth after the fall of the GDR shopping. I barely knew how to do anything else but seek out those swiftly erected tent constructions full of cardboard boxes that contained all kinds of wonderful and desirable-looking cheap clothes, and later the new branches of large chains, afternoon after afternoon, and looking, wanting, buying. In retrospect I hold my hand up in front of my nose, because it smells of smoke. I remember that the nearby block where the Vietnamese guest-workers lived was said to be on fire. It\u2019s clear in my memory that the fire had been started deliberately. I see people running, I see the excitement, I sense it, but perhaps it wasn\u2019t even on fire, I\u2019m not sure. But I remember very clearly that something was on fire somewhere for a while. Forgive me, I wanted to talk about my behaviour as a consumer and how it changed, but I got distracted. Forgive me again. I worked out that I didn\u2019t want to say anything more about my behaviour as a consumer, because what is there to say about it that you yourself haven\u2019t known for ages? So for the first few years after the fall of the wall I became a master at falling into every single consumer trap put in my way, over and over again. I am, and perhaps you need to know this, the child of determined players of the lottery. What we lived on, what fed us, was the hope of a big win, never the hope of political change. I am the daughter of a mother who rationalised herself out of her own job in 1992 whether out of negligence or honesty or both, I\u2019m not sure. I am the daughter of a father who dreamt of reaching the age of retirement years before he actually retired. I see my father sitting in the living-room in the morning. The living room in this low-rise on the edge of the forest looks like a diorama with a set that could have been made for a post-wall museum: Father (38) on short time sitting silently in his armchair. The armchair is turned towards the television. The television is off. There is no sound in the living-room. The father is the silent type anyway. The daughter stands on the edge of the diorama, between the dining area and the corridor, looking at the father; her mouth is half-open and she is dreaming about the world, and secretly of being a global star, although nothing came of it. I\u2019m a writer, I was born in the former GDR, I live in the state of Saxony, notorious for its strong rightwing scene. You could describe me as an east German, but I place no value on that, I\u2019m not comfortable with the term, and I\u2019m not trying to become comfortable with it either. When I think east German and at the same time think west German, I immediately think about how my country was sold off piecemeal, about how lives were devalued, about how conversations were curtailed, and I think about solutions other than the unification of the two German states. Solutions which were discussed, which could have happened and which, from the perspective of the present day \u2013 when for example all needs can be satisfied with a small amount of money and when pretty much all properties are sold and all districts gentrified \u2013 seem more exciting and worthwhile than the status quo, which everybody I know finds extremely tiring. The term east German triggers unpleasant memories about my own greed, about GDR citizens\u2019 desire for the Deutschmark, and their urging towards the unification of the two German states. It\u2019s a phrase that also conjures up injustices. I\u2019m thinking about west Germans who were eloquently and jovially able to impress, who occupied lucrative positions and transferred to us structures from their own country which I was unable to examine and question at the time. (As I said, I only ever thought about consumption.) I think about articles that still forget to mention the existence of the GDR or just mention it in self-justificatory sub-clauses to do their duty. I think of imperfection, repression and miscommunication. But I don\u2019t want to describe myself as an east German because I think that would mean getting involved in a competition for media attention and helping to set one past against another. Emotional though it might sound, what\u2019s needed is exchange rather than boundaries, so while I may have been a citizen of the GDR I\u2019m not prepared to become an east German. I\u2019m a German, because my passport tells me so. That\u2019s label and challenge enough. Translated by Shaun Whiteside Maxim Leo: \u2018Let me tell you a funny east German story\u2026\u2019 Maxim Leo, 49, is a screenwriter, author and journalist. Born and raised in East Berlin, he continues to live in the city, where he is editor of the Berliner Zeitung. His memoir, Red Love: The Story of an East German Family, won the European Book prize. Germans like anniversaries; they give such a clear shape to history. At these times you can simplify complicated things a bit, smooth out the contradictions. The GDR, which repeatedly comes back to life on these dates, long ago became a kind of museum country. These days hardly anybody wants to know what the East German state was really like; instead the same stories are told over and over again, about very brave civil rights activists or very nasty Stasi people. Normal people seldom appear in these stories, and the German Democratic Republic has long since rigidified into a historical caricature. That is primarily because west Germans don\u2019t want to know anything at all; they simply want confirmation that they were on the right side and east Germans were on the wrong side. West Germans also like it when you\u2019re grateful to them for sharing their wealth and their constitution with us [former east Germans]. If you\u2019re not grateful enough, west Germans get angry. For their part, east Germans stopped explaining themselves ages go. Sometimes they still point out hesitantly that it didn\u2019t rain all the time even in the GDR, that even under a dictatorship people were able to fall in love. That a genuinely normal life was possible even in a non-normal country. But then people in the west start wailing that the dictatorship is being played down, the GDR is being nostalgically transformed. So east Germans fall silent again, because what\u2019s the point? I myself always feel bad on these big anniversaries, because I can\u2019t help remembering the student from D\u00fcsseldorf that I met at my first party in west Berlin shortly after the fall of the wall. I had just bought a Billy bookcase at Ikea with my DM100 welcome money. When I was assembling the shelves I\u2019d accidently hit my thumb with the hammer. My thumbnail was brown and swollen. At the party the student from D\u00fcsseldorf asked me what had happened to my thumb. I told him that in school in the GDR they hit you on the thumb with a hammer if you didn\u2019t do your homework. And because I forgot my homework a lot, after 10 years of torture my thumb was pretty much beyond saving. The student gave me a look full of surprise and pity. He would probably have believed me if I\u2019d told him that pupils with bad marks were shot at the end of the school year. For those young west Germans the GDR was so completely wicked anything was imaginable. I wanted to confess that evening, tell the student I\u2019d been talking nonsense, but we lost sight of each other and I never saw him again. Since then, every anniversary, I imagine the student from D\u00fcsseldorf, years later, telling his children about that strange east Berliner with the battered thumb, that torture victim of the rogue East German state. So I\u2019m not entirely innocent when it comes to the fact that the GDR only exists nowadays as a horror version of itself. Also regular as clockwork on the anniversary come the reports about the state of German unity. And each time there\u2019s a huge sense of disappointment because east Germans are still so different. So strange, so ungrateful, so hard to train. East Germans vote for the right, they don\u2019t like foreigners, they don\u2019t believe in God, they eat a lot of meat and hardly have any children, but they do have a higher than average amount of sex. Worst are east German men, who are seen as left behind, frustrated, aggressive, uneducated, racist, homeless, wifeless. Has there, since Gollum from Lord of the Rings, been an uglier creature than the east German man? I write these lines as an aggrieved party. I\u2019ve been an east German man since I was born. And I\u2019m often asked to appear as crown witness; particularly on anniversaries I\u2019m supposed to explain myself and my odd compatriots. Last week a woman called me up from the radio. She said she\u2019d like to do an interview. With me as an east German. \u201cPerhaps you could give us a bit of an introduction to some of the peculiarities of east Germans,\u201d she said. It sounded as if I was a native of Papua New Guinea. A few days earlier, Deutsche Welle radio had given me a call, as had a paper from Munich and a French radio station. They all urgently need east Germans for the big anniversary. \u201cAs witty as possible\u201d, \u201cas original as possible\u201d, \u201cwith a wink, you know, Mr Leo\u201d. That\u2019s the new trend in the GDR history business. A few years ago people in the west only wanted to hear sad stories; now the tales have to be funny. No problem. Over the years I\u2019ve become a professional east German. If people want Stasi, I give them Stasi. And if people want to laugh, I\u2019ll keep chucking those funny stories at them until the earth shakes. I hadn\u2019t planned to be a professional east German. You might say I just slipped into it. There was a great need for east German stories and, to be honest, I needed the money. Ten years ago, at the last big anniversary, I had written a book about my East German family. I did a reading tour and, after many evenings in the west German provinces, I was lying in bed in the Intercity Hotel in Celle one night, thinking about how damned ironic history is: who would have expected the GDR, of all places, to involve so much world travel? Recently, incidentally, I\u2019ve felt very close to the British, because so many people are disappointed by the British right now, and no one really understands the British any more. I have an idea: how about the British split from Northern Ireland and unify with east Germany instead? I see a lot of parallels and advantages there. But let\u2019s talk about that some other time, when we\u2019ve got a bit of peace and quiet. Translated by Shaun Whiteside Bernhard Schlink: \u2018East and West Germans were curious about each other, delighted in each other\u2019 Bernhard Schlink is a writer, lawyer and academic. Born in Heidelberg in 1944, he now divides his time between Berlin and New York. His best-known book is The Reader, an international bestseller which was made into a film, starring Kate Winslet, in 2008 by Stephen Daldry. The wall fell on 9 November 1989. A few days later I was in Berlin \u2013 history was being made here, and I wanted to be part of it. East Berliners were out and about in West Berlin, easy to spot thanks to their cars, their clothes, the way they inspected shop displays, the bananas and oranges in their shopping bags. At the border, the East German Volkspolizei were friendly, in contrast to their earlier attitude, and in East Berlin I could walk into Humboldt University without going through the security check that had previously been obligatory. Otherwise people did what they always do; they went to work, did their shopping, sat in caf\u00e9s. History is everyday life. But that November everyday life was light-hearted and cheerful. Rather than the low grey clouds that usually hang above the city in November, the sun was shining. Grumpy Berliners smiled. East and West Berliners exchanged greetings. The Volkspolizei were not just friendly, they were glad that they finally could be friendly. The first days, the first weeks after the fall of the wall, were a German-German love-fest. East and West Germans were curious about each other, intrigued by each other, talked to each other, delighted in each other. Anything seemed possible \u2013 journeying to new worlds, embarking on new careers, beginning new relationships. Would we reinvent Germany? I had always known that the division of Germany would pass. I was the son of a Protestant pastor, and Protestant eastern Germany, the land of Luther and Bach and Zinzendorf, was my Germany just as much as the Catholic Rhineland was. In the 1960s I studied in West Berlin, had friends in East Berlin and went there regularly until I helped my girlfriend escape from East to West and risked arrest and imprisonment if I set foot in East Berlin again. When the relationship between the Federal Republic and the GDR normalised and I could once again travel there safely, I drove with my son through the East German cities and landscapes, poorer and greyer than their West German counterparts, sometimes in a lamentable state, but sometimes with a touching simplicity too \u2013 and, unlike West Germany, not ravaged by brutalist architecture and colourful advertising. We encountered the older Germany that could still be found there in those days and now no longer exists. When I came back from Berlin to Bonn, where I was professor of public law at the university, I received an enquiry about teaching in East Berlin. One of my colleagues knew a colleague at Humboldt University and had the impression they were looking for a visiting professor from the West now that the wall had fallen. He couldn\u2019t take it on himself, for he couldn\u2019t stand the winter air in East Berlin, where lignite was used for heating. I didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment, travelled back to Berlin to introduce myself at Humboldt University, realised that they didn\u2019t really want anyone from the West, but thought that they were supposed to, and I settled for that. That was how I ended up teaching a class on fundamental rights and another on constitutional theory in January 1990 as the first visiting professor from the Federal Republic of Germany to teach at Humboldt University. After the second session, a colleague invited me to participate as an expert in deliberations to draft a new constitution for the GDR. Over the next two months, I shared the hopes involved in drafting the new constitution. It was intended to be a free, constitutional, democratic underpinning for the GDR that would preserve the legacy of the peaceful revolution, allowing the GDR to enter into reunification negotiations with self-assurance and confidence. It was meant to be a contribution to reinventing Germany. In March, however, after the first and last free elections in the GDR, it was clear that reunification would come so quickly that plans to develop a new GDR constitution were already obsolete. In March, the love-fest between the two Germanies also drew to a close. The economic problems involved in reunification became apparent. Switching from life under socialism to life in a capitalist system was not easy for many East Germans, and it became clear that their experiences and knowledge were unappreciated, while the penalties imposed on those who had spied for the State Security Service affected both those who deserved them and those who did not. Advisers and visitors from the West were nicknamed \u201cBesserwessis\u201d (a pun on \u201cBesserwisser\u201d, the German term for \u201cknow-it-alls\u201d); many of them were convinced that they did indeed know better and treated the East Germans as annoying, impoverished, helpless relatives. The wounds inflicted in that period have still not fully healed. We did not reinvent Germany. We did not even reinvent Humboldt University, as we had hoped we would in 1990 and 1991; it has become a German university like any other. Many things have become more difficult in Germany. Often Germans from the new federal states in the east and the old federal states in the west act as if there were an awkward distance between them, reacting to their differences as if they were annoying rather than a blessing. But I have confidence in the future. Great gifts change your life and cannot just blithely be chalked up as a turn for the better; you need to get to grips with them. It remains a great gift that Germany is reunited, a gift I delight in over and over again \u2013 when I cycle through the Brandenburg Gate to Humboldt University, when I travel through Brandenburg, go hiking in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains or see the sun rise over the Baltic Sea in R\u00fcgen. Bernhard Schlink Norman Ohler: \u2018The fall of the wall was a source of kinetic energy that we lived off for years\u2019 Norman Ohler was born in 1970 in the west German town of Zweibr\u00fccken. He is the author of three novels and two novellas and co-wrote Wim Wenders\u2019s film Palermo Shooting. His bestselling non-fiction book, Blitzed, about the surprising reliance on drugs of the Nazi hierarchy, was translated into 18 languages. Ohler lives in Berlin. It was the moment everything changed, and I became a writer. Before then it had still been the 80s, the cold war, and it was clearly always going to be like that: the wall, which was after all a wall in people\u2019s heads too, would never fall, and I, a politicised teenager at the time, was going to be a journalist \u2013 I would furiously attack the state of things in the progressive media: the propaganda, the cold war\u2026 Even the day before the wall actually did come down in that moment of ecstasy, incredibly I didn\u2019t have the slightest inkling. None of us did. And then it happened. And I\u2019ll never forget how it happened. It was at about 7pm on 9 November 1989, during a really boring hour-long press conference [on live TV] by a second-rate politburo official called G\u00fcnter Schabowski. Among other things, he answered questions about a new draft GDR travel law that he said also included some transit regulations. Schabowski himself could barely get through the GDR polit-speak of the text, and rustled his papers despairingly, cleared his throat helplessly a few times and eventually, because he wanted to get it over with, announced that in his view the freedom of GDR citizens to travel to West Germany applied with immediate effect, which, in spite of the unease that suddenly spread through the room \u2013 some journalists were open-mouthed \u2013 was nothing really special as far as he was concerned, since the GDR had always described itself as a democracy, the only form of society that guaranteed the freedom of its subjects. The result of Schabowski\u2019s confusion was that immediately after the end of the conference \u2013 when he did finally call it a day \u2013 hundreds of thousands of people in Berlin went out and knocked down the wall that same night. A Kafkaesque momentum had been set in motion, and this time it wasn\u2019t lack of freedom that revealed itself, as usually happens in bureaucratic processes, but a fairytale breach that opened up. At that moment I was 800km away in the small West German town where I was born, but I did have access to a car, and the next morning I called in at my grammar school to announce that I was taking the day off, sped up the autobahn and, seven hours later, reached Berlin just in time. It was already getting dark as I climbed up on to one of those platforms that still stood around from before, from which West Germans would look over the wall into the east. Over there, everywhere I looked, a GDR soldier was kneeling on the wall and dividing the sections with a jackhammer \u2013 total rock\u2019n\u2019roll as well as an anticipation of techno \u2013 before a bulldozer came, with a kind of claw, to tear the segments individually out of the earth with military precision and then drive off with them somewhere at the back to dump them on the scrapheap of history. As each passageway was opened up it immediately filled with people who flowed in from east to west, and suddenly a young woman of 18 or so (the same age as me) was standing next to me, asking excitedly what was over there. \u201cWell, East Berlin,\u201d I replied, surprised, but she said she knew that already, she was from there, in fact, she had asked the question in a much bigger context. That was my first encounter with an East Berliner, and with her words she tore away something inside me that continues to define my life today. It\u2019s this idea of possibility. This transformation of hollow phrase and hackneyed term into a magically charged space \u2013 the change, for me personally, from journalist to writer and poet. The 90s began on that day, 9 November 1989, thanks to the inattentiveness of one police officer. The whole of world history was changed by a poetic moment at a press conference that was actually designed to exclude such moments. Since then anything has seemed possible to me, and my first three novels, about global revolution, the metropolises of New York, Johannesburg and indeed Berlin, emerged from the big bang that atomised the Berlin Wall. The fall of the wall gave Germany an incredible, positive boost, because for so many people who experienced it, myself included, it was a source of kinetic energy that they lived off for many years. Of course that energy dissipated in the end, and we are now back in a situation in Europe in which we no longer have a warm welcome for refugees who manage to get over its walls, we no longer want to learn from them. Instead Europe has slipped into a xenophobic rigidity that wants separation rather than unification. So we need new collective experiences that will give us back the strength that the politicians \u2013 as privileged people who can travel freely \u2013 have systematically tried to steal from us. We need people in the streets who will physically work for change. It wasn\u2019t capitalism that won in the fall of the Berlin Wall, but a human need for freedom. Our future is much too precious to be left to politicians and their empty words. Translated by Shaun Whiteside Julia Franck: \u2018Berlin today is a city of enthusiastic dreamers \u2013 with several jobs each\u2019 Julia Franck is the author of five novels including The Blind Side of the Heart, a family drama set in postwar Germany, which won the German book prize and sold over a million copies in Germany alone. She was born in East Berlin in 1970 and still lives and writes in the city. All I know of Germany is a small fragment: Berlin. Thanks to the curiosity of a lot of people from far away, and the hopes and dreams they brought with them, over the past 30 years this city has rapidly changed and internationalised like no other in Germany. Of all major European cities, Berlin is perhaps not only the youngest, but the one with a thousand broken bones; the craziest one, the one with the most tangible and visible scars left by wars and culture. It is like a poor, beautiful woman, dressed up and wearing makeup, but squalid and scruffy \u2013 she needs visitors, tourists and lovers to keep her going with their fantasies and money. Whether you seek a retreat into ascetic silence or anonymity, or the passionate thrill of nightlife \u2013 anything is possible here. Though Berlin\u2019s economy lies idle, tourism and foreign investors have cranked up the property market to unreachable heights. Berliners scarcely have jobs, pensions or savings that would make life in the city viable in the long term. But Berlin belongs to visionaries, dreamers and individualists from all over the place who either bring money with them or struggle, modestly and ambitiously, to survive in their particular niches. Students and artists get by, enriching the city with their inexhaustible creativity and self-exploitation, living hand to mouth while working on their concert or video or 1,000-page novel. Our family lived barely four kilometres from the west, with only the Spree and the wall, with its threat of deadly punishment in between. When the wall was built in 1961 and sealed with orders to shoot on sight, my uncle, 18 at the time, killed himself. In 1972, my 21-year-old aunt fled to the west in an empty fuel tanker. My single mother made her first application for an exit visa in 1974. After a ban on employment and various other kinds of chicanery, her application \u2013 for herself and her daughters, four of them at the time \u2013 was finally authorised in 1978. The five of us lived for almost nine months in a single room in Marienfelde refugee camp in west Berlin, the destination for all eastern European cold war refugees. It was a long time, even after we were granted asylum, before we felt properly integrated. The camp still exists, and has been used often in the 30 years since the fall of the wall: in the early 1990s, for emigrants from the former Soviet Union and Poland, later for war refugees from the Balkans and other parts of eastern Europe, and today for refugees from Syria and south-east Europe. In 2014 there was a surge of violence in the camp, when about 100 Muslim Chechens beat up 30 Syrian Christians. The situation in camps, with people of different origin, religion and perspective, is never easy. Yet the countless people who have come to Germany from all corners of the planet over the past 30 years have enriched it hugely. After the war, the divided Germans, supervised and strongly supported by the Allies, set up a new form of democratic state in west Germany and an astonishing economic miracle developed, offering those born there in the postwar period the promise of self-advancement. My generation in the west grew up with the promise that things would only get better and better. But by the mid-80s, with growing globalisation, then perestroika and the fall of the wall and reunification, it became clear that the economic miracle was over: Germany\u2019s favourite child, Federal Savings Bonds, were abolished, and after reunification the unemployment rate in some regions of the east rose to 25%, although it has been falling constantly since 2005 across the whole of Germany. There is a worsening shortage of permanent, well-paid jobs, and our generation\u2019s pension expectations have declined sharply. Despite rising numbers of high-school graduations and improvements in final exam grades, literacy rates are falling, education in schools is deteriorating and failing to promote social integration, health insurance is more and more expensive, incomes are plummeting and, as in most countries, social inequality has worsened. In the east, many people\u2019s careers and lives were badly affected by the fall of the wall. Whole regions of the former GDR lie abandoned, because so many went to the west in search of work. While most west Germans were able to look forward to the legacy of their economic-miracle parents, hardly anyone in east inherits anything \u2013 they didn\u2019t have private property or an economic miracle there. Instead they had the guardianship of the state \u2013 familiar from all dictatorships \u2013 whose watchful eye encouraged an attitude of entitlement and immaturity. Anyone who supported the system, anyone who worked for the Party or the Stasi, could make a career inside the system without making any great sacrifice in terms of time or intellect, and be sure of being provided for through their entire lives. With that security gone, there is no cushion for the economic downturn in the east. Such social and economic fissures, and the different forms they assume in east and west, make many people, particularly in the east, feel like the losers and victims of reunification. In the last elections people, having lost faith in both democracy and government, turned their backs on the big political parties and vented their defiance as Wutb\u00fcrger \u2013 furious citizens. That should be taken as an alarm signal. These people who feel left behind radicalise themselves individually or flee to politically extreme parties. Their fear of the future finds expression in rage and hatred at \u201cfake news\u201d, the government and immigration. Today some Germans in both east and west see reunification as a mistake. Berlin, though, as a formerly divided city, occupies a special place in all this. Here we see a growth in the Prekariat \u2013 those with little purchasing power, who live a precarious existence on the poverty line. The sort of people who come to Berlin are looking more to pursue their independent social, creative or political vision than for promises of security and financial gain. \u201cYou can\u2019t want to incur losses?\u201d said my first and last financial adviser, to which I replied: \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I want and have to do.\u201d My \u20ac5,000 shares were now worth only half that, but I had to pay my rent, I\u2019d missed out on a job and I needed to finish a book. In spite of the crash and social and democratic crisis, we still live in one of the wealthiest and the freest countries in the world, our taps produce clean drinking water, our rubbish is full of discarded food and we live in precious peace. If I\u2019ve had 10 bikes stolen in Berlin in the past eight years, I see this irritation as a tribute to our free, wild city. I\u2019d rather have a bicycle nicked once a year than give up cycling or live in a surveillance state with gated residential communities, in houses and streets with cameras, armed security staff and the death penalty. At the moment, unemployment in Berlin is only 8%, but with all their many jobs Berliners still earn much less than people in west Germany. Rents and prices are soaring, and yet in Berlin only 14% live in their own properties, 52% of households are single occupancy, and the trend is rising. We are a city of enthusiastic dreamers who do several jobs on the side to pay the rent. We are lucky to be a diverse international metropolis, in which every language in the world is spoken and in which a culture of social tolerance means we are able to contain the conflicts that arise among us.

      "body": "<p>The 72 people killed in the Grenfell Tower fire. The 39 migrants who died in a shipping container left in a car park in Purfleet, Essex. Little may seem to connect these two dreadful events except the sense of horror we feel about both. What links the two tragedies is less the events themselves than the public discussions about them and the way that such discussions reveal the difficulties we have in thinking about \u201ccausation\u201d or \u201cresponsibility\u201d. In both cases, the roots of the tragedies are manifold. But in both cases we seem more interested in laying instant blame than in excavating the wider causes that might help us prevent such catastrophes happening again.</p> <p>When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/01/grenfell-inquiry-costs-exceed-hundred-times-price-of-cladding\" title=\"\">Grenfell </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/01/grenfell-inquiry-costs-exceed-hundred-times-price-of-cladding\" title=\"\">Tower inquiry</a> was set up two years ago, its chair, Martin Moore-Bick, decided to divide it into two phases. The first part, <a href=\"https://www.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/phase-1-report\" title=\"\">the report of which</a> was published last week, dealt with the events of that tragic night. The second part, which may not be published for another two years, will examine the circumstances and causes of the disaster.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Both Grenfell and Purfleet reveal the difficulties we have in thinking about the wider significance of such calamities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This might seem a rational approach \u2013 consider first the actual events and then explore the causes. The trouble is that it\u2019s not easy to create such a neat distinction. In dealing with the events of the night, the first phase of inquiry has inevitably had to deal with causes, but only certain causes, the most immediate ones. It was the actions of firefighters that bore the greatest scrutiny in last week\u2019s report.</p> <p>Almost from the moment of the fire, though, it has been apparent that behind the horror lay a much wider set of factors \u2013 from the flammable cladding that was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43558186\" title=\"\">allowed to wrap the building</a> to a political culture that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/22/government-backed-red-tape-group-eu-fire-safety-rules-grenfell-fire\" title=\"\">saw regulation as an affront to freedom</a>; from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-faces-questions-over-fire-brigade-cuts-following-greenfell-fire-2017-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">cuts to the London fire service</a> to <a href=\"https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/61834\">an almost criminal level of ministerial negligence</a>. The report acknowledges many of these issues. None will be properly investigated, however, until the second phase.</p> <p>The fire service and its practices certainly need to be scrutinised. The insistence of the London Fire Brigade commissioner, Dany Cotton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/27/london-fire-brigade-chief-denies-she-should-have-expected-grenfell-dany-cotton\">in her evidence</a> to the inquiry that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t change anything we did on the night\u201d was grotesque; she has rightly faced considerable criticism both in the report and from survivors.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the failures of the fire service make sense only against the broader background of the failures of regulation and policy. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-wrack\" title=\"\">Matt Wrack</a>, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50216606\" title=\"\">observed</a>: \u201cThe truth is that the firefighters turned up\u2026 after the building had already been turned, in reality, into a death trap.\u201d</p> <p>The order of the inquiry, <a href=\"https://www.fbu.org.uk/news/2019/10/30/fbu-response-grenfell-tower-inquiry-phase-one-report\" title=\"\">Wrack argues</a>, was \u201cback to front\u201d because it \u201cprioritises scrutiny of firefighters, who did everything that they could to save lives, over investigating the critical issues of public safety that led to the fire\u201d.</p> <p>This is not simply an issue about the Grenfell inquiry and how it has been structured. It reflects, rather, a deeper cultural tendency to focus on the proximate causes of social tragedies and to ignore, or downplay, more distant but often more significant issues.</p> <p>Perhaps nowhere has this been more apparent than in the discussion of the terrible deaths of the 39 migrants found in a refrigerated container in Essex.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Police, politicians and journalists all seem to believe that people smugglers operate in a policy vacuum</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both the police investigation and the media reporting have focused on one issue: that of people smugglers or human traffickers. In the accounts of the police, politicians and journalists, the migrants are portrayed merely as victims of unscrupulous criminals. The police investigation is still live and we do not have all the details. It is not, however, the first time such deaths have occurred and we know much about people smuggling and the reasons for it, from both academic and police investigations.</p> <p>Migrants are rarely simple victims. For all the venality of the smugglers and their couldn\u2019t-give-a-toss-about-human-lives cynicism, they do not force migrants to travel. People smugglers are not the same as human traffickers, who do kidnap and coerce, and the tendency of police, politicians and journalists to conflate the two is irresponsible and misguided.</p> <p>\u201cSmugglers can be ruthless and regularly deceive migrants\u201d, the Dutch sociologist and migration specialist Hein de Haas <a href=\"http://heindehaas.blogspot.com/2015/09/dont-blame-smugglers-real-migration.html\" title=\"\">has pointed out</a>, but they \u201cdeliver a service asylum seekers and migrants are willing to pay for\u201d. They are willing to pay for it because rich countries in the west have cut off most legal routes of entry. The irony, as de Haas observes, is that it is such immigration policies that have \u201ccreated a huge market for the smuggling business\u201d.</p> <p>Yet rarely has the wider context in which the smugglers operate been discussed. Police, politicians and journalists all seem to believe that smugglers operate in a policy vacuum, that they smuggle simply because they are amoral and that there is nothing to be said beyond that.</p> <p>It\u2019s a mindset that will only ensure that the horrors revealed in that container in Purfleet will happen again. And again. And again. Every time migrants die in such gruesome fashion, there are calls for tighter immigration controls. Tighter controls lead to migrants taking more dangerous routes and being more likely to resort to smugglers. That in turn leads to more deaths. It\u2019s a vicious cycle we seem unable to see.</p> <p>More than half a century ago, the historian EH Carr observed in his book<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_History%3F\" title=\"\">What Is History?</a></em> that any social or historical event has myriad causes. Some are meaningful, some less significant, some irrelevant. How should we distinguish between them?</p> <p>Meaningful causes, Carr suggested, are those that allow us to generalise from any specific case, to make us think more broadly about a particular event, to change things (policy, infrastructure, attitudes) in a way that leads to social improvement. What the tragedies of both Grenfell and Purfleet reveal is the difficulties we have in thinking about the wider social meaning of such calamities. Even when, as in the case of Grenfell, we recognise the significance of regulation and policy, we are nevertheless drawn to thinking primarily about immediate, proximate causes.</p> <p>The question that such devastating events pose is this: do we really want to prevent such tragedies in the future? Or are we happy simply to point the finger, find someone to blame and absolve those in power of responsibility?</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 72 people killed in the Grenfell Tower fire. The 39 migrants who died in a shipping container left in a car park in Purfleet, Essex. Little may seem to connect these two dreadful events except the sense of horror we feel about both. What links the two tragedies is less the events themselves than the public discussions about them and the way that such discussions reveal the difficulties we have in thinking about \u201ccausation\u201d or \u201cresponsibility\u201d. In both cases, the roots of the tragedies are manifold. But in both cases we seem more interested in laying instant blame than in excavating the wider causes that might help us prevent such catastrophes happening again. When the Grenfell Tower inquiry was set up two years ago, its chair, Martin Moore-Bick, decided to divide it into two phases. The first part, the report of which was published last week, dealt with the events of that tragic night. The second part, which may not be published for another two years, will examine the circumstances and causes of the disaster. This might seem a rational approach \u2013 consider first the actual events and then explore the causes. The trouble is that it\u2019s not easy to create such a neat distinction. In dealing with the events of the night, the first phase of inquiry has inevitably had to deal with causes, but only certain causes, the most immediate ones. It was the actions of firefighters that bore the greatest scrutiny in last week\u2019s report. Almost from the moment of the fire, though, it has been apparent that behind the horror lay a much wider set of factors \u2013 from the flammable cladding that was allowed to wrap the building to a political culture that saw regulation as an affront to freedom; from cuts to the London fire service to an almost criminal level of ministerial negligence. The report acknowledges many of these issues. None will be properly investigated, however, until the second phase. The fire service and its practices certainly need to be scrutinised. The insistence of the London Fire Brigade commissioner, Dany Cotton, in her evidence to the inquiry that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t change anything we did on the night\u201d was grotesque; she has rightly faced considerable criticism both in the report and from survivors. Nevertheless, the failures of the fire service make sense only against the broader background of the failures of regulation and policy. As Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, has observed: \u201cThe truth is that the firefighters turned up\u2026 after the building had already been turned, in reality, into a death trap.\u201d The order of the inquiry, Wrack argues, was \u201cback to front\u201d because it \u201cprioritises scrutiny of firefighters, who did everything that they could to save lives, over investigating the critical issues of public safety that led to the fire\u201d. This is not simply an issue about the Grenfell inquiry and how it has been structured. It reflects, rather, a deeper cultural tendency to focus on the proximate causes of social tragedies and to ignore, or downplay, more distant but often more significant issues. Perhaps nowhere has this been more apparent than in the discussion of the terrible deaths of the 39 migrants found in a refrigerated container in Essex. Both the police investigation and the media reporting have focused on one issue: that of people smugglers or human traffickers. In the accounts of the police, politicians and journalists, the migrants are portrayed merely as victims of unscrupulous criminals. The police investigation is still live and we do not have all the details. It is not, however, the first time such deaths have occurred and we know much about people smuggling and the reasons for it, from both academic and police investigations. Migrants are rarely simple victims. For all the venality of the smugglers and their couldn\u2019t-give-a-toss-about-human-lives cynicism, they do not force migrants to travel. People smugglers are not the same as human traffickers, who do kidnap and coerce, and the tendency of police, politicians and journalists to conflate the two is irresponsible and misguided. \u201cSmugglers can be ruthless and regularly deceive migrants\u201d, the Dutch sociologist and migration specialist Hein de Haas has pointed out, but they \u201cdeliver a service asylum seekers and migrants are willing to pay for\u201d. They are willing to pay for it because rich countries in the west have cut off most legal routes of entry. The irony, as de Haas observes, is that it is such immigration policies that have \u201ccreated a huge market for the smuggling business\u201d. Yet rarely has the wider context in which the smugglers operate been discussed. Police, politicians and journalists all seem to believe that smugglers operate in a policy vacuum, that they smuggle simply because they are amoral and that there is nothing to be said beyond that. It\u2019s a mindset that will only ensure that the horrors revealed in that container in Purfleet will happen again. And again. And again. Every time migrants die in such gruesome fashion, there are calls for tighter immigration controls. Tighter controls lead to migrants taking more dangerous routes and being more likely to resort to smugglers. That in turn leads to more deaths. It\u2019s a vicious cycle we seem unable to see. More than half a century ago, the historian EH Carr observed in his book What Is History? that any social or historical event has myriad causes. Some are meaningful, some less significant, some irrelevant. How should we distinguish between them? Meaningful causes, Carr suggested, are those that allow us to generalise from any specific case, to make us think more broadly about a particular event, to change things (policy, infrastructure, attitudes) in a way that leads to social improvement. What the tragedies of both Grenfell and Purfleet reveal is the difficulties we have in thinking about the wider social meaning of such calamities. Even when, as in the case of Grenfell, we recognise the significance of regulation and policy, we are nevertheless drawn to thinking primarily about immediate, proximate causes. The question that such devastating events pose is this: do we really want to prevent such tragedies in the future? Or are we happy simply to point the finger, find someone to blame and absolve those in power of responsibility? \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Peter Holden\u2019s* nightmare began when he bought a car in 2015. Notices in the car park of his housing association block in Cardiff required residents to display a permit and Holden was issued with a temporary permit by the concierge while he waited for his application to be processed. The temporary permit did not pass muster with Premier Park, the company that managed the car park, and he was issued with three parking charge notices (PCNs).</p> <p>Over the next three years he was harassed by letters and phone calls demanding escalating sums, culminating in a court summons in October 2018. On the night before the hearing he was called by Premier Park\u2019s legal representatives and urged to pay the \u00a3691 \u201cdebt\u201d there and then or face an additional \u00a31,000 in legal fees. The case was dismissed by the judge, who ruled that the terms of his lease granting him the right to park on the land overrode any rules imposed by Premier Park.</p> <p>That, it seemed, was it. But only briefly. Last April a letter arrived from BW Legal, a debt recovery firm acting for Premier Park. It threatened Holden with court action unless he paid the PCNs that had been dismissed in court seven months previously. In July he was informed that he was being taken to court.</p> <p>Holden\u2019s ordeal exposes the aggressive tactics employed by the private parking industry, which demands sums of \u00a3100 or more for minor or, in some cases, non-existent parking breaches. Nearly 7 million PCNs were issued by parking management firms in the last financial year, a 20% increase on the previous 12 months. Until 2012 drivers could safely ignore these because private parking firms had no way of getting drivers\u2019 details, and if the driver denied liability, nothing could be done. But since the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">Protection of Freedoms Act</a>, parking firms can buy the details of the \u201cregistered keeper\u201d \u2013 ie the owner who is held responsible \u2013 from the DVLA at \u00a32.50 each and companies have become increasingly litigious.</p> <p>Holden, who survives on benefits, claims he was driven from his home by Premier Park\u2019s conduct. He had to spend \u00a3200 to move and is issuing a counterclaim for damages from Premier Park and BW Legal.</p> <p>Alarmingly, his experience is not unique. In Southampton, Charlene Thompson had been pursued by Premier Park and its representatives over the same period. She had been issued with four PCNs for parking outside her flat without a permit in 2015. Since she paid a service charge for parking and her tenancy agreement did not require a permit to be displayed, she ignored them.</p> <p>She says part of the reason she moved home was to escape Premier Park\u2019s operative, which is why she didn\u2019t receive the court claim issued by the company in 2017 and missed the chance to file a defence. A default judgment was issued, which she only discovered when she noticed her credit score had plummeted. She settled the \u00a3812 within the deadline, but two years later, in July, received notice from BW Legal, acting on behalf of Premier Park, that she was once again being taken to court over two of the paid PCNs as well as three more incurred at her old address.</p> <p>\u201cPremier Park is taking over my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a single mum with a baby when all this started and it was either move home or get rid of the car. The stress of having to find a new home and the money to move was the worst and now I\u2019m faced with a mountain of paperwork for charges I paid two years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The court claims against Holden and Thompson were withdrawn in July when the pair pointed out that they had already been heard. Premier Park insists it had no idea the claims had previously been to court, blaming its former lawyers for the error.</p> <p>It told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThe motorists in question had received multiple parking charges for residential parking areas, which remained unpaid. The solicitors, acting on these cases, failed to notify Premier Park that these two accounts had previously been to court. We have now changed legal provider, and these cases were included with a number of other outstanding cases as part of their hand-over. As soon as our new legal provider [BW Legal] and ourselves were made aware of this, the duplicate cases were cancelled and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused. A full review of all cases with our previous provider is under way.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Lamoureux\u2019s experience is even more outrageous. In July the Yorkshire charity manager received three letters from BW Legal, acting on behalf of the parking management firm Excel, threatening enforcement action because of unpaid county court judgments (CCJs) worth more than \u00a3800. The judgments did not exist, however. Excel had issued two court claims against him in 2016 but both had been thrown out by a judge. \u201cSince then Excel/BW Legal have never left me alone,\u201d he claims. \u201cThey have continued to call and send me threatening letters, culminating in these \u2026 CCJs. Shortly before the second hearing Excel issued four more court claims against me before eventually admitting an error. Shortly after the second hearing Excel/BW Legal issued yet another court claim, then discontinued the case just before it was due. I\u2019ve had to spend hours upon hours over the last three years researching my rights and filling out court papers.\u201d</p> <p>BW Legal later admitted to Lamoureux that the CCJs had been cited in error. When approached by the <em>Observer,</em> neither Excel nor BW Legal appeared to take responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cAs the matter was placed in the hands of our representatives to pursue the outstanding parking charge notices, it is not appropriate for us to comment,\u201d a spokesperson for Excel said. \u201cHowever, we are aware that our representatives, BW Legal, have dealt with issues raised by Mr Lamoureux under their complaints procedure that subsequently led to his complaint being upheld due to their error. We have nothing further to add.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the <em>Observer </em>about its contact with all three drivers, BW Legal said: \u201cBW Legal is a dual-regulated law firm who rely on the good faith of instructions received by our clients and we follow those instructions. We do not comment on individual cases or privileged discussions with our client. All cases in which we are instructed upon go through a pre-legal process whereby a customer is contacted to discuss the matter and the options available.</p> <p>\u201cWe always advocate the need to discuss cases in full so that legal proceedings are not required.

If customers have a cause for complaint then our full complaints process can be located on our website and we shall respond in line with the same.\u201d</p> <p>Holden, Thompson and Lamoureux are victims of a business sector that is more or less self-regulating. In order to obtain registered keeper details from the DVLA, parking management firms are obliged to sign up to one of two trade bodies which operate their own codes of practice and appeals service. Premier Park is a member of the British Parking Association, which promised to investigate its handling of Holden and Thompson\u2019s cases.

Premium-rate numbers cannot legally be used for customer services, but Premier Park insisted to the <em>Observer</em> that its 13p-a-minute line would stand, since the cost is advertised and was \u201clower than many other numbers in use across the country\u201d. The 13p-a-minute line has additional service provider access charges of up to 65p a minute.</p> <p>The government is belatedly planning a partial crackdown on unscrupulous methods used by parking companies. <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/8/contents/enacted\" title=\"\">The Parking (Code of Practice) Act 2019</a> will create a single code of practice and an independent appeals service which all operators must abide by in order to access DVLA databases.

      "bodyText": "Wanted: men \u2013 and women \u2013 who are comfortable around misogyny. We are looking for strong, confident, disagreeable characters who enjoy verbal abuse, exchanging insults, and predominantly male company. Must be able to point and shout and use a smartphone. A diagnosis of narcissism will be considered an advantage, a proven lack of empathy is essential. Are you an angry white person with a history of insulting and socially transgressive behaviour? Then a career as an MP is waiting for you, starting salary \u00a379,468 basic + expenses. No qualifications, references or previous experience necessary. Start date ASAP. Apply to your local political party quoting ref #GE19. If a career in UK politics has long been unappealing to people who are any of female, quiet, self-effacing or dispassionate, the premature exit of impressive female MPs attributing their departures to relentless, often sexist abuse and threats, now makes it look actively perverse. The consequences for faltering female representation in Westminster could be serious, unless there really are unexpected reserves of women who have the ability and courage of a Jess Phillips, Anna Soubry or Margaret Hodge, or fellow targets Rosie Cooper, Luciana Berger, Rosie Duffield. All the more so, since the abuse of female politicians by anonymous online persecutors is supplemented, the better to keep the former in their place, by more crafted insults from media professionals. Last week Theresa May was denounced, by Quentin Letts, one still-resentful fan of her successor, as a \u201cbrine-washed limpet of a prime minister\u201d, weepy yet of \u201cshrivelling dullness\u201d, someone whose failure was on such a scale as to make the fastidious writer \u201cfeel dirty\u201d. He was reviewing a new book by Anthony Seldon that, along with May\u2019s obvious faults, condemns behaviour that might strike you as inoffensive, even exemplary. How dare she be \u201cintroverted\u201d? And how, Seldon invites us to ask, could May not sack George Osborne, the chancellor turned Lebedev social secretary, with the elaborate courtesy due to a man who later said he wanted her \u201cchopped up in bags in my freezer\u201d? It may console May, rebuked for bad and good judgment alike, that even Chancellor Angela Merkel is now pilloried, for being timid and conflict averse, by supporters of a rival who enjoys dressing up as Shrek, Gandalf, Gandhi. Elsewhere, Rod Liddle (who in 2009 declared his unwillingness \u2013 because how else would you assess a woman\u2019s political abilities? \u2013 to have sex with Labour\u2019s deputy prime minister) takes a moment, in a predominantly Islamophobic Spectator polemic, to ridicule, for an important speech on coercive control, \u201cthe sobbing and oppressed Rosie \u2018#MeToo\u2019 Duffield\u201d. Signs of emotion, female politicians learn, will always fall miserably short \u2013 unless strictly patriotic \u2013 of the standards perfected over generations by boarding-school-educated parliamentarians. Last week\u2019s warning from the archbishop of Canterbury, about \u201cinflammatory language\u201d in politics, has yet to prompt any constructive response from the two second-raters apparently determined to keep the forthcoming leaders\u2019 debate all-male. Maybe Barack Obama\u2019s criticism of polarising language will be more effective? Unlikely in Boris Johnson\u2019s case, since his prized ally once incited the shooting of \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d. Though it would be disloyal to depict our British statesmen as junior partners in the normalisation of intimidation and violent speech. Nigel Farage, bored with negotiating, now threatens \u201cwar\u201d. Johnson, building on years of abusive and sexist comments, surpassed himself by retorting \u201chumbug\u201d, when Paula Sherriff, asking him to moderate his language of \u201csurrender\u201d, mentioned Jo Cox. Yes, it\u2019s fine, at the highest level of UK politics, to make light of a young woman\u2019s murder \u2013 but don\u2019t let that put you off, ladies. Turning to the judgmental language of indignant wokeness, mentioned by Obama, some of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s most valued supporters have been keen deployers, when narked, of \u201cterf\u201d (trans-exclusionary radical feminist) and the antisemitic \u201cZio\u201d. Nor can it be much of a corrective to the online ugliness when John McDonnell speaks of lynching, or when Corbyn has othered certain \u2013 Jewish \u2013 compatriots who \u201cdon\u2019t understand English irony\u201d. What kind of person, witnessing sanctioned taunting and persecution, would be attracted to Westminster? And expect to thrive there? Well, various figures eminent in the outgoing, belligerently divisive administration, offer some clues. Boris \u201cPericles\u201d Johnson, aka the Hulk, aka \u2013 to his personal tech consultant, Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 \u201cAlex the Great\u201d. Dominic \u201cOdyssean Project\u201d Cummings, superpower: ordering the non-gileted classes to fuck off. Jacob \u201cdies irae, dies illa\u201d Rees-Mogg. Gavin Williamson, owner of Cronus, a tarantula he took, regardless of arachnophobic colleagues, to work. Dominic Raab: martial arts exponent with a major feminist problem. The Spartans. And all this minus, so far as we know, any help from steroids. The imminent problem may be less a temporary scarcity of decent, inoffensive politicians, than a glut of severely disturbing ones. Well before divisions nurtured by Johnson and Cummings exacerbated existing online obscenity and aggression aimed at MPs, research confirmed, to nobody\u2019s surprise, that political ambition is related to personality type. Perhaps unhelpfully for constituents, those most attracted to politics tend to be strong on narcissism and on Machiavellianism, two of the main elements of the \u201cdark triad\u201d of negative personality traits that also features psychopathy. Behaviours associated with the dark triad include callousness, antisocial behaviour, strategic manipulation, dominance and bragging. It would be hard, following Johnson\u2019s enthronement, to imagine a constellation of qualities more likely to endear a person to the Tory membership, or to shield them, if pro-Remain, from the multitude who believe online harassment of a treacherous elite to be a civic duty, motto: \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.\u201d Officials interviewing replacements for the MPs fleeing Westminster have to consider that individuals equipped to prosper in current British politics may have most in common with the malevolent online presences who help make it, for more agreeable people, unendurable. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

Perhaps Finch should have hit fewer sixes and just knocked back some dot balls. A fortune-teller would have been handy. Mind you, Pakistan got the raw end of a few deals today: they were called off for rain just when they were getting going, and could have rattled up a decent score with Babar and Asif in the final five overs that they didn\u2019t get to face. They were called for a short run and for a no-ball that were both incorrect calls, by the looks of replays. </p> <p>Whatever the result, they know they\u2019ve been outplayed, but they get to escape with a rusty first game and head towards the second match of this series.</p> <p>As a final note, if the innings break had been 10 minutes rather than 20, we would have had five overs bowled and got a result on DLS.

That was towering. So Irfan pitches up in response, and Finch <strong>drives gorgeously through long-on for four!</strong> Bash followed by caress. </p> <p>Irfan is losing his rag now. Bowls short again, this time outside off, and Finch cuts him for four! Lofted cut, over point, waited for it and timed it perfectly. <strong>And it\u2019s a no-ball!</strong> So it\u2019s a free hit, and Finch uses every fibre of muscle in his nuggety body to <strong>heave that for six more.</strong> Even higher than the first one, in the same direction, and landing with a thud. </p> <p>The bowler manages a dot ball to mid-off next up, but Finch drives the next for four through mid-off, as Wahab Riaz slides after the ball to stop it but knocks it back while touching the ground outside the rope. Then a scrambled single from the last ball as Irfan half fields in his follow-through. </p> <p>That\u2019s 26 from the over! Wow. Australia well ahead on the DLS score sheet, but they need five overs bowled for this to count as a match.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbe6f598f08cb84c60a3c17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T06:12:20.767Z\">6.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>2nd over: Australia 13-0 (Warner 2, Finch 10) </strong>Mohammad Amir will take the other end. Left-arm swing, a lovely operator when conditions suit his movement through the air. He\u2019s trying to get Warner on the pads, resulting in a single and a leg bye. In between times Finch drives him nicely through the covers for four. You\u2019ve got to pitch up as a bowler of Amir\u2019s type, so that\u2019s the risk. He bowled some gorgeous opening spells with the white Kooka during the World Cup in England. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbe6d9e8f08cb84c60a3c12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T06:08:14.366Z\">6.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 1, Finch 4) </strong>Mohammad Irfan will kick off, the seven-footer from the Pakistan team who has spent a couple of years coming back from injury. He bowled in Australia in the 2015 World Cup and was injured then. He has an awkward gait, creaks up to the crease with his giant legs thudding. Nothing smooth or comfortable about it, but it\u2019s equally awkward when he zooms the ball down at pace from that height. He bowls a couple of near-beamers in the over, one at Warner and another at Finch, who are both startled and leap and flinch, and look to the square leg umpire, but both times the ball just dipped to waist height as it reached them. Not nice. There\u2019s one boundary from the over, when Finch gets a short ball that does bounce before reaching him, and carves a cut for four.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbe6c6c8f08d669cdab1fc7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T05:58:49.148Z\">5.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Australia's rain-adjusted target is 119</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Pakistan\u2019s rain-adjusted total is deemed to be 118, given they lost late overs where they would have expected to accelerate. That\u2019s judged from their existing run rate and their wickets in hand, using historical match data run through the Duckworth Lewis Stern system. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbe69c38f08c428d8935a61\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T05:47:43.549Z\">5.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So after an hour\u2019s rain delay, we\u2019re now having a 20-minute innings break. With a good chance of more rain ahead. Hard to believe we still run up against these obvious problems with the playing conditions. Have a 10-minute changeover like in Tests, get back out there and play, and get a couple more overs in. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbe69028f08cb84c60a3c06\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T05:44:33.416Z\">5.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Australia must chase a rain-adjusted score to win</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It will be somewhere around 120, we\u2019ll get the formal announcement shortly.

Babar has a big heave at Starc first ball, across the line and misses entirely. The umpire says not out lbw, and Australia review. The ball is missing leg stump comfortably, having hit him on the back thigh as he cleared his front leg to swing. They get awarded a leg bye. Iftikhar can only hit a run to cover next ball.</p> <p>Three balls to go. What will Starc do? Drops short! <strong>And pulled for six!</strong> Lovely bit of timing there from Babar Azam, against the full-pace bouncer. Flat over square leg, or just behind. That\u2019s a proper six. Starc bowls length and Babar chips it onto the green between mid-on and mid-off, and hares back for two. Then Starc goes full for the last ball, and Babar can only dig it square for one! </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbe67a28f08c428d8935a47\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T05:38:49.962Z\">5.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wicket!

Throws the bat outside off. Big edge. Four! That\u2019s his fifty. It hasn\u2019t been convincing: three boundaries from nicks, and his only six was nearly caught on the rope.

Asif Ali c Agar b Richardson 11 (10 balls)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Suffocation works! The over starts with a nicely timed cut shot from Babar against Richardson, but there\u2019s a sweeper to keep him to one run. Each bowler has a max of three overs now, so Cummins and Agar are already bowled out. Starc will bowl the last. Richardson bowls a short ball that Asif can\u2019t catch up with! Over his right shoulder as he pulls, and lightly clips the helmet as it goes through. Superb defensive bowling so far from Australia. Richardson bangs the next into the wicket as well, and Asif can only flat-bat it on the bounce to long-off for a single. Babar flicks cleanly off his pads but again that deep square leg sweeper keeps it to one. And with the pressure high, Asif gets one in the slot, slogs across the line, toe-ends it a bit, and Agar streaming in off the rope at deep midwicket dives forward to take a great catch!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbe65e78f08c428d8935a40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-03T05:31:34.001Z\">5.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>13 overs: Pakistan 89-3 (Babar 44, Asif 10) </strong>Two balls remaining in Zampa\u2019s over as we get back underway. He darts it in at Babar\u2019s legs, so that the batsman\u2019s advance ends in nothing but a strike on the pad and a dot ball. Then Babar tries to heave to the leg side, but can\u2019t get it cleanly and it bounces in front of deep square leg.

It works for the first two balls, as Rizwan strikes straight at cover, then sweeps to the main at backward square. The third goes straight back to the bowler, and by the fourth Rizwan has to take a risk, skipping down to Zampa to loft straight over the bowler for four. He gets the boundary but it wasn\u2019t entirely cleanly hit. <strong>The next one is cleaner, charging again, inside out over cover for six!</strong> Not just over the rope but into the fence.

That was a simple catch for first slip. Now Finch moves himself back into that spot for the left-hander, after Babar knocks a run to square leg. Sohail tries to force a back-of-a-length ball straight but can\u2019t get any timing.

Haris Sohail in for the third ball, who made a great Test ton against Australia in Dubai last year, and played some brilliant knocks in the 50-over World Cup earlier this year. Starc shapes it away from him, another left-hander, and twice beats the outside edge. But he overpitches with the final ball, looking for the pad perhaps, and Sohail drives dead straight, in the air, past Starc\u2019s left hand and almost through the umpire Paul Wilson for four.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan escape with a no-result, just 11 deliveries from conceding a loss had the rain come later. Perhaps Finch should have hit fewer sixes and just knocked back some dot balls. A fortune-teller would have been handy. Mind you, Pakistan got the raw end of a few deals today: they were called off for rain just when they were getting going, and could have rattled up a decent score with Babar and Asif in the final five overs that they didn\u2019t get to face. They were called for a short run and for a no-ball that were both incorrect calls, by the looks of replays. Whatever the result, they know they\u2019ve been outplayed, but they get to escape with a rusty first game and head towards the second match of this series. As a final note, if the innings break had been 10 minutes rather than 20, we would have had five overs bowled and got a result on DLS. Over to the innumerable cricket committees that still haven\u2019t solved these problems... That\u2019s it from the OBO for today, we\u2019ll be back with you next time. The radar looks pretty bad for the next little while. Might clear in half an hour or so. Currently this game would be a no result if there\u2019s no further play. Australia need another 1.5 overs to be bowled to win on the DLS method. And it\u2019s raining again, after one ball of the fourth over. 3rd over: Australia 39-0 (Warner 2, Finch 35) Mohammad Irfan to continue, short, and Finch destroys him for six! Huge hit, got under that one and pounded it back into the stands over midwicket! That was towering. So Irfan pitches up in response, and Finch drives gorgeously through long-on for four! Bash followed by caress. Irfan is losing his rag now. Bowls short again, this time outside off, and Finch cuts him for four! Lofted cut, over point, waited for it and timed it perfectly. And it\u2019s a no-ball! So it\u2019s a free hit, and Finch uses every fibre of muscle in his nuggety body to heave that for six more. Even higher than the first one, in the same direction, and landing with a thud. The bowler manages a dot ball to mid-off next up, but Finch drives the next for four through mid-off, as Wahab Riaz slides after the ball to stop it but knocks it back while touching the ground outside the rope. Then a scrambled single from the last ball as Irfan half fields in his follow-through. That\u2019s 26 from the over! Wow. Australia well ahead on the DLS score sheet, but they need five overs bowled for this to count as a match. 2nd over: Australia 13-0 (Warner 2, Finch 10) Mohammad Amir will take the other end. Left-arm swing, a lovely operator when conditions suit his movement through the air. He\u2019s trying to get Warner on the pads, resulting in a single and a leg bye. In between times Finch drives him nicely through the covers for four. You\u2019ve got to pitch up as a bowler of Amir\u2019s type, so that\u2019s the risk. He bowled some gorgeous opening spells with the white Kooka during the World Cup in England. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 1, Finch 4) Mohammad Irfan will kick off, the seven-footer from the Pakistan team who has spent a couple of years coming back from injury. He bowled in Australia in the 2015 World Cup and was injured then. He has an awkward gait, creaks up to the crease with his giant legs thudding. Nothing smooth or comfortable about it, but it\u2019s equally awkward when he zooms the ball down at pace from that height. He bowls a couple of near-beamers in the over, one at Warner and another at Finch, who are both startled and leap and flinch, and look to the square leg umpire, but both times the ball just dipped to waist height as it reached them. Not nice. There\u2019s one boundary from the over, when Finch gets a short ball that does bounce before reaching him, and carves a cut for four. Pakistan\u2019s rain-adjusted total is deemed to be 118, given they lost late overs where they would have expected to accelerate. That\u2019s judged from their existing run rate and their wickets in hand, using historical match data run through the Duckworth Lewis Stern system. So after an hour\u2019s rain delay, we\u2019re now having a 20-minute innings break. With a good chance of more rain ahead. Hard to believe we still run up against these obvious problems with the playing conditions. Have a 10-minute changeover like in Tests, get back out there and play, and get a couple more overs in. It will be somewhere around 120, we\u2019ll get the formal announcement shortly. Australia came back from the rain break with 14 balls to bowl. Only one boundary came from those. They\u2019ll be delighted at the result. 15 overs: Pakistan 107-5 (Babar 59, Iftikhar 1) Five balls left, and the new batsman is Iftikhar Ahmed. Babar has a big heave at Starc first ball, across the line and misses entirely. The umpire says not out lbw, and Australia review. The ball is missing leg stump comfortably, having hit him on the back thigh as he cleared his front leg to swing. They get awarded a leg bye. Iftikhar can only hit a run to cover next ball. Three balls to go. What will Starc do? Drops short! And pulled for six! Lovely bit of timing there from Babar Azam, against the full-pace bouncer. Flat over square leg, or just behind. That\u2019s a proper six. Starc bowls length and Babar chips it onto the green between mid-on and mid-off, and hares back for two. Then Starc goes full for the last ball, and Babar can only dig it square for one! Imad has to go from ball one, and he does. Normally caught Smith bowled Starc would imply a slips catch, but this is at long-on. Made decent contact with the straight drive but it falls inside the field of play. 14 overs: Pakistan 96-4 (Babar 50, Imad 0) One ball left in the over, the batsmen had crossed while Asif\u2019s dismissal ball was in the air, so Babar faces it. Throws the bat outside off. Big edge. Four! That\u2019s his fifty. It hasn\u2019t been convincing: three boundaries from nicks, and his only six was nearly caught on the rope. But he\u2019s got Pakistan some sort of score. Suffocation works! The over starts with a nicely timed cut shot from Babar against Richardson, but there\u2019s a sweeper to keep him to one run. Each bowler has a max of three overs now, so Cummins and Agar are already bowled out. Starc will bowl the last. Richardson bowls a short ball that Asif can\u2019t catch up with! Over his right shoulder as he pulls, and lightly clips the helmet as it goes through. Superb defensive bowling so far from Australia. Richardson bangs the next into the wicket as well, and Asif can only flat-bat it on the bounce to long-off for a single. Babar flicks cleanly off his pads but again that deep square leg sweeper keeps it to one. And with the pressure high, Asif gets one in the slot, slogs across the line, toe-ends it a bit, and Agar streaming in off the rope at deep midwicket dives forward to take a great catch! 13 overs: Pakistan 89-3 (Babar 44, Asif 10) Two balls remaining in Zampa\u2019s over as we get back underway. He darts it in at Babar\u2019s legs, so that the batsman\u2019s advance ends in nothing but a strike on the pad and a dot ball. Then Babar tries to heave to the leg side, but can\u2019t get it cleanly and it bounces in front of deep square leg. One run to close out that delayed over. The players are all huddled at the boundary edge, waiting to be allowed to continue. Ok, we\u2019re going to get on with things fairly soon in Sydney. The match has been reduced to 15 overs a side, and presumably Pakistan will have a rain adjustment of their eventual score with only 14 deliveries left to face. The radar seems to be suggesting that the rain in Sydney will stop soon. Obviously then there will be a delay while they clean up the ground. We\u2019re into the part of the afternoon where we\u2019ll start losing overs now. And indeed, it looks like the rope buggies have started driving around as the rain stops at the SCG. Check back in a little while. Still waiting. In the meantime, the Melbourne Stars have a mountain to climb in the WBBL. The Sixers have just done a real middle-finger job, batting through their innings without losing a wicket to set a target of 200. An unbeaten ton for Alyssa Healy alongside 87 not out for Ellyse Perry. Just rude. Hopefully a short one, as it was earlier. 12.4 overs: Pakistan 88-3 (Babar 43, Asif 10) Zampa comes back, he\u2019s bowling in fits and starts today. He might wish he was bowling in stops though. Drags the first ball short and Babar carves him gorgeously through backward point for four. Then Babar rotates strike, and Asif drops to one knee and pounds the ball high over wide long-on, deep into the Members Stand! Huge hit. It might have reached the clouds and caused a reaction, because the rain follows the ball back down. 12th over: Pakistan 76-3 (Babar 38, Asif 3) Finch brings himself into short leg for Cummins bowling against Asif. It works, too, as Cummins goes short three times and Asif barely dares to lay bat on him. Four singles from the over in the end. Pakistan have been slowed to a crawl. 11th over: Pakistan 72-3 (Babar 36, Asif 1) Babar swept a four from Agar before the wicket, but eight runs and a wicket still leaves it very much Australia\u2019s over. Asif Ali comes in, who can strike a long ball. Pakistan need a big finish. No good from Rizwan! It was time to attack, but Agar bowls well outside off, left-arm spin turning it away, but the right-hander still tries to flat-bat the ball over the leg side rather than driving over cover. There were runs on offer, but the shot was premeditated I fancy. Cummins at long-on holds the miscue. 10th over: Pakistan 64-2 (Babar 30, Rizwan 30) Gee Zampa\u2019s bowled well in his comeback over. (Ay Zampa bowled pretty well too.) Hard to time shots against. Rizwan pulls a couple but not with timing. Several find the field. Four runs in total from the over. 9th over: Pakistan 59-2 (Babar 27, Rizwan 28) Babar decides it\u2019s time to go! He\u2019s been idling along but now he dances to Agar and hits him long down the ground for six. Smith dives for the catch down towards the rope and gets a hand on it, but he\u2019s outside the field of play by the time his fingertips touch the ball, and has no chance to knock it back. Had he caught it, he would have landed outside the field. When Rizwan gets strike he crouches as though planning a reverse, then realises the ball is a bit short outside off and instead plays a kneeling uppercut for a run to short third man. Unorthodox. 8th over: Pakistan 50-2 (Babar 20, Rizwan 26) Slower short ball from Cummins this time, but Rizwan is well set up for it. He cleans up the pull shot, nicely struck with a crouch and a swivel to play behind square, but it\u2019s saved on the rope to keep the scoring to two. Cummins goes full pace for the next one! Nasty lift, and it takes the shoulder of the bat and skews down towards third man! Saved, they run two, but umpire Gerard Abood calls them short on one of the runs. On the replay that was the wrong call, Rizwan did touch his bat in at the non-striker\u2019s end. So Rizwan only gets one run for all of that, and is in the rare position of getting a single but keeping strike in the same over. A few more singles mean six from the over. Better hope it\u2019s not a one-run margin today... 7th over: Pakistan 44-2 (Babar 19, Rizwan 21) Pakistan only going at around six an over, and that continues with Ashton Agar\u2019s first. Bowling left-arm spin, most darts, he only goes for singles and a sliced Rizwan cut shot for two. Another good piece of running from the Pakistani keeper. 6th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Babar 17, Rizwan 17) Kane Richardson has Rizwan on a string against the slower-ball bouncer. Three dot balls in a row, and from the third Rizwan premeditates a scoop. Not a great option against a bowler who is so often off-pace. But Richardson doesn\u2019t just take the pace off, he gets high bounce from a fullish length, outside off stump, and it trampolines way over Rizwan\u2019s shot. Rizwan asks about a wide but considering he had moved a metre outside his stumps to chase that ball, it bounced right over him. Three singles from an excellent over to end the Powerplay. 5th over: Pakistan 35-2 (Babar 15, Rizwan 16) Pat Cummins\u2019 turn now, and he starts gorgeously. Pace, accuracy. Babar gets another run to third man, but Rizwan is pinned down for a couple of balls, getting his feet out of the way nicely to try to whip a yorker but finding midwicket, then smothered for room on the shot and blunting it to cover. Eventually Cummins gets a bit straight and Rizwan can stab a run to midwicket, the Babar a similar shot for two runs before another glide to third man. Five from the over, Australia will take that every time. 4th over: Pakistan 30-2 (Babar 11, Rizwan 15) Big call here: Richardson created two wicket-taking chances in his first over, and the fielding restrictions are still in place, but Adam Zampa is going to replace Richardson with some leg-spin. What is Finch seeing here? A chance to make the Pakistanis force the pace with two wickets already gone and some pressure on? It works for the first two balls, as Rizwan strikes straight at cover, then sweeps to the main at backward square. The third goes straight back to the bowler, and by the fourth Rizwan has to take a risk, skipping down to Zampa to loft straight over the bowler for four. He gets the boundary but it wasn\u2019t entirely cleanly hit. The next one is cleaner, charging again, inside out over cover for six! Not just over the rope but into the fence. Then a super bit of running to close the over, Rizwan groping across his front pad to knock the ball to midwicket but immediately calling \u201cTwo, two, two!\u201d and making a lightning turn at the non-striker\u2019s end to get back. A dozen from the over, though it started well. What does Finch think of that? 3rd over: Pakistan 18-2 (Babar 11, Rizwan 3) He doesn\u2019t mind playing Australia, does Rizwan. Two centuries in the five-match ODI series earlier this year leading into the World Cup. That was in the Middle East though, so it\u2019ll be a different operation here today. He gets off strike against Starc by calmly pushing a run. Even that is a pretty good early sign. It brings Babar on strike, and after he has an uncontrolled swat at Starc outside off, he drives the next ball with a straighter bat and gets a genuine edge for four! Through second slip that time, so you really can\u2019t blame Aaron Finch for that one. The batting pair trade singles to finish their first decent over. 2nd over: Pakistan 11-2 (Babar 6, Rizwan 1) Two early wickets then, and the aggressive wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan comes to the crease. A right-hander now, and he uses Richardson\u2019s natural length to fend away a single towards point to end the over. Kane Richardson with the ball from the other end, having tied his long hair back today. His first ball is blocked by Babar, but the second is edged for four! Richardson immediately turns to stare at Finch, who didn\u2019t have a slip in place for his opening bowler with the new ball! That was a simple catch for first slip. Now Finch moves himself back into that spot for the left-hander, after Babar knocks a run to square leg. Sohail tries to force a back-of-a-length ball straight but can\u2019t get any timing. So he aims a filthy slog at the next ball, which was a bit short but he goes at it with almost a straight bat, and it skews high off the outside edge and lands with Smith at backward point again. Richardson gets his reward. 1st over: Pakistan 5-1 (Babar 1, Sohail 4) Mitchell Starc to begin with the ball for Australia. He starts outside off stump and Babar reaches for it, steering the ball with an angled blade down towards third man for one. The left-handed Fakhar comes on strike, and departs immediately. Haris Sohail in for the third ball, who made a great Test ton against Australia in Dubai last year, and played some brilliant knocks in the 50-over World Cup earlier this year. Starc shapes it away from him, another left-hander, and twice beats the outside edge. But he overpitches with the final ball, looking for the pad perhaps, and Sohail drives dead straight, in the air, past Starc\u2019s left hand and almost through the umpire Paul Wilson for four. A dot ball ends the eventful over. First ball duck, second ball of the match! Starc bowls outside off just back of a length with some swing. Fakhar reaches for the drive but the outswing takes the outside edge, thick, into the gully where Smith takes a direct catch to a very fast-travelling ball. Babar Azam, one of the best white-ball batsmen in the world, is the key for Pakistan. He\u2019s the one who usually bats through an innings, averaging nearly 50 in T20 Internationals, which is a frankly ridiculous number. Fakhar Zaman at the other end is a damaging striker, though he hasn\u2019t been in great nick for a while. We\u2019ll get underway on time, with the groundstaff doing a lightning job. Pakistan Fakhar Zaman Babar Azam * Haris Sohail Mohammad Rizwan + Asif Ali Iftikhar Ahmed Imad Wasim Wahab Riaz Shadab Khan Mohammad Amir Mohammad Irfan Australia Aaron Finch * David Warner Steven Smith Ben McDermott Ashton Turner Alex Carey + Ashton Agar Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc Kane Richardson Adam Zampa Aaron Finch calls correctly, and with rain around he opts to chase so that Australia will know exactly what the situation is if any overs are lost. Good call, because the rain starts coming down a few minutes after the toss. There will be a slight delay to the start. The rain doesn\u2019t last long. Hello, folks. It\u2019s T20 time once again. Australia got rid of Sri Lanka in short order across three matches in the past week or so, but Pakistan might pose a sterner test. At least, they will if rain stays away at the SCG. No Glenn Maxwell for Australia, he\u2019s taken a mental-health break from the game for a time. Ben McDermott is the replacement batsman for him in the top four. Pakistan are the number one T20 side in the world, and whitewashed Australia in the UAE across three games last year, but may have some issues adapting to Australian conditions, even if the Sydney pitch isn\u2019t the fastest and bounciest going around.",

Led by Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s seductive, fearsome Rose the Hat, they eat screams and drink pain in exchange for a longer (if not necessarily eternal) life. In a striking, terrifically creepy image, Rose astral-projects herself into a victim\u2019s bedroom. She flies vertically to her destination, the camera swooping underneath to show her gliding face-down, like a bird. The film moves between the cult, the adult Danny, now going by Dan (Ewan McGregor, behind a bushy beard), and a young girl with telepathic powers called Abra (as in cadabra), played with steely resolve by Kyliegh Curran. It takes a little while for their stories to intersect. Dan is an alcoholic like his father, Jack, and McGregor imbues him with little-boy-lost energy, suggesting that trauma is inherited and can\u2019t be outrun. Nor can the memory of Jack Nicholson or Shelley Duvall; the fan service Flanagan pays to the Kubrick cinematic universe ends up being a ghostly imitation.",

      "body": "<p>It was a perfectly Trumpian moment for one of America\u2019s most Trumpian governors.</p> <p>Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Andy Beshear, had just accused the Republican governor, Matt Bevin, of lying in a debate last week, saying: \u201cThis is just more of the same from a governor who says that someone commits suicide on a casino floor every night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never said anything like that in my life,\u201d Bevin shot back at his Democratic challenger for the governor\u2019s seat.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all on tape!\u201d responded a flabbergasted Beshear as Bevin continued his denials.</p> <p><a href=\"https://wfpl.org/bevin-someone-kills-themselves-on-a-casino-floor-every-day/\">Of course, there is a tape</a>: the governor\u2019s comments that people kill themselves in casinos \u2013 though, not specifically casino floors \u2013 were made without proof in July and helped fuel Kentucky\u2019s election news cycle for a few days. But Bevin appears to have taken a lesson from the president on the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/04/guide-stages-trump-denial/\">art of denial</a>.</p> <p>With a disapproval rating of 53%, Bevin is currently ranked the second-least popular governor in the country <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/governor-rankings-q2-19/\">according to Morning Consult</a> \u2013 and for much of the year, he was the least popular. But despite that unpopularity \u2013 largely driven by his combative personality and repeated attacks on public school teachers \u2013 there\u2019s a fairly good chance he\u2019s about to win re-election on 5 November.</p> <p>\u201cI think the odds are in his favour because the political landscape tilts in his direction,\u201d said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. \u201cThis is a socially conservative state and he\u2019s a social conservative. It\u2019s a pro-Trump state and he\u2019s wrapped himself around Trump. And he has presided over a good economy for most of the state.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2019/10/16/kentucky-election-matt-bevin-andy-beshear-tied-race-governor/3988544002/\">A Mason-Dixon poll</a> earlier this month showed Bevin in a dead heat with Beshear, Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, with each candidate polling at 46%.</p> <p>In Kentucky, conservative voters are faced with a choice that Republicans around the country will have to make in 12 months: will they vote for an incumbent despite what is seen as an off-putting personality? Do party power and policy outweigh everything else?</p> <p>Like Trump, Bevin\u2019s words have gotten him into trouble. When public school teachers protested against controversial pension reform efforts, <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2018/04/13/matt-bevin-kentucky-governor-children-sexually-assaulted-teacher-protests/516569002/\">Bevin said the </a><a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2018/04/13/matt-bevin-kentucky-governor-children-sexually-assaulted-teacher-protests/516569002/\">strike</a> would result in children left at home without supervision being sexually assaulted and ingesting poison. Later, <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2019/04/25/kentucky-teacher-sickouts-matt-bevin-child-shot-comment/3574640002/\">he blamed the accidental shooting of a seven-year-old</a> girl by her 11-year-old brother on teachers who were protesting that day, leaving schools closed. He said those protesting against pension reform had a \u201cthug mentality\u201d.</p> <p>Primaried by Republican challengers earlier this year, he secured his party\u2019s nomination with just 52% of the vote, losing large swaths of the state.</p> <p>In a state where Trump carried more than 60% of the vote in 2016 and every county except for the homes of the two biggest cities, Bevin has anchored himself to the president, portraying the gubernatorial election as part of a larger national battle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa4337c35c5347d4b8b6803f7ad3d565404491b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa4337c35c5347d4b8b6803f7ad3d565404491b1/0_98_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Beshear makes his pitch on education next to his running mate Jacqueline Coleman.

Bevin\u2019s television ads prominently feature images of the governor with the president.</p> <p>One Bevin ad that has been popping up on Facebook tells voters to back Bevin to show support for Trump, saying: \u201cRadical liberals in Washington are only focused on one thing: impeaching President Trump.

      "bodyText": "It was a perfectly Trumpian moment for one of America\u2019s most Trumpian governors. Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Andy Beshear, had just accused the Republican governor, Matt Bevin, of lying in a debate last week, saying: \u201cThis is just more of the same from a governor who says that someone commits suicide on a casino floor every night.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything like that in my life,\u201d Bevin shot back at his Democratic challenger for the governor\u2019s seat. \u201cIt\u2019s all on tape!\u201d responded a flabbergasted Beshear as Bevin continued his denials. Of course, there is a tape: the governor\u2019s comments that people kill themselves in casinos \u2013 though, not specifically casino floors \u2013 were made without proof in July and helped fuel Kentucky\u2019s election news cycle for a few days. But Bevin appears to have taken a lesson from the president on the art of denial. With a disapproval rating of 53%, Bevin is currently ranked the second-least popular governor in the country according to Morning Consult \u2013 and for much of the year, he was the least popular. But despite that unpopularity \u2013 largely driven by his combative personality and repeated attacks on public school teachers \u2013 there\u2019s a fairly good chance he\u2019s about to win re-election on 5 November. \u201cI think the odds are in his favour because the political landscape tilts in his direction,\u201d said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. \u201cThis is a socially conservative state and he\u2019s a social conservative. It\u2019s a pro-Trump state and he\u2019s wrapped himself around Trump. And he has presided over a good economy for most of the state.\u201d A Mason-Dixon poll earlier this month showed Bevin in a dead heat with Beshear, Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, with each candidate polling at 46%. In Kentucky, conservative voters are faced with a choice that Republicans around the country will have to make in 12 months: will they vote for an incumbent despite what is seen as an off-putting personality? Do party power and policy outweigh everything else? Like Trump, Bevin\u2019s words have gotten him into trouble. When public school teachers protested against controversial pension reform efforts, Bevin said the strike would result in children left at home without supervision being sexually assaulted and ingesting poison. Later, he blamed the accidental shooting of a seven-year-old girl by her 11-year-old brother on teachers who were protesting that day, leaving schools closed. He said those protesting against pension reform had a \u201cthug mentality\u201d. Primaried by Republican challengers earlier this year, he secured his party\u2019s nomination with just 52% of the vote, losing large swaths of the state. In a state where Trump carried more than 60% of the vote in 2016 and every county except for the homes of the two biggest cities, Bevin has anchored himself to the president, portraying the gubernatorial election as part of a larger national battle. He has started calling his opponent \u201cLil\u2019 Andy\u201d \u2013 seemingly inspired by Trump\u2019s taunts against \u201cLil\u2019\u201d Marco Rubio during the presidential primaries \u2013 and the \u201cHunter Biden of Kentucky\u201d. Bevin\u2019s television ads prominently feature images of the governor with the president. One Bevin ad that has been popping up on Facebook tells voters to back Bevin to show support for Trump, saying: \u201cRadical liberals in Washington are only focused on one thing: impeaching President Trump. Vote for Matt Bevin on Nov. 5 to send them a message!\u201d Republican strategist Scott Jennings says the push to impeach Trump is pushing Americans into partisan corners \u2013 and that could work to Bevin\u2019s advantage. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if impeachment is good for the country, but it might be good for Matt Bevin in this particular campaign,\u201d he said. Trump has endorsed Bevin and is scheduled to hold a rally for the governor in Kentucky on the eve of the election. While Bevin has tried to nationalise the race, Beshear has tried to keep the focus local while being careful not to alienate Republicans who could land on his side. Beshear, 41, is not exactly the kind of candidate that would inspire enthusiasm among the Democratic party\u2019s increasingly progressive base elsewhere in the country. He is the son of Kentucky\u2019s last governor before Bevin, Steve Beshear. He tends to avoid criticising Trump, refusing to call the president\u2019s tweet telling four minority congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to their ancestral homelands racist and has remained silent on impeachment. One of his TV ads even features Trump supporters. If he does win, it could well be due to Bevin\u2019s antagonism towards the state\u2019s educators and Beshear\u2019s embrace of them. Beshear has made teachers a focal point of his campaign. He constantly rails against Bevin\u2019s \u201cbullying\u2019 of educators and promised that he would never bully fellow Kentuckians if elected. For a running mate, he tapped Jacqueline Coleman, a public high school assistant principal who was formerly a social studies teacher and basketball coach. Volunteers from 120 Strong, a grassroots advocacy group initially formed by education employees to oppose pension reform and claims 40,000 members, have been campaigning for Beshear across the state. \u201cThis is not about Team Democrat or Team Republican,\u201d said Nema Brewer, a public school district employee who is a co-founder and leader of the group. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it has to be. We all have to shed our political affiliations and do the right thing here and get a foot off our throat.\u201d Though many Republicans may be put off by Bevin\u2019s demeanour and treatment of educators, there will be Christian conservatives among them who cast ballots for the governor \u2013 as many did for Trump \u2013 simply because of his stance on abortion. Bevin publicly embraces faith. He has touted himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most pro-life governor\u201d while attacking Beshear, who supports Roe v Wade, as taking \u201cblood money\u201d from abortion providers to fund his campaign and choosing the side of \u201cdeath over life\u201d. With 57% of Kentucky adults saying that abortion should be illegal in all or most cases according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll, Bevin\u2019s hard push on abortion and faith could pay off. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons that a Republican who was lukewarm on Bevin or didn\u2019t vote for him in the primary might go home in November: it\u2019s because at the end of the day, they don\u2019t want to vote for a pro-abortion liberal Democrat,\u201d said Jennings, the Republican strategist. \u201cYou can look past your quibbles with someone on their communications style if you know they\u2019re going to protect life.

I was waiting for them to tell me I was going to hell.\u201d</p> <p>Lisciandro, who has been in a relationship with her partner, Natalia Dick, 38, for more than a year, said she was in tears by the end of the meeting and offered to hand in her classroom keys and computer.</p> <p>\u201cThey said: \u2018Oh no, we want you to teach today.

But you can\u2019t work here if you\u2019re gay, so you really don\u2019t affirm me,\u201d Lisciandro said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t teach children, if I\u2019m a good teacher but I can\u2019t teach children just because I\u2019m gay, then you don\u2019t affirm my worth.

I was married to a man and I have three kids. I\u2019ve done a lot of work loving myself and accepting myself, then in that moment, in that meeting, it took me back to those feelings. If I felt that kind of shame as an adult who spent years coming to terms with everything, I can only imagine how students would feel.\u201d</p> <p>With no legal protections in place in Florida, Lisciandro said she could not fight her dismissal, but wanted to prevent the same thing happening to somebody else. \u201cIf it can help someone, that\u2019s the reason for speaking out,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Joe Saunders, senior political director for Equality Florida, said the case is proof of the need for legal protection for LBGTQ workers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that in 2019 anybody in Florida, or anywhere, is fired for being who they are,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe live in a moment when the supreme court has ruled definitively in support of marriage equality but, where there are no local protections against discrimination, people can put a picture of their legal married partner, their husband or wife, on their desk and be fired for it.</p> <p>\u201cOr, in the case of Monica, go to a Pride event and stand with their community, and come into work the next day and be told that they\u2019re immoral and lose their livelihoods because of it.\u201d</p> <p>Saunders said his group has been trying for years to get protections for LBGTQ workers through Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature, and <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article235769332.html\">would try again next year</a>.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.stepupforstudents.org/\">Step Up for Students</a>, a state-approved not-for-profit group, 118 of Covenant Christian\u2019s 283 enrolled students have their tuition fees of up to $7,734 annually met by Florida\u2019s tax credit scholarship program. Additionally, the school also accepts taxpayer-funded scholarships from two other state programs, potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.</p> <p>\u201cThe legislature could act tomorrow and say that if you are a private religious school receiving public education dollars it\u2019s illegal for you to discriminate against teachers and students,\u201d Saunders said.</p>",

We want you to pass the baton to the new teacher to avoid embarrassment for you, and to keep the school\u2019s reputation intact.\u2019 It was going to be this whole theme about why I was leaving, you know, some personal stuff, this, that and the other.\u201d Initially at least, the school, which has 283 fee-paying students from kindergarten to high school, did not tell parents the reason for the abrupt departure of Lisciandro, who taught drama classes part-time for three years. \u201cI am sorry to say that for personal reasons Mrs Lisciandro is not able to continue teaching our musical theater class,\u201d Wenzel wrote in an email. But after Florida Today published a story about the dismissal, Wenzel issued a statement, reported by NBC, confirming he had fired her because she was gay. \u201cCovenant Christian school requires that all employees must agree to and model our position on human sexuality, which is based on the biblical teaching that asks all Christ followers to abstain from any sexual activities outside of a one-man, one-woman marriage,\u201d he wrote. Wenzel did not respond to a request for comment. Lisciandro, however, claimed the school conveyed no such policy when she was hired. \u201cThey never said that. They lost their drama teacher and said they were really in a bind and needed someone to come in and direct it. Now they say you can\u2019t be Christian and hold a position of leadership in the school if you\u2019re gay,\u201d she said. A \u201cnon-discrimination policy\u201d on the school\u2019s website states it \u201cdoes not discriminate on the basis or race, color, or national or ethnic origin\u201d. A Florida Today story from May about the state\u2019s taxpayer dollars supporting private religious schools refers to a student handbook, since removed from the school\u2019s website, which stated that students who are homosexual are subject to expulsion. \u201cIn their statement it\u2019s like we affirm everyone, we value everyone. But you can\u2019t work here if you\u2019re gay, so you really don\u2019t affirm me,\u201d Lisciandro said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t teach children, if I\u2019m a good teacher but I can\u2019t teach children just because I\u2019m gay, then you don\u2019t affirm my worth. It\u2019s so hypocritical. \u201cBefore I came out two years ago I was almost suicidal. I was worried I was going to ruin everything and everybody\u2019s lives. I was married to a man and I have three kids. I\u2019ve done a lot of work loving myself and accepting myself, then in that moment, in that meeting, it took me back to those feelings. If I felt that kind of shame as an adult who spent years coming to terms with everything, I can only imagine how students would feel.\u201d With no legal protections in place in Florida, Lisciandro said she could not fight her dismissal, but wanted to prevent the same thing happening to somebody else. \u201cIf it can help someone, that\u2019s the reason for speaking out,\u201d she said. Joe Saunders, senior political director for Equality Florida, said the case is proof of the need for legal protection for LBGTQ workers. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that in 2019 anybody in Florida, or anywhere, is fired for being who they are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in a moment when the supreme court has ruled definitively in support of marriage equality but, where there are no local protections against discrimination, people can put a picture of their legal married partner, their husband or wife, on their desk and be fired for it. \u201cOr, in the case of Monica, go to a Pride event and stand with their community, and come into work the next day and be told that they\u2019re immoral and lose their livelihoods because of it.\u201d Saunders said his group has been trying for years to get protections for LBGTQ workers through Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature, and would try again next year. According to Step Up for Students, a state-approved not-for-profit group, 118 of Covenant Christian\u2019s 283 enrolled students have their tuition fees of up to $7,734 annually met by Florida\u2019s tax credit scholarship program. Additionally, the school also accepts taxpayer-funded scholarships from two other state programs, potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. \u201cThe legislature could act tomorrow and say that if you are a private religious school receiving public education dollars it\u2019s illegal for you to discriminate against teachers and students,\u201d Saunders said.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d was the mantra of the co-founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the graduate students who, in the late 1990s, had invented a groundbreaking way of searching the web. At the time, one of the things the duo believed to be evil was advertising. There\u2019s no reason to doubt their initial sincerity on this matter, but when the slogan was included in the prospectus for their company\u2019s flotation in 2004 one began to wonder what they were smoking. Were they really naive enough to believe that one could run a public company on a policy of ethical purity?</p> <p>The problem was that purity requires a business model to support it and in 2000 the venture capitalists who had invested in Google pointed out to the boys that they didn\u2019t have one. So they invented a model that involved harvesting users\u2019 data to enable targeted advertising. And in the four years between that capitulation to reality and the flotation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/02/facebook-google-data-change-our-behaviour-democracy\" title=\"\">Google\u2019s revenues increased by nearly 3,590%</a>. That kind of money talks.</p> <p>Rana Foroohar has adopted the Google mantra as the title for her masterful critique of the tech giants that now dominate our world. It\u2019s an apt choice because it captures one of the leitmotifs in the story of how these corporations came into being and grew to their current monstrous proportions, a journey that takes them from naive (and sometimes libertarian) beginnings to ruthless monopolistic dominance.</p> <p>The great thing about her book is that it breaks the mesmerising spell that the tech giants seem to have cast upon governments, mass media and users everywhere. The beginning of wisdom in this matter is to realise that Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Uber et al are just very large corporations that do what corporations have done from time immemorial \u2013 exploit resources in order to generate profit. The only differences between them and the corporate giants of old are the nature of the resources they have appropriated and the grotesque profit margins that they obtain.</p> <p>Foroohar is well qualified to tackle them. Her day job is that of the <em>Financial Times\u2019s</em> global business correspondent, so she occupies an influential perch. But she has also, in her time, worked on the fringes of the tech industry during the first internet bubble, the one that burst in 2000. So she\u2019s seen the dynamics of tech exuberance from the inside.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is about the essential sociopathy of corporations, even those run by well-intentioned human beings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Basically, though, she comes across as a level-headed, informed and well-connected journalist: most people in the industry return her calls, even if they make sure to have a PR adviser listening in. Which is prudent, since Foroohar combines a polite manner with a high-powered crap-detector. She even emerged sane after spending several days in the company of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns\" title=\"\">Travis Kalanick</a>, the founder of Uber and a character whom James Joyce would have described as \u201ca caution to rattlesnakes\u201d.</p> <p>The overarching theme of <em>Don\u2019t Be Evil</em> is \u201chow big tech betrayed its founding principles\u201d. This is a variation on a popular theme: how the people who founded these powerful corporations were basically high-IQ innocents who had their innocence and idealism knocked out of them by the exigencies of running capitalist organisations.</p> <p>The \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d mantra is one example. Another is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s tropes about \u201cconnecting the world\u201d and creating \u201ccommunities\u201d. Another is Steve Jobs\u02bcs metaphor of the personal computer as \u201ca bicycle for the mind\u201d. And of course there\u2019s the pervasive mysticism about using technology \u201cto change the world\u201d. At no point in these vapourings does one ever find crude intentions of becoming insanely rich.</p> <p>There is another way of reading this story, though. It is about the essential sociopathy of corporations, even those run by well-intentioned human beings. The reason some of the tech companies got such an easy ride in the public imagination is that their founders were not middle-aged bastards in homburg hats \u2013 think John D Rockefeller and JP Morgan \u2013 but young geeks in hoodies. Yet these same geeks supervised the growth of corporations that are as ruthless and socially irresponsible as Standard Oil was.</p> <p>Which means that we now find ourselves faced with the same problem as faced the United States in the early 1900s: how to bring these behemoths under democratic control. And one of the most useful things about this book is that it does not fall into the trap of regarding all the tech giants as being the same. They\u2019re not and discriminating between them will be the key to regulating them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/privacy-focused-facebook-kill-zuckerbergs-business-model\" title=\"\">The business model of Facebook</a> and Google, for example, is radically different from those of Apple or Microsoft. And Amazon is a case apart.</p> <p>The most startling thought that emerges from <em>Don\u2019t Be Evil</em>, though, is that big tech may have already become \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d because the companies have become systemically critical to our economies \u2013 for reasons that have little to do with technology. The risk comes from the colossal \u201ccash\u201d reserves that they have parked abroad in best tax-avoidance manner. Foroohar says that more than half of those stashes are denominated not in dollars, but in corporate bonds. And if anything should happen to the value of those, then it might be 2008 all over again, but without a safety net. So much for not being evil.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Don't Be Evil</em> by Rana Foroohar is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "\u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d was the mantra of the co-founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the graduate students who, in the late 1990s, had invented a groundbreaking way of searching the web. At the time, one of the things the duo believed to be evil was advertising. There\u2019s no reason to doubt their initial sincerity on this matter, but when the slogan was included in the prospectus for their company\u2019s flotation in 2004 one began to wonder what they were smoking. Were they really naive enough to believe that one could run a public company on a policy of ethical purity? The problem was that purity requires a business model to support it and in 2000 the venture capitalists who had invested in Google pointed out to the boys that they didn\u2019t have one. So they invented a model that involved harvesting users\u2019 data to enable targeted advertising. And in the four years between that capitulation to reality and the flotation, Google\u2019s revenues increased by nearly 3,590%. That kind of money talks. Rana Foroohar has adopted the Google mantra as the title for her masterful critique of the tech giants that now dominate our world. It\u2019s an apt choice because it captures one of the leitmotifs in the story of how these corporations came into being and grew to their current monstrous proportions, a journey that takes them from naive (and sometimes libertarian) beginnings to ruthless monopolistic dominance. The great thing about her book is that it breaks the mesmerising spell that the tech giants seem to have cast upon governments, mass media and users everywhere. The beginning of wisdom in this matter is to realise that Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Uber et al are just very large corporations that do what corporations have done from time immemorial \u2013 exploit resources in order to generate profit. The only differences between them and the corporate giants of old are the nature of the resources they have appropriated and the grotesque profit margins that they obtain. Foroohar is well qualified to tackle them. Her day job is that of the Financial Times\u2019s global business correspondent, so she occupies an influential perch. But she has also, in her time, worked on the fringes of the tech industry during the first internet bubble, the one that burst in 2000. So she\u2019s seen the dynamics of tech exuberance from the inside. Basically, though, she comes across as a level-headed, informed and well-connected journalist: most people in the industry return her calls, even if they make sure to have a PR adviser listening in. Which is prudent, since Foroohar combines a polite manner with a high-powered crap-detector. She even emerged sane after spending several days in the company of Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber and a character whom James Joyce would have described as \u201ca caution to rattlesnakes\u201d. The overarching theme of Don\u2019t Be Evil is \u201chow big tech betrayed its founding principles\u201d. This is a variation on a popular theme: how the people who founded these powerful corporations were basically high-IQ innocents who had their innocence and idealism knocked out of them by the exigencies of running capitalist organisations. The \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d mantra is one example. Another is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s tropes about \u201cconnecting the world\u201d and creating \u201ccommunities\u201d. Another is Steve Jobs\u02bcs metaphor of the personal computer as \u201ca bicycle for the mind\u201d. And of course there\u2019s the pervasive mysticism about using technology \u201cto change the world\u201d. At no point in these vapourings does one ever find crude intentions of becoming insanely rich. There is another way of reading this story, though. It is about the essential sociopathy of corporations, even those run by well-intentioned human beings. The reason some of the tech companies got such an easy ride in the public imagination is that their founders were not middle-aged bastards in homburg hats \u2013 think John D Rockefeller and JP Morgan \u2013 but young geeks in hoodies. Yet these same geeks supervised the growth of corporations that are as ruthless and socially irresponsible as Standard Oil was. Which means that we now find ourselves faced with the same problem as faced the United States in the early 1900s: how to bring these behemoths under democratic control. And one of the most useful things about this book is that it does not fall into the trap of regarding all the tech giants as being the same. They\u2019re not and discriminating between them will be the key to regulating them. The business model of Facebook and Google, for example, is radically different from those of Apple or Microsoft. And Amazon is a case apart. The most startling thought that emerges from Don\u2019t Be Evil, though, is that big tech may have already become \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d because the companies have become systemically critical to our economies \u2013 for reasons that have little to do with technology. The risk comes from the colossal \u201ccash\u201d reserves that they have parked abroad in best tax-avoidance manner. Foroohar says that more than half of those stashes are denominated not in dollars, but in corporate bonds. And if anything should happen to the value of those, then it might be 2008 all over again, but without a safety net. So much for not being evil. \u2022 Don't Be Evil by Rana Foroohar is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, told Vanity Fair\u2019s New Establishment summit last month: \u201cI imagine I will support a Democratic nominee. I have spoken for many years about my desire for my daughter and yours to see a woman as president.\u201d Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, argued that Zuckerberg and Sandberg are reckless \u201cauthoritarians\u201d who helped get Jair Bolsonaro elected in Brazil and will do whatever it takes to preserve their power. \u201cI don\u2019t see why Facebook book wouldn\u2019t give Trump a massive, unlimited donation to get him re-elected. Who would even be able to find out whether they did that?\u201d But Stoller, author of Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that they are just for Republicans. I think that they are as likely to try to destroy Josh Hawley or to try to promote Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg or other candidates they like as they are to help Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re authoritarians. They don\u2019t care particularly about which party is in charge.\u201d Facebook\u2019s Washington office did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Thank you for your company this afternoon, that\u2019s all from me for the time being. A pleasure to be around when Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy are in that kind of form. Catch you next time. A-League: Melbourne City 3-2 Wellington - Ha ha ha! Louis Fenton has just effed and jeffed on the Fox Sports postmatch coverage and Archie Thompson had no idea what to do. You hate to see it. Fenton, remember, was adjudged to have handballed to gift City their third goal. Melbourne City, top of the league. A-League: GOAL! (Waine, 90+3 mins): Melbourne City 3-2 Wellington - Jamieson is the latest to butcher a golden opportunity for City to kill this game off. They could have had six or seven this second half, but instead the Nix attack down the left, the ball is rolled across the six-yard box and Waine is on hand to tap in at the far post and create a nervy couple of minutes at AAMI Park. A-League: 88 mins: Melbourne City 3-1 Wellington - City should have a fourth but after lovely build-up play debutant Colakovski can\u2019t direct his free header on target. A few seconds later the youngster can\u2019t beat Marinovic one-on-one after a lovely through-ball from Genreau. A-League: 86 mins: Melbourne City 3-1 Wellington - A host of substitutions and injuries have taken the sting out of the closing stages at AAMI Park. Not that Melbourne City care, they\u2019re heading to the top of the league. Cricket: It\u2019s raining again in Sydney. At risk of no-result in the T20I. A-League: 79 mins: Melbourne City 3-1 Wellington - Couple of decent saves from Marinovic keeping Wellington within touching distance but City are getting into dangerous areas at will. A-League: 75 mins: Melbourne City 3-1 Wellington - City look the likelier of the two sides to score next. Wellington are pushing but they\u2019re leaving space in behind that City, through Luna, Wales and Genreau, have come close to exploiting. Metcalfe continues to demonstrate why he is such a talent, showing superb close control, weight of pass and timing in the final third, to go with his obvious physicality. Heck of a prospect. Needless to say, Ufuk Tallay is ropeable on the touchline. Sometimes, to my eyes, he has a look of former Guardian columnist and professional miserablist Charlie Brooker, which makes his mardy face somehow comical. WBBL: Strikers 141-8 v Heat - In the final WBBL outing of the day the Strikers have posted a par score at Harrup Park in Mackay against the Heat. Sophie Devine starred with 65 as Adelaide look to move one game clear on top of the ladder. Georgie Prestwidge took three wickets for Brisbane as they battle to remain in the hunt for the semi-finals. A-League: GOAL! (Noone pen 64 mins): Melbourne City 3-1 Wellington - Noone smacks the spot-kick with his left foot hard and high to the left of Marinovic and City are cruising. A-League: PENALTY! 61mins: Melbourne City 2-1 Wellington - City attack down the left and from the side of the box Genreau drills a cross at point-blank range at Fenton and the referee points to the spot. There\u2019s a VAR delay - of course. In my eyes that wasn\u2019t a pen, full stop, because of the distance between attacker and defender. Added to that, replays suggest first contact was with Fenton\u2019s chest, not his arm, but VAR did not see a clear and obvious error. Deary me, the new IFAB definition of handball plus VAR is a dumpster fire. A-League: 58 mins: Melbourne City 2-1 Wellington - There\u2019s plenty of hustle and bustle but few clear chances at AAMI Park. City remain in control at this stage but as the game gets stretched and play broken Wellington look increasingly dangerous. A-League: 48 mins: Melbourne City 2-1 Wellington - Back underway at AAMI Park in a match that has come to the simmer nicely after a slow beginning. City have started the half brightly with a couple of corners causing some issues in the Nix box. Cricket: It\u2019s the innings break in the rain-affected T20I between Australia and Pakistan at the SCG. WBBL: 20 overs: Stars 154-6 (Flintoff 1, Penna 0) (Sixers 199-0) The Stars did their best in an unlikely run-chase but the quality of Perry and Healy at the top of the order meant the Sixers were always likely to earn the win. Villani made 59 and Martin 31 but it never seemed likely they would overhaul such a mammoth total. The Sixers have bowled better than they did today but Sarah Aley will be pleased with her 2/18. The Sixers join the Strikers and Thunder on top of the ladder with four wins. A-League: GOAL! (Galloway, 35) Melbourne City 2-1 Wellington - From 1-0 down to 2-1 up in no time at all. Phoenix invite Scott Galloway to come forward down the right and the fullback accepts the invitation before cutting inside and unleashing a thumping drive with his left foot from 25m that is too fierce for Marinovic to keep out diving to his left. That was a fair old wallop. WBBL: 16 overs: Stars 114-4 (Martin 11, Faltum 6) (Sixers 199-0) This one is all-but done. Villani\u2019s lone hand ended on 59 and now we\u2019re just waiting for the last rites to be read. A-League: GOAL! (Metcalfe, 31) Melbourne City 1-1 Wellington - City don\u2019t take long to hit back. A nice move creates space in the inside-right channel for Noone. He cuts back onto his left and delivers a teasing cross into the box that Connor Metcalfe hunts like peak Graeme Sharp to head into the back of the net. Metcalfe is growing into one of the stories of this A-League season. Superb prospect, and still only 19 (for a couple more days). A-League: GOAL! (Hooper, 24) Melbourne City 0-1 Wellington - The Nix haven\u2019t done a lot of attacking today but they\u2019ve opened the scoring nonetheless. From a rare foray forward they earn a corner and from that Gary Hooper steals in unmarked at the far post to nod over the line following a handy flick-on. Some pretty questionable defending from City but on the balance of the season so far Wellington deserve a bit of good fortune. A-League 20 mins: Melbourne City 0-0 Wellington - The home side are dominating possession at AAMI Park but they are failing to convert that into clear chances. Plus ca change, plus c\u2019est la meme chose, and all that. WBBL: 12 overs: Stars 89-3 (Villani 51, Martin 3) (Sixers 199-0) The run-rate is now reaching eye-watering territory despite Villani reaching her 18th 50 in the WBBL from just 35 deliveries. A-League 12 mins: Melbourne City 0-0 Wellington WBBL: 10.1 overs: Stars 81-3 (Villani 47) (Sixers 199-0) Villani is batting superbly, adjusting her position at the crease to put the Sixers bowlers off their lengths and working the ball with power and finesse into the gaps on the massive oval. At the other end Osborne should be out but after chipping a simple catch to mid-on (or mid-off) two Sixers fielders - Campbell and Aley - collided and the ball goes to ground. That could have been a nasty accident but thankfully both fielders are unscathed, but for a couple of bruised egos. Not that it matters! One ball later Osborne drills Aley straight to Campbell at mid-off. Funny old game, eh? A-League: 5 mins: Melbourne City 0-0 Wellington - We\u2019re underway in our first A-League fixture of the day and there\u2019s not much doing in the early exchanges. City, remember, are without their main source of goals, Jamie Maclaren. WBBL: 8 overs: Stars 67-2 (Villani 39, Osborne 3) (Sixers 199-0) Villani continues to lead the charge for the Stars at the WACA ground. A run-rate in excess of eight would normally be a tremendous start but chasing such a massive score it remains under par. It does feel borderline unfair watching Perry and Healy bat at a domestic level considering how far above the international standard the pair both are. Great for the WBBL product though and makes for superb TV. WBBL: 6 overs: Stars 47-2 (Villani 19, Osborne 2) (Sixers 199-0) After that promising start it\u2019s all gone Pete Tong for the Stars. Lee holed out to Perry off Gardner, then du Preez was agonisingly run-out at the non-striker\u2019s end after backing up too far and the all-action Perry managed to fingertip a drive onto the stumps in her follow-through. Cricket: Speaking of run-chases, England have failed in theirs in the second T20I away to New Zealand. WBBL: 4 overs: Stars 39-0 (Villani 18, Lee 21) (Sixers 199-0) Better from the Stars, upping the pressure on Kapp and van Niekerk. That patient start is turning into a decent foundation to launch an intimidating run-chase. WBBL: 2 overs: Stars 9-0 (Villani 2, Lee 7) (Sixers 199-0) The Stars have the unenviable task of chasing the fourth-highest total in WBBL history but they have got off to a modest start. Cricket: It\u2019s currently raining in Sydney where Australia\u2019s men are on top in their T20I against Pakistan. Follow that one here... WBBL: Sixers 199-0 v Stars (Perry 87, Healy 106) Healy goes inside-out for four over cover but then risks losing her chance of a ton by only finding a single from ball two. Perry shows she is the dream teammate by nurdling a single to return Healy to strike and her opening partner slashes a boundary through the vacant cordon. She then steps to leg and drives powerfully over cover to bring up her century from just 52 balls. For good measure she lashes the final ball behind point for four more. What a batter.

Healy then gets a steepling leading edge to a sweep that hangs in the air long enough for a hard-run two. The Queenslander then hammers a drive for another two before switch-hitting to the field for a single. WBBL: 18 overs: Sixers 167-0 v Stars (Perry 77, Healy 84) Runs, runs, glorious runs! Healy is now 84 from 45 after another six downtown. WBBL: 17 overs: Sixers 152-0 v Stars (Perry 73, Healy 73) The magenta march continues unabated. Is there time for a century or two? WBBL: Thunder 149-4 beat Hurricanes 148-6 - Earlier today Sydney Thunder climbed to the top of the WBBL ladder with a comfortable victory over the Hobart Hurricanes. Rachel Priest struck 50 as the Thunder chased down their target with almost two overs to spare. The Canes were once again indebted to England\u2019s Heather Knight for her 77 during the opening 20 overs when each member of the Thunder attack took at least one wicket.

That shot brings up Perry\u2019s 15th WBBL half-century. WBBL: 12 overs: Sixers 99-0 v Stars (Perry 44, Healy 51) That\u2019s 50 for Healy, from just 29 balls. She is punishing anything short and using her feet to turn anything on a length into a half-volley. Too good. At the other end Perry is scoring at a run a ball, keeping Healy on strike as much as she can. Superb partnership batting. WBBL: 10 overs: Sixers 83-0 v Stars (Perry 41, Healy 38) The first update from the WBBL is to tell you what you already know, that Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy are terrifyingly good at cricket. The Sixers openers have taken the Stars apart in the early stages at the WACA ground and both are set for huge scores. Hello everybody and welcome to another jam-packed Sunday sportwatch.

      "body": "<p>It is little wonder that the NHS takes centre stage in election campaign after election campaign: it commands an extraordinary level of public support. We are <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/07/04/nhs-british-institution-brits-are-second-most-prou\" title=\"\">more proud of the NHS</a> than the armed forces or the royal family. <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/what-does-public-think-about-nhs\" title=\"\">Nine in 10</a> support the founding principles of the NHS: free to all on the basis of need, not ability to pay. And if the NHS is the closest thing the British have to a religion, voters tend to look unfavourably on politicians seen to embody a credible threat to it.</p> <p>This is why Jeremy Corbyn launched his campaign with a stark warning about the threat of a US trade deal struck by a Conservative government, declaring the NHS is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-corbyn-says-nhs-not-for-for-sale-as-he-launches-labour-election-campaign_uk_5dbad12ae4b00d83f7239089\" title=\"\">not for sale</a>\u201d. The Conservatives promptly hit back; the health secretary, Matt Hancock, called it one of Labour\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7639891/Labour-accused-peddling-pathetic-scare-stories-NHS-trade-deal.html\" title=\"\">pathetic scare stories</a>\u201d. Even Donald Trump weighed in, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system\u2026 we\u2019re just talking about trade.\u201d It would be politically foolish for any Conservative government to try to unpick the fundamental underpinnings of the NHS; to pave the way for large-scale privatisation, to introduce an insurance-style system or to bring in significant user charges. But Labour is right that the Conservatives pose a more insidious threat, by starving it of the resources it needs, and introducing the means for powerful private-sector suppliers, such as the big pharma companies, to extract more profit at the expense of the taxpayer.</p> <p>The Conservative record since 2010 speaks for itself. Like every other public service, the NHS has come under severe strain as a result of public spending cuts imposed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/19/hammond-november-budget-banish-ghost-osborne-help-the-poor\" title=\"\">Tory chancellors</a>, even as they have doled out generous tax cuts costing billions of pounds a year that have disproportionately benefited more affluent families. This last decade has represented the <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2015/10/nhs-spending-squeezed-never\" title=\"\">tightest funding settlement</a> the NHS has received since its founding. Funding has not kept pace with rising demand as a result of an ageing population and advances in medical technology, despite the fact that spending on healthcare is significantly lower than among many of our international competitors.</p> <p>The verdict of the independent King\u2019s Fund is that the NHS is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/spending-and-availability-health-care-resources\" title=\"\">clearly under-resourced</a>\u201d. This is why, winter after winter, the NHS has struggled to meet need. Last winter, it took the unprecedented step of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/02/nhs-hospitals-told-to-take-unprecedented-measures-amid-winter-crisis\" title=\"\">cancelling all non-urgent surgery</a>, against a backdrop of increasing waiting lists, understaffing and bed occupancy rates consistently above the levels that permit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/observer-view-on-nhs-funding\" title=\"\">safe care</a>. Meanwhile, Conservative ministers have sought to misrepresent the figures: they have consistently claimed that the NHS is <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/governments-10-billion-nhs-funding-commitment-what-nhs-leaders-asked/\" title=\"\">getting more money than it actually is</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"555445847beec6fca3012590deeebd1e5309144d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/555445847beec6fca3012590deeebd1e5309144d/0_259_4573_2744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump said: \u2018It\u2019s not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system\u2026 we\u2019re just talking about trade.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the Conservatives have already put the NHS at risk in order to fulfil their objective of cutting back public spending in order to pay for expensive and unnecessary tax cuts. There is no reason to believe they will not do so again. A US trade deal is a cherished objective of the hard Eurosceptic right that now dominates the Conservative party and it poses serious risks to the NHS.</p> <p>It could open the door to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/01/nhs-drugs-bill-could-soar-if-johnson-signs-trump-trade-deal-report\" title=\"\">rising NHS drug costs</a> to the tune of billions of pounds a year. The NHS is one of the world\u2019s biggest drugs purchasers and exerts a significant downward pressure on prices. Most pharmaceutical companies take part in a voluntary pricing and access scheme that caps the total price the NHS pays for drugs manufactured under patent. The NHS also has a world-leading system for assessing drugs, not just for safety and effectiveness but value for money. Together, these mechanisms mean pharmaceutical companies wanting to sell to the NHS have to offer their drugs many times cheaper than in the under-regulated American market.

      "bodyText": "It is little wonder that the NHS takes centre stage in election campaign after election campaign: it commands an extraordinary level of public support. We are more proud of the NHS than the armed forces or the royal family. Nine in 10 support the founding principles of the NHS: free to all on the basis of need, not ability to pay. And if the NHS is the closest thing the British have to a religion, voters tend to look unfavourably on politicians seen to embody a credible threat to it. This is why Jeremy Corbyn launched his campaign with a stark warning about the threat of a US trade deal struck by a Conservative government, declaring the NHS is \u201cnot for sale\u201d. The Conservatives promptly hit back; the health secretary, Matt Hancock, called it one of Labour\u2019s \u201cpathetic scare stories\u201d. Even Donald Trump weighed in, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to have anything to do with your healthcare system\u2026 we\u2019re just talking about trade.\u201d It would be politically foolish for any Conservative government to try to unpick the fundamental underpinnings of the NHS; to pave the way for large-scale privatisation, to introduce an insurance-style system or to bring in significant user charges. But Labour is right that the Conservatives pose a more insidious threat, by starving it of the resources it needs, and introducing the means for powerful private-sector suppliers, such as the big pharma companies, to extract more profit at the expense of the taxpayer. The Conservative record since 2010 speaks for itself. Like every other public service, the NHS has come under severe strain as a result of public spending cuts imposed by Tory chancellors, even as they have doled out generous tax cuts costing billions of pounds a year that have disproportionately benefited more affluent families. This last decade has represented the tightest funding settlement the NHS has received since its founding. Funding has not kept pace with rising demand as a result of an ageing population and advances in medical technology, despite the fact that spending on healthcare is significantly lower than among many of our international competitors. The verdict of the independent King\u2019s Fund is that the NHS is \u201cclearly under-resourced\u201d. This is why, winter after winter, the NHS has struggled to meet need. Last winter, it took the unprecedented step of cancelling all non-urgent surgery, against a backdrop of increasing waiting lists, understaffing and bed occupancy rates consistently above the levels that permit safe care. Meanwhile, Conservative ministers have sought to misrepresent the figures: they have consistently claimed that the NHS is getting more money than it actually is. So the Conservatives have already put the NHS at risk in order to fulfil their objective of cutting back public spending in order to pay for expensive and unnecessary tax cuts. There is no reason to believe they will not do so again. A US trade deal is a cherished objective of the hard Eurosceptic right that now dominates the Conservative party and it poses serious risks to the NHS. It could open the door to rising NHS drug costs to the tune of billions of pounds a year. The NHS is one of the world\u2019s biggest drugs purchasers and exerts a significant downward pressure on prices. Most pharmaceutical companies take part in a voluntary pricing and access scheme that caps the total price the NHS pays for drugs manufactured under patent. The NHS also has a world-leading system for assessing drugs, not just for safety and effectiveness but value for money. Together, these mechanisms mean pharmaceutical companies wanting to sell to the NHS have to offer their drugs many times cheaper than in the under-regulated American market. The price the NHS pays influences pricing across much of the rest of the world. The US pharmaceutical industry has thus long had the NHS in its sights and in Trump they have found a sympathetic ear. He has taken aim at \u201cfreeloading\u201d foreign countries that regulate drug prices, blaming them for high US prices. The US government\u2019s desire to liberalise access to international drug markets has shaped the trade deals it has struck with other countries and it has stated it is an objective in any trade talks with the UK. As revealed by Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches last week, it has already been the subject of several meetings between US and UK trade negotiators. The hardline Tory right is desperate for a US trade deal that would align the UK\u2019s regulatory standards more closely to that of the free-market US; it is one of the reasons why it has always wanted to leave the EU. And the US is an economic powerhouse that will expect most of its objectives to be met in such a deal, particularly under an America-first president. After the economic fallout of a Boris Johnson hard Brexit, the UK would hardly be in a place to make exacting demands. A Johnson government could sign up the UK to measures in an international treaty that would bind the hand of future governments and turn Britain into a true rule-taker from the US. It makes an ultimate irony of the argument advanced by Brexiters that we should leave the EU, an institution over whose laws and rules we have a democratic say, in order to \u201ctake back control\u201d. The ideological right has taken over the Conservative party. It has already shown through its determination to pursue a hard Brexit that it will sacrifice the country\u2019s economic wellbeing in order to get the version of the future it wants.

Hang out feeders (and don\u2019t mind the greedy squirrels). Collect fallen leaf for leaf mould, and stack it where you can. Dig heavier soil on drier days so the coming frost will continue to break it up. Add in well-rotted organic matter (or convert to no-dig where you can spread it around). Leave digging any lighter soil for spring. Hoe perennial weeds and plant green manure: it\u2019s a good time now. It\u2019s the month for planting bare-root fruit trees and soft-fruit bushes. Time, too, to prune fruiting trees, raspberry canes and currants while they are dormant. Weed around the base and add mulch where you can. Remove small figs if you are lucky enough to have space for them (they can throw a lot of shade). Sharpen secateurs and spades. Clean and oil your other tools. It is a good time for good housekeeping. Tidy the shed if you have one. Harvest root crops, such as celeriac and late summer radishes, though you can leave parsnips and winter carrots until after the frost. It\u2019s your last chance to sow overwintering garlic before the ground is too wet or hard. The same with early broad beans such as \u2018Aquadulce Claudia\u2019, or \u2018Super Aquadulce\u2019. Don\u2019t much worry if you miss it this month: other \u2018late\u2019 varieties can be sown in spring. Relax and breathe, there is less to do.

All dishes \u00a34.50-\u00a39; wine \u00a312.95</strong></p> <p>Night has come to Glasgow and with it an insistent, drenching rain of a sort often gifted by the Atlantic to Scotland\u2019s west coast when autumn comes. The outer panels of the Hydro arena down by the Clyde are glowing in candy shades of pink and sky blue, as if it\u2019s ready to return to the planet that dispatched it, and on Queen Street the gutters are overflowing. Most restaurateurs would despair at weather like this. Presumably the owners of <a href=\"http://www.mikaku.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mikaku</a>, a self-styled izakaya, or Japanese-inspired inn, are not among them. It all just adds to the vibe.</p> <p>One of those owners described it to the website Glasgow Live when they opened last spring as a \u201cneo-Tokyo dystopian style\u201d and we\u2019ll have to take their word for it. It\u2019s gilded in neon. The floor is a faux cobbled lane, complete with manholes. It\u2019s edged with communal tables under lean-to roofs and food outlets with their own counters, as if it\u2019s a street food alley. Corrugated iron sheeting has been pressed into service.</p> <p>There are two ways to go here. You can engage in a bout of championship eye-rolling, while muttering about theme-park dining and trying too hard, that might make you feel superior; or you can acknowledge that most restaurant design is a version of this: an attempt to create a space that separates you from the world outside. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve eaten my way around the tightly knotted streets of inns and caf\u00e9s in Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku district and Mikaku would fit in there. The Japanese adore a bit of overblown, comic-book kitsch. They\u2019d get it. So why shouldn\u2019t we?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e154a832bd0016fbb8cf4d009146a49fef324625\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e154a832bd0016fbb8cf4d009146a49fef324625/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A ludicrously compelling combination of crispy and salty, with crumbly bits that cannot escape\u2019: chicken karrage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A ludicrously compelling combination of crispy and salty, with crumbly bits that cannot escape\u2019: chicken karrage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Likewise, I think they\u2019d get the food. While there are izakayas that have raised the cooking far beyond what was originally expected of them, at base they are meant to provide something to soak up the booze: the endless chilled glasses of Asahi and Sapporo, the cocktails with names like Electric Lychee and Ginger Zen. Or in our case the serviceable sauvignon blanc at \u00a312.95 a bottle. That wasn\u2019t me being a cheap. They only have one choice of red, white or ros\u00e9. All of them are \u00a312.95. We drag warm, salt-sprinkled edamame pods through our teeth to get at the beans inside, and try to focus on the graphic violence of the place-mat menu.</p> <p>I could now niggle about certain details and I will, because it\u2019s part of my job description. I have to raise an eyebrow over the thickness of the noodles in their ramen and wonder whether they are the exact alkaline variety they should be. I must point out that the tonkotsu stock, which should have the lip-smack of gelatine from pork bits simmered for half a day until the bones have given their all, is a little on the insubstantial side. But the impact of the cooking here is cumulative and is so much more than the sum of those parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2940c04e4d0366421a27996b2e8e80e8607b64da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2940c04e4d0366421a27996b2e8e80e8607b64da/0_233_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Smoky and seared in all the right places\u2019: beef, pork and chicken skewers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Smoky and seared in all the right places\u2019: beef, pork and chicken skewers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The site was previously a ramen shop, run by the same people, before they extended the menu and became this. Pleasingly, they offer half portions at \u00a34.50; Lilliputian miniatures in small bowls that allow you to go face down in them without filling up to the exclusion of the rest of the offering. The slices of chashu belly pork in the tonkotsu ramen are soft and sweet and salty, with just the right balance of fat to meat. In a miso black ramen, with burnt garlic oil and more slices of garlic cooked until crisp, there are pearly pieces of chicken breast. The rest of it \u2013 the sliced spring onions, the leaves of nori, the sprinkle of sesame seeds \u2013 is all very much here.</p> <p>We have a large portion of their chicken karaage for \u00a36.50 because, like any sane, properly brought up, interesting person, I am powerless in the face of thigh first dumped in a soy-based marinade then given a dusting of seasoned cornflour and finally deep fried. It is that ludicrously compelling combination of crispy and salty; of soft, tenderised meat steamed in its shell, and crumbly bits that mustn\u2019t be allowed to escape. There\u2019s a dollop of sweetened chilli sauce on the side and some mayo. It\u2019s a subtle, understated dish in the way that Rylan Clark-Neal\u2019s teeth are subtle. But the rain is still coming down, and the wine is still flowing, which means this fried chicken is necessary.</p> <p>There is an attempt at self-care courtesy of a well-made wakame salad of slippery ribbons of seaweed, with just the right bite, in a soy and sesame dressing. Then it\u2019s on to the chicken wings, presented unjointed, with the awkward geometry of pointed tip to drummer. They are tricky and messy to eat like this, but the staff are watching. They chuck wet wipes on to the table as if they are life preservers thrown to the drowning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6ed6daa1c38518fcf60e3cac8a21912088df83e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ed6daa1c38518fcf60e3cac8a21912088df83e/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Worth the mess\u2019: sweet soy and sesame chicken wings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Worth the mess\u2019: sweet soy and sesame chicken wings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sweet soy and sesame versions with their crisp shell are worth the mess and very much worth the price at \u00a32.90 for two. I also order a pair of the hot variety in \u201cOni Demon\u201d sauce. The cheery Glaswegian waitress looks at me kindly and says, \u201cAre you sure, hen?\u201d I wave her away with the casualness of a man who has seen many things and will see many more. It turns out I haven\u2019t seen this. They are red and they are angry and they make my diaphragm go into spasm and sweat pool under my eyes. Coming to Mikaku has been a good idea. Ordering these has not been a good idea. I manage one. She takes away the other, with the nod of a woman who knew it would come to this.</p> <p>Grilled skewers of pork, beef and chicken with spring onion, at around \u00a32 each, are smoky and seared in all the right places. We\u2019ve avoided the gyoza, because they\u2019d told me they bought them in rather than made them here. However, the dessert menu includes fried apple gyoza with butterscotch sauce, and they cannot be resisted: they\u2019re a tiny version of an apple Pop-Tart. I mean that in a good way. They\u2019re certainly better than the weird peanut-butter ice cream. No matter. There\u2019s enough left in the bottle to deaden the taste. We pay the modest bill, bow our heads in thanks to Mikaku for showing us a good time, and head out through the ostentatious weather to nearby Hope Street, and a blues jam at the club Swing. After all the damn piano isn\u2019t going to play itself.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/30/koj-cheltenham-jay-rayner-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Koj</a>, the cheery Cheltenham restaurant from <em>MasterChef</em> finalist Andrew Kojima, does not claim to be an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/27/going-crazy-for-izakayas-yakatori-japanese-food-megan-carnegie-brown\" title=\"\">izakaya</a>, but it does boast a \u201cbeer food menu\u201d, which pretty much makes it one. There\u2019s a list of buns, filled with the likes of pork belly, apple and kimchi or panko cauliflower with curry mayo, as well as udon noodles, donburi rice bowls, various ramen and the obligatory fried chicken (<a href=\"https://kojcheltenham.co.uk/\" title=\"\">kojcheltenham.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>There was scepticism when McDonald\u2019s announced it would be available for delivery through the likes of <a href=\"https://www.ubereats.com/en-GB/\" title=\"\">Uber Eats</a>. Who would bother to get something as cheap as McDonald\u2019s delivered? A lot of people, it seems. Delivery is now available at 950 of its sites and, according to the company, accounts for more than 10% of all their business in the UK. On 18 September McDonald\u2019s says it received a record 124,000 delivery orders.</p> <p>Major churn in the London restaurant world.

The outer panels of the Hydro arena down by the Clyde are glowing in candy shades of pink and sky blue, as if it\u2019s ready to return to the planet that dispatched it, and on Queen Street the gutters are overflowing. Most restaurateurs would despair at weather like this. Presumably the owners of Mikaku, a self-styled izakaya, or Japanese-inspired inn, are not among them. It all just adds to the vibe. One of those owners described it to the website Glasgow Live when they opened last spring as a \u201cneo-Tokyo dystopian style\u201d and we\u2019ll have to take their word for it. It\u2019s gilded in neon. The floor is a faux cobbled lane, complete with manholes. It\u2019s edged with communal tables under lean-to roofs and food outlets with their own counters, as if it\u2019s a street food alley. Corrugated iron sheeting has been pressed into service. There are two ways to go here. You can engage in a bout of championship eye-rolling, while muttering about theme-park dining and trying too hard, that might make you feel superior; or you can acknowledge that most restaurant design is a version of this: an attempt to create a space that separates you from the world outside. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve eaten my way around the tightly knotted streets of inns and caf\u00e9s in Tokyo\u2019s Shinjuku district and Mikaku would fit in there. The Japanese adore a bit of overblown, comic-book kitsch. They\u2019d get it. So why shouldn\u2019t we? Likewise, I think they\u2019d get the food. While there are izakayas that have raised the cooking far beyond what was originally expected of them, at base they are meant to provide something to soak up the booze: the endless chilled glasses of Asahi and Sapporo, the cocktails with names like Electric Lychee and Ginger Zen. Or in our case the serviceable sauvignon blanc at \u00a312.95 a bottle. That wasn\u2019t me being a cheap. They only have one choice of red, white or ros\u00e9. All of them are \u00a312.95. We drag warm, salt-sprinkled edamame pods through our teeth to get at the beans inside, and try to focus on the graphic violence of the place-mat menu. I could now niggle about certain details and I will, because it\u2019s part of my job description. I have to raise an eyebrow over the thickness of the noodles in their ramen and wonder whether they are the exact alkaline variety they should be. I must point out that the tonkotsu stock, which should have the lip-smack of gelatine from pork bits simmered for half a day until the bones have given their all, is a little on the insubstantial side. But the impact of the cooking here is cumulative and is so much more than the sum of those parts. The site was previously a ramen shop, run by the same people, before they extended the menu and became this. Pleasingly, they offer half portions at \u00a34.50; Lilliputian miniatures in small bowls that allow you to go face down in them without filling up to the exclusion of the rest of the offering. The slices of chashu belly pork in the tonkotsu ramen are soft and sweet and salty, with just the right balance of fat to meat. In a miso black ramen, with burnt garlic oil and more slices of garlic cooked until crisp, there are pearly pieces of chicken breast. The rest of it \u2013 the sliced spring onions, the leaves of nori, the sprinkle of sesame seeds \u2013 is all very much here. We have a large portion of their chicken karaage for \u00a36.50 because, like any sane, properly brought up, interesting person, I am powerless in the face of thigh first dumped in a soy-based marinade then given a dusting of seasoned cornflour and finally deep fried. It is that ludicrously compelling combination of crispy and salty; of soft, tenderised meat steamed in its shell, and crumbly bits that mustn\u2019t be allowed to escape. There\u2019s a dollop of sweetened chilli sauce on the side and some mayo. It\u2019s a subtle, understated dish in the way that Rylan Clark-Neal\u2019s teeth are subtle. But the rain is still coming down, and the wine is still flowing, which means this fried chicken is necessary. There is an attempt at self-care courtesy of a well-made wakame salad of slippery ribbons of seaweed, with just the right bite, in a soy and sesame dressing. Then it\u2019s on to the chicken wings, presented unjointed, with the awkward geometry of pointed tip to drummer. They are tricky and messy to eat like this, but the staff are watching. They chuck wet wipes on to the table as if they are life preservers thrown to the drowning. The sweet soy and sesame versions with their crisp shell are worth the mess and very much worth the price at \u00a32.90 for two. I also order a pair of the hot variety in \u201cOni Demon\u201d sauce. The cheery Glaswegian waitress looks at me kindly and says, \u201cAre you sure, hen?\u201d I wave her away with the casualness of a man who has seen many things and will see many more. It turns out I haven\u2019t seen this. They are red and they are angry and they make my diaphragm go into spasm and sweat pool under my eyes. Coming to Mikaku has been a good idea. Ordering these has not been a good idea. I manage one. She takes away the other, with the nod of a woman who knew it would come to this. Grilled skewers of pork, beef and chicken with spring onion, at around \u00a32 each, are smoky and seared in all the right places. We\u2019ve avoided the gyoza, because they\u2019d told me they bought them in rather than made them here. However, the dessert menu includes fried apple gyoza with butterscotch sauce, and they cannot be resisted: they\u2019re a tiny version of an apple Pop-Tart. I mean that in a good way. They\u2019re certainly better than the weird peanut-butter ice cream. No matter. There\u2019s enough left in the bottle to deaden the taste. We pay the modest bill, bow our heads in thanks to Mikaku for showing us a good time, and head out through the ostentatious weather to nearby Hope Street, and a blues jam at the club Swing. After all the damn piano isn\u2019t going to play itself. Jay\u2019s news bites Koj, the cheery Cheltenham restaurant from MasterChef finalist Andrew Kojima, does not claim to be an izakaya, but it does boast a \u201cbeer food menu\u201d, which pretty much makes it one. There\u2019s a list of buns, filled with the likes of pork belly, apple and kimchi or panko cauliflower with curry mayo, as well as udon noodles, donburi rice bowls, various ramen and the obligatory fried chicken (kojcheltenham.co.uk). There was scepticism when McDonald\u2019s announced it would be available for delivery through the likes of Uber Eats. Who would bother to get something as cheap as McDonald\u2019s delivered? A lot of people, it seems. Delivery is now available at 950 of its sites and, according to the company, accounts for more than 10% of all their business in the UK. On 18 September McDonald\u2019s says it received a record 124,000 delivery orders. Major churn in the London restaurant world. Martin Morales\u2019s Peruvian restaurant group Ceviche is to appoint administrators after a period of \u201cincredibly tough\u201d trading. High-end Chinese restaurant Duddells has closed at London Bridge, siting planning issues. Breddos Tacos has closed its central London outpost and chef Mark Hix is in talks to close his Soho restaurant. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1",

Build new almshouses</a>\u201d, News). A \u201cnew almshouse movement\u201d is welcome, but one essential element of this approach must be a transformation of its culture. The heritage of centuries has been deeply paternalistic, with older people viewed as \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of the decisions taken on their behalf by the good and worthy who populate almshouse boards.</p> <p>\u201cCo-production partnership\u201d is a notion taking hold very slowly, whereby the end-users of new schemes have a real voice and are involved in the development from the outset, and power is not concentrated on high but shared. The residents of a new almshouse will be those who were young in the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 they are used to having a say. The example given of the Older Women\u2019s Cohousing project in High Barnet offers a compelling contrast, run entirely by themselves without external patronage. A new almshouse movement would be a wonderful thing, but it needs to borrow concepts such as individual and group autonomy, collective decision-making and co-production from the community-led housing movement if it is to be truly modern.<br><strong>Maria Brenton</strong>, UK Cohousing<br>London SW6<br></p> <h2>Food for thought, Rees-Mogg<br></h2> <p>Two years ago, that lovely Christian man Jacob Rees-Mogg described the massive increase in the number of food banks as \u201cuplifting\u201d and a sign of a compassionate society.

Golden rice represents a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d solution to a complex problem, much like the introduction of cane toads to Australia to control beetle pests. The UN\u2019s sustainable development goals teach us that we need a more systematic approach to tackling problems such as child malnutrition.</p> <p>Children are deficient in vitamin A in many countries because they don\u2019t have access to vegetables. That means they\u2019ll be deficient in many other nutrients, which golden rice will not tackle, a lack that will continue to do significant damage to their health. Plus, consider economic and social factors: if golden rice is promoted as healthy and essential for children, it will be more expensive than \u201cordinary\u201d rice. The children who most need it are unlikely to get it. Studies last year showed that paddy rice cultivation can emit twice as many greenhouse gases as previously thought, providing further impetus to moving in the direction demanded by the World Health Organization, towards producing twice the amount of fruit and vegetables we currently do to ensure a minimally healthy diet for every human being.</p> <p>A \u201cbusiness as usual with a bit of added technology\u201d alleged solution to our problems is unlikely to meet the social, economic and environmental crises we face.<br><strong>Natalie Bennett</strong>, Green party peer and former leader<br>Sheffield<br></p> <p>Robin McKie\u2019s article was a stark factual reminder of the potential societal benefits of GM technologies.

The time has come to evaluate technologies objectively for their safety, and ask ethical questions about their deployment.

Boris Johnson did not have to rush over to Brussels to ask what he should put in the Queen\u2019s speech. Mr Rainey seems to believe that the lack of attention to deprived northern areas was because of the EU parliament, when we all know of the harm done in the 1980s by the Thatcher government and austerity policies after the financial crash.

Far-right groups are tolerated by politicians and the national police, as witnessed by the scenes at Franco\u2019s exhumation and, more violently, on the streets of Barcelona in counter-demonstrations. Francoism remains alive in the judiciary and police. This has again been demonstrated by the harsh and provocative crackdown on Catalan leaders and the reaction to the resulting protests.

      "bodyText": "Housing that is well designed for ageing is of paramount importance in a society where numbers over the age of 85 are set to double in the next 25 years (\u201cThe solution for an ageing UK? Build new almshouses\u201d, News). A \u201cnew almshouse movement\u201d is welcome, but one essential element of this approach must be a transformation of its culture. The heritage of centuries has been deeply paternalistic, with older people viewed as \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of the decisions taken on their behalf by the good and worthy who populate almshouse boards. \u201cCo-production partnership\u201d is a notion taking hold very slowly, whereby the end-users of new schemes have a real voice and are involved in the development from the outset, and power is not concentrated on high but shared. The residents of a new almshouse will be those who were young in the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 they are used to having a say. The example given of the Older Women\u2019s Cohousing project in High Barnet offers a compelling contrast, run entirely by themselves without external patronage. A new almshouse movement would be a wonderful thing, but it needs to borrow concepts such as individual and group autonomy, collective decision-making and co-production from the community-led housing movement if it is to be truly modern. Maria Brenton, UK Cohousing London SW6 Food for thought, Rees-Mogg Two years ago, that lovely Christian man Jacob Rees-Mogg described the massive increase in the number of food banks as \u201cuplifting\u201d and a sign of a compassionate society. I wonder if he has a similar sense of uplift on hearing evidence given by desperate mothers to the inquiry into universal credit that they were selling sex to buy food for their children (\u201cA welfare system that drives mothers into prostitution is no safety net\u201d, Comment). Sarah James Monmouth GM rice is not so golden Your article on GM rice was one-sided and simplistic (\u201cBlock on GM rice \u2018has cost millions of lives and led to child blindness\u2019\u201d, News). Golden rice represents a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d solution to a complex problem, much like the introduction of cane toads to Australia to control beetle pests. The UN\u2019s sustainable development goals teach us that we need a more systematic approach to tackling problems such as child malnutrition. Children are deficient in vitamin A in many countries because they don\u2019t have access to vegetables. That means they\u2019ll be deficient in many other nutrients, which golden rice will not tackle, a lack that will continue to do significant damage to their health. Plus, consider economic and social factors: if golden rice is promoted as healthy and essential for children, it will be more expensive than \u201cordinary\u201d rice. The children who most need it are unlikely to get it. Studies last year showed that paddy rice cultivation can emit twice as many greenhouse gases as previously thought, providing further impetus to moving in the direction demanded by the World Health Organization, towards producing twice the amount of fruit and vegetables we currently do to ensure a minimally healthy diet for every human being. A \u201cbusiness as usual with a bit of added technology\u201d alleged solution to our problems is unlikely to meet the social, economic and environmental crises we face. Natalie Bennett, Green party peer and former leader Sheffield Robin McKie\u2019s article was a stark factual reminder of the potential societal benefits of GM technologies. However, it is probably appropriate to stop the blame game that has focused on GM. This argument has blighted potentially constructive discussion between \u201cagricultural\u201d and \u201cenvironmental\u201d interests that should be moving forward together to develop environmentally compatible agriculture capable of producing healthy food for all. Many of us involved in advancing the food security agenda believe passionately that our work has to proceed hand in hand with safe technology and that progress has also to stand the test of environmental sustainability. The time has come to evaluate technologies objectively for their safety, and ask ethical questions about their deployment. This approach will require a coming together of all interest groups around what must be common themes about which there can be little debate: a climate emergency and the urgent need to figure out a way to feed two billion more people healthily by 2050. Dale Sanders, director John Innes Centre Norwich It\u2019s a freelancer\u2019s life It\u2019s not just actors who at times need other employment (\u201cWas it necessary to shop Katie Jarvis for working in a shop?\u201d, Comment). Some years ago, as a freelance writer, I sought another job and became a television subtitler. Hearing about my new job (whose aim is to enable deaf people to enjoy their chosen TV programmes), a small but significant number of literary colleagues expressed pity and obvious embarrassment at what they clearly saw as loss of caste. At one university where I was invited (still wearing my writer\u2019s hat) to speak on a literary topic, I was discreetly urged by my hosts not to mention my current employment lest it lower my status in the eyes of my audience. \u201cGig economy\u201d is a new term for what has always been financial reality for freelance actors, writers, artists and musicians. Katie Jarvis\u2019s situation is just one example of the multitasking needed to maintain a creative career. I wish her good luck \u2013 and lots of gigs. Zoe Fairbairns London SE19 EU is our partner, not ruler It seems that Dan Rainey is confused as to how the EU works (\u201cWhy I voted Leave\u201d, Letters). The EU has nothing to do with how we run our NHS, police, education, local authorities, housing, social services or taxes. The EU does not \u201crule\u201d us \u2013 we are equal partners. Boris Johnson did not have to rush over to Brussels to ask what he should put in the Queen\u2019s speech. Mr Rainey seems to believe that the lack of attention to deprived northern areas was because of the EU parliament, when we all know of the harm done in the 1980s by the Thatcher government and austerity policies after the financial crash. One of the EU\u2019s main policies has been, and still is, to get funds to the deprived areas of Europe, including in the UK. Janet Davies Hartley Wintney, Hampshire No Spanish practices please You state that Britain \u201cbadly needs a dose of Spanish-style candour about its history\u201d (\u201cSpain confronts its past. Other countries should follow its lead\u201d, Editorial). This is an overly kind interpretation of Spain\u2019s past and current approach to fascism and dissent. Far-right groups are tolerated by politicians and the national police, as witnessed by the scenes at Franco\u2019s exhumation and, more violently, on the streets of Barcelona in counter-demonstrations. Francoism remains alive in the judiciary and police. This has again been demonstrated by the harsh and provocative crackdown on Catalan leaders and the reaction to the resulting protests. The disinterment of Franco is long overdue. However, the removal of the dictator\u2019s influence is a more pressing matter for today\u2019s Spain. Andrew Poyner Stamford, Lincs An age-old problem Torsten Bell\u2019s analysis of voting patterns is just one example of how Britain is divided by age (\u201cAge, not class, has come to define how Britain votes\u201d, Comment). Ours is one of the most age-segregated countries and this has led to a host of social and economic problems, from loneliness and ageism to housing, health, care and education. The next government must bring Britain together. More mixing between the generations will build stronger communities and a stronger country.

Nine self-declared larger, or plus-size, or fat, or living-with-obesity (there was even a political nature to the terms they chose to use, and it\u2019s normally a sorry sign when clear communication hog-ties its own feet through supersensitivity to lexicon) souls disappeared for a fortnight to a rather lovely country house to bond, to argue, to cry, to worry. It could have been done irritatingly, even exploitatively; yet, for all that this did remain, essentially, reality TV, there was thought and genuine sensitivity behind both programmes.</p> <p>But reality TV is chiefly entertainment, and right from the off Victoria was happy to cast herself as the villain of the piece. Victoria life-coaches people of weight to not just accept but glory in their adipose tissue. Her T-shirt reads \u201cRiot Not Diet\u201d. Yet such is her antipathy to any sense of societal fat-shaming that she refuses to countenance children even being warned that their weight might lead to future problems (\u201cLet them be <em>children</em>, for God\u2019s sake\u201d) and says things such as: \u201cThis is not about health. This is about perpetuating fatphobic ideas\u201d; and: \u201cHealth \u2013 you can\u2019t define it. It\u2019s a social construct. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Thus the camp was split from about evening one: dear comedian Jed, worried about type 2 diabetes, and health-jag Jack, and Del, who had paid \u00a310,000 for a gastric sleeve, and sweet, honest civil servant Babs (\u201cI\u2019m <em>not</em> confident. I <em>hate</em> being this size\u201d) worried honestly about whether they were wrong to want to be smaller, healthier, more mobile. While Victoria took her little cabal off to the pub and whispered, drunk on potential power: \u201cI <em>really</em> want Jed not to start dieting.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t, in the end, despise Victoria. Far from it: her zest for life shone through. She even persuaded shy body-hating Babs to strip to her bikini in an Oxford pedestrian precinct; and for a little while there was a smile on Babs\u2019s face, happy tears in her eyes. By the end of the experiment, DNA results had been given \u2013 in almost all cases, there <em>was</em> genetic predisposition, and I\u2019ll try to think differently from now on, rather than writing some people off as lazycakes. In the end, I felt more sorry for Victoria than any of the rest of this generally lovely, troubled, kind little (big) bunch. Nothing too wrong with zest and a generally positive outlook, but when your \u201cpositivity\u201d becomes positively delusional \u2026 and I can\u2019t have been the only one who shuddered, given the statistics, at the statement: \u201cWhen I\u2019m making enough money off my businesses, what I ultimately want to do is to go round schools, for free, teaching body confidence and body positivity.\u201d</p> <p>I suspect one young Oxford commuter had it about right. \u201cI know what the <em>right</em> thing to say is,\u201d she answered, strangely thoughtful, wise. \u201cThe politically correct answer: that\u2019s fine, lovely, go for it \u2026 sisters! But I don\u2019t actually think that in my heart. Sorry.\u201d While in no way wishing to join those who blame all their gnarls and ills on \u2018\u201cpolitical correctness\u2019\u201d, I can\u2019t help feeling, as a vague fan of the power of words, that this has been one mild error along an admittedly long and difficult way. Just asking people to say different words doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll think different thoughts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5489902fc0a26c271a80ec9a8efc0ed39b0e9bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5489902fc0a26c271a80ec9a8efc0ed39b0e9bc/0_345_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kieran Hodgson in How Europe Stole My Mum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kieran Hodgson in How Europe Stole My Mum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A glorious slice of semi-serious fun arrived on meant-to-be-Brexit night in the shape of Kieran Hodgson\u2019s \u201ccomedy documentary\u201d <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/how-europe-stole-my-mum\" title=\"\"><strong>How Europe Stole My Mum</strong></a>.

      "bodyText": "Who Are You Calling Fat? (BBC Two) | iPlayer How Europe Stole My Mum (Channel 4) | All 4 Guilt (BBC Two) | iPlayer Seven Worlds, One Planet (BBC One) | iPlayer The Morning Show (Apple TV +) | Apple.com One of the hardest watches of the week, but ultimately redemptive, uplifting even, was the BBC\u2019s two-night special Who Are You Calling Fat?. Nine self-declared larger, or plus-size, or fat, or living-with-obesity (there was even a political nature to the terms they chose to use, and it\u2019s normally a sorry sign when clear communication hog-ties its own feet through supersensitivity to lexicon) souls disappeared for a fortnight to a rather lovely country house to bond, to argue, to cry, to worry. It could have been done irritatingly, even exploitatively; yet, for all that this did remain, essentially, reality TV, there was thought and genuine sensitivity behind both programmes. But reality TV is chiefly entertainment, and right from the off Victoria was happy to cast herself as the villain of the piece. Victoria life-coaches people of weight to not just accept but glory in their adipose tissue. Her T-shirt reads \u201cRiot Not Diet\u201d. Yet such is her antipathy to any sense of societal fat-shaming that she refuses to countenance children even being warned that their weight might lead to future problems (\u201cLet them be children, for God\u2019s sake\u201d) and says things such as: \u201cThis is not about health. This is about perpetuating fatphobic ideas\u201d; and: \u201cHealth \u2013 you can\u2019t define it. It\u2019s a social construct. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Thus the camp was split from about evening one: dear comedian Jed, worried about type 2 diabetes, and health-jag Jack, and Del, who had paid \u00a310,000 for a gastric sleeve, and sweet, honest civil servant Babs (\u201cI\u2019m not confident. I hate being this size\u201d) worried honestly about whether they were wrong to want to be smaller, healthier, more mobile. While Victoria took her little cabal off to the pub and whispered, drunk on potential power: \u201cI really want Jed not to start dieting.\u201d I didn\u2019t, in the end, despise Victoria. Far from it: her zest for life shone through. She even persuaded shy body-hating Babs to strip to her bikini in an Oxford pedestrian precinct; and for a little while there was a smile on Babs\u2019s face, happy tears in her eyes. By the end of the experiment, DNA results had been given \u2013 in almost all cases, there was genetic predisposition, and I\u2019ll try to think differently from now on, rather than writing some people off as lazycakes. In the end, I felt more sorry for Victoria than any of the rest of this generally lovely, troubled, kind little (big) bunch. Nothing too wrong with zest and a generally positive outlook, but when your \u201cpositivity\u201d becomes positively delusional \u2026 and I can\u2019t have been the only one who shuddered, given the statistics, at the statement: \u201cWhen I\u2019m making enough money off my businesses, what I ultimately want to do is to go round schools, for free, teaching body confidence and body positivity.\u201d I suspect one young Oxford commuter had it about right. \u201cI know what the right thing to say is,\u201d she answered, strangely thoughtful, wise. \u201cThe politically correct answer: that\u2019s fine, lovely, go for it \u2026 sisters! But I don\u2019t actually think that in my heart. Sorry.\u201d While in no way wishing to join those who blame all their gnarls and ills on \u2018\u201cpolitical correctness\u2019\u201d, I can\u2019t help feeling, as a vague fan of the power of words, that this has been one mild error along an admittedly long and difficult way. Just asking people to say different words doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll think different thoughts. A glorious slice of semi-serious fun arrived on meant-to-be-Brexit night in the shape of Kieran Hodgson\u2019s \u201ccomedy documentary\u201d How Europe Stole My Mum. The premise was nice. The day after that referendum, the comedian visits his \u201cmum\u201d, Liza Tarbuck, who makes an admission: and the ensuing dialogue just about wraps up life over the last three-and-a-half years. \u201cI actually voted to leave. Still, I shouldn\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll change anything in our relationship, will it?\u201d (beat) \u201cYou \u2026 you piece of shit, Mum. You racist Chardonnay-sozzled old witch. Don\u2019t you realise you\u2019ve completely ruined my entire future, you immediately-post-menopausal provincially accented moron?\u201d \u201cWell, I should have expected nothing else from a nasty, snobbish, stuck-up, traitorous, IPA-guzzling disappointment of a son like you. Why don\u2019t you piss off back to \u2026 London? Hodgson had the genius idea of analysing how we joined the EEC (\u201cBrentry\u201d) \u2013 Heath, Wilson, Benn, Jenkins, Labour\u2019s earlier civil war, De Gaulle \u2013 to try to find some parallels, even answers. He actually got further, with the inspired help of Tarbuck, Harry Enfield and some dusty footage, than an entire slew of Newsnights. An inspired chunk of educative cleverness.

So Imogen Hermes Gowar, who chose a chastity belt, wondered if the belt was not only about men trying to control women, but about women wanting to keep themselves safe. Interestingly, she was told that chastity belts were rarely used until the Renaissance, and even then, often only as satire. So the widely held belief that in the Crusades, knights would lock their wives in chastity belts before going off to war was, flatly, wrong. Instead, the knights left their wives in charge of their estates, fighting off intruders.

Likewise, Don Jr keeps mum over Richard Nixon\u2019s justice department <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FH-NY-0024-0034.pdf\">having sued</a> his grandfather, father and their business for housing discrimination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Don Jr has taken a page from the playbook of Yair Netanyahu, troller-in-chief of his father's adversaries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As is to be expected, Triggered\u2019s displeasure with social media is exaggerated and omits a key fact: the apparent Cambridge Analytica\u2013Facebook\u2013Trump campaign axis.</p> <p>Cambridge Analytica <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768216311/whistleblower-explains-how-cambridge-analytica-helped-fuel-u-s-insurgency\">purportedly</a> took direction from Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign\u2019s major-domo, while it received a multimillion-dollar infusion from the Mercer family, the campaign\u2019s major benefactors and the owners of Breitbart. In turn, Facebook\u2019s personal data was plundered and used to help enrage the US electorate.</p> <p>True to form, only <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/875456/trumps-campaign-upset-twitter-banned-political-ads-oddly-russian-state-media\">the Trump campaign and Russia</a> have objected to Twitter\u2019s announcement that it will bar all campaign ads.</p> <p>Flogging his book, Trump Jr pulls no punches. On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1189291154149380096\">Twitter</a>, he announced: \u201cGo check out <a href=\"http://triggeralib.com/\">TriggerALib.com</a> to easily send your favorite leftist commie a copy of my new book #Triggered. Maybe they\u2019ll learn something. Also, What\u2019s better than capitalism and trolling combined??? Answer: NOTHING!\u201d</p> <p>It appears Don Jr has taken a page from the <a href=\"https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5552665,00.html\">playbook of Yair Netanyahu</a>, the son of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s beleaguered prime minister and Trump Sr\u2019s one-time political soulmate. For years, the younger Netanyahu has served as the keeper of his father\u2019s ideological flame and troller-in-chief of his adversaries.</p> <p>Unlike Yair, Don Jr\u2019s proximity to his father represents an evolution of sorts, one that Triggered only hints at. Don Jr acknowledges that he was shipped off to the <a href=\"http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=93091\">Hill School</a> amid his parents\u2019 acrimonious and tabloid-headlining divorce. He also touches on his discomfort with his father\u2019s lifestyle.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat made me feel uncomfortable around the people who populated the rich circles my father lived and worked in. Even when my father would bring home a celebrity \u2026 I would run in the other direction.\u201d</p> <p>Left unsaid is that as a 12-year-old, Don Jr <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-jr-bio-controversies-2017-7#trump-was-whisked-off-to-boarding-school-with-his-brother-eric-after-his-parents-divorce-he-went-to-the-hill-school-in-pottstown-pennsylvania-for-high-school-2\">did not talk to his father</a> for a year while his father\u2019s marriage to Ivana, his mother, crumbled before the cameras.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Don Jr goes full bore at the Clintons and the Bidens, labelling the former family \u201cone of the most corrupt and uncivil political machines in the history of our nation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "In Triggered, the president\u2019s eldest child excoriates the left for its censoriousness, but ignores his father\u2019s repeated demands for the same. In case Don Jr forgot, Trump p\u00e8re is no friend of free speech or a free press. The elder Trump has called for tougher libel laws, unsuccessfully sought to strip CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta of his White House press pass, threatened Michael Wolff with an injunction after the Guardian published excerpts from Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury, and turned the daily press briefing into a memory. Trump\u2019s dad also treated the murder of Jamal Khashoggi as a non-event and made bargaining chips of the Hong Kong protesters. Barack Obama and Don Jr get it right when they ding the left\u2019s social justice warriors for their paroxysms of wokeness. But the president\u2019s son has little to say about the sentinels of the right, starting with his father. A president who finds equivalence among Charlottesville\u2019s demonstrators, sacralizes Robert E Lee and appoints judges who declined to affirm the validity of Brown v Board of Education, the supreme court decision that barred de jure segregation, is a prisoner to the prejudices of his base. Not surprisingly, Triggered hammers away at past Democratic support for slavery but is silent over the vitality of neo-Confederacy within the modern-day GOP. It elides David Duke\u2019s endorsement of Trump and the latter\u2019s tacit acceptance of the ex-grand wizard\u2019s seal of approval. Likewise, Don Jr keeps mum over Richard Nixon\u2019s justice department having sued his grandfather, father and their business for housing discrimination. As is to be expected, Triggered\u2019s displeasure with social media is exaggerated and omits a key fact: the apparent Cambridge Analytica\u2013Facebook\u2013Trump campaign axis. Cambridge Analytica purportedly took direction from Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign\u2019s major-domo, while it received a multimillion-dollar infusion from the Mercer family, the campaign\u2019s major benefactors and the owners of Breitbart. In turn, Facebook\u2019s personal data was plundered and used to help enrage the US electorate. True to form, only the Trump campaign and Russia have objected to Twitter\u2019s announcement that it will bar all campaign ads. Flogging his book, Trump Jr pulls no punches. On Twitter, he announced: \u201cGo check out TriggerALib.com to easily send your favorite leftist commie a copy of my new book #Triggered. Maybe they\u2019ll learn something. Also, What\u2019s better than capitalism and trolling combined??? Answer: NOTHING!\u201d It appears Don Jr has taken a page from the playbook of Yair Netanyahu, the son of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s beleaguered prime minister and Trump Sr\u2019s one-time political soulmate. For years, the younger Netanyahu has served as the keeper of his father\u2019s ideological flame and troller-in-chief of his adversaries. Unlike Yair, Don Jr\u2019s proximity to his father represents an evolution of sorts, one that Triggered only hints at. Don Jr acknowledges that he was shipped off to the Hill School amid his parents\u2019 acrimonious and tabloid-headlining divorce. He also touches on his discomfort with his father\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cThere was something,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat made me feel uncomfortable around the people who populated the rich circles my father lived and worked in. Even when my father would bring home a celebrity \u2026 I would run in the other direction.\u201d Left unsaid is that as a 12-year-old, Don Jr did not talk to his father for a year while his father\u2019s marriage to Ivana, his mother, crumbled before the cameras. Unsurprisingly, Don Jr goes full bore at the Clintons and the Bidens, labelling the former family \u201cone of the most corrupt and uncivil political machines in the history of our nation\u201d. Unfortunately, the Trumps appear to have an edge over the Clintons when it comes to grifting: at least the Clinton Foundation was real. The Trump Foundation and Trump University? Not so much. Indeed, as the president framed things the other day as he backtracked over holding the G7 confab at the Doral: \u201cYou people with this phony Emoluments Clause.\u201d Said differently, Bill Clinton was impeached because of his zipper. The incumbent president is in hot water for making the US government a Kleenex for his raging grudges and ambitions. As for the Bidens, Don Jr had this to say on Fox News: \u201cI wish my name was Hunter Biden. I could go abroad, make millions off of my father\u2019s presidency \u2013 I\u2019d be a really rich guy! It would be incredible!\u201d Where to start? Moscow? Still, Triggered\u2019s critique of the left\u2019s use of shaming as a cudgel should not be ignored. The fact is, members of the Democratic establishment continue to worship at the twin altars of identity politics and political correctness. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, Richard Stengel, an undersecretary in Hillary Clinton\u2019s state department, argued that the constitution should not protect hate speech, which should be banned \u201cbecause the intellectual underpinning of the first amendment was engineered for a simpler era\u201d. Stengel was once Time\u2019s managing editor. Nothing like a bureaucrat who wants to play speech tsar, especially one who had previously worked at a magazine. Ultimately, Triggered is best viewed as the opening salvo of the Trump child with real political chops.

There has to be a Player of the Match, and it goes to Santner for his 3-25, but this was a team effort.

      "bodyText": "For England, Curran and Jordan (and Morgan) deserved better. But New Zealand prevailed because they had far more experience, and more than three players showing their class: Guptill and Neesham with the bat, Southee, Ferguson, Santner and Sodhi with the ball, and de Grandhomme and Guptill in the field. There has to be a Player of the Match, and it goes to Santner for his 3-25, but this was a team effort. New Zealand were cannier than England, playing the dimensions, and their fielding was in a different league. Thanks for your company, and do join Geoff Lemon for another T20 international (rain permitting). 20th over: England 155 all out (Rashid b Mitchell 4, Brown 4 not out) The last over begins, surreally, with three dots, and ends, one ball early, with a fine yorker. NZ were far too good, even though they thought 180 was par on a sporting pitch. England lost too many early wickets and dropped far too many catches. So it\u2019s 1-1 and rightly so. 19th over: England 154-9 (Rashid 4, Brown 3) England\u2019s last pair are trying to get \u2019em in singles. This will work as long as the final over includes 17 no-balls. 18th over: England 149-9 (Rashid 1, Brown 1) Ferguson finishes with 4-0-34-2. His extra pace came in handy. Mahmood edges four, to open his T20 account, but then gives catching practice to cover. 17th over: England 144-8 (Rashid 1, Mahmood 0) So 33 needed off three \u2013 feasible if you have any top-order batsmen, but Saqib Mahmood has never scored a run in T20 cricket. Lewis Gregory finally hits a six, off a knuckle ball from Southee, but instantly perishes trying to repeat himself. And Colin de Grandhomme completes the set of England\u2019s middle order. 16th over: England 134-7 (Gregory 6, Rashid 0) Jordan found the rope one last time, with a lofted cover shove, but now he\u2019s gone and Adil Rashid is going to have to assume the mantle. A question from Andrew Losowsky. \u201cWhy do you think the ground is so empty? I thought T20 was supposed to be a crowdpleaser? We have the World Cup finalists playing on a weekend, and the stands look pretty sparse.\u201d Well, certainly half-sparse, yes. I wish I knew the answer. Ah, shame. Jordan\u2019s superb counter-attack ends as he tries to drag Santner square but gets it too straight. Yet another good catch. 15th over: England 128-6 (Gregory 5, Jordan 31) Southee summons Ferguson to give Jordan a dose of his own medicine, full and straight, and it works at first, with two dots, but Jordan adjusts and chips a two and then a four. Game still alive, just: England need 49 from 30 balls. 14th over: England 120-6 (Gregory 4, Jordan 24) Hang on a minute. Jordan plays a classy cut for four off Sodhi, then wallops a six, and another, and another... He can\u2019t, can he? 13th over: England 96-6 (Gregory 3, Jordan 1) Just when they need ten an over, England manage two singles off Santner. T20 can be cruel. 12th over: England 94-6 (Gregory 2, Jordan 0) England have got two things horribly wrong today: their catching, and their belief that you can hit down the ground on a field with short square boundaries. de Grandhomme has taken all his catches in the V. And there goes their last hope. Malan lofts a ball that is so far outside off, it might have been a wide. It\u2019s a tough chance to Guptill at long-off, running in, and he does very well to hang onto it. Game over, surely. 11th over: England 91-5 (Malan 38, Gregory 0) Santner has 2-17 and although Malan gave him the big-swing treatment too, NZ are in charge here. England need 86 off nine with not enough wickets left. Curran is a mighty competitor but he\u2019s also a small man, trying to whack a tall man over an even taller man, and it doesn\u2019t work. Colin de Grandhomme has now caught as many catches as James Vince dropped. 10th over: England 82-4 (Malan 30, Curran 8) Malan finally goes big, picking up a full ball from Neesham from outside off and depositing it high in the stand at square leg. Curran joins in with a lofted late cut for four, and that\u2019s the chunky over England needed. Another email! And it comes with a bit of feeling. \u201cYeah I\u2019m sure winning the World Cup was great,\u201d says Benjamin Macintyre, \u201cbut have you ever gotten Bairstow out first ball haha revenge.\u201d 9th over: England 67-4 (Malan 21, Curran 1) Sam Curran, who bowled so well, is sent in ahead of Lewis Gregory. Curran has had so much responsibility so young, it\u2019s almost as if he plays for Man United. Another one! Sodhi\u2019s googly defeats Billings as he comes down the track, and he can only slice it high to de Grandhomme. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this England innings that can\u2019t be fixed by four dropped catches. 8th over: England 62-3 (Malan 20, Billings 6) Yet another bowling change as Mitchell replaces Neesham. Aiming for a yorker, he gives it too much width and allows Malan to stroke a cover-drive for four. Eight off the over, which means the rate keeps climbing \u2013 it\u2019s now just past 9.5, i.e. steep. 7th over: England 54-3 (Malan 14, Billings 4) Santner\u2019s reward for taking the big wicket is to be taken off. On comes his fellow spinner Sodhi, who concedes only five. Malan is going along at a run a ball, and he needs to take charge now. 6th over: England 49-3 (Malan 12, Billings 2) Malan takes the hint and hits a four \u2013 off the edge, through the slips, as Neesham finds some movement in his first T20i over for 33 months. Rust? What\u2019s that? 5th over: England 41-3 (Malan 6, Billings 0) So the switch to spin pays off. And a lot now rests on the shoulders of Malan, who has been quietly doing very little \u2013 he\u2019s only faced eight balls, and has yet to find the boundary. Morgan swings Santner for six, then tries to repeat the shot, but picks out de Grandhomme. And there goes the batsman who has made nearly all of England\u2019s runs. 4th over: England 33-2 (Malan 4, Morgan 26) Ferguson continues but may wish he hadn\u2019t. Morgan threads a two through a crowded cover region, then slaps four past gully, and spanks six in the same direction. He has 26 off 14 balls: collapse, what collapse? Holy crap, there\u2019s an email. It\u2019s our old friend Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cThat last NZ scalp,\u201d he notes, \u201ctook Chris Jordan to number two on the list of highest T20I wicket-takers for England. It shows how phenomenal he has been in this format. Since as far as one can remember, he\u2019s been an accurate bowler throughout the innings while also pulling off stunning catches every now and then. It\u2019s quite a shame to see him out of the other formats, but it\u2019s the way things have to be. With a singular focus on the World Cup next year, an extension of his purple patch can convert his status from \u2018yes he\u2019s rather good\u2019 to \u2018he\u2019s an all-time great of the format\u2019. Of course, there is a lot of time left between now and then, which he hopefully navigates through smoothly!\u201d Abhijato, never mind Jordan\u2019s undoubted excellence \u2013 I salute your single quotes. 3rd over: England 17-2 (Malan 4, Morgan 10) After scratching around for a few balls, Morgan thinks \u201cSod it\u201d and goes down the track to drive Southee inside-out for six. The man knows no fear. Can someone tell Kevin Pietersen? 2nd over: England 7-2 (Malan 2, Morgan 4) And Morgan nearly goes first ball, thick-edging Ferguson just wide of Taylor, who\u2019s just moved from slip to gully. Mind you, with the score 3-2, Southee should have had four slips. He\u2019s gone! Having a slap at Ferguson and picking out the fielder at wide third man. New Zealand have now caught as many catches out of two as Vince managed out of five. And they are hot favourites. 1st over: England 2-1 (Malan 1, Vince 1) James Vince is having quite a day. Five catches went to him, and he dropped three of them. He comes in to bat after one ball of the innings, and finds he has the wrong gloves, so he backtracks, then reappears, edges one and misses another. He\u2019ll probably get a hundred. First ball of the innings! Bairstow chips an outswinger straight to mid-on, and Daryl Mitchell shows none of the leniency we saw earlier from England. Game on. Jordan continues being immaculate, with a dot, a leg bye, and another drop as Malan, who has just told us \u201cthe key is to hold our catches\u201d, spills a dolly. Neesham celebrates with a six, smacked over midwicket, and then Jordan gets him caught by Vince, of all people, though it takes ages to be confirmed as the ump thought it was a bump ball. So Neesham makes his T20 comeback with an excellent 42 at nearly two-a-ball, and NZ have a total that is decent without being daunting on this narrow ground. Jordan finishes with 4-0-23-3. He, Curran and Rashid, the three senior pros, managed 31 dots from their 12 overs, while the rookies only had 11 from eight overs. Rashid was expensive between the dots, going for 40 overall, but Curran and Jordan were exemplary. They\u2019ve kept England in this game, in the face of some awful fielding. 19th over: NZ 166-7 (Neesham 36, Southee 1) Morgan keeps the faith with Mahmood, though he does get Jordan to talk him through things from mid-on. Not much either of them can do about this as Neesham goes inside-out with a six over extra-cover. Then a bad ball, short and on the hips, is helped round the corner for four. That\u2019s Neesham\u2019s career-best in T20 internationals: a good pick. 18th over: NZ 151-7 (Neesham 22, Southee 0) That is an immense over from Jordan, bowling full and straight, or short and straight, and helping himself to two for two. Another one! Santner slogs, skies it, and gives a simple catch to long-on. All down to Neesham now. Taylor has been quite untroubled... and then Jordan slips in a slow full toss that hits him on the back pad as he tries a slog-sweep. Silly but effective. 17th over: NZ 149-5 (Taylor 27, Neesham 21) Morgan\u2019s plan for the death is to have Jordan joined by Mahmood, who is slingy and built, you would think, to bowl yorkers. But he gets the line wrong to Neesham, who swings him for an easy six and now has 21 off 11 balls. The good news for England is that Taylor has switched to the anchor role and seems content with singles. 16th over: NZ 138-5 (Taylor 24, Neesham 13) Curran finally goes for a big one as Neesham drop-flicks for six, but he still finishes with a dot and the excellent figures of 4-0-22-2. 15th over: NZ 128-5 (Taylor 22, Neesham 5) Heeeere\u2019s Jimmy, playing his first T20 international since 2017. He takes a sighter for one ball, then glances Rashid for four. Two balls later, he swings to leg and gives a simple chance which is dropped at deep square. It\u2019s Vince again! 14th over: NZ 122-5 (Taylor 21, Neesham 0) Morgan sent for Sam Curran, who, in this England team, is the second most senior seamer, while still looking about 12. He does the business, keeping Taylor quiet and despatching his partner. Curran has 3-0-12-2. Mitchell, desperate for a mention in the OBO, shoots for a straight six but skies it to give Jordan a simple catch. 13th over: NZ 118-4 (Taylor 18, Mitchell 4) Taylor plays an even better shot, a late cut for four off a ball from Gregory that was blameless. Eight off the over as Taylor goes to 18 off 11 balls. One of the wonders of Twenty20 is seeing what batsmen can do when they don\u2019t have time to play themselves in. 12th over: NZ 110-4 (Taylor 12, Mitchell 2) Ross Taylor is usually the sober senior pro in this batting line-up, but it\u2019s Sunday afternoon and he may just have had a half of lager. He swings Rashid for a steel-wristed six, then chips him for four over cover, to regain the initiative. 11th over: NZ 98-4 (Taylor 1, Mitchell 1) A dream start for Lewis Gregory, who keeps it tight and full and now has figures of 1-0-2-1. England have been unplayable for four of these 11 overs, and unspeakable for the other seven. With Brown struggling, Morgan turns to Lewis Gregory, who was the invisible man on his debut \u2013 did not bat or bowl. And he gets a wicket first ball! By hitting the top of off, as if he thinks he\u2019s playing a Test. So both the danger-men have gone. 10th over: NZ 96-3 (de Grandhomme 28, Taylor 0) If that was a blow, de Grandhomme is in de Nial. He flicks Rashid for four, just over the man on the 45, and then belts him for the biggest six so far, 20 rows back. At the halfway stage, NZ are narrowly on top. Right on cue. Rashid bowls a ball so bad that you\u2019d think only Ian Botham could take a wicket with it. Guptill, down on one knee to pull, gets it too high on the bat and offers a catch that even Vince can\u2019t fluff. 9th over: NZ 85-2 (Guptill 41, de Grandhomme 17) Back comes Pat Brown and de Grandhomme tucks in, standing and delivering successive sixes. It\u2019s a triumph when Brown manages a dot as Guptill blocks. His two overs have gone for 32, this partnership is 28 off 15 balls, and England badly need a wicket. 8th over: NZ 70-2 (Guptill 39, de Grandhomme 4) Rashid beats Guptill with his first ball, but Guptill, after a single or two, gets his own back with a pull for six. The square boundaries are very short here. 7th over: NZ 59-2 (Guptill 31, de Grandhomme 1) Well done Mahmood \u2013 a first scalp and a mere six off the over. He has figures of 20-0-20-1, and now here comes some spin, from Adil Rashid. A first international wicket for Mahmood... and he may not have guessed it would happen like this. H ebowls a slower ball outside off, Seifert sweeps it, and gets it so fine that Billings takes a comfortable catch \u2013 like a less spectacular version of the Sarah Taylor special. But Mahmood, after an early battering, will take it. 6th over: NZ 53-1 (Guptill 30, Seifert 12) This is another drop as Jordan bounces Seifert, catches his glove, and Sam Billings leaps but can\u2019t hold on. And a third one as Guptill has a slog and Vince, at long-on, makes a great diving effort \u2013 not dopey that time. Ten off the over, 27 off the last two, so Curran\u2019s good work has been thrown away. 5th over: NZ 43-1 (Guptill 22, Seifert 10) Sam Curran takes a breather with the fine figures of 2-0-8-1. On comes Pat Brown, who seems not to have noticed that his fine leg is up. He strays onto Guptill\u2019s pads and pays the price as two leg glances go for four. Seifert joins in the fun with a six over midwicket, somewhere between a whip and a whack. And then Seifert is dropped by James Vince \u2013 a sitter at cover, off an off-break. Vince is such a talent, but he can be so dopey. 4th over: NZ 26-1 (Guptill 12, Seifert 3) Saqib Mahmood has been taken off after that pricey first over, as Morgan turns to Chris Jordan, who has played more T20 cricket for England than anyone else in the past two years. He starts, majestically, with five dots, taking pace off the ball and landing it back of a length. Finally, off the sixth ball, Seifert pierces the ring and picks up a hard-run two to the cover sweeper. 3rd over: NZ 24-1 (Guptill 12, Seifert 1) Curran is 10mph slower than Mahmood, but harder to hit because he\u2019s bowling full and finding some swing. And now he\u2019s got the breakthrough too. His brother, by the way, is not dropped but rested, as he has a side strain. Cunning from Curran. A wide down the legside. A wide down the offside. And then the bullseye, spearing in at Munro\u2019s right ankle as he strolls across his stumps. He thinks about a review, only to run out of time. 2nd over: NZ 18-0 (Guptill 10, Munro 6) Mahmood opens his account with a bouncer, which Guptill flaps at and misses. Second ball, Mahmood goes for length and Guptill whacks him for six over long-on. A few singles and then Colin Munro swings a six too, over the man at deep square. Harsh but fair. 1st over: NZ 3-0 (Guptill 2, Munro 0) Curran starts with a yorker just outside off stump, which Guptill blocks, rather tentatively. Third ball, he\u2019s beaten, also outside off. Fourth ball, he manages a push to cover for a single, which is followed by a leg bye and another single. Another good start from Curran, and here comes the new boy. The players are on the field and there\u2019s not a long white cloud in the sky. The new ball has been thrown to Sam Curran. Saqib Mahmood was presented with his cap by David Lloyd, also of Lancashire and England. This being T20, the cap was the colour of Donald Trump\u2019s face. Saqib has just been interviewed by Bumble too, and he came across as likeable and down-to-earth. How did he hear about his call-up? \u201cFrom Morgs, yesterday. I was having a nap in the afternoon, he sent me a text and I missed it, so he called me.\u201d One change for NZ too, as they bring in Jimmy Neesham for Scott Kuggeleijn. Since Neesham is left-handed, a star of the Super Over and highly entertaining on Twitter, the only surprise is that he was ever left out. New Zealand 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Colin Munro, 3 Tim Seifert (wkt), 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Colin de Grandhomme, 6 @JimmyNeesh, 7 Daryl Mitchell, 8 Mitchell Santner, 9 Tim Southee (capt), 10 Ish Sodhi, 11 Lockie Ferguson. England 1 Dawid Malan, 2 Jonny Bairstow, 3 James Vince, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Sam Billings (wkt), 6 Lewis Gregory, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Pat Brown, 11 Saqib Mahmood. And bowl again. Early team news: England are reported (by Lawrence Booth, the editor of Wisden, on Twitter, with the lead piping) to be giving a debut to Saqib Mahmood, the Lancashire fast bowler. That\u2019ll be their fourth new cap since the day Brexit didn\u2019t happen. \u201cGood morning from foggy Hanoi, Vietnam,\u201d says Dan Bradnam. The Dan himself. \u201cTried explaining cricket to my local host, but I think he thought I was asking where to do Tai Chi.\u201d Morning everyone, or afternoon, or whatever it is with you. And welcome to the big one. The rugby World Cup Final was just the hors d\u2019oeuvre. Those blustery encounters in the Premier League were merely the pasta course.

      "bodyText": "Labor has launched a new campaign targeting the government over aged care funding, as the health minister, Greg Hunt, commits to delivering a \u201csignificant package\u201d for the sector before Christmas. Setting a deadline of 11 November when parliament returns, opposition leader Anthony Albanese said the \u201caged care, action now\u201d campaign would gather signatures from across the country calling for immediate funding to address a crisis in the sector. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for the government to be sitting on its hands while these cuts have been made, while even the money that was allocated hasn\u2019t been spent,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe truth is that this government has cut aged care funding, they slashed it while Scott Morrison was the treasurer of Australia. And the consequences are there for all to see.\u201d The new campaign comes after the royal commission into aged care released a scathing report into the sector on Thursday, calling for urgent funding for home care packages, action on chemical restraints used in nursing homes and the removal of disabled young people from aged care. Albanese said the report had highlighted \u201catrocious\u201d behaviour towards older Australians, and the government had been missing in action since the report was handed down on Thursday. While the minister for aged care, Richard Colbeck, faced criticism for refusing to commit extra funds to the overburdened system following the report\u2019s public released, Hunt on Sunday defended the government\u2019s response. He said the report went \u201cfurther than we expected\u201d and the Coalition would now consider and respond to the commission\u2019s interim findings. \u201cWe are responding to what is the most profound and serious review of aged care in Australia, in the commission\u2019s words, in four decades,\u201d Hunt told ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cWe called this [royal commission] because we recognised that there were deep and serious challenges. The commission went further than we expected in the sense that it identified a nationwide challenge over multiple decades. It identified both a cultural and a governmental challenge, and so, we are responding, and there will be additional home care packages.\u201d When asked if he would commit to at least $2.5bn \u2013 the amount needed to address the home care wait list of 120,000 \u2013 Hunt said he would not pre-empt the figure. The inquiry pointed to 16,000 people who died last year while waiting for a home care package, with those needing the highest level of care waiting an average 22 months. Labor\u2019s shadow minister for aged care, Julie Collins, said that for every week that the government delayed action, 300 older Australians die without their home care package. \u201cIt is simply not good enough for the prime minister and minister Hunt to say, \u2018Oh, wait, we will do something in a few weeks\u2019,\u201d Collins said. \u201cOlder Australians sitting in that queue don\u2019t have weeks \u2013 the government must respond urgently. That\u2019s what our campaign is about.\u201d Hunt pointed to a decision made at Friday\u2019s council of Australian governments health council meeting to make medicine safety a new national priority as an example of the government responding \u201cin real time\u201d to concerns raised by the commission about the use of chemical restraints. The Coag resolution was an agreement to establish a baseline report on medicine use and safety to identify the prevalence of harm and misuse of medicines. Hunt said the government would be taking \u201cstronger action\u201d on the use of chemical restraints in response to the commission\u2019s findings, but would not detail what changes were under consideration. \u201cWe will be dealing with chemical restraints as one of the three priorities that they\u2019ve identified for a response right now,\u201d he said. Hunt also said the report had raised concern about ageism in Australia, which he said was a \u201cnational cultural issue\u201d that needed to be addressed by both government and the community. \u201cThe big change is to deal with what the commission refers to as an ageist society, and respect, and respect is both government and communal,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThis is the line in the sand, together, where we change the way that Australians deal with ageing in what is, by definition, an ageing society.\u201d In response to a major report from the productivity commission this week on mental health, Hunt said the government\u2019s \u201cobjective\u201d was to build 100 adult mental health clinics over the next decade, with eight already under way costing $60m. But he said one of the biggest barriers to treatment was \u201cself stigma\u201d.",

A spokesperson for the Breeders\u2019 Cup later confirmed that he had been taken to Santa Anita\u2019s equine hospital and had been found to have sustained a serious injury to his left hind ankle.</p> <p>Five senior vets were involved in the decision that Mongolian Groom should be put down.</p> <p>\u201cMongolian Groom \u2026 was immediately attended to by an expert team of veterinarians led by Dr Ryan Carpenter,\u201d the Breeders\u2019 Cup operation said in a statement. \u201cDuring their evaluation at the equine hospital at Santa Anita, they observed a serious fracture to his left hind limb. Radiographs were taken and a complete evaluation was performed.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the extent of the injury, Dr Carpenter, in consultation [with four colleagues] recommended humane euthanasia of Mongolian Groom.\u201d</p> <p>The statement continued: \u201cThe death of Mongolian Groom is a loss to the entire horse racing community. Our equine and human athletes\u2019 safety is the Breeders\u2019 Cup\u2019s top priority. We have worked closely with Santa Anita leading up to the World Championships to promote enhanced equine safety. Santa Anita has implemented numerous industry-leading reforms to enhance the existing health and safety measures with the intent of providing a safe racing environment.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, Breeders\u2019 Cup always observes the most thorough up-to-date medication practices and restrictions, testing protocols, equine security and surveillance program, veterinary exams, injury management protocols and racing surface testing. These measures are in place to ensure our athletes are racing under the safest and most transparent conditions possible.</p> <p>\u201cBreeders\u2019 Cup has engaged world-renowned veterinarian, Dr.Larry Bramlage, to conduct an independent evaluation, the results of which will be published when completed. We will continue to keep all stakeholders apprised as information becomes available. We are committed to working with our partners in the industry to continue to advance safety reforms, with the well-being of our athletes in mind.\u201d</p> <p>Vino Rosso had been demoted from first to second after crossing the line just in front of Code Of Honor in the Jockey Club Gold Cup in September, but there was no doubt about the manner of his victory here as he stormed past McKinzie, the favourite, to win by four-and-a-quarter lengths with Higher Power the same distance away in third.

      "bodyText": "Vino Rosso\u2019s powerful stretch run carried him to victory in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic at Santa Anita on Saturday, but the race was marred by a serious injury to Mongolian Groom, the first sustained by any runner in the 14 Breeders\u2019 Cup races over Friday and Saturday. Two hours after the race, it was announced that the four-year-old had been put down as his injuries were too serious to be treated, marking the 37th equine death at the prestigious track since last December. Mongolian Groom was starting to fade rounding the home turn when he was suddenly pulled up by Abel Cedillo, his jockey. A spokesperson for the Breeders\u2019 Cup later confirmed that he had been taken to Santa Anita\u2019s equine hospital and had been found to have sustained a serious injury to his left hind ankle. Five senior vets were involved in the decision that Mongolian Groom should be put down. \u201cMongolian Groom \u2026 was immediately attended to by an expert team of veterinarians led by Dr Ryan Carpenter,\u201d the Breeders\u2019 Cup operation said in a statement. \u201cDuring their evaluation at the equine hospital at Santa Anita, they observed a serious fracture to his left hind limb. Radiographs were taken and a complete evaluation was performed. \u201cGiven the extent of the injury, Dr Carpenter, in consultation [with four colleagues] recommended humane euthanasia of Mongolian Groom.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cThe death of Mongolian Groom is a loss to the entire horse racing community. Our equine and human athletes\u2019 safety is the Breeders\u2019 Cup\u2019s top priority. We have worked closely with Santa Anita leading up to the World Championships to promote enhanced equine safety. Santa Anita has implemented numerous industry-leading reforms to enhance the existing health and safety measures with the intent of providing a safe racing environment. \u201cIn addition, Breeders\u2019 Cup always observes the most thorough up-to-date medication practices and restrictions, testing protocols, equine security and surveillance program, veterinary exams, injury management protocols and racing surface testing. These measures are in place to ensure our athletes are racing under the safest and most transparent conditions possible. \u201cBreeders\u2019 Cup has engaged world-renowned veterinarian, Dr.Larry Bramlage, to conduct an independent evaluation, the results of which will be published when completed. We will continue to keep all stakeholders apprised as information becomes available. We are committed to working with our partners in the industry to continue to advance safety reforms, with the well-being of our athletes in mind.\u201d Vino Rosso had been demoted from first to second after crossing the line just in front of Code Of Honor in the Jockey Club Gold Cup in September, but there was no doubt about the manner of his victory here as he stormed past McKinzie, the favourite, to win by four-and-a-quarter lengths with Higher Power the same distance away in third. It paled towards insignificance, however, as the seriousness of Mongolian Groom\u2019s injury became apparent. Earlier in the evening, Iridessa was the only European-trained winner over the two days thanks to a perfectly-judged ride by Wayne Lordan in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf.

On Thursday the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission released the findings from a series of investigations into individual officer conduct as well as wider systematic issues in the police force.

Victoria police confirmed over the weekend the photograph of the officer was legitimate. \u201cWe have identified the police officer who was photographed at this week\u2019s protest with a comment on his body worn camera and can confirm the image is real,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are still working to ascertain how and why this comment was on his camera. \u201cThe community can be reassured this is not the type of behaviour we expect from our officers and we are extremely disappointed by the situation.\u201d \u201cVictoria police will be investigating the matter further with involvement from professional standards command and disciplinary action will be considered as part of this.\u201d Victoria police said the behaviour detracted from an \u201cotherwise professionally conducted operation and tarnishes the reputation of all of our officers\u201d.",
