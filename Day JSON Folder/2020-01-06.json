The figure \u2013 far higher than a previous estimate of about 40,000 \u2013 spoke to the scale of the challenge facing Mexico\u2019s leftist leader, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took power in December 2018 vowing to pacify his country.

On Monday equally horrifying details emerged about the number of people being \u201cdisappeared\u201d in Mexico \u2013 often by drug cartels, mafia groups or even state security forces. Mexico\u2019s undersecretary of human rights, Alejandro Encinas Rodr\u00edguez, told reporters that since L\u00f3pez Obrador took office authorities had discovered 873 clandestine burial sites from which 1,124 bodies had been exhumed.

Mike Mulvey\u2019s 8-2 loss the Phoenix, Mark Jones\u2019s final 5-0 capitulation \u2013&#xa0;those were performances from teams bereft of confidence. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/06/marquee-hits-and-misses-highlight-a-leagues-evolution\">Were it not for an unstoppable Robbie Kruse</a>, the Jets may yet have emerged from their trip to Melbourne relatively intact.</p> <p>In many ways, Merrick becomes the victim of his own achievements. Judged in comparison with the seasons Newcastle fans endured under predecessors Phil Stubbins, Scott Miller and Jones, even this campaign shows comparative hope. It only becomes an absolute failure when viewed in comparison with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/03/forget-fairytales-a-league-success-is-borne-out-of-unity-of-purpose\">Merrick\u2019s incredible success with the club in 2017-18</a>.</p> <p>And yet within the Jets\u2019 latest 4-0 capitulation are the kernels of legitimate criticism against the 66-year-old. An at-times blinkered emphasis on attacking football in a league full of counter-attackers \u2013 a prioritising of principles over pragmatism, irrespective of the match context or the squad at his disposal \u2013 had became a glaring Achilles heel. It is one thing to praise passages of front-facing football, but if the defence is shambolic and the set-piece organisation sorely wanting, aspiring to compose a symphony and creating cacophony invites rebuke.</p> <p>Critics will point to seasons that have ebbed away, promise that was not always fulfilled by Merrick\u2019s teams, but over 13 seasons and 300-plus A-League games the positives have far outweighed the negatives.</p> <p>Two championships, two premierships and two A-League coach of the year awards illuminated his Melbourne Victory days, but it was the memory of Archie Thompson or Danny Allsopp in full flight, fed by the mercurial talent of Fred, Tom Pondeljak or Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez that endures \u2013 as one fateful Adelaide United side found out to their eternal haunting.</p> <p>In his time with the Wellington Phoenix, the silverware-shy underdogs went 22 of 27 rounds towards an elusive premiership in 2014-15, coaxing the best out of the prodigiously talented but hot-and-cold Roly Bonevacia, returning Nathan Burns to Johnny Warren medal-winning form, and turning a backpacking Spanish paramedic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/mar/17/a-league-tactics-wellington-phoenix-danger-zones\">into one of the competition\u2019s most effective defensive midfielders</a>.</p> <p>And then there was Newcastle. Behind only the Wanderers\u2019 inaugural A-League campaign and subsequent Asian Champion\u2019s League triumph, and Guillermo Amor\u2019s bottom-to-double-winners fairytale with Adelaide United, the Jets\u2019 2017-18 campaign ranks as one of the A-League\u2019s great against-all-odds narratives. Seven years in a finals-free wilderness, and only an unplugged VAR machine between them and the miraculous.</p> <p>Through all of this it was the calibre of the man that left his indelible imprint on Australian football, and those he worked with. Vince Lia tells a story of staring at the scrapheap less than two seasons into his playing career, before a phone call from Merrick to Ricky Herbert provided a 12-season reprieve for the player he\u2019d dumped from his Victory team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/jan/02/david-squires-on-what-is-in-store-for-the-a-league-in-2020\">David Squires on ... what is in store for the A-League in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A teacher before cutting his teeth in the NSL in the late 80s with coaching roles at Preston Makedonia and Sunshine George Cross, Merrick never lost his desire to entice the best out of those around him. Former staff speak of the inquisitive way in which the quietly-spoken Scot would challenge them or their methods \u2013 inviting growth through critical self-reflection.</p> <p>In the microcosm of Australian football where the norm is too often the snarling alpha-dog barking instructions, cajoling through fear of humiliation or ridicule, Merrick provided a welcome counterpoint. Notoriously taciturn on the sideline, he invested quiet faith in his players, inviting those others had called worthless or journeymen to conjure the very best from within themselves.</p> <p>His legacy in Australia assured, the chief complaint looking back on a 40-plus-year association with football might be that the man who grew up among Edinburgh carnival performers didn\u2019t get to pull the final curtain on his own terms. For the Jets, only the achievements of his successor will prove whether the decision to move on Merrick was the correct one.</p>",

Were it not for an unstoppable Robbie Kruse, the Jets may yet have emerged from their trip to Melbourne relatively intact. In many ways, Merrick becomes the victim of his own achievements. Judged in comparison with the seasons Newcastle fans endured under predecessors Phil Stubbins, Scott Miller and Jones, even this campaign shows comparative hope. It only becomes an absolute failure when viewed in comparison with Merrick\u2019s incredible success with the club in 2017-18. And yet within the Jets\u2019 latest 4-0 capitulation are the kernels of legitimate criticism against the 66-year-old. An at-times blinkered emphasis on attacking football in a league full of counter-attackers \u2013 a prioritising of principles over pragmatism, irrespective of the match context or the squad at his disposal \u2013 had became a glaring Achilles heel. It is one thing to praise passages of front-facing football, but if the defence is shambolic and the set-piece organisation sorely wanting, aspiring to compose a symphony and creating cacophony invites rebuke. Critics will point to seasons that have ebbed away, promise that was not always fulfilled by Merrick\u2019s teams, but over 13 seasons and 300-plus A-League games the positives have far outweighed the negatives. Two championships, two premierships and two A-League coach of the year awards illuminated his Melbourne Victory days, but it was the memory of Archie Thompson or Danny Allsopp in full flight, fed by the mercurial talent of Fred, Tom Pondeljak or Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez that endures \u2013 as one fateful Adelaide United side found out to their eternal haunting. In his time with the Wellington Phoenix, the silverware-shy underdogs went 22 of 27 rounds towards an elusive premiership in 2014-15, coaxing the best out of the prodigiously talented but hot-and-cold Roly Bonevacia, returning Nathan Burns to Johnny Warren medal-winning form, and turning a backpacking Spanish paramedic into one of the competition\u2019s most effective defensive midfielders. And then there was Newcastle. Behind only the Wanderers\u2019 inaugural A-League campaign and subsequent Asian Champion\u2019s League triumph, and Guillermo Amor\u2019s bottom-to-double-winners fairytale with Adelaide United, the Jets\u2019 2017-18 campaign ranks as one of the A-League\u2019s great against-all-odds narratives. Seven years in a finals-free wilderness, and only an unplugged VAR machine between them and the miraculous. Through all of this it was the calibre of the man that left his indelible imprint on Australian football, and those he worked with. Vince Lia tells a story of staring at the scrapheap less than two seasons into his playing career, before a phone call from Merrick to Ricky Herbert provided a 12-season reprieve for the player he\u2019d dumped from his Victory team. A teacher before cutting his teeth in the NSL in the late 80s with coaching roles at Preston Makedonia and Sunshine George Cross, Merrick never lost his desire to entice the best out of those around him. Former staff speak of the inquisitive way in which the quietly-spoken Scot would challenge them or their methods \u2013 inviting growth through critical self-reflection. In the microcosm of Australian football where the norm is too often the snarling alpha-dog barking instructions, cajoling through fear of humiliation or ridicule, Merrick provided a welcome counterpoint. Notoriously taciturn on the sideline, he invested quiet faith in his players, inviting those others had called worthless or journeymen to conjure the very best from within themselves. His legacy in Australia assured, the chief complaint looking back on a 40-plus-year association with football might be that the man who grew up among Edinburgh carnival performers didn\u2019t get to pull the final curtain on his own terms. For the Jets, only the achievements of his successor will prove whether the decision to move on Merrick was the correct one.",

      "bodyText": "The trial of former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein did not begin with the bang of a judge\u2019s gavel, but with a wave of silence that fell over the crowd of people standing outside the county courthouse building in New York when the disgraced mogul emerged from a black SUV Monday morning. In the crowd were seven women who looked on solemnly as Weinstein walked, their arms draped over a barricade that separated them from him and his entourage. Some held signs that read \u201cJustice for survivors\u201d and \u201cListen to survivors\u201d. Weinstein did not meet their pointed stares when he shuffled into the building with the aid of a walking frame. The group, a small coalition of the 80 women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, gathered to mark the start of what they hope will be the vehicle that brings justice for Weinstein\u2019s accusers. \u201cI stand in solidarity with the brave survivors who will take the stand against Harvey Weinstein in this trial. While the emotion of the day runs high, I join these other brave women who were also harmed by Harvey Weinstein to say: We aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d the actor Rosanna Arquette told reporters moments after Weinstein disappeared inside the courthouse. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including raping a woman in 2013 and forcing another woman to engage in oral sexual conduct in 2006. The trial is in its early stages, with jury selection beginning next week. Rose McGowan, an actor and activist, thanked the women who will be testifying in court in an open letter she wrote to Weinstein. \u201cToday is a day for us to honor how far we\u2019ve come and how much we\u2019ve endured to get here. But it is not the end,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cWe are free, we are beautiful, we are strong and you will never take that from us.\u201d Prompted by questions from reporters, the women responded to comments Weinstein made in an email he sent to CNN in December that indicated he believes it will be possible for him to build a career in the film industry again. \u201cDoes anyone really want to see that? It\u2019s like a pedophile saying, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to go back to coaching Little League as soon as this is all over.\u2019 This is a dangerous predator,\u201d said Lauren Sivan, a journalist who said Weinstein masturbated into a nearby potted plant in front of her in 2007. \u201cEven if he is acquitted on this trial, let\u2019s hope he will never be able to go back to doing what he was doing.\u201d Rebutting Weinstein\u2019s comments he made in an interview with the New York Post, lamenting the ruin of his supposed legacy of boosting women\u2019s careers in Hollywood, McGowan said: \u201cFor every woman he put on screen, he took out about a hundred behind the scene.\u201d In response to a question about the friendly emails that Weinstein\u2019s defense team say show his accusers kept contact with Weinstein after their alleged assaults, Sarah Ann Masse, an actor, said she hopes \u201can expert who is trauma-informed\u201d will speak about the experience of sexual assault survivors. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly common to stay in touch with your abusers if you knew them prior to abuse,\u201d Masse said. \u201cHopefully the jury and judge will be informed enough to know not to listen to those ridiculous defenses.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Oil prices climbed above $70 a barrel for the first time in four months on Monday amid fears that the US airstrike that killed Iran\u2019s top military commander may trigger a retaliation and disrupt global energy supplies. The Brent crude price hit $70.73 (\u00a353.74), its highest level since Houthi rebels launched a drone attack on a major Saudi oil facility in September, with European stock markets also posting losses, including a decline of 0.6% on the FTSE 100 in London. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones in New York were slightly up at closing. About a fifth of the global oil supply flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow shipping route between Oman and Iran. It was targeted last year by Iran, which seized two oil tankers in the strait. A prolonged oil price surge could raise the risk of a global economic recession and would add about 2p a litre to the price of petrol at the pumps. However, market analysts at Goldman Sachs and UBS have cast doubt on whether oil prices will continue to rally beyond $70 a barrel because of strong production from outside the Middle East. Brent crude slipped back below $69 in later afternoon trading on Monday after touching its four-month high. UBS expects the global oil market to be oversupplied this year because of rising production from the US and Norway, which would keep prices from staying above $70. Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the global market\u2019s focus on the oil price after the attack is \u201ca rather 1970s reaction\u201d that is \u201cperhaps not appropriate for 2020\u201d. The oil price spike to more than $70 a barrel after the Saudi oil refinery attack proved short-lived, with the price retreating to less than $65 within days. \u201cMore serious economic damage may come if there is cyber-retaliation \u2013 which seems suited to this situation \u2013 or from general uncertainty,\u201d Donovan said. The geopolitical jitters have triggered a surge in the market price for gold, which asset managers typically consider a safe haven in times of turmoil. The market price for gold rose to a near seven-year high of $1,575 an ounce on Monday and analysts expect the price could climb higher if the US dollar weakens relative to other currencies. A spokesman for the RAC said a prolonged oil price rally would add at least 2p a litre to the price of petrol, weeks after the first rise in six months in December. The average price of a litre of petrol rose by almost 0.25p in December to 126.1p, according to the RAC. Motorists are paying more for the fuel because of a combination of rising oil market prices and the cost of meeting EU rules to include more biofuels in petrol and diesel.",

They restricted the hosts to the one, decisive goal, as Alex Forbes beat three men down the left and fed Don Roper, who crossed for Reg Lewis to head home. Arsenal went on to win the cup. Leeds missed out on promotion.</p> <p><strong>The next time the teams met in the cup was the 1972 final.</strong> Leeds were the best team in the land back then, the bosses of England from 1965 to 1974, though much good that did them in terms of overall trophy haul. By way of illustration, it was Arsenal who were reigning double champions at the time; Leeds righted some wrongs by prevailing 1-0 at Wembley thanks to Mick Jones\u2019 pullback and Allan Clarke\u2019s diving header. It remains their only FA Cup.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal, by contrast, have 13 of the things. </strong>They\u2019ve also got much the better of Leeds in the cup head-to-heads, having knocked them out in 1983, 1991, 1993, 2004, 2011 and 2012. Leeds\u2019 only FA Cup victory during that time came in 1997, when an early Rod Wallace goal was enough to see off the Gunners at Highbury.</p> <p><strong>Leeds have won just one of their last five games in the Championship. </strong>They won\u2019t want to be narrowly missing out on promotion again like they did in 1950 (and last year), so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/leeds-united-arsenal-fa-cup-marcelo-bielsa\">aren\u2019t likely to compromise their push for the Premier League by picking a full-strength side</a>. Arsenal might give it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/mikel-arteta-arsenal-fa-cup-leeds\">a good old go</a>, though.

      "bodyText": "So Arsenal go to Bournemouth in the fourth round, while Leeds regroup for their Championship bid. Nick Ames and Barney Ronay were at the Emirates tonight, and here are their verdicts on the quintessential game of two halves. Clickity click, enjoy, enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Mikel Arteta talks. \u201cNow I am really pleased. But I think we have seen two different teams. One in the first 30 minutes, another from the first 30 minutes of the first half. I tried to give them advice, to tell them exactly what they were going to face. And after 32 minutes we started to win. We changed our attitude and desire, and at half-time our organisation. We were completely different. Leeds batter every team, but it is good to learn. Their intensity is really different.\u201d The goalscoring hero Reiss Nelson speaks to the BBC: \u201cEmotions are high. Leeds are a great team, and they pressed us hard, we didn\u2019t expect it. But we got the goal in the end.\u201d Then man-of-the-match Alexandre Lacazette is asked what Mikel Arteta said at half-time. \u201cHe shouted a lot. He was not happy. Thank you Reiss for the goal!\u201d The Leeds fans are giving their team a huge ovation, despite the result. They were deliciously good in the first half, blowing Arsenal away, lacking only a cutting edge. Admittedly the word \u201conly\u201d is doing a lot of work there. Arsenal couldn\u2019t have complained had they been a couple of goals down. But they regrouped magnificently in the second half, beating Leeds at their own high-energy game, and managed to grind out the decisive goal. The sort of game Arsenal haven\u2019t been winning so often in recent years. Leeds don\u2019t look too distraught. You sense they\u2019re more than happy to concentrate on their promotion push. Well that was a game of two halves, and no mistake. Leeds were totally dominant in the first half, but couldn\u2019t find the net. Arsenal turned the tables in the second half, and Reiss Nelson scored the goal that made the difference. Arsenal will travel to Bournemouth in the fourth round! 90 min +5: Douglas slips Harrison into space down the left. Harrison runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. That is surely that. 90 min +4: Leeds need to get it upfield quickly. So White decides to beat two men in his own area instead of moving the ball on. He only just about gets away with it, but that\u2019s cost Leeds precious time. 90 min +3: Luiz takes, and shovels a ludicrous effort miles over the bar. Leeds are still alive ... just. Can they pull something out of the bag, and take Arsenal back to Elland Road? 90 min +2: Guendouzi buys a cheap free kick off Costa, just to the right of the Leeds D. A great opportunity for the hosts to close this out. 90 min +1: In the first of five extra minutes, Pepe is replaced by Saka. 90 min: A brilliant chance for Harrison to save Leeds, as he\u2019s sent into acres down the left. But upon entering the box, he hesitates over his shot, allowing Sokratis to challenge. Adding insult to injury, Sokratis plays the ball off him, and Leeds don\u2019t even get a corner. 89 min: Of course, prim old VAR has to spoil everyone\u2019s fun, and far too much time is spent deciding whether Douglas had deliberately poked Sokratis in the eye. There\u2019s nothing obvious to see, and on we go. Eventually. 87 min: Now Arsenal are guarding the ball by the right-hand corner flag. Sokratis is sitting around the ball, legs akimbo. He\u2019s swarmed by desperate Leeds players. Eventually Harrison, trying to work the ball out from betweek Sokratis\u2019s legs, falls over. He clatters into Sokratis, knee on chin, boot up arse. It\u2019s a moment of slapstick brilliance. No free kick. It\u2019s only going to be a throw. 85 min: Pepe swings the resulting free kick into the mixer. Leeds clear easily enough. But they need something in attack, quicksmart, and Arsenal aren\u2019t affording them the opportunity. Paul Janaway will be pleased with all this: \u201cHopefully Arsenal will learn to grind out the game with Arteta. A learning process for many of the Arsenal youngsters and something we have lacked for years. Every game extra experience!\u201d 84 min: Willock and Kolasinac are happy to faff about near the left-hand corner flag. No attacking intent, just good game management. Eventually Martinelli decides to dribble towards the box, and is hauled down by Dallas, who goes in the book. 82 min: ... Dallas crosses deep. Costa, at the far post, but too wide for a shot, passes back to nobody. Luiz clears. 81 min: But Leeds aren\u2019t finished yet. Costa breaks upfield and slips the ball wide right for Stevens, whose first-time cross is blocked out of play by Luiz. Corner. And from that ... 80 min: ... Sokratis sends a shot sailing towards Highbury &amp; Islington tube. 79 min: Kolasinac bursts down the inside left. He one-twos with Lacazette, then shoots from a tight angle. Douglas slides in to deflect out for a corner. From which ... 78 min: Ayling looks to have tweaked his hamstring. He\u2019s replaced by Stevens, making his third appearance for Leeds. 77 min: Ozil is replaced by Willock. 75 min: Before the corner can be taken, VAR checks on a clash between Lacazette and Berardi. Lacazette had taken a little soft kick at the prone Leeds defender, after a brief tangle. But it\u2019s not considered enough for a red card. Or any censure in fact. The corner, like the VAR rock-and-roll, comes to nothing. 74 min: Lacazette turns away from two blue shirts, a gorgeous bit of skill. Leeds are now on the back foot. Pepe runs at them down the right and tees up Martinelli, who shoots. His effort is deflected over for a corner. 72 min: Douglas goes direct for goal. Aiming for the top right, he\u2019s always wide and high. Another let-off for Arsenal. But Leeds are at least showing in Arsenal\u2019s half of the pitch now; they haven\u2019t done that on a regular basis for quite a while. 71 min: Costa spins Kolasinac smartly down the inside-right channel. Kolasinac sticks out a cynical arm and he\u2019s in the book. Another free kick for Leeds, 30 yards out, right of centre. 70 min: The free kick\u2019s lumped in. The flag goes up for offside. Then another Leeds attack. A long ball. Costa and Bamford are both flagged. Frustration for Leeds. 69 min: Ozil is stripped by Dallas, who makes off down the left. Ozil drags him back. Free kick. A chance for Leeds to cause some rare second-half bother in the Arsenal box. 67 min: Klich is booked for a late clatter on Xhaka. That may raise a Leeds eyebrow or two, as Xhaka has been putting it about tonight without censure. But that\u2019s the decision. Meanwhile Arsenal make their first change of the evening, replacing the goalscorer Nelson with Martinelli. 65 min: Cute play from Ozil and Nelson, who work the ball in from the left and tee up Lacazette on the penalty spot. Lacazette attempts to spin and shoot, but collides with Berardi. Lacazette wants a penalty, and VAR take a look, but nothing is forthcoming. 63 min: Xhaka swings a leg at Douglas. It\u2019s late and clumsy, and he should be in the book, but referee Anthony Taylor is in a very generous mood tonight. 61 min: Ozil and Lacazette combine on the edge of the Leeds D, slipping the ball to Nelson on the left. Nelson\u2019s shot is deflected out for a corner on the right. The set piece comes to nothing, but the hosts continue to knock on the door. They\u2019ve been relentless since the restart, a full switcheroo from the first half. 60 min: Leeds make that double switch: Costa and Dallas come on for Gotts and Alioski. 59 min: Pepe dribbles down the inside-right and sends a cross infield. The ball hits White\u2019s chest. Pepe wants a penalty, but that\u2019s not going to happen. 58 min: Gotts tries to turn the tide with a shot from 25 yards. It\u2019s wild and wide. On the touchline, Marcelo Bielsa prepares a double change. 57 min: Arsenal passes are sticking now. And Leeds, who were first to everything in the first half, suddenly look a bit ragged. They\u2019ve been shocked by Arsenal\u2019s newly found intensity. Arsenal\u2019s post-break pressure pays off! Pepe wins the ball in midfield and drives down the inside-right channel. He slips the ball wide right for Lacazette, who tries to return it. But the ball\u2019s deflected towards Nelson instead. Nelson doesn\u2019t quite connect properly, six yards out, but manages to bundle the ball over the line anyway. Leeds will wonder how it\u2019s come to this, after their first-half dominance, but here we all are. 54 min: Leeds finally get themselves going in the second half, Bamford drifting in from the right and pearling a low shot towards the bottom left that Martinez does extremely well to parry. 52 min: Guendouzi curls a low shot inches wide of the bottom left. Where have this Arsenal been? Not turning up until the second half? Has Mikel Arteta bought Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s sat-nav? 51 min: This is so much better from Arsenal. Guendouzi slips a pass in from the right for Ozil, who pauses, draws three players towards him, then tees up Lacazette to his left. Lacazette fires towards the bottom right. Meslier is behind it all the way. 50 min: Lacazette takes. He whips over the wall towards the top left. It\u2019s never coming down quickly enough, though. It skims the top of the crossbar. Meslier almost certainly had it covered. 49 min: Xhaka drives down the inside left and purchases a cheap free kick off Klich, who clumsily barges him over from behind, just to the left of the D. A free kick in a very dangerous place. 48 min: Nelson has another dribble down the left. He goes nowhere, but that\u2019s OK. Arsenal have obviously been given the proverbial rocket at half time. They\u2019re faster and sharper, and haven\u2019t allowed Leeds a kick since the restart. 46 min: And Arsenal come again, Lacazette flicking cutely down the middle for Nelson, who skedaddles with great purpose towards the Leeds box. White sticks on his shoulder, though, and does just enough to herd him away from goal before he can shoot. Phillips arrives to help out, and Leeds clear. But barely a minute of the second half has elapsed, and already Arsenal look a different team. 45 min 13 sec: Pepe has a go from 30 yards. It flies 30 yards over, but that\u2019s not the point. A necessary statement of intent. It\u2019s the second half. Arsenal kick off. They were totally outplayed by Leeds in the first period; the visitors enjoyed 63 percent possession, and had 15 attempts on goal to Arsenal\u2019s three. Leeds\u2019 high-paced pressing has been too much for Arsenal, who will need to raise their game in this second half or they\u2019ll be going out. No changes yet. Half-time entertainment. How on earth are Leeds not a couple of goals up? They\u2019ve been utterly dominant, and have given Arsenal a proper chasing. I\u2019d pay ready money to be a fly on the wall as Mikel Arteta turns on the hairdryer. 45 min: Leeds stroke it around beautifully. Just as it looks as though they\u2019re going to launch another sortie on the Arsenal goal, Alioski clumsily wanders offside. The Arsenal crowd holler at Sokratis; they want the game restarted quickly. But the defender is blowing hard, having been given the runaround for 44-and-a-half minutes, and he performs the internationally recognised mime for Calm Down. Not entirely sure the fans will be getting onside with that message. 43 min: Breaking news on the BBC: Ozil has touched the ball nine times so far. Nobody\u2019s seen less action. He\u2019s an easy target sometimes, but come on. Here\u2019s Charles Antaki with \u201cthe excellent news ... Arsenal cannot in all physical, sporting or moral conscience, be as bad in the next half as in this.\u201d 41 min: Alioski slips Klich into the Arsenal box down the left. Klich rounds Martinez on the outside, but the angle\u2019s too tight for a shot. He pulls back for Gotts, who miscontrols and that\u2019s a goal kick. This is absurd. 40 min: Space for Klich down the right. Gotts, on the edge of the six-yard box, meets the pullback but skies it over the bar. How are Leeds not ahead? Or, put a different way: how are Arsenal not behind? 39 min: Ayling crosses from the right, nearly catching Sokratis out and finding Alioski free in the box. Sokratis does well to readjust his position and clear in the nick of time. 37 min: Arsenal can\u2019t keep hold of the ball at all. White fairly clatters Lacazette twice, the striker asking for free kicks he\u2019s never going to be awarded. He looks fully miffed. He\u2019s been second best in that particular duel. 35 min: Alioski hurt his leg while falling in a tangle with Sokratis, but he\u2019s good to continue. It\u2019s not long before Leeds are coming at Arsenal again, Harrison slipping a gorgeous reverse ball down the inside right for Phillips, who returns it across the face of goal. Harrison can\u2019t quite get his shot away. Arsenal clear, and it looked as though Phillips was initially offside anyway. 33 min: Ayling crosses deep from the right. Alioski wins the header in a battle with Sokratis, six yards out. It\u2019s flying towards the top left. Martinez, channelling his inner David Seaman, claws out sensationally. What a save! Arsenal clear their lines, while Alioski stays down, requesting treatment. 32 min: Douglas floats a pass down the inside-left channel that very nearly releases Bamford on goal. Holding does extremely well to read the danger and get in the way to head clear. 31 min: ... Luiz heads harmlessly wide left. It was a great opportunity, eight yards out, with a huge hole in the middle of the Leeds defence. Arsenal have still only had one effort on target. 30 min: Luiz strides forward and takes a hopeful punt from the best part of 30 yards. Full marks for ambition. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner on the left. From which ... 28 min: Alioski crosses from the left. Harrison swivels on the edge of the D and sends yet another shot whistling goalwards. Once again, Martinez is right behind it. The Arsenal keeper is earning his money this evening. 26 min: Sokratis has to battle like billy-o just to earn a throw on the halfway line. Leeds aren\u2019t giving Arsenal any space or time. The wide-eyed, open-mouthed look on Sokratis\u2019s face as he takes the rare chance to catch a breath speaks volumes. 24 min: Leeds, suitably chastened, go up the other end and nearly score themselves, Alioski making good ground down the left before whizzing a low shot across the face of goal and out for a goal kick. 23 min: Leeds stroke it around nicely. So good to watch. Complacency is the only danger right now. White dawdles over the ball and allows Lacazette to scoot away with it. The striker enters the area. It looks like a classic sucker punch is about to be landed, but Lacazette takes too much time and he\u2019s swarmed then crowded out. 21 min: Phillips swings a medium-height free kick into the mixer. The ball skims off Xhaka\u2019s head, and Martinez spills it off his chest and out of his arms. It\u2019s knocked out in a panic for a corner, which Martinez to be fair claims well. He launches long ... and there\u2019s nobody in red in the Leeds half. Arsenal need to clear their heads, because they\u2019re all over the show at the minute. 20 min: Arsenal are a shambles at the back. Nelson, running back towards his own goal, is easily stripped of possession by Alioski, who slips a pass wide left for Bamford. Alioski clumsily bundles him over. A free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the area. 19 min: Luiz plays a ridiculous ball out of defence, an easy interception for Alioski, who should do better than standing up a cross, intended for Bamford, that\u2019s easy for Holding to head out for a corner. The set piece comes to nothing. 17 min: Harrison drops a shoulder to leave Kolasinac in the dust down the right. Another shot from distance. Martinez, who will have warm hands, deals with this one too. Leeds will wonder how they\u2019re not ahead. 15 min: Leeds hit the bar! Klich glides in from the right and lays off to Bamford, who one-twos a pretty triangle with Harrison, enters the box, and smashes a shot off the crossbar from 12 yards out, a little to the right. He probably should have scored, but the quality of the move was such that you can\u2019t complain too much. Leeds are playing some fine football. Can we have them back in the Premier League, please? Enough\u2019s enough. 14 min: Harrison has a dig from 20 yards. It\u2019s a fine, rising effort, and Martinez does very well to claw it away from the top-right corner. This match is being played at 101 mph. 12 min: Xhaka goes on a sensational 60-yard run down the left wing. He then tries to release Ozil into the box, but in attempting a slide-rule pass, punts clumsily out for a goal kick. That\u2019s like walking a couple of miles home with the house keys, to let your locked-out family in, only to drop them down the drain in front of the porch. 11 min: Ayling and Alioski combine well down the right, the former eventually hooking across from the byline for Douglas, who is completely unmarked in the middle, six yards out and onside! But the cross is a foot too high for Douglas. What a let-off for Arsenal, who are all over the shop at the back. 10 min: Leeds are putting the Arsenal defence under pressure with their hard press. Holding is forced into a shank out of play. From the throw, Bamford latches onto Harrison\u2019s whipped right-wing cross and flashes a header out of play on the right. This is good stuff from Leeds, both on and off the pitch. A hell of an atmosphere, some good old-fashioned cup bedlam. 8 min: Pepe looks in the mood for Arsenal, even if the rest of his team-mates aren\u2019t up to speed yet. Now he lashes a shot towards the top left from 20 yards; it\u2019s easy enough for Meslier, but a decent effort nonetheless. 7 min: Harrison latches onto a dismal Holding pass out of defence, and goes racing towards the Arsenal box. Leeds are three on two. Harrison slots one down the inside-left channel for Bamford, who is in less space than the man in blue out on the right. Bamford shoots, only to see his shot blocked for a corner that comes to nothing. Leeds should have worked Martinez at the very least. 6 min: It\u2019s mainly Leeds in these opening exchanges. They\u2019re pinging it around nicely. But hold on! Douglas loses control in the centre circle, and misses a tackle on Pepe, allowing the winger to sashay down the middle of the park with great purpose. He\u2019s crowded out before he can get to the Leeds box, but what a fine run. 4 min: Alioski takes the free kick, sending it curling towards the far post. Bamford gets eyebrows on it, but can only help it out for a goal kick. 3 min: Douglas rakes a long ball towards Bamford, who can\u2019t win the heading duel with Luiz, but then Guendouzi bundles over Alioski as they compete for the loose ball. A free kick for Leeds, just to the left of centre, 40 yards out. 2 min: Leeds are out of the blocks quickly, pressing, pressing, pressing. A sign that they\u2019re not here to mess about. Bamford is nearly released down the left, but Luiz snuffs out his run. A lively start by the visitors. And we\u2019re off! Leeds get the rerun of the 1972 final going. A fantastic atmosphere at the Emirates. The teams are out! Arsenal in red shirts with white sleeves, Leeds in third-choice powder blue. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Right, I\u2019m back. What a draw, eh? Eh? Anyway, back to tonight\u2019s big game, and let\u2019s find out who\u2019ll be travelling to Bournemouth in the fourth round. No bombshells in the pre-match interviews, other than the revelation that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is ill. Before the big kick-off at the Emirates, the draw for the fourth round will be made. That means some downtime for this MBM, as I nip across to populate the live blog with the fate of your favourites. See you over there, and we\u2019ll all meet back here before the match? Great, it\u2019s a plan. \u266b \u266f \u266a Memories light the corners of your mind, distant snow-covered memories, of the way we were \u266a \u266b \u201cThe Arsenal v Leeds tie in 1991 went to a whopping three replays,\u201d recalls Matt Emerson. \u201cI vividly recall the second one being during a bitterly cold spell in London and tuned in to Capital Gold to hear the great news that they\u2019d cleared the snow off the pitch and - thanks to Arsenal\u2019s fabled undersoil heating - the match was definitely on. I duly went along: it ended nil-nil. Happy days.\u201d A night off for Arsenal\u2019s leading scorer and captain, then. But Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has made his presence felt at the Emirates tonight nonetheless. Ahead of a month of frenzied transfer-window speculation, he\u2019s sought to shut down all idle chat surrounding his future. Arsenal fans will enjoy reading the captain\u2019s notes in their official matchday programme this evening. Unless the first letter of each paragraph spells A-C-T-U-A-L-L-Y-I-M-O-F-F-S-E-E-Y-A, in the style of former Autocar employee James May, we haven\u2019t checked that closely. Arsenal make four changes to the side that beat Manchester United last week. Emiliano Martinez, Rob Holding, Reiss Nelson and Matteo Guendouzi take the places of Bernd Leno, Lucas Torreira, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Leeds make five changes to the team sent out to draw at West Brom in their last match. Illan Meslier and Robbie Gotts make their debuts, alongside the recalled Gaetano Berardi, Barry Douglas and Patrick Bamford. Casilla, Liam Cooper, Stuart Dallas, Eddie Nketiah and Helder Costa make way. Arsenal: Martinez, Sokratis, Luiz, Holding, Nelson, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Kolasinac, Ozil, Pepe, Lacazette. Subs: Leno, Ceballos, Mavropanos, Willock, Martinelli, John-Jules, Saka. Leeds United: Meslier, Ayling, Berardi, White, Douglas, Phillips, Alioski, Gotts, Klich, Harrison, Bamford. Subs: Cooper, Casilla, Dallas, Helder Costa, Davis, Stevens, Casey. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Arsenal and Leeds United first met in the FA Cup in 1950. Leeds, then as now, were in the second tier, but a defence led by legend-in-making John Charles gave a good account of itself. They restricted the hosts to the one, decisive goal, as Alex Forbes beat three men down the left and fed Don Roper, who crossed for Reg Lewis to head home. Arsenal went on to win the cup. Leeds missed out on promotion. The next time the teams met in the cup was the 1972 final. Leeds were the best team in the land back then, the bosses of England from 1965 to 1974, though much good that did them in terms of overall trophy haul. By way of illustration, it was Arsenal who were reigning double champions at the time; Leeds righted some wrongs by prevailing 1-0 at Wembley thanks to Mick Jones\u2019 pullback and Allan Clarke\u2019s diving header. It remains their only FA Cup. Arsenal, by contrast, have 13 of the things. They\u2019ve also got much the better of Leeds in the cup head-to-heads, having knocked them out in 1983, 1991, 1993, 2004, 2011 and 2012. Leeds\u2019 only FA Cup victory during that time came in 1997, when an early Rod Wallace goal was enough to see off the Gunners at Highbury. Leeds have won just one of their last five games in the Championship. They won\u2019t want to be narrowly missing out on promotion again like they did in 1950 (and last year), so aren\u2019t likely to compromise their push for the Premier League by picking a full-strength side. Arsenal might give it a good old go, though. So for a few reasons, the hosts are the hot favourites tonight. But anything can happen in the FA Cup. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 7.56pm GMT. Heads up!",

      "body": "<p>There has been the usual hand-wringing over the FA Cup this week. What is it for? What is its destiny? Do we still need this thing to work the way this thing works?</p> \n<p>Well, here was one convincing answer. The point of the FA Cup is to get Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds United to the Emirates Stadium and then stick them on prime time TV. That ought to do it for now.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/06/arsenal-leeds-united-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">Reiss Nelson puts Arsenal through in FA Cup despite Leeds\u2019 best efforts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Arsenal made it to the fourth round of the Cup thanks to Reiss Nelson\u2019s second-half goal. They had the resolve not to wilt in the way so many Arsenal teams might have wilted under this degree of pressure. But the real story was Leeds, who were simply a joy to watch in the first half. Best of all Bielsa\u2019s team were that rare thing in elite sport, a source of constant surprise. Ten minutes before half-time the light blue shirts swarmed through Arsenal\u2019s left side once again and suddenly, outrageously, they were passing the ball around between themselves in the Arsenal box, the home defence overrun, outmanned, bafflingly outnumbered.</p> \n<p>Patrick Bamford and Jack Harrison couldn\u2019t quite get a shot away. Somehow the score remained 0-0. But it was thrilling to see a team with the will to flood Arsenal\u2019s backline from the start.</p> \n<p>Time and again Leeds\u2019 No10 Ezgjan Alioski seemed to have wandered in from some parallel dimension or abseiled down off the lip of the stadium roof, such were the strange empty spaces he kept finding.</p> \n<p>And at times this didn\u2019t look like a standard football match at all. There were too many light blue shirts in among the red ones, too many at the Arsenal end. It looked like a production error, like a Super 8 film clumsily spliced. One kept expecting the picture to jog and the teams to separate, Leeds to retreat to the required respectful distance. Didn\u2019t happen. Kept on going.</p> \n<p>This is, of course, how Bielsa teams play. It was a treat in itself to see him on a Premier League touchline, a manager whose influence among the dukes of elite management is so eagerly fanfared it has become a self-fuelling institution in itself.</p> \n<p>Bielsa stood and watched the early exchanges, a slightly hangdog figure in club overcoat and glasses: brain whirring, circuits computing the early trajectory of Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s slightly madcap dashes down the right.</p> \n<p>There was an element of master-and-disciple about a meeting with Mikel Arteta, albeit in a next-gen, one-remove kind of sense. Pep Guardiola\u2019s office wall at Manchester City is festooned with Bielsa quotes, many of which touch on his uniquely high-throttle demands. \u201cRunning is understanding, running is everything,\u201d Bielsa has said. For 45 minutes Leeds took this entirely to heart.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17fb84fb95cc0752335506759f0b802c0a624816\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17fb84fb95cc0752335506759f0b802c0a624816/0_115_3436_2062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcelo Bielsa collects his thoughts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcelo Bielsa collects his thoughts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Davies/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It felt wild, brittle and slightly doomed, as Leeds failed to turn this into goals. But it made for a stunning spectacle, football as a crowd-event, as a shared expression of energy. The boisterous knot of away fans, the intense running patterns, the knot of men in coats on the touchline: there is something collegiate and tightly bonded about Leeds, like watching a brilliantly well-planned travelling stag do unfold before your eyes.</p> \n<p>Arsenal started a strong team in the face of this. The only real oddity was the presence of Sokratis Papastathopoulos at right-back, an intriguing take on the notion of the full-back as creative dynamo. Leeds found most of their joy down that side. Three times early on they stormed through on that left flank, Bamford smashing a shot on to the bar with 10 minutes gone.</p> \n<p>This was authentic, vibrant Bielsa-ball, the light blue shirts swarming together in small pockets. It is the best thing about his teams when they function as they should, the basic sense of optimism in that running game, every part of the team moving forward behind its most advanced point.</p> \n<p>This fearlessness has often ended in success, often in brilliant failure. Here it made for a gripping game of 35 shots , constant sprints and collisions, a rat-a-tat of short, quick passing.</p> \n<p>The question as ever is how to sustain that level of intensity, to cover the gaps it will inevitably leave. Leeds needed to score in those moments but couldn\u2019t find the right angle, the right space. Half-time broke their stride. Arsenal finally pulled themselves up to their full height, and 10 minutes into the second half a nice break from P\u00e9p\u00e9 ended with Nelson bundling the ball over the line.

      "bodyText": "There has been the usual hand-wringing over the FA Cup this week. What is it for? What is its destiny? Do we still need this thing to work the way this thing works? Well, here was one convincing answer. The point of the FA Cup is to get Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds United to the Emirates Stadium and then stick them on prime time TV. That ought to do it for now. Arsenal made it to the fourth round of the Cup thanks to Reiss Nelson\u2019s second-half goal. They had the resolve not to wilt in the way so many Arsenal teams might have wilted under this degree of pressure. But the real story was Leeds, who were simply a joy to watch in the first half. Best of all Bielsa\u2019s team were that rare thing in elite sport, a source of constant surprise. Ten minutes before half-time the light blue shirts swarmed through Arsenal\u2019s left side once again and suddenly, outrageously, they were passing the ball around between themselves in the Arsenal box, the home defence overrun, outmanned, bafflingly outnumbered. Patrick Bamford and Jack Harrison couldn\u2019t quite get a shot away. Somehow the score remained 0-0. But it was thrilling to see a team with the will to flood Arsenal\u2019s backline from the start. Time and again Leeds\u2019 No10 Ezgjan Alioski seemed to have wandered in from some parallel dimension or abseiled down off the lip of the stadium roof, such were the strange empty spaces he kept finding. And at times this didn\u2019t look like a standard football match at all. There were too many light blue shirts in among the red ones, too many at the Arsenal end. It looked like a production error, like a Super 8 film clumsily spliced. One kept expecting the picture to jog and the teams to separate, Leeds to retreat to the required respectful distance. Didn\u2019t happen. Kept on going. This is, of course, how Bielsa teams play. It was a treat in itself to see him on a Premier League touchline, a manager whose influence among the dukes of elite management is so eagerly fanfared it has become a self-fuelling institution in itself. Bielsa stood and watched the early exchanges, a slightly hangdog figure in club overcoat and glasses: brain whirring, circuits computing the early trajectory of Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s slightly madcap dashes down the right. There was an element of master-and-disciple about a meeting with Mikel Arteta, albeit in a next-gen, one-remove kind of sense. Pep Guardiola\u2019s office wall at Manchester City is festooned with Bielsa quotes, many of which touch on his uniquely high-throttle demands. \u201cRunning is understanding, running is everything,\u201d Bielsa has said. For 45 minutes Leeds took this entirely to heart. It felt wild, brittle and slightly doomed, as Leeds failed to turn this into goals. But it made for a stunning spectacle, football as a crowd-event, as a shared expression of energy. The boisterous knot of away fans, the intense running patterns, the knot of men in coats on the touchline: there is something collegiate and tightly bonded about Leeds, like watching a brilliantly well-planned travelling stag do unfold before your eyes. Arsenal started a strong team in the face of this. The only real oddity was the presence of Sokratis Papastathopoulos at right-back, an intriguing take on the notion of the full-back as creative dynamo. Leeds found most of their joy down that side. Three times early on they stormed through on that left flank, Bamford smashing a shot on to the bar with 10 minutes gone. This was authentic, vibrant Bielsa-ball, the light blue shirts swarming together in small pockets. It is the best thing about his teams when they function as they should, the basic sense of optimism in that running game, every part of the team moving forward behind its most advanced point. This fearlessness has often ended in success, often in brilliant failure. Here it made for a gripping game of 35 shots , constant sprints and collisions, a rat-a-tat of short, quick passing. The question as ever is how to sustain that level of intensity, to cover the gaps it will inevitably leave. Leeds needed to score in those moments but couldn\u2019t find the right angle, the right space. Half-time broke their stride. Arsenal finally pulled themselves up to their full height, and 10 minutes into the second half a nice break from P\u00e9p\u00e9 ended with Nelson bundling the ball over the line. From there Arsenal had just about enough to bring Leeds to heel. It was a beautiful thing to watch all the same, a reminder not just of the quality in English football\u2019s second tier, but of the fine patterns, the basic fun of Bielsa and his running game. Leeds didn\u2019t come here looking for a replay. But they will, with a bit of luck, be back before long.",

      "bodyText": "Children who experience severe deprivation early in life have smaller brains in adulthood, researchers have found. The findings are based on scans of young adults who were adopted as children into UK families from Romania\u2019s orphanages that rose under the regime of the dictator Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu. Now experts say that despite the children having been adopted into loving, nurturing families in the early 1990s, the early neglect appears to have left its mark on their brain structures. \u201cI think the most striking finding is \u2026 that the effects on the brain have persisted,\u201d said Prof Edmund Sonuga-Barke, a co-author of the study from King\u2019s College London, who added that the results showed neuroplasticity had limits. \u201cThe idea that everything is recoverable, no matter what your experience \u2026 isn\u2019t necessarily true \u2013 even with the best care you can still see those signs of that earlier adversity,\u201d he said. The plight of the undernourished children, who had little social contact and received insufficient care, shocked the world when it came to light after the fall of the communist government in 1989. Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s oppressive policies had banned abortion and contraception, while those without children were taxed. As a result, large numbers of children ended up in orphanages living in terrible conditions. Previous studies involving the adoptees have shown they had marked cognitive difficulties as children \u2013 although these improved considerably into adulthood \u2013 while they also had high rates of conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, as adults, high levels of anxiety and depression. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Sonuga-Barke and colleagues told how they carried out brain scans and other measures of 67 Romanian adoptees who had spent between three and 41 months living in severe deprivation as children. At the time of the scans the adoptees were between 23 and 28 years old. The team also took brain scans from 21 adults of a similar age who had been born and adopted in the UK before they were six months old. The results revealed the Romanian adoptees had on average an 8.6% smaller brain overall than their UK peers. The team also found the size of the reduction was linked to the length of time spent in the Romanian orphanages: each additional month was linked to a 3cm3 lower total brain volume. \u201cThe more deprivation they had, the smaller their brains are,\u201d said Sonuga-Barke. The team\u2019s analysis showed the smaller brain size explained the reduced IQ and, at least in part, the higher rates of ADHD found among the Romanian adoptees. Among further findings, the team discovered that two areas of the brain showed a further size difference compared with the UK-born adoptees \u2013 although these did not vary with time spent in the orphanages. One area, which included the right inferior frontal gyrus, was smaller in the Romanian adoptees even than expected from the reduced overall brain size. This area is a key centre for executive control circuits. The second area, which included the right inferior temporal gyrus \u2013 an important area for auditory and visual processing as well as some aspects of memory \u2013 was larger than expected from the smaller brain size among the Romanian adoptees and appears to have provided a protective effect. The larger this area, the fewer the symptoms of ADHD in the Romanian adoptees. However, the team said it was not clear if this area grew in response to deprivation, or whether some children were, somewhat fortunately, predisposed to a larger area. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any better evidence in the whole of [human] neuroscience, for a compensatory effect in a high-risk sample like this,\u201d said Sonuga-Barke. He added the team were surprised to find no particular impact on the amygdala \u2013 the region of the brain that processes emotions. While the study cannot prove that early childhood deprivation leads to a smaller brain, Sonuga-Barke said it was likely, noting genetic influences, ethnic differences, overall body size, and effects in the womb had been ruled out as explaining the link. The team proposed a number of possible mechanisms including the absence of experiences that are important for normal brain development, and chronic stress that could damage the developing brain. However Sonuga-Barke said it remained unclear which features of deprivation were responsible, and that poor nutrition did not appear to explain the link. \u201cWe are fairly confident that there are psychological routes to these effects as well, linked to lack of stimulation, lack of social interaction, and lack of attachment and bonding,\u201d he said. Prof Denis Mareschal, from Birbeck, University of London, said the study highlighted the importance of providing enriched environments in early infancy and childhood. But he urged caution, noting the deprivation in the Romanian orphanages was extreme. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether less extreme deprivations typical of deprived upbringings in low socioeconomic status neighbourhoods in the UK would lead to similar long-term consequence on brain structure, or whether these milder forms of deprivations could be compensated for by subsequently experiencing enriched environments such as those provided by the Sure Start programmes here in the UK.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary who stood down as an MP only to be elevated weeks later to the House of Lords, is planning to keep an \u00a38,400 payment given to members who are closing down their offices. Morgan, who is paid a cabinet minister\u2019s salary of \u00a379,754, said she will accept the winding-up payment given to retiring MPs. A Labour MP has called for both Morgan and Zac Goldsmith, another minister who was unexpectedly elevated to the Lords, to pay back any money they have accepted. Chris Bryant, the MP for Rhondda, said: \u201cAfter all the talk of democracy it would be wrong for any MP who has lost or resigned their seat and is immediately put on a salary as a minister in the Lords to take this double payment. Both Nicky and Zac should consider giving it to charity.\u201d Under new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) rules implemented after the 2019 election, MPs can claim for an additional two months\u2019 salary \u2013 about \u00a38,400 \u2013 if they close down their office. Morgan announced she was standing down as the MP for Loughborough in October, in a letter that cited \u201cthe clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP\u201d as part of the reason for her decision. But she was highly visible during the election campaign while other senior ministers, including Andrea Leadsom and Victoria Atkins, were hardly seen. When asked by the Guardian on 25 November last year whether she had communicated with anyone connected to No 10 or Boris Johnson about a possible job in government or peerage, she replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Days after Johnson\u2019s landslide election victory, the new prime minister surprised many by making Morgan a life peer and asking her to remain in post. Morgan said she would accept the winding-up payment, despite protests from other MPs. \u201cWe are all entitled to a winding-up payment and that is what I am doing, winding up all my work as an MP. I am taking it,\u201d she said. Former MPs who lost their seats at the general election \u2013 or those who stepped down just before it \u2013 are entitled to more than \u00a32m in taxpayers\u2019 money. Under IPSA rules, 71 defeated MPs can claim a \u201closs of office payment\u201d equal to double the existing statutory redundancy pay rate \u2013 taking into account years of service, weekly pay and age \u2013 for non-MPs. Goldsmith, a minister of state who lost his Richmond Park seat last month, would be entitled not only to the winding-up payment but also to a separate loss of office payment. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs has been asked whether he has accepted either payment.",

      "bodyText": "The rape trial of the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein began on Monday in Manhattan and immediately erupted into furious name-calling between lawyers, who decried each other\u2019s behaviour as \u201cabominable\u201d, \u201cdegrading\u201d and \u201chumiliating\u201d. It was a sign of the high stakes in a trial that marks the next chapter in the #MeToo movement triggered by allegations of sexual misconduct by the movie producer two years ago. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to five counts that include raping a woman in 2013 and forcing another woman to engage in oral sexual conduct in 2006. The most serious charge is predatory sexual assault, carrying a maximum sentence of life. Even as the trial was cranking into gear in New York, Weinstein\u2019s legal problems multiplied with the announcement that prosecutors in Los Angeles had brought their own criminal charges against him. He was charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in an alleged two-day spree in February 2013. Though it was well known that LA prosecutors were investigating, the charges still sent shockwaves across the country. In Manhattan, a group of accusers including the actors Rose McGowan and Rosanna Arquette stared as Weinstein got out of his car. Some held signs that said \u201cJustice for survivors\u201d. Surrounded by his legal team, hunched over a gray metal walker, Weinstein hurried into the building. Inside, the movie producer sat 10ft from Gloria Allred, the campaigning attorney who represents two women who will testify. The pair did not make eye contact. The trial\u2019s cast is drawn from Hollywood\u2019s high table. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, the actors Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow among them. But the case is also of intimate importance to all who have endured sexual harassment in the workplace. For them, the movement triggered by the Weinstein revelations in October 2017 has become a driving force for change. For Weinstein, the stakes could not be higher. Last month a $25m settlement was reached involving more than 30 women. To the dismay of some, the deal did not touch Weinstein\u2019s own money or require him to admit guilt. In New York, to secure a guilty verdict on the charge of predatory sexual assault, prosecutors will have to convince the jury the producer engaged in a pattern of sexual crimes over time. The judge, James Burke, has indicated he will allow three other women to testify including Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, who alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 1993. Though that incident is beyond the statute of limitations, it can be presented as evidence of alleged predatory behaviour. On Monday, the hearing erupted in dispute, lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon accusing Weinstein\u2019s attorneys of \u201cabominable\u201d behaviour which \u201cdegraded and humiliated\u201d the accusers. \u201cIn the last 72 hours it has been in our opinion abominable to talk about evidence, to talk about sealed discovery in public, to talk about witnesses in a humiliating way,\u201d Illuzzi-Orbon said. She pointed to a conversation in which one of Weinstein\u2019s legal team cast aspersions on an accuser. \u201cIf you say things like, \u2018She\u2019s a good actress, I\u2019m sure she will come off well, she\u2019s performing, or that she\u2019s lying, or that it was a loving intimate relationship \u2026\u2019\u201d The prosecutor said evidence would be presented that would discount any claim of intimacy between Weinstein and his alleged victims. The judge turned to one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers and said: \u201cSo what did you do, Miss Rotunno?\u201d Donna Rotunno said: \u201cI did nothing improper. I have been professional, I have been respectful and I have done my job.\u201d Burke issued an edict to both parties: \u201cLeave the witnesses alone. Do not talk about them in any capacity.\u201d The issue of how the women who will testify have been treated also came up in regard to Black Cube, a corporate intelligence company run largely by former officers of Israeli intelligence. The New Yorker journalist Ronan Farrow revealed that Weinstein employed Black Cube to make contact with accusers as a way of extracting information. The prosecutor requested the court to order Weinstein\u2019s lawyers to tell the jury Black Cube contacted witnesses. The prosecution also revealed that they wished to present the jury with photographs relating to one accuser. There are 72, they said, though they intend to admit seven. \u201cWe have minimalised any undue prejudices\u201d in the images, Illuzzi-Orbon said. \u201cWe do feel the they are very, very important for the jury to see.\u201d The judge reserved his ruling. Weinstein\u2019s team protested that they were not being given sufficient evidentiary material. In particular they protested that medical records of one of the accusers, including notes of a visit to a hospital emergency room, were heavily redacted. A Weinstein attorney said: \u201cThe state says this is a sensitive matter for the complaining witnesses \u2013 no doubt. But it is also a sensitive matter for Mr Weinstein. It affects his ability to defend himself.\u201d The case was adjourned until Tuesday, when jury selection begins. That is expected to take up to two weeks. Outside, the accusers who call themselves the \u201csilence breakers\u201d spoke to reporters. McGowan read an open letter to Weinstein. \u201cYou thought you could terrorise me and others into silence,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were wrong. That we\u2019ve come to this moment of justice is staggering. The trial means so much to so many.\u201d McGowan was joined by six other women, including Arquette, Lauren Sivan and Sarah Ann Masse. They responded to Weinstein\u2019s comments to the New York Post in December, in which he lamented that his work \u201cpromoting women has been forgotten\u201d. \u201cFor every woman he put on the screen, he took out about a hundred behind the scenes,\u201d McGowan said. Masse noted that when Weinstein walked into court, \u201che wouldn\u2019t look at us, he wouldn\u2019t make eye contact. Nothing has changed. He\u2019s a coward.\u201d To Arquette, he looked like a \u201cvery broken man\u201d. McGowan added: \u201cI think he has taken some good acting tips.\u201d",

More than 50 Israeli women, appalled by the treatment of the British 19-year-old, flew into Cyprus in a show of solidarity with Cypriot activists who have arranged a mass protest outside the court at the time of sentencing. Some arrived at Larnaca airport wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the words: \u201cWe Believe You.\u201d Others carried banners that declared: \u201cYou\u2019ll never walk alone.\u201d Sara Maimon, a 45-year-old Israeli nurse newly arrived from Jerusalem, said: \u201cWe are here to both protest injustice and support the victim. I hope it is meaningful to her that women in Israel believe her. There are people like me who also feel a little bit responsible that it was our citizens who did this to her.\u201d The Israeli women will also be demonstrating outside the Israeli embassy in Nicosia later on Tuesday. Protests are also planned in solidarity with the Briton in Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning. At Monday\u2019s protest in London, Dorothy Muir, a former police officer who during her career investigated sexual offences, said she had concerns about what she had heard about the woman\u2019s treatment by Cypriot police. \u201cNobody should be interviewed for eight hours without a solicitor or an interpreter in a foreign country,\u201d Muir said. Protesters marched from the high commission, near Piccadilly, to Parliament Square, via Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, pausing briefly outside Downing Street. They ended their protest by the statue of the suffragette Millicent Fawcett. There Nevitt read out a statement from the teenager\u2019s lawyer before reading out details of the case, including the injuries recorded on her body, her testimony about her experience on the night, the DNA from semen found on her body, how the Israelis involved had circulated explicit sexual footage of her online, and how their relatives had sprayed champagne and chanted \u201cthe Brit is a whore\u201d on their return to Israel after their release. \u201cThe message sent is, if you are attacked and report, don\u2019t expect help or justice,\u201d she said. \u201cThe case won\u2019t be properly investigated and you\u2019ll become the accused. It also sends a message to men that you can get away with sexual assault. That you won\u2019t even be investigated.\u201d",

The ruling by a tax tribunal could potentially save News UK enormous sums in the future and allow the company to claim back tens of millions of pounds from the government in overpayment of VAT. Newspapers, books and some other printed products have historically been zero-rated for the purpose of value-added tax because their consumption is considered to benefit the public. News UK has fought a long-running legal challenge against the decision to charge VAT at 20% on the online editions of the Times and Sunday Times, arguing that because the tablet edition and website are only updated four times a day they meet the legal definition of a newspaper. The segment of law giving newspapers their zero-rated VAT status was written in 1972, long before anyone had to consider whether it was possible to be a digital newspaper, forcing lawyers to come up with a definition. The upper tax tribunal ruling stated it is \u201can essential characteristic of a newspaper that it is produced in periodic editions\u201d, with the Times\u2019 occasionally updated website and tablet edition meeting the definition, while constantly updated outlets such as the BBC News and Guardian websites do not.

      "body": "<p>For those of us in Iraq who get the latest news from WhatsApp groups, the dawn of 3 January was filled with apprehension and fear. It felt like the huge events of the recent past: the night of the declaration of war in 2003, the news of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/14/iraq.iraq1\" title=\"\">Saddam Hussein</a>\u2019s arrest, the day of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/30/iraq.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">his execution</a>, or the day the Iraqi military collapsed in the face of Islamic State\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jan/29/bureaucracy-evil-isis-run-city-mosul\" title=\"\">occupation of Mosul</a>.</p> <p>To this list we can now add: the day the Americans killed General <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/05/boris-johnson-qassem-suleimani-was-threat-to-all-our-interests-lament-death\" title=\"\">Qassem Suleimani</a>, commander of the Iranian Quds force, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/abu-mahdi-al-muhandis-iraq-iran-militias-suleimani\" title=\"\">Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis</a>, the deputy chief of the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias.</p> <p>Everyone had heard the news before the sun had even risen, with horrific images circulating of the remains of the dead bodies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Suleimani and al-Muhandis were responsible for the brutal crackdown on demonstrations since they began in October</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some speculated that the two most influential men in Iraq had been returning to Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone to increase the pressure on parliament and the president to approve a new prime minister. Iraq has had a caretaker government since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/29/iraq-pm-resign-protests-abdul-mahdi-al-sistani\" title=\"\">autumn resignation</a> of Adel Abdul Mahdi, in the wake of protests \u2013 over the economy and corruption \u2013 led by the young and poor. The purpose of this pressure would have been to appoint a pro-Iranian figure who essentially carried on the policies of Abdul Mahdi \u2013 himself accused by the Iraqi protesters of being an Iranian pawn.</p> <p>As a friend wrote to me, in an ironic message on WhatsApp that, out of fear, he did not post to Facebook: \u201cThe American bombing is not an attack on Iraqi sovereignty, but Iranian sovereignty. For sadly, there is no Iraqi sovereignty.\u201d Ever since the start of operations to liberate areas under Isis control in the autumn of 2014, for which the Americans and Iranians acted in an effective alliance, it\u2019s been an open secret that Iraq\u2019s political scene has been completely captured by Iran.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23d7ae03102d7a1bc84a2b1f43616a3c58bf5d6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23d7ae03102d7a1bc84a2b1f43616a3c58bf5d6c/0_215_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester in Baghdad after the prime minister\u2019s resignation in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Abdul Mahdi ran a government that was a front for militia forces.\u2019 A protester in Baghdad in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murtaja Lateef/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To a certain extent, this has been with the tacit acceptance of the Americans; and just as the Iranians have come to treat Iraq as a mere protectorate, so, too, has Washington. It treats Iraq as a land where it can do whatever it likes, from targeting warehouses arming the PMU last summer, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/30/tehran-condemns-us-airstrikes-in-iraq-and-syria-as-act-of-terrorism\" title=\"\">striking</a> the Iraqi Hezbollah militia in the city of Qaim on the Iraqi-Syrian border, to the recent airstrikes. These were all unilateral acts that were not coordinated with the Iraqi security authorities, and the Iraqi government was not aware of them until hours beforehand or even afterwards. This persistent violation of sovereignty helped drive the Iraqi parliament\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/anti-isis-coalition-suspends-operations-as-iraqi-mps-vote-to-expel-us-troops\" title=\"\">resolution</a> on Sunday, ordering all foreign troops out of the country.</p> <p>After the attack, the protesters in Baghdad and other cities issued statements condemning the US assassination of Suleimani and wishing mercy on the martyrs \u201cwho had a role in fighting Isis\u201d. These statements reveal the protesters\u2019 opposition to the US actions in Iraq. But they also point to caution regarding how the pro-Iranian armed factions that operate in Iraq might react \u2013 these are groups that originally accused the protest movements of being controlled by the US embassy in Baghdad.</p> <p>In contrast to the sombre and mournful reaction in Iran, some of Iraq\u2019s Shia population do not seem to be upset by the killings of Suleimani and al-Muhandis. They, especially supporters of the demonstrations, may even be relieved. After all, these were the two men responsible for the brutal crackdown on demonstrations since they began in October. This repression has killed more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/world/middleeast/Iraq-protests-Iran.html\" title=\"\">500 peaceful protesters</a> and wounded more than 19,000, some of whom now live with permanent disabilities.</p> <p>Abdul Mahdi, an intellectual who is fluent in French, ran a government that was a front for militia forces, which operate in the shadows, disregarding laws and customs. This was not a successful recipe for putting the interests of the Iraqi people first.

      "bodyText": "For those of us in Iraq who get the latest news from WhatsApp groups, the dawn of 3 January was filled with apprehension and fear. It felt like the huge events of the recent past: the night of the declaration of war in 2003, the news of Saddam Hussein\u2019s arrest, the day of his execution, or the day the Iraqi military collapsed in the face of Islamic State\u2019s occupation of Mosul. To this list we can now add: the day the Americans killed General Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Iranian Quds force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy chief of the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU), an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias. Everyone had heard the news before the sun had even risen, with horrific images circulating of the remains of the dead bodies. Some speculated that the two most influential men in Iraq had been returning to Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone to increase the pressure on parliament and the president to approve a new prime minister. Iraq has had a caretaker government since the autumn resignation of Adel Abdul Mahdi, in the wake of protests \u2013 over the economy and corruption \u2013 led by the young and poor. The purpose of this pressure would have been to appoint a pro-Iranian figure who essentially carried on the policies of Abdul Mahdi \u2013 himself accused by the Iraqi protesters of being an Iranian pawn. As a friend wrote to me, in an ironic message on WhatsApp that, out of fear, he did not post to Facebook: \u201cThe American bombing is not an attack on Iraqi sovereignty, but Iranian sovereignty. For sadly, there is no Iraqi sovereignty.\u201d Ever since the start of operations to liberate areas under Isis control in the autumn of 2014, for which the Americans and Iranians acted in an effective alliance, it\u2019s been an open secret that Iraq\u2019s political scene has been completely captured by Iran. To a certain extent, this has been with the tacit acceptance of the Americans; and just as the Iranians have come to treat Iraq as a mere protectorate, so, too, has Washington. It treats Iraq as a land where it can do whatever it likes, from targeting warehouses arming the PMU last summer, and striking the Iraqi Hezbollah militia in the city of Qaim on the Iraqi-Syrian border, to the recent airstrikes. These were all unilateral acts that were not coordinated with the Iraqi security authorities, and the Iraqi government was not aware of them until hours beforehand or even afterwards. This persistent violation of sovereignty helped drive the Iraqi parliament\u2019s resolution on Sunday, ordering all foreign troops out of the country. After the attack, the protesters in Baghdad and other cities issued statements condemning the US assassination of Suleimani and wishing mercy on the martyrs \u201cwho had a role in fighting Isis\u201d. These statements reveal the protesters\u2019 opposition to the US actions in Iraq. But they also point to caution regarding how the pro-Iranian armed factions that operate in Iraq might react \u2013 these are groups that originally accused the protest movements of being controlled by the US embassy in Baghdad. In contrast to the sombre and mournful reaction in Iran, some of Iraq\u2019s Shia population do not seem to be upset by the killings of Suleimani and al-Muhandis. They, especially supporters of the demonstrations, may even be relieved. After all, these were the two men responsible for the brutal crackdown on demonstrations since they began in October. This repression has killed more than 500 peaceful protesters and wounded more than 19,000, some of whom now live with permanent disabilities. Abdul Mahdi, an intellectual who is fluent in French, ran a government that was a front for militia forces, which operate in the shadows, disregarding laws and customs. This was not a successful recipe for putting the interests of the Iraqi people first. The government has turned Iraq into a stage for regional geopolitics, rather than meeting the pressing needs of Iraqis for better public services and economic development, as well as integrating the post-2003 generation \u2013 who are now in search of work \u2013 into society. When these people took to the streets last September, Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government responded with water cannon that fired scalding water. It removed the makeshift markets that the poor Shia neighbourhoods depend on. This fuelled widespread anger and further helped push hundreds of thousands of young people into the streets. This was not at the instigation of the US or others but because of the government\u2019s clumsy actions; and instead of the government taking these protests seriously, it viewed them as a US-Israeli-Gulf conspiracy against Iraq and Iran, and unleashed the militia gunmen to crush them. The government and armed factions\u2019 violent repression of Iraqi protesters was a watershed moment that completely isolated the political class from society.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops.

      "bodyText": "The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, had said it is imperative that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, but held back from endorsing the US assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad, stressing it was a decision made by the US, and not by either Nato or the coalition against Islamic State. His intervention came as the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also warned Iran that \u201cit is imperative that it return to the nuclear deal\u201d, remarks that could presage a European decision to abandon the deal if Iran does not recommit itself to its terms. Stoltenberg was speaking after he said Nato diplomats in Brussels had been briefed by video conference by US state department and Pentagon officials on their rationale for killing Suleimani. He did not specify whether the US gave any intelligence assessments to back claims made by officials in America that Suleimani was masterminding attacks on US diplomats likely to take place in the weeks or months ahead. Iranian sources have endorsed Iraqi government claims that Suleimani was in Baghdad last week to personally convey an Iranian message in response to Saudi Arabian calls for a reconciliation process. \u201cHe was on a peace mission,\u201d Iranian diplomats claimed. A similar claim had been made by the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi. Stoltenberg confirmed that Nato training operations in Iraq were being suspended due to fallout from the US strike on Suleimani, but he said he wanted them to restart as soon as possible. The Iraqi parliament has called for the removal of US troops from Iraq, but there is less clarity whether coalition forces will be allowed to continue to train the Iraqi army to fight Islamic State. Stoltenberg stressed: \u201cThe important thing now is to de-escalate and avoid further increases in tensions on the region.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are united in condemning Iran\u2019s support of a variety of different terrorist groups.

Iran has already breached many of the deal\u2019s restrictions, including on the fissile purity to which it enriches uranium, its overall stock of enriched uranium, the nature of the centrifuges with which it enriches uranium, and where it enriches uranium.

But here on a small island, friendless in its self-imposed isolation, a broken opposition party begins the painful process of pulling itself out of the ashes of catastrophic defeat.

We have an appealing showcase of much of the best of Labour: MPs of conviction, seriousness, good sense and likability. The casual observer will find the candidates saying much the same \u2013 time to learn lessons, listen to the lost voters, change without losing Labour values \u2013 all done in a show of apparent unity. A glance at Twitter shows the party has been split, rawly exposed in the failed 2016 coup against Corbyn, left v right, leave v remain, Momentum v ordinary members, backroom fixers v the rest. But the shock of the election may have delivered the party a salutary dose of electroconvulsive therapy. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/01/02/keir-starmer-comfortably-leads-labour-leader-race\" title=\"\">YouGov\u2019s poll of members</a> astounded many by having Keir Starmer beating Rebecca Long-Bailey by 61% to 39%, assuming a runoff between the two. Unexpected unity is suddenly within grasp.</p> \n<p>Until that poll, many proclaimed the new leader must be a northern woman, definitely no Londoner. True, it\u2019s high time Labour had a female leader, but gender doesn\u2019t trump every other desirable quality: Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher did their parties proud, but not Theresa May or Jo Swinson. Northern? Boris Johnson, demolisher of the \u201cred wall\u201d, had barely ventured north of Slough, where he was educated, more at home in Mustique than Middlesbrough.</p> \n<p>While Labour candidates compete for the inverted snobbery of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue7wM0QC5LE\" title=\"\">born-in-a-shoebox</a> prize, most have good working-class upbringings. So what? Johnson\u2019s silver spoon hindered him not a jot. The lesson is that he appealed to every class and sector \u2013 slightly more to C2DEs than ABC1s. It\u2019s not where the leader comes from but what they seem to stand for in the public imagination.</p> \n<p>The public can be badly wrong \u2013 but winning requires nationwide success, not narrow segmentation targeting particular voters. Lisa Nandy\u2019s plea for northern towns is full of excellent local campaigning plans, but a countrywide vision is what wins. Or, in Johnson\u2019s case, a better feint at a vision than the other party.</p> \n<p>It may take finely tuned ears to spot the subtle nuances between candidates\u2019 messages, so take the advice of Herbert Morrison (Peter Mandelson\u2019s grandfather): \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what\u2019s in the motion, lad, just tell me who\u2019s backing it.\u201d Look behind the candidates to see their promoters and Phillips has captured those on the right who, like her, have been most fearless in speaking out truthfully against Corbyn when electoral disaster beckoned \u2013 Neil Coyle, Wes Streeting, Margaret Hodge.</p> \n<p>Nothing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\" title=\"\">Long-Bailey\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\" title=\"\">pitch</a>, as set out in these pages, marks her out as especially far left, with her talk of \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d and no mention of socialism. An impeccable working-class girl made good who became a solicitor by her own efforts, Long-Bailey\u2019s problem is her history and her supporters. When hoisted into her seat with the aid of Len McCluskey\u2019s Unite union in 2015, she immediately joined the 36 Corbyn nominators. She was rewarded with rapid promotion to the shadow cabinet, where Corbyn and McDonnell both pushed her as heir apparent.</p> \n<p>With a seat on the NEC, she has voiced no objections to a series of inside fixes, not even protesting during the antisemitism row. She voted to back Jon Lansman\u2019s failed \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d attempt to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post.

Leadership qualities come in a thousand varieties: nothing that made Johnson a winner applies to Starmer, but that\u2019s his strength, a weighty foil to the flippant showman. So far, his heft and experience set him head and shoulders above the rest of the contenders. His video outlining a life\u2019s work shows the weight of his legal battles fought and won for good causes, a man you\u2019d want on your side defending you, the one across the Commons dispatch box that the Tories most fear.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnother future is possible\u201d is his solid opener.

Someone will slip up; surprises happen. Phillips attracts venom from the left, but her warmth and spontaneity may count for more in the boredom of these meeting halls, just as Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband stole surprise victories by speaking better human than their early-favoured rivals. Other candidates may suddenly leap up to win over the febrile, election-traumatised membership.</p> \n<p>All should be made to answer these questions: will you cleanse the Augean stables of the McCluskey-dominated Labour top offices? Will you pledge to stand down if you fall into irrecoverable unpopularity? Will you prove yourself a non-tribal democrat by backing electoral reform? Have you the wit, brain and cunning to neutralise the monstrous attacks every Labour leader faces from Britain\u2019s unbridled rightwing press?

The starting gun is fired by Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC). We have an appealing showcase of much of the best of Labour: MPs of conviction, seriousness, good sense and likability. The casual observer will find the candidates saying much the same \u2013 time to learn lessons, listen to the lost voters, change without losing Labour values \u2013 all done in a show of apparent unity. A glance at Twitter shows the party has been split, rawly exposed in the failed 2016 coup against Corbyn, left v right, leave v remain, Momentum v ordinary members, backroom fixers v the rest. But the shock of the election may have delivered the party a salutary dose of electroconvulsive therapy. YouGov\u2019s poll of members astounded many by having Keir Starmer beating Rebecca Long-Bailey by 61% to 39%, assuming a runoff between the two. Unexpected unity is suddenly within grasp. Until that poll, many proclaimed the new leader must be a northern woman, definitely no Londoner. True, it\u2019s high time Labour had a female leader, but gender doesn\u2019t trump every other desirable quality: Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher did their parties proud, but not Theresa May or Jo Swinson. Northern? Boris Johnson, demolisher of the \u201cred wall\u201d, had barely ventured north of Slough, where he was educated, more at home in Mustique than Middlesbrough. While Labour candidates compete for the inverted snobbery of the born-in-a-shoebox prize, most have good working-class upbringings. So what? Johnson\u2019s silver spoon hindered him not a jot. The lesson is that he appealed to every class and sector \u2013 slightly more to C2DEs than ABC1s. It\u2019s not where the leader comes from but what they seem to stand for in the public imagination. The public can be badly wrong \u2013 but winning requires nationwide success, not narrow segmentation targeting particular voters. Lisa Nandy\u2019s plea for northern towns is full of excellent local campaigning plans, but a countrywide vision is what wins. Or, in Johnson\u2019s case, a better feint at a vision than the other party. It may take finely tuned ears to spot the subtle nuances between candidates\u2019 messages, so take the advice of Herbert Morrison (Peter Mandelson\u2019s grandfather): \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what\u2019s in the motion, lad, just tell me who\u2019s backing it.\u201d Look behind the candidates to see their promoters and Phillips has captured those on the right who, like her, have been most fearless in speaking out truthfully against Corbyn when electoral disaster beckoned \u2013 Neil Coyle, Wes Streeting, Margaret Hodge. Nothing about Long-Bailey\u2019s pitch, as set out in these pages, marks her out as especially far left, with her talk of \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d and no mention of socialism. An impeccable working-class girl made good who became a solicitor by her own efforts, Long-Bailey\u2019s problem is her history and her supporters. When hoisted into her seat with the aid of Len McCluskey\u2019s Unite union in 2015, she immediately joined the 36 Corbyn nominators. She was rewarded with rapid promotion to the shadow cabinet, where Corbyn and McDonnell both pushed her as heir apparent. With a seat on the NEC, she has voiced no objections to a series of inside fixes, not even protesting during the antisemitism row. She voted to back Jon Lansman\u2019s failed \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d attempt to abolish Tom Watson\u2019s post. Though respected for developing the excellent Green New Deal, which promised good jobs in former manufacturing zones, and though personally well-liked, that silent obedience in the face of backroom skulduggery will drag her down \u2013 as will the names of those promoting her, Lansman especially. At each outing, it gets clearer why Starmer is so far the members\u2019 favourite. Leadership qualities come in a thousand varieties: nothing that made Johnson a winner applies to Starmer, but that\u2019s his strength, a weighty foil to the flippant showman. So far, his heft and experience set him head and shoulders above the rest of the contenders. His video outlining a life\u2019s work shows the weight of his legal battles fought and won for good causes, a man you\u2019d want on your side defending you, the one across the Commons dispatch box that the Tories most fear. \u201cAnother future is possible\u201d is his solid opener. On benefits, he demands people be treated \u201cwith dignity\u201d. On Brexit he is right, the second referendum battle is lost (Phillips had to correct herself on this). The immediate battle is over the EU deal Johnson strikes. As a uniter of deadlocked left and right, Brexit and remain, it would be hard to find better than Starmer. But frontrunners are at risk, with 12 weeks ahead in some 30 hustings around the country. Someone will slip up; surprises happen. Phillips attracts venom from the left, but her warmth and spontaneity may count for more in the boredom of these meeting halls, just as Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband stole surprise victories by speaking better human than their early-favoured rivals. Other candidates may suddenly leap up to win over the febrile, election-traumatised membership. All should be made to answer these questions: will you cleanse the Augean stables of the McCluskey-dominated Labour top offices? Will you pledge to stand down if you fall into irrecoverable unpopularity? Will you prove yourself a non-tribal democrat by backing electoral reform? Have you the wit, brain and cunning to neutralise the monstrous attacks every Labour leader faces from Britain\u2019s unbridled rightwing press? Tories gloating at Labour disarray would get their own jolt of shock treatment on waking to find Starmer at the helm of an opposition back in serious business. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

The president has spent the last three years discrediting the very intelligence community that produced this intelligence.

If it has to do with Russian meddling or a determination of North Korea not to denuclearise, that\u2019s intelligence we don\u2019t like.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to bring this blog to a close now. Our US politics live blog will have all the latest fallout from the killing of Suleimani and there will be more reports and analysis on Iran page. The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has called for a \u201cdiplomatic way through\u201d the crisis. In carefully worded comments for a pooled TV interview, Raab said: I\u2019ve just come from the meeting that the prime minister chaired with key ministers and officials, and clearly our first priority is to make sure that UK national citizens, shipping, diplomatic missions and military personnel are safe. We\u2019ve changed our travel advice, we\u2019re going to be reinforcing in due course the Royal Navy protection for shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. And on the diplomatic front, our overwhelming message that the prime minister and I are conveying to our European and American counterparts, and also critically our partners in the Middle East, is the importance of deescalating the tensions and finding a diplomatic way through this crisis. I will be talking further with our European partners, our Middle Eastern partners, and I\u2019ll be traveling to the US and Canada towards the end of the week. Asked if the decision to order the killing of Suleimani was right or wrong, Raab said: General Suleimani was a regional threat. He had a track record, that was his job description. I don\u2019t think we will, as the prime minister said, lament his passing. But at the same time looking forward now, the key message that we\u2019ve got all of our European and American partners but critically, also, to the Iranians to the Iraqis, and all of those affected in the region, is the importance to defuse the tensions, to deescalate. I had a conversation with Foreign Minister Zarif this afternoon, where we conveyed that message and the importance of finding a diplomatic way through. Asked about Trump\u2019s threat to target cultural sites, Raab said: We have been clear that cultural sites are protected under international law and would expect that to be respected. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, has warned the US to \u201cnever threaten the Iranian nation\u201d. He also criticised Trump\u2019s threat to target 52 Iranian cultural sites if Tehran retaliates against the killing of Suleimani. In a tweet he urged Trump to remember the killing of 290 Iranians when a US navy ship shot down an Iranian Airbus over the Strait of Hormuz. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has demanded an end to the escalation of tensions and warned of the \u201cprofound risk of miscalculation\u201d. He did not name any countries but his warning appeared squarely aimed at the US and Iran. Speaking to reporters he said: \u201cMy message is simple and clear: stop escalation. Exercise maximum restraint. Restart dialogue. Renew international cooperation. Let us not forget the terrible human suffering caused by war.\u201d Guterres also warned that \u201cgeopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century\u201d. He added: \u201cThis cauldron of tensions is leading more and more countries to take unpredicted decisions with unpredictable consequences and a profound risk of miscalculation.\u201d The US embassy in Israel has issued a security alert warning US citizens of \u201cheightened tensions\u201d and highlighting the risk of rocket attacks. The alert, published on the embassy\u2019s website, made no mention of the killing of Suleimani. It said: \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the embassy strongly encourages US citizens to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness, as security incidents, including rocket fire, often take place without warning.\u201d Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, has told the US ambassador to Baghdad, that both countries should work together on implementing an Iraqi parliamentary resolution on the withdrawal of foreign troops. Reuters quotes a statement from Mahdi\u2019s office as saying: The prime minister stressed the importance of mutual cooperation on implementing the withdrawal of foreign troops, in line with the Iraqi parliament\u2019s resolution, and to set relations with the United States on a proper foundation. He stressed how dangerous the situation is right now and its potential consequences, adding that Iraq is doing everything it can to prevent the descent into open war.\u201d Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has announced the temporary suspension of training in Iraq after chairing a meeting in Brussels over the Iran crisis. Speaking to reporters in the Belgian capital he also distanced Nato from the US killing of Suleimani. Stoltenberg said: \u201cThis is a US decision. It is not a decision taken by the global coalition nor Nato. But all allies are concerned about Iran\u2019s destabilising activities in the region.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: Donald Trump has issued a new warning to Iran amid mounting tension between Tehran and Washington over his decision to order the killing of Qassem Suleimani last week. In an all-caps tweet the president said Iran would never have a nuclear weapon. Trump also defended his threat to target Iranian cultural sites \u2013 widely seen as a war crime \u2013 if Tehran retaliates for the killing of Suleimani. Speaking to reporters he said: \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Unesco has reminded the US that it has signed treaties committing it not to harm cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict Two senior Senate Democrats, Chuck Shumer and Robert Menendz, have called on Trump to immediately declassify the administrations reasoning for the strike on Suleimani. The former national intelligence director James Clapper made a similar call and cast doubt on the administration\u2019s claim that Suleimani posed a direct threat to US lives. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly wept while presiding over a vast public funeral procession in Tehran for Suleimani. Khamenei\u2019s voice cracked with emotion as he recited prayers over the coffin of Suleimani and others killed in the attack. Police in Tehran said millions of mourners gathered in the Iranian capital. Observers said they were the largest crowds in Tehran since the funeral in 1989 of Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said the scale of the crowds was a signal to Donald Trump that the US could not break the will of the Iranian people. Zarif also predicted the end of the \u201cmalign US presence\u201d in the region. Suleimani\u2019s daughter, Zeinab, told mourners that the US can expect revenge. She said: \u201cAmerica and Zionism should know that my father\u2019s martyrdom will lead to awakening \u2026 in the resistance front and bring about a dark day for them and flatten their homes.\u201d Diplomats across the world have called for calm and implicitly criticised the US in the wake of the killing of Suleimani. The foreign minister of Germany described a threat by Donald Trump to impose sanctions on Iraq if it withdrew US troops as \u201cnot very helpful\u201d. China said it believes Iran was forced to reduce its commitment to the nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia said tensions in the regions were at a \u201cvery dangerous moment\u201d. EU foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Iran in Brussels on Friday. Downing Street has said targeting cultural sites in Iran, as Trump has suggested, would breach international warfare conventions. Responding to Trump\u2019s latest comments, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said there were \u201cinternational conventions in place that prevent the destruction of cultural heritage\u201d. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is to travel to Russia this week for talks with Vladimir Putin about the crisis. She is due to visit Moscow on Saturday at the invitation of Putin, the Kremlin said. Oil prices have climbed above $70 a barrel for the first time in eight months amid fears that the US airstrike may trigger a retaliation. The attack has sent shockwaves through global markets, causing equity indices in Asia, the US and Europe to slump while the benchmark price of Brent crude climbed to its highest level since May last year. The husband of the jailed British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has criticised the killing of Suleimani, saying it is hard to demand Iran complies with the rule of law if its adversaries play fast and loose with the same law. Richard Ratcliffe again urged Johnson, the British prime minister, to find time to meet him to discuss his wife\u2019s plight. A YouGov poll for HuffPost suggests some US public backing for the killing of Suleimani. It found 43% approved of the action compared with 38% who disapproved. But between 43% to 35% said Trump did not plan carefully enough before ordering the strike. Josep Borrell, who started work as the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief last month, has invited the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, for separate talks after a phone call over the weekend. \u201cIt is up to the Iranian side to take up the invitation and proceed. I understand that there is interest on both sides to continue the mutual engagement,\u201d a spokesman for Borrell said, when asked if the meeting would go ahead. Even as commentators were reading the last rites for the Iran nuclear deal, the EU is seeking to keep alive the agreement it helped secure in 2015. In a tweet Borrell said he deeply regretted Iran\u2019s latest announcement on the deal, adding: \u201cFull implementation of nuclear deal by all is now more important than ever, for regional stability and global security. I will continue working with all participants on way forward.\u201d The EU said it would continue to rely on the verdict of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has responsibility for monitoring Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear deal. EU foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Iran in Brussels on Friday, two diplomats have told Reuters. Earlier Boris Johnson, Emanuel Macron, and Angela Merkel issued a joint statement calling for deescalation of the crisis. It said: We have condemned the recent attacks on coalitions forces in Iraq and are gravely concerned by the negative role Iran has played in the region, including through the IRGC and the Al-Quds force under the command of General Suleimani. There is now an urgent need for de-escalation. We call on all parties to exercise utmost restraint and responsibility. The current cycle of violence in Iraq must be stopped. We specifically call on Iran to refrain from further violent action or proliferation, and urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the JCPOA. We recall our attachment to the sovereignty and security of Iraq. Another crisis risks jeopardising years of efforts to stabilise Iraq. We also reaffirm our commitment to continue the fight against Daesh, which remains a high priority. The preservation of the Coalition is key in this regard. We therefore urge the Iraqi authorities to continue providing the Coalition all the necessary support. We stand ready to continue our engagement with all sides in order to contribute to defuse tensions and restore stability to the region. Donald Trump\u2019s threat to destroy the sites of ancient Persia should send a shiver down the spine of any civilised person. How can anything justify American bombing of Persepolis or the mosques of Isfahan? Only the demented can see them as \u201cthreatening America\u201d. It is on the same ethical plane as the Islamic State vandalism of Palmyra and Mosul. Hundreds of Yemenis have taken part in a protest in Sana\u2019a called by Tehran-backed Huthi rebels to vent anger over the US assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Suleimani, AFP reports. \u201cWe come together with free men around the world to face down the American Satan,\u201d an announcer told the crowd at the Bab al-Yaman entrance to the capital\u2019s Old City. The demonstrators cried: \u201cDeath to America\u201d and waved banners calling for a boycott of US and Israeli products, in images broadcast by the Huthis\u2019 Al-Masirah television. Huthi official Dhaifallah al-Shami addressed the crowd under giant portraits of Suleimani and top Iraqi military figure Mahdi al-Muhandis, both killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad last Friday. \u201cThe blood of the martyrs Suleimani and Muhandis is not just Iranian or Iraqi but belongs to the Muslim community and to free men around the world,\u201d he said. The Huthis have called for swift reprisals for the killings. A statement from Huthi authorities read out to the crowd said it was \u201ctime for the Americans and Zionists to pack their bags\u201d and leave the region. The rebels are locked in a five-year conflict with a Saudi-led military coalition. It was unclear if the Huthi call for reprisals was also directed at Riyadh, which has stepped up efforts to end Yemen\u2019s conflict amid a lull in Huthi attacks on the kingdom. Donald Trump\u2019s capslock diplomacy continues: Unesco has reminded the US that it has signed treaties committing it not to harm cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict, after Donald Trump stood by his threat to go after Iranian cultural sites, warning of a \u201cmajor retaliation\u201d if Iran strikes back for the killing of Suleimani. The UN cultural body said that under provisions of the 1954 and 1972 conventions \u2013 which have been ratified by both the US and Iran \u2013 signatory states undertake not to take any deliberate measures which might damage cultural and natural heritage on the territory of other states party to those conventions. Downing Street has released a readout of a phone call between Boris Johnson and the prime minister of Iraq, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, about the crisis. It said: \u201cThe leaders discussed the need to de-escalate tensions in the region following the death of Qassem Suleimani and agreed to work together to find a diplomatic way forward. \u201cThe prime minister underlined the UK\u2019s unwavering commitment to Iraq\u2019s stability and sovereignty and emphasised the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh.\u201d This suggests that the UK is trying to persuade Baghdad not to expel US troops from Iraq as its parliament has vowed. Two senior Senate Democrats have called on Trump to immediately declassify the administrations reasoning for the strike on Suleimani, as suggested by former national intelligence director James Clapper (see earlier). In a letter to Trump the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and a Senate foreigns relation committee member, Robert Menendez, said the White House\u2019s classified notification sent to Congress late on Saturday under the War Powers Act was insufficient and inappropriate. \u201cIt is critical that national security matters of such import be shared with the American people in a timely manner,\u201d they wrote. Late on Sunday, the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said the House would introduce and vote this week on a war powers resolution to limit the president\u2019s military actions regarding Iran. In a letter to House Democrats, Pelosi called the airstrike provocative and disproportionate and said it had endangered US service members, diplomats and others by risking a serious escalation of tensions with Iran. A similar resolution was introduced in the Senate. Iran\u2019s UK ambassador, Hamid Baeidinejad, has condemned Trump\u2019s threat to target Iran\u2019s cultural sites if there it retaliating against Suleiman\u2019s killing. Retweeting criticism of Trump\u2019s comments by Tristram Hunt, the director of the V&amp;A museum, Baeidinejad said Trump threat was a disturbing step towards his goal of war. Donald Trump has defended his threat to target Iranian cultural sites \u2013 widely seen as a war crime \u2013 if Tehran retaliates for the killing of Suleimani. On bellicose form, the US president also lashed out at Iraq following its parliament\u2019s demand for American troops to be expelled from that country, and vowed to respond with crippling sanctions. Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One a day later, he sought to offer a justification for threat he tweeted on Saturday. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to kill our people,\u201d Trump said, according to a pool report. \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry says it sees no threat of nuclear weapons proliferation after Iran\u2019s decision to abandon limitations on enriching uranium, Reuters reports. The ministry said that Russia remained fully committed to the Iran nuclear deal Iran announced on Sunday that it would lift limitations on uranium enrichment, taking a further step back from commitments to a 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers, but said it would continue to cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog. Here\u2019s a summary of events so far: Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly wept presiding over a vast public funeral procession in Tehran for Qassem Suleimani. Khamenei\u2019s voice cracked with emotion as he recited prayers over the coffin of Suleimani and others killed in the attack, amid raised tensions between Tehran and Washington. Police in Tehran said millions of mourners gathered in the Iranian capital. Observers said they were the largest crowds in Tehran since the funeral in 1989 of Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said the the scale of the crowds were a signal to Donald Trump that the US could not break the will of the Iranian people. Zarif also predicted the end of the \u201cmalign US presence\u201d in the region. Suleimani\u2019s daughter, Zeinab, told mourners that the US can expect revenge. She said: \u201cAmerica and Zionism should know that my father\u2019s martyrdom will lead to awakening \u2026 in the resistance front and bring about a dark day for them and flatten their homes.\u201d Diplomats across the world have called for calm and implicitly criticised the US in the wake of the killing of Suleimani. The foreign minister of Germany described a threat by Donald Trump to impose sanctions on Iraq if it withdrew US troops as \u201cnot very helpful\u201d. China said it believes Iran was forced to reduce its commitment to the nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia said tensions in the regions were at a \u201cvery dangerous moment.\u201d Downing Street has said targeting cultural sites in Iran, as Trump has suggested, would breach international warfare conventions. Responding to Trump\u2019s latest comments, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said there were \u201cinternational conventions in place that prevent the destruction of cultural heritage\u201d. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is to travel to Russia this week for talks with Vladimir Putin about the crisis. She is due to visit Moscow on Saturday at the invitation of Putin, the Kremlin said. Oil prices have climbed above $70 a barrel for the first time in eight months amid fears that the US airstrike may trigger a retaliation. The attack has sent shockwaves through global markets, causing equity indices in Asia, the US and Europe to slump while the benchmark price of Brent crude climbed to its highest level since May last year. The husband of the jailed British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has criticised the killing of Suleimani, saying it is hard to demand Iran complies with the rule of law if its adversaries play fast and loose with the same law. Richard Ratcliffe again urged Johnson, the British prime minister, to find time to meet him to discuss his wife\u2019s plight. Downing Street has said targeting cultural sites in Iran would breach international warfare conventions in an implicit rebuke to Donald Trump for threatening to bomb protected heritage sites. Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman refused to criticise Trump directly but made clear the UK government would not support such a course of action, after the US president said he could target 52 Iranian sites if Iran retaliated over the assassination of Qassem Suleimani \u2013 \u201csome at a very high level and important to Iran and the Iranian culture\u201d. Responding to Trump\u2019s latest comments, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said there were \u201cinternational conventions in place that prevent the destruction of cultural heritage\u201d, implying the UK does not believe such threats would be carried out. Helicopter video footage released by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards-affiliated Fars news agency shows the scale of the crowds in Tehran. Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s regional rival and a key ally of the US, has called for calm. Its foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, said the kingdom does not want to see further escalation of tensions in the region at a \u201cvery dangerous moment\u201d. Speaking at press briefing in Riyadh, Reuters quoted him saying: \u201cWe are very keen that the situation in the region doesn\u2019t escalate any further. It\u2019s certainly a very dangerous moment and we have to be conscious of the risks and dangers not just to the region but to wider global security. \u201cWe hope that all actors take all the steps necessary to prevent any further escalation and any provocation.\u201d The Iranian ambassador to the UK is to complain formally about a frontpage article in the Times claiming that Iranian generals are prepared to kill British troops in response to the assassination of Qassem Suleimani. Hamid Baeidinejad said he strongly condemned \u201cthe vicious lie and provocative news by #Times today\u201d. He added on Twitter: \u201cI will ask the concerned UK authorities to take swift action to stop such malicious false propaganda in this very sensitive time.\u201d The story was headlined \u201cWe will kill UK troops, warns Iran\u201d. Although the embassy frequently takes issue with the slant of specific stories in the British press, including what it feels is anti-Iranian bias, it is rare for the ambassador to threaten a formal complaint. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, asked Trump: \u201cHave you EVER seen such a sea of humanity in your life?\u201d Zarif predicted the end of what he called the \u201cmalign US presence\u201d in the region. Observers say the scale of the crowds in Tehran are \u201castonishing\u201d. Downing Street has urged the Iraqi government to allow foreign troops to remain in the country to fight against the threat posed by Islamic State. In the wake of the killing of Suleimani and a Iraqi militia leader in the US drone attack, Iraq\u2019s parliament voted to expel US troops. The PM\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe coalition is in Iraq to protect Iraqis and others from the threat from Daesh at the request of the Iraqi government. We urge the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition is able to continue our vital work countering this shared threat. \u201cThe foreign secretary spoke to the Iraqi president and prime minister this weekend. \u201cThe prime minister is speaking with his Iraqi counterpart today and our ambassador in Baghdad is in touch with political leaders in Iraq to emphasise these points and urge them to ensure we can keep fighting this threat together.\u201d James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, has expressed doubts about the Trump administration\u2019s claim that Suleimani posed a direct threat to US lives. Speaking to CNN, Clapper said: \u201cSuleimani himself didn\u2019t plant IEDs. He didn\u2019t himself launch rocket attacks against American personel or facilities. So to me it is a bit of a stretch that by doing this they thwarted an imminent attack. Typically under Suleimani attacks were carried out by proxies, that is Shia militia in Iraq.\u201d Clapper also said the Trump administration was facing a problem of trust by appearing to pick and chose the intelligence it believes. He said: There is a credibility issue here in general. The president has spent the last three years discrediting the very intelligence community that produced this intelligence. There is a history that people should remember about 17 years ago when the administration made assurances about intelligences pertaining to Iraq which of course was the occasion for an invasion. So scepticism is in order her. The discrediting of the intelligence community is going to come back to haunt and this may be a case in point. If it has to do with Russian meddling or a determination of North Korea not to denuclearise, that\u2019s intelligence we don\u2019t like. But if we have intelligence we do like, that supports our position then it\u2019s ok. There a bit of a credibility challenge here for the administration. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, has claimed there was \u201cvery solid\u201d intelligence that Suleimani was travelling around the region to plan an attack against troops. \u201cWe knew he was in the process of planning these attacks and we acted to defend American lives,\u201d O\u2019Brien told Fox News. Clapper said he could not believe such assurances without seeing the intelligence on which they were based. He suggested Trump may have to publish any intelligence showing Suliemani posed a threat to US lives. Clapper said: \u201cThe president has indicated he might declassify the intelligence, and in this case the occasion may call for it. The two intelligence oversight committees in the Senate and the House certainly are entitled to the same intelligence information and to my knowledge they have not been exposed to it.\u201d Downing Street has insisted Britain\u2019s security partnership with the US remains \u201cvery close\u201d despite Donald Trump not informing the UK of its plans to assassinate Suleimani, PA reports. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cWe have a very close security partnership with the United States, we are in regular dialogue at every level.\u201d Asked if Johnson was convinced the US drone strike was legal, the spokesman said: \u201cStates have a right to take action such as this in self defence and the US have been clear that Suleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats and military personnel.\u201d Johnson spoke to the Iraqi prime minister on Monday morning, the spokesman said. The scale of the crowds mourning Suleimani in Tehran are was the biggest since the 1989 funeral for the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, according to Reuters. Crowds chanted: \u201cDeath to America\u201d. One poster held by a mourner read: \u201cIt is our right to seek a harsh revenge,\u201d echoing comments by Iranian military and political leaders. The death of the general, widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran after Khamenei, has prompted a rare public display of unity at home after deadly anti-government protests in November and before parliamentary elections in February. \u201cThe martyrdom of Suleimani is for sure a turning point for the establishment, at home and abroad. His death, at least for now, has united Iran,\u201d a former senior pro-reform Iranian official told Reuters. The coffins of Suleimani and the Iraqi militia leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was also killed in Friday\u2019s attack, were draped in their national flags and passed from hand to hand across the heads of mourners in central Tehran. The funeral ceremonies will culminate with Suleimani\u2019s burial in his home city of Kerman, in southern Iran. Traditionally, Muslims are buried swiftly after their death, often the same day. But Suleimani\u2019s body has first been taken to cities in Iraq, where Iran has vied with the Washington for influence since the 2003 US invasion, before being carried around Iran. \u201cAmerica and Zionism should know that my father\u2019s martyrdom will lead to awakening ... in the resistance front and bring about a dark day for them and flatten their homes,\u201d Zeinab Suleimani, the commander\u2019s daughter, told mourners. Iran usually refers to Israel as the Zionist state and describes regional countries and other forces opposed to Israel and the United States as a \u201cresistance\u201d front. \u201cCrazy Trump, don\u2019t think that everything is over with my father\u2019s martyrdom,\u201d she said in the televised address. Ismail Haniyeh, leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, told the ceremony: \u201cResistance against the Zionist project on the land of Palestine will not stop, and resistance against the American dominance will not be broken.\u201d Haniyeh was on his first trip to Iran since becoming leader of the group in 2017. Here\u2019s video of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollha Ali Khamenei, crying over Suleimani\u2019s coffin. Police in Tehran say \u201cmillions\u201d of people have gathered in Tehran to mourn the death of Suleimani, Reuters reports. Soleimani\u2019s daughter, Zeinab, directly threatened an attack on the US military in the Mideast while speaking to a crowd that stretched as far as the eye could see in Iran\u2019s capital. \u201cThe families of the American soldiers in western Asia ... will spend their days waiting for the death of their children,\u201d she said to cheers. Iranian state television and others online shared a video that showed Trump\u2019s American flag tweet following Soleimani\u2019s killing turn into a coffin, the likes of the tweet replaced by over 143,000 \u201ckilled\u201d with the hashtag #severerevenge. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself prayed over the caskets of Soleimani and others slain in the attack. Khamenei, who had a close relationship with Soleimani, wept at one point during the traditional Muslim prayers for the dead. The crowd wailed. Soleimani\u2019s successor, Esmail Ghaani stood near Khamenei\u2019s side, as did Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other top leaders in the Islamic Republic. Soleimani\u2019s mass processionals has seen politicians and leaders across the Islamic Republic\u2019s political spectrum take part, temporarily silencing that anger. Ghaani, a longtime Soleimani deputy, has now taken over as the head of the Revolutionary Guard\u2019s Quds Force, an expeditionary arm of the paramilitary organisation answerable only to Khamenei. Germany has described Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose sanctions on Iraq if Baghdad expels US troops as \u201cnot very helpful\u201d. Speaking to German radio, the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can convince Iraq with threats, but with arguments.\u201d Maas also warned that long term efforts to rebuild Iraq \u201ccould all be lost\u201d if the situation escalates. Iraq\u2019s parliament demanded American troops leave after the drone attack on Suliemani which also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a senior Iraqi militia commander. In response Trump said Iraq would facing crippling sanctions if it carried out the expulsion. Speaking to reporter on Air Force One Trump said: \u201cIf they do ask us to leave, if we don\u2019t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they\u2019ve never seen before ever. It\u2019ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.\u201d Maas admitted that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had hoped for more full-throated backing from allies. \u201cApparently he wasn\u2019t too happy that we didn\u2019t 100% support America\u2019s actions,\u201d Maas said after Pompeo spoke by phone with his German, French and British counterparts. Maas said it was important that the European Union presented a united stance so it could play a meaningful role in helping to cool tempers. \u201cOur own security interests are massively affected by the fight in Iraq against international terrorism, against IS, so we have a responsibility here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s necessary that the EU foreign ministers quickly convene in Brussels to coordinate a European position.\u201d He also said Germany, France and Britain would decide this week how to react to Iran\u2019s decision to forego the limit on enrichment it had pledged to honour in the nuclear agreement. \u201cWe can\u2019t just accept this without responding,\u201d Maas said. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t make things easier and it could be the first step towards the end of the deal and that would be a great loss.\u201d China is siding with Iran in the wake Suliemani\u2019s killing and has condemned the US. Its foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Beijing believes Iran was \u201cforced\u201d to reduce its commitment to the nuclear deal. He added that \u201crecent military adventures by the US violated the basic norms governing international relations.\u201d On Sunday Iran announced that it will no longer abide by any of the limits imposed by the unravelling 2015 nuclear deal following the US military intervention. Shuang added that \u201cthere is no way out by military means, and extreme pressure will not work.\u201d He said \u201cpower politics is unpopular and unsustainable.\u201d China is among the countries that signed the nuclear deal. Shuang added that Iran has demonstrated restraint under the agreement and did not violate its obligations. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, will travel to Russia later this week for talks with Vladimir Putin about the Middle East crisis following Suliemani\u2019s killing, Reuters reports. The Kremlin said Merkel will travel to Russia on Saturday at Putin\u2019s invitation and that the two leaders also plan to discuss the situations in Syria, Libya and Ukraine. Welcome to live coverage of the fallout from the death of Qassem Suleimani, the Iranian general killed in a US drone strike on Friday. So far today huge crowds have brought central Tehran to a standstill as mourners flooded the Iranian capital to pay a homage to Suleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 powerful Quds Force. The country\u2019s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly wept as he led prayers for Suleimani, who was one of Iran\u2019s most popular public figures. Late on Sunday, Donald Trump defended his threat to target Iranian cultural sites if Tehran retaliates for the killing of Suleimani. The US president also lashed out at Iraq following its parliament\u2019s demand for American troops to be expelled from that country, and vowed to respond with crippling sanctions. Over the weekend the Trump administration scrambled to justify its claim that the killing of Iran\u2019s most powerful general was about stopping a war rather than starting one, as tensions spiralled by the hour. Later on Monday Nato ambassadors will meet at their Brussels headquarters to discuss the killing, surprised many of Washington\u2019s allies and triggered calls for de-escalation.",

      "body": "<p>President Donald Trump\u2019s new year message, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1213593975732527112\">posted on Twitter</a> in the wake of the US killing of Qassem Suleimani, was unequivocal: \u201cLet this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites \u2026 some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s little room for doubt: the president is threatening to destroy cultural heritage, which constitutes a war crime according to several international laws that the US has both sponsored and signed. These include the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 2017 United Nations Security Council resolution 2347, which \u201ccondemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artefacts, and the looting and smuggling of cultural property from archaeological sites, museums, libraries, archives, and other sites, notably by terrorist groups\u201d.</p> <p>The description of Iran\u2019s most valuable cultural sites fall under such regulations, which were first created in the aftermath of the second world war, a time in which both sides lost invaluable buildings, artworks and cultural practices, mostly due to technological advancement in the means of warfare. Fears of future wars with widespread use of aerial bombardment, even nuclear warfare, were so great that one of the nascent UN\u2019s imperatives was to protect not only people from indiscriminate destruction, but the spaces where their livelihoods were carried out as well. This is how current shorthand terminologies such as Unesco world heritage sites were coined: not as a list of beautiful and valuable sites to be visited or seen, but as an inventory of spaces where war could under no circumstances be waged.</p> <p>With conflicts ongoing today that extend even longer distances between attacker and target, these legislations demand obedience by their signatories more than ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27a29934b560e81b05c06688d91541896af3581e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27a29934b560e81b05c06688d91541896af3581e/0_682_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Islamic State destroyed the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Islamic State destroyed the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth MacLean for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the wake of the 2001 Taliban destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan and Islamic State\u2019s 2015 laying to waste of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/inside-palmyra-syria-after-second-isis-islamic-state-occupation\">the ancient site of Palmyra</a>, we have become much more aware of the fragility of cultural heritage. The global outcry after the accidental fire which last summer consumed Notre Dame Cathedral was also loud: the feeling that treasures of the past are slipping away from our protection is one of the marks of contemporary culture. However, it is worth remembering that the construction of the Taliban and Isis as barbaric enemies makes it far easier for the public to denounce these events as war crimes.</p> <p>Iran is a widely misunderstood nation, partly because access to it has been restricted since the 1979 Iranian revolution, but mostly because cold war-era western politics coated the country with a communist veneer, shrouding it as a barbaric land, a perception which persists to this day. Its regime, non-secular and repressive, has bolstered its negative reputation recently as it has allegedly murdered more than 1,500 activists in the past three months amid an internet blackout.

      "bodyText": "President Donald Trump\u2019s new year message, posted on Twitter in the wake of the US killing of Qassem Suleimani, was unequivocal: \u201cLet this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites \u2026 some at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.\u201d There\u2019s little room for doubt: the president is threatening to destroy cultural heritage, which constitutes a war crime according to several international laws that the US has both sponsored and signed. These include the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 2017 United Nations Security Council resolution 2347, which \u201ccondemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage, including the destruction of religious sites and artefacts, and the looting and smuggling of cultural property from archaeological sites, museums, libraries, archives, and other sites, notably by terrorist groups\u201d. The description of Iran\u2019s most valuable cultural sites fall under such regulations, which were first created in the aftermath of the second world war, a time in which both sides lost invaluable buildings, artworks and cultural practices, mostly due to technological advancement in the means of warfare. Fears of future wars with widespread use of aerial bombardment, even nuclear warfare, were so great that one of the nascent UN\u2019s imperatives was to protect not only people from indiscriminate destruction, but the spaces where their livelihoods were carried out as well. This is how current shorthand terminologies such as Unesco world heritage sites were coined: not as a list of beautiful and valuable sites to be visited or seen, but as an inventory of spaces where war could under no circumstances be waged. With conflicts ongoing today that extend even longer distances between attacker and target, these legislations demand obedience by their signatories more than ever. In the wake of the 2001 Taliban destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan and Islamic State\u2019s 2015 laying to waste of the ancient site of Palmyra, we have become much more aware of the fragility of cultural heritage. The global outcry after the accidental fire which last summer consumed Notre Dame Cathedral was also loud: the feeling that treasures of the past are slipping away from our protection is one of the marks of contemporary culture. However, it is worth remembering that the construction of the Taliban and Isis as barbaric enemies makes it far easier for the public to denounce these events as war crimes. Iran is a widely misunderstood nation, partly because access to it has been restricted since the 1979 Iranian revolution, but mostly because cold war-era western politics coated the country with a communist veneer, shrouding it as a barbaric land, a perception which persists to this day. Its regime, non-secular and repressive, has bolstered its negative reputation recently as it has allegedly murdered more than 1,500 activists in the past three months amid an internet blackout. In this context, Iran is often viewed as a cultural void rather than the birthplace of the Persian empire and of great achievements in the arts and sciences. Currently, 24 sites in Iran are protected by Unesco: Persepolis, one of the last massive archaeological complexes from ancient Persia, protected by Iranian institutions; the Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan with its breathtaking mosques and architecture that unifies engineering, religious symbolism and material mastery; the historic city of Yazd, the quintessential landscape from which we get all our fantastical ancient Middle Eastern references to Arabian nights. Additionally, as of August 2016, 50 more sites in Iran are on Unesco\u2019s tentative list, awaiting ratification. As we contemplate this collection of architectural treasures, we must understand that these places do not exist apart from those who live, love, laugh and pray within and throughout them: Iranians understand their value better than anyone and have set up commendable efforts to preserve, restore and share them. We therefore cannot separate the sites\u2019 worth from their people. Any unjustified harm that comes to Iranians, or weakens their institutions, will inevitably place these sites at risk of damage, a pattern we should have learned from Palmyra, and from Mosul after the irreparable damage to artefacts held in the museum there. Even though Unesco has set forth the foundations for the absolute protection of priceless buildings, we have yet to better understand the relationship between humans and their environment that produces culture. In light of the Trump administration quitting Unesco in 2019, the president\u2019s threats to Iran\u2019s cultural heritage must not be taken lightly. We should all know well what could be lost forever.",

His somewhat uncritical dismissal of objections to privilege, wealth and prestige being ascribed on the basis of accident of birth, would, I suggest, sit uncomfortably with his Christian faith. It is worth noting that the rich young man in Matthew 19 was told to \u201cgo sell your belongings and give to the poor\u201d.</p> <p>But it is Coles\u2019 last paragraph that ultimately subverts his own argument: \u201cin an era of growing anxiety, and even more menace, the monarchy here, like other monarchies in other places, could be the best defence against the rise of tyrants\u201d.

Surely the recent attempt to prorogue parliament illustrated how our constitutional monarch, far from being a bulwark against tyranny, was an agent of it, albeit unwittingly.</p> <p>What I believe Coles\u2019 all-too-easy conversion has done is show once more, that if the Church of England is to ever be in the vanguard, rather than the guard\u2019s van, it needs to be disestablished \u2013 now.<br><strong>Rev David Black</strong><br><em>Tilston, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I became a monarchist in 1977.

When our town celebrated the bicentenary of the granting of its charter she came to collect \u201cthe good Scots penny\u201d the monarch was promised in the charter. She had done her homework about the town, spent the day with us, unveiled two commemorative plaques, opened the refurbished Scout hall and had a buffet lunch at which she spoke to everybody in a very relaxed manner.</p> <p>Having her mother as our monarch enables us to rely on such a steady, non-political figurehead that many countries must envy. Most of the royal family are worth every penny for all that they do \u2013 and I would not begrudge the relatively small amount it costs us for their presence, whereas I\u2019d pay plenty to lose a \u201cruler\u201d like Trump.<br><strong>Helen Keating</strong><br><em>Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "I was disappointed to read that Richard Coles is now a born-again monarchist (How Princess Anne made me a monarchist, Journal, 1 January). His somewhat uncritical dismissal of objections to privilege, wealth and prestige being ascribed on the basis of accident of birth, would, I suggest, sit uncomfortably with his Christian faith. It is worth noting that the rich young man in Matthew 19 was told to \u201cgo sell your belongings and give to the poor\u201d. But it is Coles\u2019 last paragraph that ultimately subverts his own argument: \u201cin an era of growing anxiety, and even more menace, the monarchy here, like other monarchies in other places, could be the best defence against the rise of tyrants\u201d. Really? Surely the recent attempt to prorogue parliament illustrated how our constitutional monarch, far from being a bulwark against tyranny, was an agent of it, albeit unwittingly. What I believe Coles\u2019 all-too-easy conversion has done is show once more, that if the Church of England is to ever be in the vanguard, rather than the guard\u2019s van, it needs to be disestablished \u2013 now. Rev David Black Tilston, Cheshire \u2022 I became a monarchist in 1977. Not only was I living in Germany and surrounded by a nation that deeply envied us for our monarchy, but I picked up how the silver jubilee was important for so many British people of all ages and backgrounds. When there was controversy over Kurt Waldheim\u2019s suitability for the Austrian presidency, my feelings were reinforced. And in 2020, were we to abolish the monarchy, whom could we all unite behind as a possible president? Thank you for publishing Richard Coles\u2019 thoughts. David Jones Spalding, Lincolnshire \u2022 Richard Coles is absolutely right about Princess Anne and the monarchy. When our town celebrated the bicentenary of the granting of its charter she came to collect \u201cthe good Scots penny\u201d the monarch was promised in the charter. She had done her homework about the town, spent the day with us, unveiled two commemorative plaques, opened the refurbished Scout hall and had a buffet lunch at which she spoke to everybody in a very relaxed manner. Having her mother as our monarch enables us to rely on such a steady, non-political figurehead that many countries must envy. Most of the royal family are worth every penny for all that they do \u2013 and I would not begrudge the relatively small amount it costs us for their presence, whereas I\u2019d pay plenty to lose a \u201cruler\u201d like Trump.

The design is beautifully austere, a 10-pointed star in plan, with a conical roof, completely plain save for two bands of calligraphy around the bottom and the top. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2020 to clarify that Armenians were forced to move to the Isfahan area by Persia\u2019s shah in the early 1600s, rather than fleeing there.",

But the decisions taken today (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news?page=with:block-5e1350b98f087e8308e697ea#block-5e1350b98f087e8308e697ea\">3.23pm)</a> are in line with the plan announced by the party last month for the leadership contest to be <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-labour-general-election-jennie-formby-a4314096.html\">over by the end of March</a> (the party will miss this deadline, but only by a week), and it is hard to see anything partisan in the timetable. </p> <p>Candidates will have a week to get the 22 nominations they need from MPs and MEPs. Some of the candidates who have announced that they are standing may struggle to meet this threshold, but if they can\u2019t get the numbers over a week, they are probably not in a strong position to complain.</p> <p>The window during which people can apply to vote as a registered supporter is open for just 48 hours, and a \u00a325 fee will apply. These rules are a lot more restrictive than those in place in 2015. But they are the same as those in place in 2016, and so the NEC can argue it is just sticking with precedent. And in 2016 about 120,000 people managed to sign up during that period. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news?page=with:block-5e130a4a8f085eda5c112efb#block-5e130a4a8f085eda5c112efb\">10.37am.)</a></p> <p>If candidates can get the requisite number of nominations from MPs, under rules introduced while Corbyn has been leader they have to clear a second nomination hurdle \u2013 either by getting 5% of the union/affiliate vote, or by getting nominations from 10% of constituency Labour parties (ie 33 of them). According to <a href=\"https://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2019/12/16/labour-leadership-election-who-can-vote-and-how-does-it-work\">this useful explainer</a> by Luke Akehurst, any candidate with the backing of one of the five big Labour unions \u2013 Unite, Unison, GMB, Usdaw and the CWU \u2013 should be able to clear the 5% union/affiliate hurdle easily. (They would need either two smaller unions, or a smaller union and a socialist society, backing them too, but that should not be a problem for someone with a big union behind them.) Getting the support of 33 CLPs might be harder, particularly for candidates not backed by Momentum (which is well organised at CLP level), but the NEC has given candidates a month to secure these nominations, which does not seem too unreasonable a timetable.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T17:21:49.227Z\">at 5.21pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1350b98f087e8308e697ea\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T15:23:46.694Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Timetable for Labour leadership contest</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the details of the timetable for the Labour leadership election decided by the NEC.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 7 January:</strong> Nominations open from MPs and MEPs.<br><strong>Monday 13 January:</strong> Nominations from MPs and MEPs close at 2.30pm.<br><strong>Tuesday 14 January:</strong> Registered supporters applications open at 5pm.<br><strong>Thursday 16 January:</strong> Registered supporters\u2019 applications close at 5pm.<br><strong>Wednesday 15 January:</strong> Second stage of nominations from constituency Labour parties and affiliates opens.<br><strong>Monday 20 January:</strong> Freeze date for eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters.

His plans to run are thought to depend on getting sufficient early nominations, but it would fuel the brewing conflict between the party\u2019s pro-Corbyn wing and its centrists.</p> <p>Before the election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/23/union-unite-deselection-scottish-labour-ian-murray-edinburgh-sout\">the union Unite had attempted to block his nomination</a> because of his open hostility to Corbyn and to Len McClusky, the Unite leader, but failed.</p> <p>Murray held Edinburgh South on 12 December with an 11,095 (22.3%) majority while Labour suffered its worst general election result in Scotland of the modern era. It lost six of its seven MPs in another Scottish National party landslide after winning only 18.6% of the vote.</p> <p>Party sources say Murray has told other MPs he believes Labour\u2019s future and the UK\u2019s survival rests on it tackling Scottish, English and Welsh nationalism, with a substantial constitutional reform programme. </p> <p>He has not yet specified what those reforms would involve, but he echoed a pledge in Labour\u2019s manifesto to set up a constitutional convention or \u2013 if it eventually formed a UK government, through a royal commission. </p> <p>In a note circulated around the parliamentary party, he accused Corbyn, and by implication Ed Miliband, of failing to tackle nationalism effectively. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are no doubts that constitutional and nationalist issues are engulfing our politics.

It took me time for that shame to turn into pride.</p> <p>I want children growing up here now to know they are worth as much as anyone else. And I want the world of Westminster politics to hear that too. </p> <p>Because I remember when I first spoke from the frontbench in the House of Commons, a parliamentary sketchwriter said I must have got lost from the set of Little Britain. </p> <p>It was another way of saying I didn\u2019t know my place. </p> <p>Maybe I don\u2019t. </p> <p>But I know the place I came from.

By the standards of recent politics, it was, and rightly so. But actually, we could have told a simpler story.</p> <p>So many of our policies simply restored services that an older generation could remember our country having had before. </p> <p>So much of our platform could have been explained as simple common sense. A contrast to absurdities like our trains being run by nationalised companies from every European country except our own. </p> <p>And when we have new policies to offer, it is so much better to show than to tell. </p> <p>To show what has been achieved in other countries and ask why we can\u2019t have the same.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that some of Labour\u2019s manifesto promises were seen as \u201cglib promises of free things \u2026 and distrusted as much as any other sales pitch\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said Labour leave supporters felt patronised by the party.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of the friends I grew up with, my own family even, voted to leave the EU.

And even in remain areas the party was vulnerable, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nor should we take for granted the new voters we have won over, any more than we should have done those we have lost.</p> <p>For all that\u2019s said about London, we made no net advance in seats there either. We faced a fight to hold others like Dagenham and Rainham \u2013 a place that, like my own constituency, has so much to gain from a Labour government, but where too many people felt our party had lost touch with them.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said Labour was facing the biggest challenge in its history.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said other social democratic parties were also facing the same problems.</strong> </li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Across Europe social democratic parties are collapsing.

When it was put to her that she and Long Bailey were seen as Jeremy Corbyn continuity candidates, Rayner replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, to be honest, as a northern working-class lass, I\u2019ve been underestimated, and told my place, ever since I was born. And two northern women, I can tell you, will not be being told that we are continuity anything from any man. We will set out what we are. I\u2019m sure Rebecca will set out who she is, and if she decides to stand she will get my support. She\u2019s nobody\u2019s continuation. Rebecca is her own person. And I\u2019m my own person. I won\u2019t be told what Angela Rayner should be either. I\u2019m there to support my electorate.</p> </blockquote> <p>In her Guardian article last week, Long Bailey said she was backing Rayner for the deputy leadership. Rayner is reciprocating. But, in her Sky News interview, Rayner also said the fact that she was supporting her friend did not mean she was opposed to having anyone else as Labour leader. Asked who she wanted to lead the party, Rayner replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I would take any of [the candidates] as my boss. I think one of the things you will find over the next couple of months is that we\u2019ve got fantastic support and fantastic candidates, and some great quality in our leadership candidates.</p> <p>I will obviously support my flatmate and friend, Rebecca Long Bailey, because I think she\u2019s another fantastic northern woman who will really be able to give it to Boris Johnson and the Tories, and hold them to account, but I\u2019ll happily work under any of our leadership contenders. It is not for me to say who our membership should vote for.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if she would be happy to have Jess Phillips as party leader, Rayner replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019d work for Jess Phillips as well, absolutely \u2026 Jess is absolutely fantastic as well.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94eabf3afb76f25556f0e1ca419dd74b035e69d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94eabf3afb76f25556f0e1ca419dd74b035e69d5/30_0_898_539/500.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Rayner\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Rayner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T13:42:08.477Z\">at 1.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1330c28f085eda5c113084\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T13:06:25.919Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From my colleague <strong>Dan Sabbagh</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dansabbagh/status/1214164638759366656\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No immediate plans to upgrade UK military presence in the Middle East, defence sources indicate.

Under the rules introduced when Ed Miliband was leader, registered supporters can vote, as well as proper party members and people who are affiliated to the party through membership of a trade union. But the NEC will have to decide how much people will have to pay to vote as a registered supporter, and how long they will get to register.</p> <p>In 2015, the fee was just \u00a33. People in the party were not sure how popular the scheme would be, but more than 100,000 people ended up registering. In 2016, the fee was set at \u00a325 and registration was open for just 48 hours, but 120,000 people registered anyway. At the time Corbynites on the NEC were worried about the registered supporters scheme being exploited by Owen Smith supporters, but in the event 70% of the people who signed up in the 48-hour window voted for Jeremy Corbyn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/aliceperryuk/status/1213940152919371777\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People on Twitter discussing possible price for Registered Supporters. \u00a33 was far too low and caused problems.

He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The one that I worry about \u2013 but I don\u2019t know what she stands for \u2013 when I look at Rebecca Long Bailey, she\u2019s really the continuity candidate.

We are leaving. We will have left the EU \u2026</p> <p>This election blew away the argument for a second referendum, rightly or wrongly, and we have to adjust to that situation. The argument has to move on and the argument now is, can we insist on that close relationship with the EU, close economic relationship, but collaboration in other areas? And also what is the framework now for future trade relations? Because my concern is less about technical membership of the EU now, it\u2019s if we shift our focus from the EU and move away from those standards and arrangements, it is inevitable that Boris Johnson and his government will look to America for a trade deal and we need to know the terms of that because we\u2019ve had a lot of discussion about the NHS being part of those negotiations, but all public services could be part of those negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer was not pressed on whether he was firmly ruling out Labour ever adopting a rejoin position under his leadership, or whether he was just saying there was no realistic possibility of this being an option over the next five years (which is now Jess Phillips\u2019 position - see <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news?page=with:block-5e12ee3e8f08c3972264582c#block-5e12ee3e8f08c3972264582c\">8.51am)</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T11:00:22.284Z\">at 11.00am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e12f8b98f085eda5c112e99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T09:15:56.434Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are two other lines in <strong>Jess Phillips</strong>\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jess-philips-brexit-eu-remain-labour-leadership-election-corbyn-boris-johnson-a9271356.html\">article in the Independent today</a> that are worth pointing out.</p> <p>First, she argues that one of Labour\u2019s biggest mistakes during the election was to allow Boris Johnson to get away with the claim that he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 January. She says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister is well known for being economical with the truth, but one of the biggest mistakes Labour\u2019s top team made during the general election campaign was to let him get away with a whopper: that he will get <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit\">Brexit</a> done by 31 January. Instead we know the biggest challenge yet to come is getting a trade deal in place to agree the terms of our future relationship with the European Union and making sure we avert the serious risk of crashing out without a deal.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is also what Keir Starmer, the favourite in the contest, has been arguing. For pro-Europeans like Starmer and Phillips, who strongly supported a second referendum, it is a way of acknowledging that Brexit was a problem for the party during the election (an argument being made powerfully by Corbynites in the party), without accepting the second referendum policy was at fault.</p> <p>And, second, while implicitly accepting that she have gone too far in her Andrew Marr interview (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news?page=with:block-5e12ee3e8f08c3972264582c#block-5e12ee3e8f08c3972264582c\"> 8.51am)</a>, Phillips argues that overall honesty and plain speaking are positive attributes. She says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve seen where a lack of honesty and plain speaking, courage and conviction got Labour at the last election. In trying to look both ways we ended up pleasing no one.</p> <p>In my experience, honesty is the best policy. People in my Birmingham Yardley constituency voted to leave the European Union by about 60%. They know that I think leaving the European Union presents huge risks to our country and they know that I haven\u2019t suddenly changed my mind. But it hasn\u2019t broken their trust in me or my faith in them, because we\u2019re honest with each other. Contained in that honesty is mutual respect. We don\u2019t always agree on everything, but we have good faith that our intentions are good. There is not enough of that about at the moment.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T11:01:55.258Z\">at 11.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e12ee3e8f08c3972264582c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T08:51:26.212Z\">8.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jess Phillips clarifies Brexit stance, saying party won't back rejoin at next election</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

As my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/05/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-says-party-could-argue-to-rejoin-eu\">Heather Stewart points out</a>, this contrasted with the approach taken by Keir Starmer, who stressed it was time to move one. Asked if the party would be a \u201creturn party\u201d at the next election, Phillips said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a leave seat but I campaigned for remain because I thought it was the best thing for the people that I represent and I thought it was the best thing for the country and I\u2019m not going to just change my mind on that. But what we have to do is wait and see.</p> </blockquote> <p>And when pressed if, as leader, she could make rejoining the EU official Labour policy, she replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You would have to look at what was going on at the time \u2026 what our job is for the next three years is to hold Boris Johnson to account on all the promises. So if we are living in an absolute paradise of trade and we\u2019re totally safe in the world and we\u2019re not worrying about having to constantly look to America for our safety and security, then maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s new leader and deputy leader will be announced at a special conference on 4 April, with prospective supporters given a 48-hour window next week to sign up if they want to have their say. Downing Street has said targeting cultural sites in Iran would breach international warfare conventions in an implicit rebuke to Donald Trump for threatening to bomb protected heritage sites. Angela Rayner has said Labour faces the stark challenge of \u201cwin or die\u201d after the party\u2019s general election defeat as she officially launched her campaign to become deputy leader. Jess Phillips, a Labour leadership candidate, has backed away from her suggestion yesterday that she could support the UK rejoining the EU at the next general election. In an article published this morning, she said she could not imagine the Labour party supporting this idea. (See 8.51am.) Yvette Cooper, the former Labour cabinet minister, has announced that she will not be standing for the Labour leadership. But, in an article for the Guardian, she has identified seven tasks for the person who does replace Jeremy Corbyn. Her article is here. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, will not be allowed to bypass Whitehall\u2019s usual recruitment processes when recruiting \u201cweirdos\u201d and \u201cmisfits\u201d for Downing Street jobs, No 10 has said. Boris Johnson is facing demands for cash compensation that could run to more than \u00a3100m for any disruption caused by Brexit to Northern Ireland\u2019s businesses. Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, has allocated \u201cfrontbench\u201d roles for his MPs. Davey himself will combine being acting leader with being Treasury spokesperson. That is all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. From LabourList\u2019s Sienna Rodgers Talks in Belfast aimed at getting the Northern Ireland assembly and its power-sharing executive back up and running have not been running smoothly, the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack reports. Jackson Carlaw, the acting leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has declared he will campaign to succeed Ruth Davidson, as the contest formally began. Carlaw, the then deputy Scottish Tory leader, became interim leader after Davidson unexpectedly resigned last August, citing family pressures and her long-standing unhappiness over the UK party\u2019s stance on Brexit. The overwhelming favourite, Carlaw announced on Monday on Twitter he would stand and said: \u201cWe must take the fight to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, broadening our platform and diversifying our party.\u201d He told the Sunday Times he thought the Tories would need to ditch some \u201cprecious\u201d policies to compete more aggressively in the centre ground as \u201cblue collar Conservatives\u201d, although he failed to specify which. He is expected to face competition from Michelle Ballantyne, an MSP who is the party\u2019s social security spokeswoman, who said she believed there needed to be \u201ca contest and not a coronation\u201d. Ballantyne said she would stand if she won nominations from 100 party members. A remain voter who has since enthusiastically backed Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance, Carlaw been backed by several senior colleagues, including Murdo Fraser, a former leadership candidate who lost out to Davidson in 2011. Liam Kerr and Rachael Hamilton, two other frontbench MSPs, are to chair his campaign. There had been speculation that Adam Tomkins, the constitutional affairs spokesman, could stand but Tomkins said he backed Carlaw. The Telegraph has reported party grandees would prefer to avoid a contest, arguing a three-month long leadership campaign will detract from their efforts to oppose Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government, with 15 months left to the next Holyrood election. The Tories became the second largest party at Holyrood under Davidson\u2019s leadership, winning 31 of its 129 seats in the 2016 election. Nominations close at noon on 17 January. From New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh Last week, there was speculation that Labour\u2019s national executive committee, which has a majority of members loyal to Jeremy Corbyn but which is far from 100% Corbynite, might try to fix the rules of the leadership contest to help Corbyn\u2019s preferred candidate (widely assumed to be Rebecca Long Bailey, although some of Corbyn\u2019s allies are pushing Ian Lavery as a candidate). But the decisions taken today (see 3.23pm) are in line with the plan announced by the party last month for the leadership contest to be over by the end of March (the party will miss this deadline, but only by a week), and it is hard to see anything partisan in the timetable. Candidates will have a week to get the 22 nominations they need from MPs and MEPs. Some of the candidates who have announced that they are standing may struggle to meet this threshold, but if they can\u2019t get the numbers over a week, they are probably not in a strong position to complain. The window during which people can apply to vote as a registered supporter is open for just 48 hours, and a \u00a325 fee will apply. These rules are a lot more restrictive than those in place in 2015. But they are the same as those in place in 2016, and so the NEC can argue it is just sticking with precedent. And in 2016 about 120,000 people managed to sign up during that period. (See 10.37am.) If candidates can get the requisite number of nominations from MPs, under rules introduced while Corbyn has been leader they have to clear a second nomination hurdle \u2013 either by getting 5% of the union/affiliate vote, or by getting nominations from 10% of constituency Labour parties (ie 33 of them). According to this useful explainer by Luke Akehurst, any candidate with the backing of one of the five big Labour unions \u2013 Unite, Unison, GMB, Usdaw and the CWU \u2013 should be able to clear the 5% union/affiliate hurdle easily. (They would need either two smaller unions, or a smaller union and a socialist society, backing them too, but that should not be a problem for someone with a big union behind them.) Getting the support of 33 CLPs might be harder, particularly for candidates not backed by Momentum (which is well organised at CLP level), but the NEC has given candidates a month to secure these nominations, which does not seem too unreasonable a timetable. Here are the details of the timetable for the Labour leadership election decided by the NEC. Tuesday 7 January: Nominations open from MPs and MEPs. Monday 13 January: Nominations from MPs and MEPs close at 2.30pm. Tuesday 14 January: Registered supporters applications open at 5pm. Thursday 16 January: Registered supporters\u2019 applications close at 5pm. Wednesday 15 January: Second stage of nominations from constituency Labour parties and affiliates opens. Monday 20 January: Freeze date for eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters. Closes at 5pm. Friday 14 February: Close of CLP and affiliate nominations. Friday 21 February: Ballot opens. Thursday 2 April: Ballot closes at 12pm. Saturday 4 April: Special conference to announce results. The NEC has announced the timetable for the leadership election. A Labour spokesman said: Our national executive committee has agreed the timetable and process for the leadership and deputy leadership elections. The ballot will run from 21 February to 2 April, with the results announced on Saturday 4 April. We are by far the largest political party in the UK with well over half a million members. We want as many of our members and supporters to take part, so it has been designed to be open, fair and democratic. Here is more from the NEC meeting. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. A \u00a325 fee and a 48-hour registration period are what applied in 2016, when Labour last staged a leadership contest. It was assumed at the time that this might discourage people from registering, but it didn\u2019t; around 120,000 people signed up and voted in the contest as registered supporters. (See 10.37am.) Ian Murray, Labour\u2019s only surviving MP in Scotland, is preparing to enter the contest to become Labour\u2019s deputy leader on a platform of constitutional reform and countering nationalism. Murray, an arch-critic of Jeremy Corbyn and an opponent of Brexit, is expected to signal his intention to run tomorrow after being asked to stand by other Labour MPs. His plans to run are thought to depend on getting sufficient early nominations, but it would fuel the brewing conflict between the party\u2019s pro-Corbyn wing and its centrists. Before the election, the union Unite had attempted to block his nomination because of his open hostility to Corbyn and to Len McClusky, the Unite leader, but failed. Murray held Edinburgh South on 12 December with an 11,095 (22.3%) majority while Labour suffered its worst general election result in Scotland of the modern era. It lost six of its seven MPs in another Scottish National party landslide after winning only 18.6% of the vote. Party sources say Murray has told other MPs he believes Labour\u2019s future and the UK\u2019s survival rests on it tackling Scottish, English and Welsh nationalism, with a substantial constitutional reform programme. He has not yet specified what those reforms would involve, but he echoed a pledge in Labour\u2019s manifesto to set up a constitutional convention or \u2013 if it eventually formed a UK government, through a royal commission. In a note circulated around the parliamentary party, he accused Corbyn, and by implication Ed Miliband, of failing to tackle nationalism effectively. He said: There are no doubts that constitutional and nationalist issues are engulfing our politics. I have the experience and knowledge of dealing with both, and the Labour party has ducked this issue for too long. English nationalism from the Tories and Scottish nationalism from the SNP are squeezing the Labour party and we must stop it. [The] danger for our party across the UK is what I have been warning of since 2015. If we don\u2019t tackle the big constitutional issues with reference to our own values and the national interest, then we lose our core purpose. After listening to Angela Rayner\u2019s speech this morning, my colleague Kate Proctor concluded it was hard to see why she was running for the deputy Labour leadership when she might be a strong candidate for leader. (See 12.23pm.) It is not hard to see why. It\u2019s a good speech, with some compelling lines and a superb opening. Here is the opening. I wanted to make this speech here, on the estate where I grew up and lived for most of my life. I talk about my background because for too long I felt I wasn\u2019t good enough; I felt ashamed of who I was. It took me time for that shame to turn into pride. I want children growing up here now to know they are worth as much as anyone else. And I want the world of Westminster politics to hear that too. Because I remember when I first spoke from the frontbench in the House of Commons, a parliamentary sketchwriter said I must have got lost from the set of Little Britain. It was another way of saying I didn\u2019t know my place. Maybe I don\u2019t. But I know the place I came from. It\u2019s here. Not Little Britain. Real Britain. And people here deserve the very best our country has to offer. But they will only get it from a Labour government. (It was Quentin Letts in the Daily Mail who compared Rayner to a Little Britain character.) And here are some of the news lines from the speech. Rayner said it was a mistake for Labour to describe some of its policies are revolutionary when it would have been better to present them as common sense. We fell into the trap of describing a platform of revolutionary change. By the standards of recent politics, it was, and rightly so. But actually, we could have told a simpler story. So many of our policies simply restored services that an older generation could remember our country having had before. So much of our platform could have been explained as simple common sense. A contrast to absurdities like our trains being run by nationalised companies from every European country except our own. And when we have new policies to offer, it is so much better to show than to tell. To show what has been achieved in other countries and ask why we can\u2019t have the same. She said that some of Labour\u2019s manifesto promises were seen as \u201cglib promises of free things \u2026 and distrusted as much as any other sales pitch\u201d. She said Labour leave supporters felt patronised by the party. She said: Many of the friends I grew up with, my own family even, voted to leave the EU. They felt like we treated them as embarrassing aunts or uncles. That we didn\u2019t listen, didn\u2019t understand, and didn\u2019t act on their democratic vote. She said Labour should deal more firmly with antisemitism. There are also lines beyond which there is no dialogue and no compromise possible. And the first line in the sand is antisemitism. Cross that line and you\u2019re out. Apologies are worthless without action. We need to make clear now that we will take that action. To educate where there is ignorance. And to quickly remove bigotry wherever it is found. She said the coalition that had sustained the Labour party (the working class and the progressive middle class) was \u201cbroken\u201d. Explaining how bad the election result was for Labour, she said it had lost working-class seats it had held for decades, that in some seats it had only won because the leave vote was split, and that the Tories were ahead of Labour by 40% to 23% among blue collar workers. And even in remain areas the party was vulnerable, she said: Nor should we take for granted the new voters we have won over, any more than we should have done those we have lost. For all that\u2019s said about London, we made no net advance in seats there either. We faced a fight to hold others like Dagenham and Rainham \u2013 a place that, like my own constituency, has so much to gain from a Labour government, but where too many people felt our party had lost touch with them. She said Labour was facing the biggest challenge in its history. She said other social democratic parties were also facing the same problems. Across Europe social democratic parties are collapsing. The once mighty German SPD, the biggest and oldest social democratic party in the world is on 11%. The combined forces of the French centre left parties are on \u2026 6%. We are now in danger of the same fate. She said Labour needed a \u201ccollectivist\u201d approach to its problems, and that she did not have all the answers herself. I don\u2019t pretend that I have all the answers. That is the point of being a collectivist. That by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we do alone. That final sentence is a quote from the new Clause IV introduced by Tony Blair. She said she owed much of her life to Labour, including policies introduced by the Blair government. I owe much of my life to Labour. The Labour governments that provided the welfare state, Sure Start, and the minimum wage, which gave me the help I needed to not just survive but succeed. The trade unions that gave me a political education, skills and a vocation. Here are some lines from Labour\u2019s NEC meeting. From the Yorkshire Post\u2019s Geri Scott From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard From the Telegraph\u2019s Harry Yorke Keith Vaz sits on the NEC as the representative of BAME Labour. Downing Street has issued a read-out following Boris Johnson\u2019s conversation with his Iraqi opposite number, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, this morning. A No 10 spokesperson said: The prime minister spoke to prime minister Abdul Mahdi of Iraq this morning. The leaders discussed the need to de-escalate tensions in the region following the death of Qassem Suleimani and agreed to work together to find a diplomatic way forward. The prime minister underlined the UK\u2019s unwavering commitment to Iraq\u2019s stability and sovereignty and emphasised the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh. This morning, Tom Watson, the former deputy Labour leader, said he was worried that Rebecca Long Bailey would be a \u201ccontinuity candidate\u201d. (See 9.38am.) But Angela Rayner, who is standing to replace Watson as deputy leader and backing her friend and London flatmate for leader, told Sky News this claim was wrong. When it was put to her that she and Long Bailey were seen as Jeremy Corbyn continuity candidates, Rayner replied: Well, to be honest, as a northern working-class lass, I\u2019ve been underestimated, and told my place, ever since I was born. And two northern women, I can tell you, will not be being told that we are continuity anything from any man. We will set out what we are. I\u2019m sure Rebecca will set out who she is, and if she decides to stand she will get my support. She\u2019s nobody\u2019s continuation. Rebecca is her own person. And I\u2019m my own person. I won\u2019t be told what Angela Rayner should be either. I\u2019m there to support my electorate. In her Guardian article last week, Long Bailey said she was backing Rayner for the deputy leadership. Rayner is reciprocating. But, in her Sky News interview, Rayner also said the fact that she was supporting her friend did not mean she was opposed to having anyone else as Labour leader. Asked who she wanted to lead the party, Rayner replied: Well, I would take any of [the candidates] as my boss. I think one of the things you will find over the next couple of months is that we\u2019ve got fantastic support and fantastic candidates, and some great quality in our leadership candidates. I will obviously support my flatmate and friend, Rebecca Long Bailey, because I think she\u2019s another fantastic northern woman who will really be able to give it to Boris Johnson and the Tories, and hold them to account, but I\u2019ll happily work under any of our leadership contenders. It is not for me to say who our membership should vote for. When asked if she would be happy to have Jess Phillips as party leader, Rayner replied: I\u2019d work for Jess Phillips as well, absolutely \u2026 Jess is absolutely fantastic as well. From my colleague Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor When Boris Johnson meets Ursula Von Der Leyen, the European commission president, at No 10 on Wednesday, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, will attend too. The European commission\u2019s chief spokesman said the meeting was taking place at \u201ca very specific moment\u201d before trade talks had begun. \u201cThis is not a meeting that will go into the details of the trade negotiation.\u201d The EU is not expected to finalise its mandate for talks on the future relationship with the UK until 25 February, the first time the EU\u2019s European affairs ministers will meet after the UK\u2019s departure on 31 January. While I was at the No 10 lobby briefing, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, was launching her campaign to be Labour\u2019s deputy leader. My colleague Kate Proctor was there and here is her story about the speech. And here are some more tweets from Kate. I will post more on the speech shortly. Labour\u2019s national executive committee is meeting now to discuss the arrangements for the leadership contest. As he arrived for the meeting, Ian Lavery, the party chairman, who has not ruled out standing for the leadership himself, said he expected the NEC to come up with the \u201cright solution\u201d during its discussion on the leadership contest. He said: We\u2019ll be having thorough discussions. Let me tell you that this NEC will not be a five-minute job, it never is. Every letter and every proposal will be discussed and we\u2019ll come up with the right solution, believe me. I\u2019m just back from the No 10 lobby briefing. Holding these meetings in 9 Downing Street, instead of in a room in the Houses of Parliament, will probably be good for lobby journalists\u2019 exercise levels, although it is hard to see any other benefits at the moment, and for someone writing a live blog it\u2019s a big inconvenience. Here are the main points. Britain would oppose any move by the US to attack cultural sites in Iran, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed. The spokesman said it was clear that this was not allowed under international conventions \u2013 although he stopped short of saying the move would amount to a war crime. Boris Johnson will host a meeting of senior ministers this afternoon to discuss Iran, the spokesman said. And tomorrow he will chair a national security council meeting on the topic. Britain is urging Iraq not to insist on the withdrawal of American troops, the spokesman said. He said: The coalition is in Iraq to protect Iraqis and others from the threat from Daesh [Isis] at the request of the Iraqi government. We urge the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition is able to continue our vital work countering this shared threat. Johnson was speaking to his Iraqi counterpart on this issue this morning, the spokesman said. The spokesman rejected suggestions that the US assassination of Qassem Suleimani was illegal. Asked about this, he said: States have a right to take action such as this in self-defence and the US have been clear that Suleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats and military personnel. But the spokesman refused to say if the UK government had been shown any evidence by the Americans to justify their claim that Suleimani posed an imminent threat to US personnel when he was killed. Dominic Cummings will not be allowed bypass normal civil service recruitment processes when hiring staff for No 10, the spokesman said. Asked about the blog by Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, inviting \u201cweirdos\u201d and others interested in working for him to respond to a private email address, the spokesman said this was for \u201cexpressions of interest\u201d only. He said new civil servants would be appointed in the usual way. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. I\u2019m off to the No 10 lobby briefing now. From today, No 10 is holding the briefings in Downing Street, instead of in a room in the House of Commons (about two minutes\u2019 walk from the corridor where press gallery journalists are based), and this means getting to and from the meetings is going to take longer and be more cumbersome (because it will involve clearing No 10 security). I probably won\u2019t be able to post again until after 11.45am. These are from Alice Perry, a local government representative on Labour\u2019s national executive committee. One of the key issues to be decided at today\u2019s NEC meeting is what the arrangements will be for registered supporters to vote in the leadership contest. Under the rules introduced when Ed Miliband was leader, registered supporters can vote, as well as proper party members and people who are affiliated to the party through membership of a trade union. But the NEC will have to decide how much people will have to pay to vote as a registered supporter, and how long they will get to register. In 2015, the fee was just \u00a33. People in the party were not sure how popular the scheme would be, but more than 100,000 people ended up registering. In 2016, the fee was set at \u00a325 and registration was open for just 48 hours, but 120,000 people registered anyway. At the time Corbynites on the NEC were worried about the registered supporters scheme being exploited by Owen Smith supporters, but in the event 70% of the people who signed up in the 48-hour window voted for Jeremy Corbyn. In an interview with Sky News this morning, Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, refused to say whom he would be backing in the Labour leadership contest. But he said that Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, was the candidate he was worried about. He explained: The one that I worry about \u2013 but I don\u2019t know what she stands for \u2013 when I look at Rebecca Long Bailey, she\u2019s really the continuity candidate. She stands for Corbynism in its purest sense. And that\u2019s perfectly legitimate but we have lost two elections with that play. But he also acknowledged that, when Long Bailey does announce her campaign, she might adopt a different line. She hasn\u2019t said anything yet; as far as I know she has not formally announced and it might be that she chimes a different note in her opening bid and that she wants to take the party in a different direction and she\u2019s very candid about what went wrong, in which case then she\u2019s in quite a good position to shift things around. But I think it\u2019s fair for me to reserve judgment. It is true that Long Bailey has not said anything in the form of an interview or a speech. But she did make an opening pitch in the form of an article in the Guardian last week. For the record, this is what Sir Keir Starmer, the frontrunner in the Labour leadership contest, said in his Andrew Marr interview (pdf) yesterday when asked if he would back rejoining the EU if he became Labour leader. Well, we are going to leave the EU in the next few weeks and it\u2019s important for all of us, including myself, to recognise that the argument about leave and remain goes with it. We are leaving. We will have left the EU \u2026 This election blew away the argument for a second referendum, rightly or wrongly, and we have to adjust to that situation. The argument has to move on and the argument now is, can we insist on that close relationship with the EU, close economic relationship, but collaboration in other areas? And also what is the framework now for future trade relations? Because my concern is less about technical membership of the EU now, it\u2019s if we shift our focus from the EU and move away from those standards and arrangements, it is inevitable that Boris Johnson and his government will look to America for a trade deal and we need to know the terms of that because we\u2019ve had a lot of discussion about the NHS being part of those negotiations, but all public services could be part of those negotiations. Starmer was not pressed on whether he was firmly ruling out Labour ever adopting a rejoin position under his leadership, or whether he was just saying there was no realistic possibility of this being an option over the next five years (which is now Jess Phillips\u2019 position - see 8.51am). There are two other lines in Jess Phillips\u2019 article in the Independent today that are worth pointing out. First, she argues that one of Labour\u2019s biggest mistakes during the election was to allow Boris Johnson to get away with the claim that he would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 January. She says: The prime minister is well known for being economical with the truth, but one of the biggest mistakes Labour\u2019s top team made during the general election campaign was to let him get away with a whopper: that he will get Brexit done by 31 January. Instead we know the biggest challenge yet to come is getting a trade deal in place to agree the terms of our future relationship with the European Union and making sure we avert the serious risk of crashing out without a deal. This is also what Keir Starmer, the favourite in the contest, has been arguing. For pro-Europeans like Starmer and Phillips, who strongly supported a second referendum, it is a way of acknowledging that Brexit was a problem for the party during the election (an argument being made powerfully by Corbynites in the party), without accepting the second referendum policy was at fault. And, second, while implicitly accepting that she have gone too far in her Andrew Marr interview (see 8.51am), Phillips argues that overall honesty and plain speaking are positive attributes. She says: We\u2019ve seen where a lack of honesty and plain speaking, courage and conviction got Labour at the last election. In trying to look both ways we ended up pleasing no one. In my experience, honesty is the best policy. People in my Birmingham Yardley constituency voted to leave the European Union by about 60%. They know that I think leaving the European Union presents huge risks to our country and they know that I haven\u2019t suddenly changed my mind. But it hasn\u2019t broken their trust in me or my faith in them, because we\u2019re honest with each other. Contained in that honesty is mutual respect. We don\u2019t always agree on everything, but we have good faith that our intentions are good. There is not enough of that about at the moment. Good morning. Labour\u2019s national executive committee is meeting today to decide the detailed arrangements for the party\u2019s leadership contest. And this morning we have witnessed what amounts to something close to the first U-turn by one of the candidates. Yesterday, in an interview (pdf) with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr, Jess Phillips did not rule out Labour campaigning to rejoin the European Union at the next election. As my colleague Heather Stewart points out, this contrasted with the approach taken by Keir Starmer, who stressed it was time to move one. Asked if the party would be a \u201creturn party\u201d at the next election, Phillips said: I have a leave seat but I campaigned for remain because I thought it was the best thing for the people that I represent and I thought it was the best thing for the country and I\u2019m not going to just change my mind on that. But what we have to do is wait and see. And when pressed if, as leader, she could make rejoining the EU official Labour policy, she replied: You would have to look at what was going on at the time \u2026 what our job is for the next three years is to hold Boris Johnson to account on all the promises. So if we are living in an absolute paradise of trade and we\u2019re totally safe in the world and we\u2019re not worrying about having to constantly look to America for our safety and security, then maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. But the reality is if our country is safer, if it is more economically viable to be in the European Union, then I will fight for that regardless of how difficult that argument is to make. Some commentators viewed this as a mistake, and Phillips herself seems to agree because in an article for the Independent this morning she has clarified her position, saying she could not imagine Labour backing rejoin at the next election. She says: People are asking me if I\u2019ll lead the campaign to rejoin the EU. We haven\u2019t even left yet! The honest answer is that I don\u2019t know what the future will hold, but we must accept the result, move our country forward and hold Boris Johnson to account. I can\u2019t see a campaign to rejoin winning support in the next Labour manifesto. Labour should always be an outward-facing and a pro-European party, but we know in our heads as well as our hearts that our failure to win the election means the terms of the debate have changed. There are, of course, more important things happening in the world than the Labour leadership contest, although any influence the UK may have over the conflict between President Trump and Iran may be limited. But Boris Johnson will be discussing it today with ministers on his first full day back from holiday. Parliament does not return until tomorrow, but we will be getting a No 10 lobby briefing. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Boris Johnson is due to hold talks with ministers about the Iran crisis following his return from holiday. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, gives a speech in Stockport. She is expected to announce that she is standing to be Labour\u2019s deputy leader. 12pm: Labour\u2019s national executive committee meets to decide the arrangements for the party\u2019s leadership contest. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

These threats made it clearer how the US-Iran conflict could spill over into other countries, most notably Iraq, in the volatile oil-producing region. As a result, oil prices jumped above US$70/barrel for several hours. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>This escalation was serious, and as we have noted in recent days, the risk that a policy miscalculation could send the US and Iran into actual war is much higher than it has been in recent months. However, we maintain our forecast that the two countries are likely to avoid outright war. Iran is not in a position financially, after more than a year of crippling US sanctions, to finance a lopsided war with the US. Any serious attack on a US ship, or even less likely, US soil, would prompt a severe response from the US; it is hard to see how Iran could come back from something like that. Donald Trump also puts his re-election campaign at risk if he were to provoke a deeply unpopular foreign war. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Assuming that the two countries avoid an all-out war, we continue to expect oil prices to hover around US$70/b in the first quarter of 2020. This is higher than our earlier forecast, of around US$65/b, as the two countries launch a series of increasingly violent, but targeted bilateral attacks that keep regional tensions extremely high. </li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1333cc8f08c39722645a88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T13:20:49.613Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reuters\u2019 David Gaffen has rounded up some of the latest news and view on oil:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidgaffen/status/1214156845432164354\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MONDAY MORNING IN ENERGY: Brent crude at $70 now after the US lit a fuse last week with the killing of a top Iranian commander: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OOTT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OOTT</a><br><br>* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Iraq?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Iraq</a> voted on a resolution that would remove US troops <br>* Trump threatens sanctions on Iraq<br>* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Iran?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Iran</a> steps back further from JCPOA <a href=\"https://t.co/LsLJRB6ObP\">pic.twitter.com/LsLJRB6ObP</a></p>&mdash;

Elections could well revive tensions this year and escalation in the Middle-East could have a significant impact on asset prices in the region as the risk premium remains relatively low in some stronger-rated countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait or the UAE. Some weaker countries like Bahrain or deteriorating credit stories like Oman are even more vulnerable.</p> <p>Finally, another source of concern is Iraq where public discontent is growing quickly on the back of government corruption allegation.

      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets have closed in the red, although they did recover some of their losses. The FTSE 100 ended 47 points lower at 7,575 points, down 0.6%. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Stocks have sold-off again on account of the US-Iran tensions. The rhetoric from both sides has been upped, which has prompted traders to dump equities. The Iranian regime has suggested it will carry out an attack on US interests as a payback for the killing of one of its military commanders in Iraq last week. President Trump has warned Iran that any military response will bring about further US attacks. The tense standoff has encouraged traders to curtail their exposure to most stocks. The upheaval in the Middle East has driven up demand for BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Tullow Oil and John Wood shares. Curiously, the oil price is now dropping back from its earlier highs... and shares are recovering some of their losses. Brent crude is back down to $69.11 per barrel, up 0.75% today, having been above $70 this morning. Perhaps KellyAnne Conway\u2019s attempt to calm the situation this morning has worked...as the markets continue to weigh up the likely next move in the US-Iran crisis, Fiona Cincotta of City Index says investors are awaiting developments.... The selloff in Asia spilt over into the European session with bourses across Europe on the back foot on Monday. Investors are treading cautiously as they wait to see how tensions between Iran and US play out. Whilst the two sides exchange threats investors aren\u2019t leaving much to chance. Flows into safe havens such as the Japanese yen, gold and Swiss franc are on the up, which riskier assets such as equities are out of favour. Industrial stocks, consumer product-makers and financial stocks are leading the sell-off in New York. Energy stocks are rising, though, following the jump in crude prices. Miners are also up, as the weaker US dollar pushes up commodity prices. Donald Trump has now insisted that Tehran will never have a nuclear weapon: That feels like a response to Iran\u2019s decision not to abide by the limits on enriched uranium agreed in the 2015 nuclear deal. But as historian Simon Schama points out, it was Trump who undermined that Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action by withdrawing the US from it in 2018. Some good news: America\u2019s service sector companies grew faster last month. Data firm Markit has reported that its US Services PMI rose to 52.8 for December, up from 51.6 in November - and better than the \u2018flash\u2019 estimate of 52.2. Any reading over 50 shows growth. This PMI report suggests the economy grew at a \u201crelatively modest\u201d annual rate of 1.8% in December, Markit adds. Wall Street has opened weakly, as Iranian tensions weigh on the New York stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 201 points at the open, a drop of 0.7%, to 28,433 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is down 0.6%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has dropped by 0.85% as investors ditch equities in favour of safe asses such a the Japanese yen and gold. That follows losses in Asia overnight, and in Europe today -- where the FTSE 100 is currently down 0.67% or 50 points at 7570. Investors are worrying about how Tehran will respond to Qasem Soleimani\u2019s death in a US drone attack on Thursday night. Brad Bechtel of Jefferies say they face a \u201ctug-of-war......as the prospect for a better growth outlook and improvement in global trade along with the search for yield are running into Middle East geopolitical tensions.\u201d Just in: Donald Trump\u2019s advisor, Kellyanne Conway, has said the president is still confident he can reach an agreement with Iran, despite just ordering Qasem Soleimani\u2019s death. Could that be an attempt to cool the situation? Cailin Birch, Global Economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that oil prices will remain at current levels for some months, even if the US and Iran avoid full-blown military action. Birch says: The further escalation of US-Iran tensions over the weekend was significant, with Iran promising severe retaliation and Donald Trump threatening Iranian cultural sites and sanctions on Iraq. These threats made it clearer how the US-Iran conflict could spill over into other countries, most notably Iraq, in the volatile oil-producing region. As a result, oil prices jumped above US$70/barrel for several hours. This escalation was serious, and as we have noted in recent days, the risk that a policy miscalculation could send the US and Iran into actual war is much higher than it has been in recent months. However, we maintain our forecast that the two countries are likely to avoid outright war. Iran is not in a position financially, after more than a year of crippling US sanctions, to finance a lopsided war with the US. Any serious attack on a US ship, or even less likely, US soil, would prompt a severe response from the US; it is hard to see how Iran could come back from something like that. Donald Trump also puts his re-election campaign at risk if he were to provoke a deeply unpopular foreign war. Assuming that the two countries avoid an all-out war, we continue to expect oil prices to hover around US$70/b in the first quarter of 2020. This is higher than our earlier forecast, of around US$65/b, as the two countries launch a series of increasingly violent, but targeted bilateral attacks that keep regional tensions extremely high. Reuters\u2019 David Gaffen has rounded up some of the latest news and view on oil: Higher oil prices could soon hit motorists at the pumps, pushing inflation higher. My colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: A prolonged oil price surge could raise the risk of a global economic recession, and would add about 2p a litre to the price of petrol at the pumps. But market analysts at Goldman Sachs and UBS have cast doubt on whether oil prices will continue to rally beyond $70 a barrel due to strong production from outside the Middle East. Here\u2019s her news story about today\u2019s oil price spike: Wall Street is expected to fall when trading begins in around 90 minutes. The Dow Jones industrial average is down around 150 points in the futures market, or -0.6%, on top of the 233 points lost on Friday following Qasem Soleimani\u2019s death. Anxiety over the Middle East has wiped away any lingering festive cheer in the markets today, with the main indices all solidly lower. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says the selloff is fairly restrained, despite some sharp moves in the last couple of days. The new year has started with a bang in so far volatility is concerned. This is mainly due to the escalation of tensions between the US and Iran after Tump ordered the assassination of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a drone strike in Iraq on Friday. Iran has promised \u201csevere revenge\u201d for the death of Soleimani and has already pulled back from the 2015 nuclear accord. The markets have reacted with crude oil spiking on concerns over further supply disruptions in the Middle East, while gold has soared past its 2019 high on raised safe-haven demand. Stocks have fallen sharply, although the downside has been limited due to expectations that the raised tensions will have minimal impact on global growth. BAE Systems is now the top riser on the FTSE 100, up 1.8% at 591p, ahead of BP and Shell. That\u2019s their highest level since October 2018. Clearly investors think the firm behind the Eurofighter Typhoon jet, the Queen Elizabeth (QE) Class Aircraft Carriers and \u201cPre-fragmented, Programmable, Proximity- fused\u201d ammunition could do well in the current climate. The cost of insuring Saudi Arabian government debt against default has spiked today, but still remains low in broad terms. Saudi credit default swaps jumped to 64 basis points, from 55 on Friday, data firm Markit say. That means it would cost $64,000 per year to insure $10m of Saudi debt -- suggesting a default is still pretty unlikely. Shares in the world\u2019s largest oil company have sunk to their lowest level since it floated a month ago. Saudi Aramco shares have dropped to 34.3 Saudi riyals today, down 0.7%, after dropping 1.7% on Sunday. Aramco floated at 32 riyals per share last month, and promptly surged 10% as local investors scrambled to take part in the sometime-troubled float. A rising oil price should be good news for Aramco, but investors appear more concerned that the firm will be hurt by the Middle East crisis. Germany\u2019s DAX index is having a particularly bad morning. Each of the 30 stocks on the DAX is in the red, dragging it down to a three-week low. The technology, basic material, industrial and financials sectors are all down, on concerns that Middle East tensions will hurt growth and push oil prices higher. European stock markets are on track for their worst one-day fall since the start of December. Steady selling pressure this morning has pushed the Stoxx 600 down by 1.1%, to a two-week low. The US-Iran crisis is worrying markets badly, says Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Today\u2019s opening losses extend the stock market weakness that began on Friday when a US airstrike killed Iran\u2019s top Military Commander Qassem Soleimani. The prospect of Iran avenging the killing of Soleimani and then a retaliation from the US is keeping de-escalation hopes at bay. Defensive industries like utilities are outperforming amid the downturn. The pound has now gained half a cent against the US dollar. The better-than-expected UK PMI report is boosting sterling, as it could suggest a pick-up in growth next year. But the dollar is also dipping against other currencies, as traders favour safe-haven options such as the yen. Breaking: Optimism following Boris Johnson\u2019s election win last month has lifted Britain\u2019s dominant services sector to.. er... stagnation. Data firm Markit reports that its Services PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, hit 50.0 for December. That\u2019s up from 49.3 in November, and better than the \u2018flash\u2019 estimate released during the month. Although 50.0 shows stagnation, businesses reported that optimism has risen - to its highest level in 15 months. With workloads rising, and new orders at their highest level since July, some firms have taken on more staff. It appears that firms are happy that the election delivered a decisive result, meaning they can plan for the future. Tim Moore, economics associate eirector at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cService companies widely commented on delayed spending decisions and a headwind to sales from domestic political uncertainty in the run-up to the general election. With manufacturing and construction output also subdued in December, the latest PMI surveys collectively signal an overall stagnation of the UK economy at the end of 2019. Persian Gulf tensions are one of the biggest threats to emerging markets this year, particularly in the Middle East, says Charles de Quinsonas of the Bond Vigilantes team at M&amp;G. He points out that Iran is due to hold elections next month -- now overshadowed by the escalating crisis with the US. Given Iran\u2019s GDP is already shrinking, further disruption could hurt its economy and destabilise the country. De Quinsonas writes: One knows geopolitical risk matters when a few unsophisticated drones can suspend 5% of global oil supply (or 50% of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil capacity) over one night. It happened in September 2019 and it reminded everyone not only how fragile the Persian Gulf status quo was but also the far-reaching impact any type of escalation could have for the rest of the world with crude oil up +15% the day following the drone attack. Whilst the strait of Hormuz crisis seems to have abated in the second half of 2019, Iran now faces parliamentary election in February 2020 in a context of a sharp economic recession (IMF predicts -9.5% GDP growth in 2020) after two years of unilateral sanctions from the US (since May 2018). Elections could well revive tensions this year and escalation in the Middle-East could have a significant impact on asset prices in the region as the risk premium remains relatively low in some stronger-rated countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait or the UAE. Some weaker countries like Bahrain or deteriorating credit stories like Oman are even more vulnerable. Finally, another source of concern is Iraq where public discontent is growing quickly on the back of government corruption allegation. Elections in 2020 are a possible scenario and Saudi Arabia\u2019s influence in the country has increased in order to counter-balance Iran\u2019s alleged control of some Iraqi Shia militias. The pro-Iranian demonstration at the American Embassy in Baghdad a couple of days ago, followed by the US killing of a top Iranian General in Iraq on 2nd Jan, are here to remind us that the US-Iran tensions are unlikely to vanish in 2020. Over in the eurozone, corporate growth has picked up a little, but remains weak. Data firm Markit\u2019s survey of service sector activity, just released, has jumped to 52.8 from 51.9 in November, showing faster growth. But with manufacturing still shrinking, the overall eurozone composite PMI only crept up to 50.9, from 50.6, That\u2019s worryingly close to stagnation. This chart, from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, shows how new UK car sales have declined for the last few years: Breaking: UK car sales slumped by 2.4% last year, to 2.3 million vehicles. That\u2019s the lowest sales figure since 2013, as Brexit uncertainty and the knock-on impact of the diesel emissions scandal hits demand. The sell-off is gathering pace fast. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has now lost 85 points, or over 1%, with every sector dropping apart from energy. This takes the Footsie down to 7539 points, back to its lowest point on New Year\u2019s Eve. The prospect of conflict in the Gulf region has hit shares in airline companies. International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, has slumped by 3.3%, as has budget airline easyJet. Shares in oil companies are bucking today\u2019s falls, as they benefit from the jump in crude prices. BP is the biggest riser in London, up 1.9%, followed by Royal Dutch Shell which has gained 1.3%. They\u2019re almost the only FTSE 100 risers today, apart from Polymetal (which produces gold) and weapons maker BAE Systems. Traders are concluding there could be more demand for its combat aircraft, land vehicles and ships if relations between Washington and Tehran worsen. European stock markets are all in the red this morning, following losses in Japan and the Middle East. Germany\u2019s DAX has dropped by 1%, while the UK FTSE 100 is down 0.7% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has shed 1.25%. It\u2019s a trade as old as the hills -- when panic strikes, buy gold. The bullion price has spiked this morning to $1,573 per ounce, its highest level since April 2013. That mean it has leapt by 22% in the last 12 months, suggesting that gold still holds its status as a store of value (although it\u2019s still shy of its record high of around $2,000 per ounce in 2011). Geopolitical anxieties Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has started 2020 badly, shedding 451 points or nearly 2% to 23,204.86. The day began with the traditional ceremonies to start the new trading year, with staff donning kimonos and posing before the electronic screens. But this dash of colour was followed by hefty dollops of electronic red ink, as stocks tanked. Lee Hardman of Japanese bank MUFG says traders are anxious, and trying to deduce how Iran will respond to the death of its top general. The significant flare up in geopolitical tensions between Iran and the US has disrupted the calm in financial market at least temporarily. Our Middle East analyst Ehsan Khoman described the killing of Iran\u2019s commander of the foreign operations branch (Quds Force) of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards corps (IRGC), Major General Qassem Soleimani as a watershed moment in US relations with Iran. He noted that Iran has always had a healthy respect for US military power and it is unlikely to want to be drawn into a direct head-to-head confrontation. The strategy of responses since the 1979 revolution has been that the Iranian leadership backs down in the face of intense US military pressure. However, he believes it is not clear if the same script applies. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Fears of conflict in the Middle East are gripping the markets today. Three days after the killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, investors are nervous that the region is destabilised. With Iran vowing retaliation to Suleimani\u2019s death, and Donald Trump threatening the possibility of a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d response if they do, traders are ditching stocks and piling into safe havens. Oil has spiked dramatically, on fears to disruption to supplies from the Gulf region. Brent crude has jumped 2% this morning to $70 per barrel, its highest level since last September -- when Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq oil processing facility was attacked. That\u2019s up from $66 at the end of last year. US crude prices have also jumped sharply, hitting $64 per barrel for the first time since last April. It\u2019s a classic knee-jerk reaction from the markets, with stocks sliding in the Middle East and Asia. The Saudi stock market tumbled by 2.4% on Sunday, pulling Aramco\u2019s shares to their lowest since it floated last month. Egypt and Kuwait both slumped by 4%, and we\u2019re expecting European stocks to weaken a little today. The Stoxx 600 index has shed 0.5% in early trading. As well as the immediate risk of retaliation, there\u2019s also concern that Iran has decided to cut its commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal. That means it will no longer limit the amount of enriched uranium it holds. Firas Modad, Middle East analyst at IHS Markit, says Suleimani\u2019s death will certainly weaken, but not destroy, Iran\u2019s ability to project asymmetric power in the region. He predicts Tehran will retaliate gradually: In Iraq, militias such as Badr, Kataib Hizbullah and Asaib Ahl al-Haq are very likely to intensify attacks using IEDs, rockets and small-arms fire against US bases and energy assets, with the intent of maximising casualties rather than merely sending a message, as had been the case heretofore. Iran\u2019s retaliation is likely to be gradual, with a string of attacks in and outside the region, rather than a one-off. As a lower risk option, Iran is also likely to conduct attacks, sometimes attributed to the Houthi, against energy, desalination, maritime and aviation assets in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, using cruise missiles and weaponised UAVs. Trump, though, says the US has identified 52 Iranian sites (one for every American held hostage back in 1982) which would be attacked if Iran retaliates. Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have called for all parties to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the crisis, but Stephen Innes of AxiTrader says investors are dashing for cover: A possible Iran escalation and a 52-pronged US retaliation have spooked oil markets this morning. As a result, traders are tripping over one another to get topside to exposure. It\u2019s all about hedging the tail risk today. And a possible US-Iran war is a massive tail risk to hedge when it comes to oil. Traders need to get long oil to defend against a potential oil price spike and just in case the tomahawks fly. Also coming up today New surveys of service sector companies across the globe are released today, showing how firms fared in the final months of 2019. Traders are hoping for signs of growth, after a key US manufacturing index hit a 10-year low last Friday. We also get new UK car sales figures, which are expected to show sales hit a six-year low in 2019. The agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for December: Expected to rise to 52.4, from 51.9 in November, showing faster growth 9am GMT: UK car sales figures for December, and 2019 9.30am GMT: UK services PMI for December: Expected to drop to 49.1, from 49.3 in November, showing another contraction 2.45pm GMT: US services PMI for December: expected to rise to 52.2 from 51.6, showing faster growth",

      "body": "<p>How would any of us know it was new year if the papers weren\u2019t full of articles about how to improve ourselves written by people so clueless about life that they opted for the media as a long-term career? Such guidance has been especially prevalent this year, maybe because it\u2019s a new decade or maybe because these kinds of articles are a lot easier and cheaper to produce than proper investigative journalism \u2013 who really can say? But I would like to draw everyone\u2019s attention to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chris-evans-the-moment-i-saw-the-light-and-turned-my-life-around-0xxbm7r9g\" title=\"\">one article</a> published over the weekend, about how we can all lead better lives, written by none other than British radio\u2019s own Chris Evans (as opposed to Hollywood\u2019s own Chris Evans). Because, truly, no one is better qualified to give life guidance than a man who, in 2000, at the age of 34, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-407792/Billie-Piper-Chris-Evans-saved-life.html\" title=\"\">gave the then 18-year-old Billie Piper a silver Ferrari</a>, even though she didn\u2019t know how to drive.</p> <p>Ah, but that\u2019s all very much in the past, Evans assures us, because he is now ENLIGHTENED. He proves this at some length in an article that itself seems to defy the very notion of space and time, with observations including: \u201cNewton saw his falling apple one day and declared: \u2018Look! Gravity!\u2019 That was his identity that day, he became the gravity guy. But what about the tree whence the apple fell? The tree that had defied his gravity in the first place, rising skywards, majestically, towards the stars.\u201d The headline on the article is I Have Seen the Light, but the editors could have saved themselves a few characters and just titled it, more accurately, Made Ya Think.</p> <p>Evans thrillingly reveals all the things he has learned with such aper\u00e7us as: \u201cEverything you really want, you already have\u201d (probably true of a man who owns <a href=\"https://buzzdrives.com/27-cars-owned-by-top-gears-chris-evans-2/\" title=\"\">one of the most expensive car collections in the country</a>) and: \u201cWe say: \u2018I am not myself today,\u2019 but we never say: \u2018Myself is not my I today.\u2019\u201d Made ya think!</p> <p>On and on it goes, with Evans \u2013 who earns \u00a32m a year on Virgin Radio \u2013 counselling readers that they shouldn\u2019t \u201cseek to be enriched and find yourself enslaved\u201d and \u201cour need to go on holiday [is] completely surplus to who we really are\u201d. (Quite how this fits with Evans\u2019 instruction that in order to have a happy life one must \u201chave at least two holidays booked at all times\u201d is, alas, not explicated.)</p> <p>If you\u2019re thinking: \u201cSounds like my man was given some Eckhart Tolle for Christmas,\u201d you would not be far wrong. Tolle \u2013 the favoured writer for all narcissists \u2013 has indeed shaped what I guess we can call Evans\u2019 \u201cthinking\u201d. But, true to form, Evans doesn\u2019t just like Tolle \u2013 he worships him. He is, Evans says, in a line that is a million times funnier than anything that was in Zoolander 2, \u201cmy No 1 guru\u201d; Evans has read The Power of Now every year for the past two decades, a habit that has been scientifically proven (maybe) to have a more corrosive effect on the brain than long-term cocaine use. \u201cManifestation is the art of making what you want to happen happen.

      "bodyText": "How would any of us know it was new year if the papers weren\u2019t full of articles about how to improve ourselves written by people so clueless about life that they opted for the media as a long-term career? Such guidance has been especially prevalent this year, maybe because it\u2019s a new decade or maybe because these kinds of articles are a lot easier and cheaper to produce than proper investigative journalism \u2013 who really can say? But I would like to draw everyone\u2019s attention to one article published over the weekend, about how we can all lead better lives, written by none other than British radio\u2019s own Chris Evans (as opposed to Hollywood\u2019s own Chris Evans). Because, truly, no one is better qualified to give life guidance than a man who, in 2000, at the age of 34, gave the then 18-year-old Billie Piper a silver Ferrari, even though she didn\u2019t know how to drive. Ah, but that\u2019s all very much in the past, Evans assures us, because he is now ENLIGHTENED. He proves this at some length in an article that itself seems to defy the very notion of space and time, with observations including: \u201cNewton saw his falling apple one day and declared: \u2018Look! Gravity!\u2019 That was his identity that day, he became the gravity guy. But what about the tree whence the apple fell? The tree that had defied his gravity in the first place, rising skywards, majestically, towards the stars.\u201d The headline on the article is I Have Seen the Light, but the editors could have saved themselves a few characters and just titled it, more accurately, Made Ya Think. Evans thrillingly reveals all the things he has learned with such aper\u00e7us as: \u201cEverything you really want, you already have\u201d (probably true of a man who owns one of the most expensive car collections in the country) and: \u201cWe say: \u2018I am not myself today,\u2019 but we never say: \u2018Myself is not my I today.\u2019\u201d Made ya think! On and on it goes, with Evans \u2013 who earns \u00a32m a year on Virgin Radio \u2013 counselling readers that they shouldn\u2019t \u201cseek to be enriched and find yourself enslaved\u201d and \u201cour need to go on holiday [is] completely surplus to who we really are\u201d. (Quite how this fits with Evans\u2019 instruction that in order to have a happy life one must \u201chave at least two holidays booked at all times\u201d is, alas, not explicated.) If you\u2019re thinking: \u201cSounds like my man was given some Eckhart Tolle for Christmas,\u201d you would not be far wrong. Tolle \u2013 the favoured writer for all narcissists \u2013 has indeed shaped what I guess we can call Evans\u2019 \u201cthinking\u201d. But, true to form, Evans doesn\u2019t just like Tolle \u2013 he worships him. He is, Evans says, in a line that is a million times funnier than anything that was in Zoolander 2, \u201cmy No 1 guru\u201d; Evans has read The Power of Now every year for the past two decades, a habit that has been scientifically proven (maybe) to have a more corrosive effect on the brain than long-term cocaine use. \u201cManifestation is the art of making what you want to happen happen. It is a real superpower available to us all,\u201d Evans continues, and there, I\u2019m afraid, I must manifest cutting him off. It is quite something how these guys all go the same way, isn\u2019t it? They make too much money and then decide to show their humility by adhering to some kind of cod quasi-mystical/religious theory that conveniently always puts them at its godlike centre.

      "bodyText": "When a gunman entered Sandy Hook elementary school and murdered 20 children and six adults after killing his mother in their home, the shock was so great you could assume that America would undergo a profound shift in consciousness. In addiction parlance, Sandy Hook was the rock bottom moment \u2013 where things are so bad you know they can no longer continue as is. After rock bottom, there is a choice: stasis and misery or growth and transformation. With Sandy Hook, many of us in Australia assumed that after the grief, there would be a reckoning: the National Rifle Association would lose much of its power and influence, its spokespeople and shills would become pariahs, and meaningful legislation would pass so that this tragedy wouldn\u2019t happen again. Right? Wrong. Since Sandy Hook, when much of the world said \u201cnever again\u201d, 2,348 mass shootings have occurred. The number rises every day. For America, a shift in national consciousness did occur, but powerful interests (and the politicians beholden to these interests) stopped growth and transformation. Stasis and misery followed. From the other side of the world, many Australians were confused and appalled. How hard can it be, we tweeted, lectured and hectored. Even our conservative former prime minister John Howard did the rounds of the US late-night shows to explain how he enacted radical gun reform measures, how Australia used the painful and shocking experience of the Port Arthur massacre to change and evolve. There was more than a hint of moral superiority in how much we liked telling Americans they must lay down their weapons, that they needed to wake up. But soon it will be our time to look in the mirror. This apocalyptic-seeming Australian summer is our Sandy Hook moment. We have to seize it and change our thinking, our priorities and our politics. In doing so we can change our country, our future, and transform ourselves into global leaders on climate change. These fires without precedent have the potential to profoundly shift the national consciousness. This summer could shake us awake \u2013 if we let it. But if we don\u2019t do it now, while things are raw and real, we never will. The alternative is bleak: another lost year, another lost decade. That\u2019s another year of willing yourself to forget that 49.7C day in Penrith, of trying to block out the pictures you saw on social media of charred animal carcasses and the ash you see falling from the sky and the image of the New Year\u2019s Day sky that turned black at 4pm, of the people you saw on television who tried not to cry when they said their house had burnt down, but were thankful to be alive.

Of the man who died in Batlow of a heart attack after helping defend his friend\u2019s home. Surely these things are powerful and terrifying enough to change us? What might our transformation look like? It might look like a simple acknowledgement of causation between climate change and this summer\u2019s fires. Transformation is recognising the facts: Australia is a climate vandal, led by wreckers. We are ranked the worst of 57 countries on climate policy. Australia is the largest exporter of coal to the world, a global top 10 deforester and a world leader in mammal extinction. Our carbon-loving prime minister, supported by the Murdoch media and fossil fuel industry, came into parliament carrying a lump of coal. Climate scientists have proven time and time again, the link between carbon emissions and global heating. The ferocity of these fires was predicted. Once this causation has been established in our minds, we can and we must demand that the government create a meaningful climate policy. The painful lessons of this summer could be transformative, if we allow them to be. Australia \u2013 having experienced the pointy end of the climate catastrophe \u2013 could become a leader in the global fight to reduce emissions. The alternative is stasis and misery \u2013 or even more awful (and currently unimaginable) \u2013 a worsening of the current condition, a death spiral. When rock bottom is hit, change can happen. Four thousand people evacuated to a beach on New Years Eve. This is rock bottom. The largest evacuation in Australia\u2019s history. This is rock bottom. One third of the koala population on the New South Wales mid-north coast being destroyed, and the entire ecosystem ravaged. Again, rock bottom. This is our Sandy Hook moment. We must seize it and demand an effective climate policy. Or nature will be forced to teach us her hard lessons \u2013 over and over and over again. Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>Ben Stokes missed the start of this tour to make sure he could pick up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/15/england-cricketer-ben-stokes-wins-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-award\" title=\"\">BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year </a>award in person after a stellar 2019. Six days into 2020 the all-rounder looks as if he is in the mood to hang on to that crown for another year.</p> <p>Following a record-equalling five catches in South Africa\u2019s first innings, Stokes pulverised the home bowlers during a remarkable 75-minute cameo in which 72 runs flowed from his bat off 47 balls. Those who remark that this form of the game is boring or that it needs to be altered should have been at Newlands as, powered largely by Stokes\u2019s brutal assault, England piled up 157 runs in a session comprising only 27 overs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/06/england-south-africa-second-test-day-four-match-report\">Jimmy Anderson strikes late but South Africa remain in hunt against England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forget the Hundred, this was sporting entertainment at its very best as Stokes put his foot to the floor, hammering seven fours and three sixes, to extend England\u2019s lead well beyond 400. It was cricket on fast forward and there was no need for fireworks, cheerleaders or player drafts to jazz up the \u201cproduct\u201d.</p> <p>Dominic Sibley\u2019s grind on Sunday had set up this scenario for Stokes, who started the day on nought following the dismissal of the nightwatchman Dom Bess to the final ball of the previous evening. Sibley resumed on 85 but at one point, with Stokes reaching his half\u2011century in 34 balls and in exactly 50 minutes, it appeared as if he would be beaten to the century mark by his batting partner even though he was on 95 at the time.</p> <p>Whatever it is about this ground, Stokes certainly likes it. Four years ago he hit the quickest Test double hundred by an England player \u2013 in 163 balls \u2013 and the second fastest by anyone when he bludgeoned 258. England drew that match on a flat pitch, yet the speed of Stokes\u2019s scoring on this fourth morning may prove crucial in the final reckoning of this contest that Joe Root\u2019s team will believe they can still win on the final day despite South Africa\u2019s stubborn resistance.</p> <p>What was so impressive about this particular contribution was how selfless it was. On 72 and with the landmark of a Test century in sight, many players would dial down the risk-reward ratio in terms of their shots. But not Stokes, England\u2019s vice-captain, whose leadership position within this group was officially restored last summer following the incident in Bristol that led to him being stripped of the role in 2017.</p> <p>By the time he holed out to the spin of Keshav Maharaj Stokes had a strike-rate of 153.19. Only two other England players have higher for a Test innings of 50 or more \u2013 Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff.</p> <p>There was one moment of danger during this latest Stokes masterpiece, when he was dropped on 38 off Kagiso Rabada. But it was the 28-year-old\u2019s most fluent batting display since that epic unbeaten 135 that almost singlehandedly helped England to chase down 359 against Australia at Headingley last summer. That, and his heroics in the World Cup final \u2013 where Stokes\u2019s bat again proved the difference in an altogether different classic against New Zealand at Lord\u2019s \u2013 meant he deservedly topped the vote for the the BBC award last month.</p> <p>The early signs this year are that this is a man determined to continue defining contests with his sheer force of will. Over the weekend his five catches in South Africa\u2019s first innings equalled the most by a fielder in Tests as he became the 12th player \u2013 not including wicketkeepers \u2013 to achieve the feat. This latest contribution with the bat, though, surpassed that and England might need him to conjure up something special with the ball on the final day at Newlands as they hunt for a series\u2011levelling victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>However this series ends up, Stokes will again be his country\u2019s key man across all formats this year. The England and Wales Cricket Board will hope he sprinkles some much-needed stardust on their new 100-ball competition when that starts in July. But for Stokes, a man who seemingly always rises to the big occasion, there is another global event he has the opportunity to dominate \u2013 the T20 World Cup in Australia this autumn.

      "bodyText": "Ben Stokes missed the start of this tour to make sure he could pick up the BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year award in person after a stellar 2019. Six days into 2020 the all-rounder looks as if he is in the mood to hang on to that crown for another year. Following a record-equalling five catches in South Africa\u2019s first innings, Stokes pulverised the home bowlers during a remarkable 75-minute cameo in which 72 runs flowed from his bat off 47 balls. Those who remark that this form of the game is boring or that it needs to be altered should have been at Newlands as, powered largely by Stokes\u2019s brutal assault, England piled up 157 runs in a session comprising only 27 overs. Forget the Hundred, this was sporting entertainment at its very best as Stokes put his foot to the floor, hammering seven fours and three sixes, to extend England\u2019s lead well beyond 400. It was cricket on fast forward and there was no need for fireworks, cheerleaders or player drafts to jazz up the \u201cproduct\u201d. Dominic Sibley\u2019s grind on Sunday had set up this scenario for Stokes, who started the day on nought following the dismissal of the nightwatchman Dom Bess to the final ball of the previous evening. Sibley resumed on 85 but at one point, with Stokes reaching his half\u2011century in 34 balls and in exactly 50 minutes, it appeared as if he would be beaten to the century mark by his batting partner even though he was on 95 at the time. Whatever it is about this ground, Stokes certainly likes it. Four years ago he hit the quickest Test double hundred by an England player \u2013 in 163 balls \u2013 and the second fastest by anyone when he bludgeoned 258. England drew that match on a flat pitch, yet the speed of Stokes\u2019s scoring on this fourth morning may prove crucial in the final reckoning of this contest that Joe Root\u2019s team will believe they can still win on the final day despite South Africa\u2019s stubborn resistance. What was so impressive about this particular contribution was how selfless it was. On 72 and with the landmark of a Test century in sight, many players would dial down the risk-reward ratio in terms of their shots. But not Stokes, England\u2019s vice-captain, whose leadership position within this group was officially restored last summer following the incident in Bristol that led to him being stripped of the role in 2017. By the time he holed out to the spin of Keshav Maharaj Stokes had a strike-rate of 153.19. Only two other England players have higher for a Test innings of 50 or more \u2013 Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff. There was one moment of danger during this latest Stokes masterpiece, when he was dropped on 38 off Kagiso Rabada. But it was the 28-year-old\u2019s most fluent batting display since that epic unbeaten 135 that almost singlehandedly helped England to chase down 359 against Australia at Headingley last summer. That, and his heroics in the World Cup final \u2013 where Stokes\u2019s bat again proved the difference in an altogether different classic against New Zealand at Lord\u2019s \u2013 meant he deservedly topped the vote for the the BBC award last month. The early signs this year are that this is a man determined to continue defining contests with his sheer force of will. Over the weekend his five catches in South Africa\u2019s first innings equalled the most by a fielder in Tests as he became the 12th player \u2013 not including wicketkeepers \u2013 to achieve the feat. This latest contribution with the bat, though, surpassed that and England might need him to conjure up something special with the ball on the final day at Newlands as they hunt for a series\u2011levelling victory. However this series ends up, Stokes will again be his country\u2019s key man across all formats this year. The England and Wales Cricket Board will hope he sprinkles some much-needed stardust on their new 100-ball competition when that starts in July. But for Stokes, a man who seemingly always rises to the big occasion, there is another global event he has the opportunity to dominate \u2013 the T20 World Cup in Australia this autumn. It is a trophy England would have won in India four years ago had Stokes not conceded four successive sixes to Carlos Brathwaite in the final over of the tournament in Kolkata. This year, then, offers a chance of redemption for Stokes in that particular format. If his 2020 continues like this, do not count against him correcting that blot on his career and inspiring England to another memorable victory.",

      "body": "<p>Labour\u2019s leadership contest starts on Tuesday. But the scale of December\u2019s election defeat is a challenge to all of us in the party, not just our next leader. So here are seven things the whole Labour party must now do.</p> <p><strong>1</strong><strong> Face the scale of defeat with humility</strong></p> <p>We didn\u2019t win the argument, we lost. For the fourth time in a row. The Tory party has more power now than for a quarter of a century \u2013 power to hurt the families, communities and public services we were fighting for.</p> <p>Our socialist party lost the majority of the working-class vote and fell behind in the very industrial towns that forged Labour and were hardest hit by Tory austerity. Labour values on equality, solidarity and social justice matter more than ever, and many people are crying out for a progressive government. But we couldn\u2019t persuade people this time and unless we get our act together, we could lose even more support in future.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just about perceptions of Jeremy Corbyn. Or Brexit. Or scepticism about our manifesto. It was about the fact that on every one of those issues a gulf has grown between the party and the voters we lost. The next leader has to bridge that gap but they won\u2019t stand a chance of doing so if the rest of us pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p><strong>2</strong><strong> Stop the factional infighting</strong></p> <p>We cannot be a narrow hard-left party. That doesn\u2019t reflect our values or history. Nor will we win next time if we collapse into polarised factional infighting. Parties are teams. If we can\u2019t compromise with each other, we can\u2019t hold any coalition of voters together.</p> <p>I stood against Jeremy last time \u2013 and while I agreed with him on tackling inequality and climate change, I criticised him on security and credibility. I was proud to be a minister in the last Labour government \u2013 a government that some current shadow cabinet members have strongly criticised.</p> <p>As a result, whether fair or not, I recognise there are many in our party who won\u2019t see me as the person to pull all sides of the party together following Jeremy\u2019s departure. And rebuilding towards a Labour government is more important than any one person. So I am really grateful to everyone who urged me to stand again but this isn\u2019t the time for me to do so. However, I\u2019m not going anywhere \u2013 the next leader needs support and we all need to keep fighting for the Labour government our country so badly needs.</p> <p><strong>3</strong><strong> Be a party for the whole country \u2013 not just a liberal-labour party for the cities</strong></p> <p>Being a broad church isn\u2019t just about left and centre. Through our history we\u2019ve included Fabians, trades unionists, Methodists and Marxists, middle class and working class, city and town, young and old, liberal and communitarian.</p> <p>Right now both the left and the centre wings of our party are concentrated in the cities, appealing to younger, more liberal and more middle-class voters \u2013 but drifting away from older, working class voters in towns. Brexit put that problem on steroids as leave voters in towns such as mine in Yorkshire felt neither Jeremy Corbyn nor Tony Blair were listening to them.</p> <p>I\u2019m worried too that some members from all sides of the party are criticising candidates for talking about patriotism. Of course we should be patriotic \u2013 if Labour can\u2019t show people we love our country, we won\u2019t ever get to be in government again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85cd28f0c1089c8883d22706c4dfde9374ad6d57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85cd28f0c1089c8883d22706c4dfde9374ad6d57/0_85_4340_2603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Blackpool during last year\u2019s general election campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Blackpool during last year\u2019s general election campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4</strong><strong> Learn to love the achievements of the last Labour government</strong></p> <p>If we keep slagging off the last Labour government, why are we surprised if voters don\u2019t want another one? On the doorstep when we pointed out Tory failures, too often people responded \u201cyeah, but was Labour any better?\u201d Actually yes \u2013 GP appointments within two days not two weeks, fewer kids in poverty, more police officers, more buses, fewer people sleeping on the street, more investment in our towns \u2026 I could go on.</p> <p>Of course Labour\u2019s future programme needs to be more radical and ambitious for the 2020s and not go back to 1997. Of course there are things that the last Labour government got wrong. But we also need to show how Labour can make a difference.</p> <p><strong>5</strong><strong> Be a strong and credible opposition, as well as a radical alternative government</strong></p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s government has to be held to account through forensic scrutiny \u2013 and that involves all of us, not just the new leader. Opposition is hard work but it matters. At stake is our NHS, our public services, the future of manufacturing industry. Britain is leaving the EU at the end of January and our future trading relationships will be crucial. We also have to be credible as an alternative government. It isn\u2019t enough to admit the manifesto was too crowded and wasn\u2019t believed if we still freak out when the leadership candidates tell us we can\u2019t have every new policy we want. Socialism is still the language of priorities.</p> <p><strong>6</strong><strong> Bring </strong><strong>kindness and integrity back into politics</strong></p> <p>The next leader must take strong action against antisemitism and they need all our support in doing so to stop racism or prejudice corroding our soul. But all of us have a responsibility to stop the abuse on and offline. I\u2019ve seen those on both the left and centre of our party accused by other members of being traitors. We should leave that kind of vitriol behind and stand up for something better.</p> <p><strong>7</strong><strong> Get involved</strong></p> <p>Don\u2019t despair. The first election I campaigned in was 1992 and afterwards I feared we would never win again. But I remember John Smith saying to young activists: \u201cAs long as people like you still join and fight for our party, I know we have a future.\u201d</p> <p>We are further behind than in 1992 and face bigger challenges, not least in Scotland. But we also still have great strengths and passion, amazing activists who worked hard for every vote and believe in a better Britain. And it feels like things change faster now so who knows what we can achieve if we try. So join. Or rejoin. Be part of this.</p> <p>Those who built the Labour party more than a century ago created something incredible \u2013 a party for ordinary decent people who believe we must stand together when one of us is struggling. We won\u2019t stop fighting for social justice. When we are strong, when we are broad, we change the world. That\u2019s what we must do again.</p> <p>\u2022 Yvette Cooper is the Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Baldessari was a towering figure in conceptual art. I mean, literally he was a towering figure: 6ft 7in to be precise. He was also incredibly important. His own work spread across painting, photography, film, video, artists\u2019 books, billboards and public sculpture. It was shown in more than 200 solo exhibitions, 1,000 group shows, and saw him appointed a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the 2009 Venice Biennale. Yet he was equally significant owing to his teaching at the California Institute of the Arts, where David Salle, Jack Goldstein, Mike Kelley, Tony Oursler, James Welling, Analia Saban, Matt Mullican and Liz Larner were among his students. Cindy Sherman and Barbara Kruger have both cited him an important influence on their work, too. In a 2012 video which purports to be a \u201cbrief history\u201d of the artist, narrated by Tom Waits (whom Baldessari requested personally, because he \u201chas a great voice\u201d), Baldessari is lauded as the \u201cgodfather of conceptual art\u201d, the \u201cmaster of appropriation\u201d and \u201ca surrealist for the digital age\u201d. For an artist whose career was spent removing every trace of his own authorship, it\u2019s ironic he\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve asked for an autograph: \u201cBALDESSARI\u201d in gappy block capitals inked in my copy of the catalogue to the artist\u2019s 2010 Tate Modern retrospective. Before all that, however, there was a young man forging a career in the then backwater art scene of California. His family was not a rich one; both Baldessari\u2019s parents were immigrants and, after obtaining a master\u2019s from San Diego State College, he taught first at a high school, then a community college and, one summer, a camp for juvenile delinquents.

When it comes to discussing all-round play, we shouldn\u2019t forget Stokes\u2019 fielding, which is as good as anyone in the world right now and as any England player in history.

Dom Sibley, England\u2019s answer to Desperate Dan, has, in between lunging awkwardly and munching cow pie, done what England\u2019s team of cavaliers has been desperate for someone to do: score slow (his first 50 runs took 50 overs), boring, unremarkable and steady runs. </p> <p>In the words of James Anderson \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been missing for a couple of years. Hopefully he\u2019s going to cement his place and will get confidence from this knock and go on tomorrow. More importantly, hopefully he can go on in his career in the next few years.\u201d</p> <p>Sibley will start tomorrow just 15 short of a century, with the middle-order guns for company. By mid-morning drinks he should be nearly there - the perfect morale booster for the rest of the tour and just what England need with his opening partner Rory Burns now likely to be nursing his ankle and off cricket for the rest of the winter.<br></p> <p> Of course there\u2019s always the possibility that England will pull out of their classic collapses - South Africa lost their last 7 wickets for 66 after all. But with a lead of 264 already, and a change in the wind direction to help the fast bowlers, another 50-100 runs and they\u2019ll be safe. Safeish. Pretty safe. Let\u2019s settle on safe enough. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T00:53:32.874Z\">at 12.53am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company and emails. I\u2019ll leave you with Vic\u2019s report from Cape Town. Please join Simon and Tim tomorrow morning for the final day\u2019s play; it\u2019ll be worth it. Close of play England need eight wickets for victory tomorrow, South Africa 312 runs. We can probably discount the latter, Quinton de Kock notwithstanding, but the home side have a decent chance of batting out a draw. Their key men are the debutant Pieter Malan, who has already survived 193 balls for his 63, and the captain Faf du Plessis. England will take encouragement from the hint of reverse swing that Jimmy Anderson found late in the day to set up and then dismiss Zubayr Hamza. That could prove decisive, especially with the pitch offering little to the seamers or spinners. 56th over: South Africa 126-2 (Malan 63, Maharaj 2) England give Malan a single off Curran\u2019s first delivery, an unusual tactic that allows them to bowl at Maharaj. He is beaten, chasing a wide yorker, but there are no other alarms and he will return tomorrow morning. That\u2019s stumps. 55th over: South Africa 123-2 (Malan 62, Maharaj 0) Anderson almost gets another one, with the nightwatchman Maharaj beaten all ends up. I thought it was the last over of the day. In fact it was Anderson\u2019s last over, and there will be one more at the other end. Anderson has always been so good at finding a way to take a wicket late in the day, and he\u2019s done it again at the age of 37. Having set Hamza up with a few reverse inswingers, he got one to straighten just enough to take a thin edge as Hamza pushed forward defensively to cover any inswing. Jos Buttler did the rest, tumbling to his right to take a good two-handed catch. That is just brilliant from Anderson. Anderson has done it in the last over of the day! 54th over: South Africa 123-1 (Malan 62, Hamza 18) Sam Curran replaces Ben Stokes for the last over at this end. Nothing happens. Pieter Malan has played an almost flawless defensive innings. \u201cHi Rob, Happy New Year,\u201d says Robert Ellson. \u201cI do hope the ICC\u2019s cricket committee have enjoyed the first four days of this very compelling match.\u201d 53rd over: South Africa 122-1 (Malan 62, Hamza 17) With three overs remaining today, Jimmy Anderson replaces Joe Root. He has always prided himself of taking vital wickets at the end of long days, especially on flat tracks. Another here, especially that of Malan, would be precious. There is some reverse swing back into Malan, who offers no stroke to the first two deliveries. The second was pretty close, though I\u2019m loath to call it a dodgy leave given how good Malan has been outside off stump. A maiden. 52nd over: South Africa 122-1 (Malan 62, Hamza 17) Stokes to Hamza, round seven. Hamza does the sensible thing by pushing the ball to mid-on and getting the hell down the other end. A single from Malan brings up the second fifty partnership of the innings - this time with only one boundary. South Africa have managed risk superbly. Hamza survives the remainder of the Stokes (working-)over. Well played. \u201cFrom memory, Mark Waugh spent much of his time at first slip, especially once Mark Taylor retired (from where he famously tried to sledge Jimmy Ormond),\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cFreddie, on the other hand, had to wait to even migrate to second slip. For much of his early career the first two spots were occupied by Trescothick and Strauss. Botham, on the other hand, was an almost immediate shoo-in for the number two slot. Although his \u2018hands on knees\u2019 technique provoked criticism, a few seasons of snaffling edges off Joel Garner had already turned him into a fine slipper by the time he reached the England side. He also benefitted from a era where quick bowlers were expected to stand there - both Willis and Hendrick did so for England - rather than at fine leg.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it Warne 1, Mark Waugh 2? Oh I don\u2019t know, it was forever ago. 51st over: South Africa 119-1 (Malan 61, Hamza 16) Malan moves into the sixties with a pleasant drive for two off Root. Kevin Pietersen, commentating on Sky Sports, is full of praise for Malan\u2019s temperament and technique. He\u2019s not the only one, but his view is worth more than most. From the wreckage of 2019, South Africa have found some really promising newcomers. 50th over: South Africa 117-1 (Malan 59, Hamza 16) England are giving Malan the single so that Stokes can bowl to Hamza. Nasser Hussain did that once to get an out-of-form Steve Waugh on strike during the 2002-03 Ashes; imagine the four-letter comedy of Waugh\u2019s internal monologue at that precise moment. Actually, you don\u2019t have to, I\u2019ve found it in Waugh\u2019s book: It was Under-10 stuff by Nasser, intended to take the piss out of me and let his quick bowler have his way with me. The tension was stimulating and I wanted confrontation, but I needed to let off some steam. \u2018You smart-arse prick!\u2019 seemed to cover that objective pretty well. To me, it was about respect. Back in 2019-20, Malan does take a single, allowing Stokes four balls at Hamza. The second of those is a jaffa that that roars past the edge. This is some hot, hot heat from Stokes, but Hamza is hanging in there. 49th over: South Africa 116-1 (Malan 58, Hamza 16) Joe Root replaces Dom Bess, starting around the wicket to Malan. He plays a rare loose stroke, mistiming a sweep and gloving the ball over the head of Stokes at leg slip. England have tried everything today. We certainly can\u2019t criticise them for not thinking outside the box. \u201cJust how flipping King of the Valley have you just made me feel?\u201d says Damian Clarke. \u201cSkipper always used to put me at second slip, even though my ego said Please, Boss, Cover! Can\u2019t wait for my wife to get home. She\u2019ll be absolutely thrilled at my planned evening\u2019s monologue.\u201d 48th over: South Africa 113-1 (Malan 55, Hamza 16) Hamza, reaching outside off stump at a short ball, clunks Stokes this far short of Broad at extra cover. He then flaps a bouncer unconvincingly into the leg side before being hit on the armpit as he tries to jump inside the line. Although Stokes is now bowling over the wicket, I think he was given an official warning for running on the pitch earlier in the over. That aside, it\u2019s been a brilliant spell from Stokes. \u201cSiamese Dream by the Smashing Pumpkins is not the best album ever,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cBut it makes me feel things. Fernando Torres is not the greatest player to play for Liverpool. But I got unbelievably excited when the ball was at his feet. Matthew Arnold is not history\u2019s greatest poet. But \u2018Dover Beach\u2019 has a final stanza that I find incredibly moving. Ben Stokes is not the greatest English all-rounder. But he brings something viscerally exciting to the table.\u201d And it\u2019s a lot more viscerally exciting than the phrase \u2018viscerally exciting\u2019. 47th over: South Africa 113-1 (Malan 55, Hamza 16) Five from Bess\u2019s over. I think it\u2019s a mistake to persist with him tonight, and I\u2019ll keep banging on about it until fate decides to shut me up. \u201cI just meant the teams they\u2019ve been in haven\u2019t actually been tremendously successful (compared to the best teams of their time)!\u201d says David Murray. \u201cSo can they really be such great matchwinners? PS England could still lose this...\u201d I think they can, but each his own. I wouldn\u2019t worry about England losing this unless de Kock takes matters into his own hands. South Africa won\u2019t risk it. 46th over: South Africa 108-1 (Malan 52, Hamza 14) Stokes winces after bowling one short ball to Malan. I think it\u2019s his side, though he has no problem finishing the over. Another maiden to the hugely impressive Malan. Stokes looks absolutely shattered, so I fully expect him to bowl the remaining four overs at this end. \u201cEnjoyed the discussion on our all-rounders,\u201d says Paul in Manchester. \u201cJust wondered why are they all brilliant at second slip? Rather than say in the covers? Or rather than first slip?\u201d Stokes would be good anywhere, Flintoff and latterday Botham less so I suspect. The slip question is a good one. I assume it\u2019s just that second slip is the most important position \u2013 Mark Waugh, probably the greatest of all, fielded there I think \u2013 and that they would have been equally good at first. 45th over: South Africa 108-1 (Malan 52, Hamza 14) Bess has now moved around the wicket to the right-handers, which theoretically brings both edges into play, but in truth he is struggling to threaten either. \u201cEngland have used seven bowlers before any one of the has bowled 10 overs,\u201d says Michael Duggan. \u201cHas this happened before in a Test? I wouldn\u2019t even know how to begin asking Statsguru.\u201d I suspect even Travis Basevi, the hulking genius who invented Statsguru, wouldn\u2019t know how to ask that. I suspect it\u2019s happened a few times in the past - perhaps in this match - but couldn\u2019t be sure. 44th over: South Africa 106-1 (Malan 51, Hamza 13) Stokes has decided it\u2019s time for some rough stuff from round the wicket. Rough is the operative word, as it might also be with a view to leaving a few footmarks outside the right-hander\u2019s off stump for Dom Bess. Kumar Dharmasena has a word about his follow through halfway the over, in fact, so Stokes moves over the wicket for the final delivery. A maiden to Malan, who dealt with the short stuff comfortably. 43rd over: South Africa 106-1 (Malan 51, Hamza 13) Malan drives Bess for a single to reach a very impressive half-century on debut. It\u2019s been a calm, accomplished innings: 144 balls, two fours, umpteen well-judged singles. I think England should bring back Anderson at this end, as nothing much is happening for Bess. Do you hear that, fate? Can you hear me now? Nothing is happening for Bess. Sweet bugger all. D squat. Nuttin. 42nd over: South Africa 103-1 (Malan 49, Hamza 12) A lovely delivery from Stokes follows Malan and hits him near the breastbone. It would be such a cliche if Stokes ripped out a couple of wickets before the close. There are 13 overs remaining. \u201cSeems clear to me that Stokes is the best batsman, Flintoff the best bowler, Stokes the best fielder and Flintoff the most X-factor, which can only mean that England\u2019s greatest allrounder is Botham,\u201d says James. \u201cAnyway, statistics show that Alastair Cook has a Test average of 47 with the bat and 7 with the ball.\u201d And the best Bob Willis impersonation, so he wins in the crowd-pleasing department as well. 41st over: South Africa 100-1 (Malan 46, Hamza 12) Bess gets one to kick at Hamza, who lets it go past his body and down the leg side for four byes. A bit more encouragement for England, though. That\u2019s drinks. 40th over: South Africa 96-1 (Malan 46, Hamza 12) Ben Stokes comes into the attack. He has a bowling average of 33.38, higher than those of Mark Ealham, Dermot Reeve and Richard Illingworth. He starts with a no-ball before hitting a good length with a bit of lift to Malan. As throughout the innings, Malan shows immaculate judgement outside off stump. 39th over: South Africa 95-1 (Malan 46, Hamza 12) It\u2019s not compulsory for England to bowl a spinner at the Kelvin Grove End, but that\u2019s what Joe Root has done since Bess came into the attack. There isn\u2019t much happening for him - a bit of turn, but not much bounce. South Africa must be starting to fancy their chances of drawing this match. 38th over: South Africa 90-1 (Malan 44, Hamza 9) Broad turns Malan round with a good delivery that takes a leading edge and dribbles into the off side. England really need at least one more wicket tonight, and I\u2019m surprised we haven\u2019t seen Ben Stokes yet. \u201cPulling off miracles every now and then is fine,\u201d says OB Jato, \u201cbut I think we can all agree that Colin de Grandhomme is the daddy of Test all-rounders?\u201d Don\u2019t. I still wake up most mornings in a cold sweat, eight overs into his spell in the World Cup final, the walls inexorably closing in. 37th over: South Africa 89-1 (Malan 43, Hamza 9) Enough with the emails for a bit, I keep missing the actual cricket. The impressive Malan skids back in his crease to force consecutive deliveries from Bess for two and then three. He\u2019s an alert runner, Malan, and his hit only two boundaries in his 43. 36th over: South Africa 83-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 8) \u201cFlintoff is a bit like Harmison,\u201d says Stephen Wolstencroft. \u201cWhen he was on it he was a world beater, but there were too many series when he was nowhere near his best and/or drunk at sea. Stokes is more consistent, a better batsman, and has a habit of taking key wickets and of bowling Flintoff-like endurance spells. Freddie is better at chess, though.\u201d Not sure I agree with that. As a batsman, certainly, but as a bowler I thought Flintoff was consistently excellent from around 2004 until his knee packed in, and even then he produced that epic spell in the 2009 Lord\u2019s Test against Australia. Flintoff\u2019s C-game was miles better than Harmison\u2019s, in my humble one. Stokes is a much better batsman, though, even though Freddie did have a golden period from 2003-06. I\u2019d say Stokes is closer to Botham, who was also technically excellent, as a batsman. 35th over: South Africa 83-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 8) Dom Bess replaces Joe Denly, who did his job by getting rid of Dean Elgar. I\u2019m still not convinced Elgar hit it, but hey ho. There\u2019s a suggestion of turn to Hamza, who inside-edges one delivery onto the pad and short of the man at short leg. An accurate start from Bess. 34th over: South Africa 83-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 7) Broad goes wide on the crease to Hamza, who edges along the ground for four. England only have two slips anyway and that was well wide of them. It\u2019s hard yakka out there. England have 21 overs to take another wicket or two. \u201cRe. your 30th over comments,\u201d says David Murray. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this slightly ignore the fact that Stokes, Flintoff and even Botham perhaps didn\u2019t actually win all that many matches compared with the very best?\u201d That depends how you define matchwinning, I suppose. Jason Roy and Jos Buttler won the Headingley Test of 2019, but they scored 23 runs between them. 33rd over: South Africa 78-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 3) Hamza gets off the mark with a confident cut off Denly. He looks much less threatening to the right-handers from over the wicket than he did to Elgar. It might be worth trying to attack from round the wicket. \u201cLook at what Stokes did today to set up a match-winning scenario,\u201d says David Kelsey. \u201cHe came out and (elegantly) clumped 72 off 47. He could have done things very differently but he played the scenario for the team; and he does this all the time. Averages are useful, context is usefullerererererer.\u201d Yes but context, like lunch, is difficult. That\u2019s why most people treat averages as gospel. Anyway, Stokes and Kallis are so different that there\u2019s no point trying to compare them. It\u2019s like comparing an epochal orgasm and a massive bank balance. 32nd over: South Africa 73-1 (Malan 36, Hamza 0) Stuart Broad replaces Sam Curran (6-2-9-0). That\u2019s a bespoke bowling change, as Broad has dismissed Zubayr Hamza in every innings in this series. Hamza looks keen to get off strike, but does the next best thing by surviving the last four balls of the over. \u201cThe running down the wicket in the Oz match was innocuous in the extreme,\u201d says Martin Turnbull. \u201cCan you let David Murray know that his accusation will be remembered come the next Ashes. Looking forward to seeing the Poms put to the sword next year: 4-1 is my early prediction.\u201d What makes you so confident England will win the fifth Test? 31st over: South Africa 73-1 (Malan 36, Hamza 0) Denly continues, although he\u2019s now bowling to two right-handers. He\u2019d prefer to bowl to a left-hander, though none are due in until Quinton de Kock. 30th over: South Africa 72-1 (Malan 35, Hamza 0) \u201cIs it just me or is \u2018XX can\u2019t be judged by statistics\u2019 standard English cricket fan speak for \u2018not actually that great\u2019?\u201d says Indy Bagral. \u201cYou all love to harp on about single standout performances, but part of what makes such performances stand out is the dross that surrounds them. Stokes\u2019 4th innings at Headingley will live on in folklore but it politely ignores the fact that if he hadn\u2019t got himself out chasing a wide one at 30 odd for 3 in the first innings, maybe some Hollywood heroics wouldn\u2019t have been necessary in the first place? It\u2019s always been a personal conviction of mine that this English preference for a highlights reel over boringly consistent actual brilliance is what keeps them from ever being the best for any sustained period of time.\u201d I know what you mean, but I don\u2019t particularly agree. I don\u2019t have time to reply, properly, but I\u2019ll always believe there is a small group of selfless matchwinners (Adam Gilchrist was another) whose impact cannot be conveyed through averages. 29th over: South Africa 71-1 (Malan 34, Hamza 0) That was Joe Denly\u2019s first Test wicket. Elgar pushed tentatively outside off stump at Denly and was given out caught behind. He reviewed straight away, thinking his bat had hit the ground. There was the smallest spike on UltraEdge as the ball went past the edge, and then another spike as the bat hit the ground. That was enough for the third umpire to uphold the original decision. My instinct is that Elgar didn\u2019t hit it, but I suppose there wasn\u2019t enough evidence for the third umpire to overrule. Joe Denly has struck! It\u2019s a pretty controversial dismissal, which was upheld on review, but Elgar has gone. 28th over: South Africa 64-0 (Malan 29, Elgar 32) This is good stuff from Curran, who is using plenty of variations in an attempt to make something happen. If Anderson and Broad are the classical interrogators, then Curran is more like Manny from Black Books. That over, a maiden to Elgar, was the fifth of his spell. He might have one more before Ben Stokes, who is a different kind of cop, replaces him at this end. 27th over: South Africa 64-0 (Malan 29, Elgar 32) 26th over: South Africa 61-0 (Malan 28, Elgar 30) Curran switches over the wicket to Malan, who edges a good delivery along the floor to second slip. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says David Murray. \u201cInteresting to read about Warner and Labuschagne both getting penalised for running down the pitch (presumably trying to make things easier for Lyon in the fourth innings). Australia still not averse to a bit of cheating?\u201d I haven\u2019t seen it, but I\u2019d be surprised if it was deliberate. It doesn\u2019t make much sense, as they were going to win anyway and we\u2019re still in the PR years. 25th over: South Africa 60-0 (Malan 28, Elgar 29) \u201cHappy new year Rob, and to all those who read the OBO,\u201d says Chris Drew. \u201cTalking of the leg spin bowling of Marn\u0175s fach for Australia, he was also the second highest wicket taker for Glamorgan last season. I\u2019m trying to contain my excitement for the new season...\u201d He won\u2019t just trouble the scorers, he\u2019ll have them begging for mercy. 24th over: South Africa 57-0 (Malan 27, Elgar 27) Sam Curran continues at the other end, the one with the crack. Malan takes a sharp single to mid-off, a reflection of South Africa\u2019s positive intent since tea. They\u2019ve scored 10 in two overs, all in ones and twos. 23rd over: South Africa 52-0 (Malan 24, Elgar 26) There are 33 overs to bowl this evening. England probably need at least two wickets in that time to ensure a decent night\u2019s sleep. The part-time legspinner Joe Denly, who looked dangerous before tea, has Elgar in trouble straight away. His third ball spat from the rough to hit Elgar on the arm guard and loop wide of Buttler. England thought it was a chance, with Buttler stretching desperately in an unsuccessful attempt to take the catch, but replays showed it wouldn\u2019t have been out. Later in the over Malan pushed a single to bring up a solid fifty partnership. \u201cStokes v Flintoff?\u201d says Tom Carver. \u201cChildren of their times and can\u2019t be compared. Stokes is a millennial striving to be the best version of himself. Flintoff was a naughty noughties boozer mainly striving to have fun and play some cricket along the way. Stokes is the better player, applies himself more assiduously and will end up with better stats, but Flintoff will be remembered more fondly.\u201d Depends whether you\u2019re X or Y, surely? Tea South Africa have a chance of saving this match. England are still strong favourites, with four sessions remaining, but the pitch isn\u2019t doing a lot and South Africa know their way round a fourth-innings rearguard. See you in 15 minutes for the final session. 22nd over: South Africa 46-0 (Malan 23, Elgar 21) Joe Root brings himself on for the latest before tea. A lot goes on but nothing happens, and South Africa go to tea unscathed. Pieter Malan and Dean Elgar have played impressively. 21st over: South Africa 44-0 (Malan 22, Elgar 20) Denly enquires politely for LBW when Malan pushes forward with bat and pad together. Even if it was pad first, he was outside off stump. Another encouraging over from Denly, who will hopefully continue after tea. \u201cThe Stokes/Flintoff debate is getting a tad tedious,\u201d says Nacmac Bok. \u201cThe definitive answer to an allrounder debate is always Jacques Kallis.\u201d Even when the question is about English allrounders? 20th over: South Africa 43-0 (Malan 21, Elgar 20) Curran continues around the wicket to Malan. He leaves everything outside off stump, including a couple of deliveries that lift from a length. His judgement looks excellent. 19th over: South Africa 41-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 20) Another imaginative bit of captaincy from Joe Root, who has brought on Joe Denly to replace Dom Bess. There\u2019s a lot of rough outside the left-hander\u2019s off stump, and we saw how dangerous the part-time legspin of Marcus Labuschagne could be during the Ashes. Malan overbalances and is fortunate that the ball hits the pad and deflects wide of Buttler for a leg bye. Had it done so, that would have been a stumping chance. The next ball bursts from the rough to Elgar, who gloves it in the air on the off side. The delivery after that rips through the gate to hit Elgar in the chest, and he ends the over by missing a slightly flustered sweep stroke. A superb, mood-changing first over from Denly. 18th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 19) Sam Curran comes on to replace Jimmy Anderson. I think he\u2019ll be an important bowler today, with his variety, intelligence and golden arm. He goes straight around the wicket to the right-handed Malan, who offers no stroke to a ball that curves reasonably close to off stump. Another maiden, the fourth in five overs. \u201cInteresting debate about the best all-rounder,\u201d says Max in Germany, \u201cbut I think Stokes has the talent (and time) to be even more devastating than Kallis.\u201d What Stokes doesn\u2019t have, and probably never will, are Kallis\u2019s ruthlessness and concentration. That\u2019s why his career averages will be nowhere near as good. But you can\u2019t really judge Stokes by statistics. It\u2019s like trying to quantify love, or something. 17th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 19) Apologies, I\u2019m all over the show here. To be honest, very little is happening. South Africa are plodding along comfortably, England are getting no help from the pitch or the Kookaburra ball. 16th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Malan does well to shoulder arms and allow a lifter from Anderson to whistle past his armpit. He looks an accomplished old-fashioned opener, an observation supported by his first-class record: 10,000 runs at an average of 45. \u201cRe: Faf\u2019s debut rearguard hundred... look at AB\u2019s scoring rate in the second innings!\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cFor a guy with a reputation as a 360 degree player made for T20, he could bat out time when his side was under the cosh phenomenally well. Check this out against India in 2015. South Africa lost, but they batted 143 overs for 143 all out! De Villiers scored 43 from 297 balls!\u201d That team was great at putting the shutters up. The thing I love most about de Villiers\u2019 rearguard in Adelaide is that, six days later, he lashed 169 from 184 balls to win the series. Where do you even start with that level of brilliance? Headingley 2019, I suppose. 15th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Another economical over from Bess. He\u2019s not really threatening, though, and I\u2019d like to see Sam Curran have a few overs from that end. 14th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Sorry, I keep missing the actual cricket to attend to emails. The lack of excitement in the TV commentary suggests you\u2019re not missing much. \u201cI\u2019d agree re Freddie being a better bowler,\u201d says Boris Starling. \u201cYou rarely get the sense that Stokes is capable of turning a game with the ball the way he is with the bat, or that he could bowl an over like Flintoff\u2019s famous one at Edgbaston to get rid of Langer and Ponting in 2005. When it comes to discussing all-round play, we shouldn\u2019t forget Stokes\u2019 fielding, which is as good as anyone in the world right now and as any England player in history. If it came to picking one man to take a catch for my life, I\u2019d probably still have Mark Waugh, but Stokes would definitely be in the mix.\u201d Flintoff was an immense bowler. At his best, he was the most irresistible England bowler of my cricket-watching lifetime. Others did it for much longer, I realise. 13th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 19, Elgar 17) Bess has a slip and short leg for Malan, who looks comfortable in coming down the track to the offspinner. Three from the over. No sign of any bite for Bess at the moment. \u201cBased on this morning\u2019s evidence, we might be forgiven for thinking that Stokes cares more about England winning this match than nurturing his career average,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cThe man clearly has no future in the game - let\u2019s make him captain soon.\u201d He\u2019d be a shoo-in for an all-time Selfless XI. One of the best things about this morning\u2019s innings is that Stokes took two - one for the team one for Dom Sibley. In a parallel universe Stokes batted at a normal tempo, Sibley worried that he was holding the team back and got himself out for 93. 12th over: South Africa 34-0 (Malan 17, Elgar 17) Anderson changes ends to replace Broad (5-1-13-0), and Malan drives him crisply through extra cover for three. He\u2019s playing nicely. As is Elgar, who pings a boundary through mid-on off the next delivery. This is a test of England\u2019s patience. \u201cI\u2019d be quite up for a rearguard action here,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cRemember those? Mark Greatbatch or Andy Flower batting for seven sessions, jumpers for goalposts. Nowadays it\u2019s all Ben Stokes and Kusal Perera sort of nonsense. Be nice to be applauding Elgar off at the end of the match on 158 not out in a total of 8/360. Proper cricket.\u201d If anyone can, South Africa can. Faf du Plessis famously did it on debut, and that great side of the early 2010s had a few such rearguards. That said, those who really know their Onions would rather South Africa ended nine rather than eight wickets down. 11th over: South Africa 27-0 (Malan 14, Elgar 13) Malan uses his feet to drive Bess for a single, something South Africa didn\u2019t really do in the first innings. That\u2019s drinks, which comes at a decent time for England\u2019s thinktank. \u201cNot sure why commentators are in a funk about letting Broad have a few overs out in the middle,\u201d says Tom Atkins. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time, he could use the practice out in the middle and for me the psychological value of making bowlers toil pointlessly and the openers sweat out on the field shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d Most people are disproportionately angry about something these days. And if you don\u2019t agree, I\u2019ll fill you in. 10th over: South Africa 26-0 (Malan 13, Elgar 13) There isn\u2019t a huge amount happening for Broad. This could be a case for Mulde- Sam Curran, who has the ability to take wickets in unusual ways. 9th over: South Africa 23-0 (Malan 11, Elgar 12) Joe Root decides to play a bit of slap-bass, bringing Dom Bess on first change. Nothing to report in his first over, but a nice, attacking move from England. \u201cStokes versus Flintoff - hard to judge as Stokes still has a long way to go,\u201d says David Murray. \u201cBut for me he\u2019s far more talented. Flintoff isn\u2019t even in the top 10 best bowlers for England, whereas if it wasn\u2019t for his suspension I think we\u2019d be already talking about Stokes as one of our best-ever batsmen. And he could almost be in the team as a specialist fielder. Flintoff also had the advantage of playing in a good team.\u201d I think it\u2019s closer than that, and I wouldn\u2019t put Stokes in England\u2019s top 50 batsmen. I also think Flintoff has become a little underrated since he retired. But I\u2019d definitely put Stokes above him, mainly because he wins at Top Trumps in the Miracles category. 8th over: South Africa 21-0 (Malan 10, Elgar 11) Elgar hooks Broad for a single. He had plenty of time to play that stroke, another indication that the pitch has lost some of its zing. The moment I type that, Malan does well to get on top of a much nastier lifter. That might have hit a crack. 7th over: South Africa 20-0 (Malan 10, Elgar 10) Thanks Tanya, morning everyone. It looks like England are going to have to work pretty hard for these 10 wickets. At least they didn\u2019t use up their second review on that appeal in Anderson\u2019s previous over. Umpire Smyth, officiating from his office, thought it was out when he saw it live. And that\u2019s it from me as I trot off to buy emergency school shoes and handover to Rob Smyth to take you through to stumps. Thanks for all the emails and tweets, sorry I wasn\u2019t able to publish them all, an avalanche in my inbox this morning! What a bloody great day\u2019s cricket. 6th over: South Africa 18-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 9) A maiden for Broad, as the fielders shoo away the lurking Hadeda. In his office, John Robbins has a keen eye for literals. Following the OBO at work on a slow day at the office. So slow in fact that David Stocker\u2019s Bulgarian winter reminded me of the winter I spent in Romania, in Galati. So cold, the Danube froze over and I could have taken a stroll across to the Ukraine. Everything worked \u2013 busses, trams, my Dacia Logan, and the heating in my flat was so good (powered by surplus energy from the local steel mill) I had to open the window\u2026 No no-balls, but a couple of superfluous apostrophes in David\u2019s post. (I told you it was a slow day in the office). 5th over: South Africa 18-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 9) Anderson carrying more of a threat at the moment. He seems to have Malan caught by a diving Buttler as the slips rise up. Behind the stumps, much discussion as to whether to appeal but Anderson is already walking back shaking his head. With a quick glance towards the back of his retreating fast bowler, Root decides not to press ahead with a review. Wise decision - the noise was pad on pad. More judicious leaving from Malan. 4th over: South Africa 17-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 8) Elgar and Malan play out Broad\u2019s over without much to get excited about. AH! A reference to this I assume? 3rd over: South Africa 14-0 (Malan 9, Elgar 5) Ah, just been reminded that Malan is making his Test debut, which makes that leaving in the first over all the more impressive/foolhardy. He shoulders arms again to Anderson here, in between knocking a couple of twos. 2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (Malan 5, Elgar 5) Elgar gets in on the act, through the covers for a nice cuppa tea and four malted milks. Broad\u2019s line improves and fourth ball he appears to thump Malan on the back pad. Broad\u2019s arms pump up and down like a demented marionette and, with seconds to spare, Root reviews. The replay shows the ball squeezing between front pad and bat, just trimming the edge of bat before hitting Elgar high on the back pad. Genrous Joel Eley\u2019s cup floweth over : Following from Kuala Lumpur, it seems that a recipe for success as an England all-rounder is not to be a perfect role model. All have had front page headlines. However all have provided life long memories, Botham 1981, Flintoff 2005, Stokes 2019. Plus many others. Comparing stats does not do any of them justice as they go from sublime to ridiculous. However most of the the posts have not also considered how good they all were / are (in Stokes case) in the field. Beefy standing in front of keeper at 2nd Slip, Freddie run outs and Stokes only 5 catches in the last innings!! My moment of the World Cup was Nasser commentating after the catch \u201cNo way, you cannot do that Ben Stokes\u201d. Appreciate them all is what I say. 1st over: South Africa 4-0 (Malan 4, Elgar 0) Malan flicks Anderson\u2019s first rather ragged ball for four, then lets the third ball alone and the ball skims the side of off stump. Oooh and again, and again, four balls in a row. Either he knows this pitch very well or he\u2019s about to come to a rather embarrassing end. While Mark Slater wonders why Joe Root exposed Broad to a potential broken finger, Romeo is feeling for Dom Sibley: Sibley needed to reach 135 (and not get out) to end the match with a Test batting average of 40. 135 was also the score Little Marnus (Marn\u0175s bach to his real friends) needed to score in the first innings at Sydney to end the innings with an average of 60. Marnus managed it of course, but Root chopped Sibley off. Yikes! They\u2019re back out. Such riches from you lot as well. Derek Stocker in frosty eastern Europe: Hello Tanya from wintery Bulgaria. The snow is coming thick and fast. As a Zimbabwean I find winter in BG a tad challenging. Still my first winter here, staying in a caravan renovating our derelict cottage was almost the death of me. I sprung from my 7 sleeping bags woken from two enormous explosions. Lucky I wasn\u2019t dreaming of the Rhodesian bush war. Oh no! Chunks of orange ice all over the place. I don\u2019t know what temperature soda freezes at. The gas heater chugging out about 2 calories of heat and the interior like an industrial freezer. Two bottles of orange pop kerbam, kerbam. When I went out next morning the thermometer deserved a second glance...minus 37 centigrade. Almost Siberianesque. Still I survived without losing any digits and in 9 years I have not experienced cold like that again. Minus 20c has been the lowest. Anyway ma\u2019am to the sport of the Goddess...Extra\u2019s in this England innings. 22 extra\u2019s not a single no ball. That is crazy. 660 balls not a single no ball. Impossible. And Daniel Shepherd in hotter Dubai \u201calso a good time zone for OBOing\u201d A suitably fine discussion for a day like this when we can enjoy the greater moments of English cricket rather than wallow in the gloom. For me there are two things that haven\u2019t really been touched on. As two sublimely and naturally gifted players, the teams they played in is relevant. Stokes has become a wonderful batsmen in a team bereft of wonderful batsmen, whereas Flintoff led the bowling in a team full of decent batters. Would they have stepped up in the other discipline if they\u2019d swapped teams? And the acid test is which one would you pick? Obviously the team makeup, as mentioned, would affect it but, for me, Stokes gets the nod for his astonishing fielding. 111th over: England 391-8 (Sibley 133, Broad 8) And that is that. England declare with abounding riches, South Africa need 438 to win or have a day and three quarters to bat out. England, inspired by guts and glory from Sibley and Stokes, and with the fast bowlers well-rested, and the odd glitch in the pitch, should have this in the bag by elevenses tomorrow. 110th over: England 382-8 (Sibley 127, Broad 5) Slightly funny period of play this, just one off the over and Rabada slams a ball into Broad which he inexpertly defends off the splice. A couple of newbies - thanks so much for tuning/logging/clicking in. Steve Crick: Welcome to my first ever em such as this and I cannot pretend to cricket geekdom, but this live coverage makes me glad it\u2019s not on the telly, not R5 for that matter. Keep up the good work! Am I allowed a mention of The Bradford Bulls? But of course. And Kevin Tong: I just have a quick question/clarification, what do you mean by \u201cSouth Africa will now have to make the highest score in Test history to win the game\u201d? A quick google tells me there have been higher scores in test history. Sorry, I\u2019m a pretty new and naive follower of the game, haha. Sorry, I meant the highest score batting last to win the game. 109th over: England 381-8 (Sibley 126, Broad 5) Broad sweeps Maharaj fine and gallops off for a single, but it whizzes for four. He, with waterlogged boots, plays and misses his way through the rest of the over. More highlights news, thanks Andy Shaw. 108th over: England 377-8 (Sibley 126, Broad 1) Broad deals perfectly calmly with a short one from Rabada, knocking it into the covers for a single. I\u2019m trying to find out when England last managed 150+ runs in a session. They managed it twice last time they were in Cape Town back in 2016, with 150 runs exactly in the third session on day one, and 196 runs (!!) in the first session of day two, writes Michael Avery. Has it been done in the intervening period? Does anyone remember? Can someone reading the OBO get statsguru to work in a way that I can\u2019t (almost undoubtedly)? 107th over: England 375-8 (Sibley 125, Broad 0) A little consolation for Maharaj, as England send Stuart Broad out for what will undoubtedly be some short stuff. Perhaps an unnecessary risk, if he were to break his finger avoiding a snorter. Steve Castle has some succour for those of you without Sky. Thanks Steve. The only highlights I can find which are free are on Sky Sports\u2019 YouTube channel. They\u2019re not exactly exhaustive though, with each day\u2019s play squeezed into five minutes... Curran twonks the third ball of the day straight to midwicket. On Flintoff and Stokes, it is hard to divide the two, I think as some OBOers have said, Flintoff, like Botham before him, didn\u2019t nurture his body as he might have, so his career peak was relatively short. But Stokes is of a different era, his body is not his problem, unless it crumbles from over-use. Bad news for Pat Brown who had been due to play in the Big Bash. He has a lower back stress fracture, so has been withdrawn from England\u2019s ODI squad. They\u2019re back out. This lovely tribute was sitting in my inbox, from Simon Darvill. Had the silly bugger not died a couple of weeks before Christmas, today would have been my dad\u2019s 75th birthday. He was a long time club cricketeer who bowled a deceptive short run up right arm medium pace filler, competent with the bat and who actively chose to filed at silly mid off/on in an age before helmets and protection. He was an avid Northantamptonshire (or just \u201cThe County\u201d as they were known in our house) supporter and Test watcher. He was ambivalent to the allure of short form cricket (\u201cI was playing 20/20 years ago - all those evening games we played, what were they but 20/20?\u201d). Why do I tell you this? First because he would be absolutely loving this display of batting this morning and second to say thanks to him for giving me my love of cricket. For all the Sunday afternoons spent on the boundaries of cricket clubs around the Midlands, for all the hours watching Test matches and for taking me to see the County play Hampshire in the John Player League and getting to see Gordon Greenidge play in the flesh (even if his display was far from stellar that day). Cheers Dad. An unsuccessful lunch interval. I lost a couple of games of magnetic darts to my eleven year old and also failed to find the answer to a question a couple of you have written in to ask. Are there any terrestrial highlights of this series? I\u2019m spoilt by having Sky, but can\u2019t find any evidence of them online. Can anyone help? What a session for England! A wonderful debut century for Sibley - Mike Atherton has just outstatted most by calling it the first Test hundred for an England opener at Newlands since Jack Hobbs in 1910. He compares Sibley\u2019s powers of concentration with Alastair Cook - early days, but high praise. And Ben Stokes? An eye-popping, tongue-clicking, head-blowing cameo. Time for a quick stretch, back in a jiffy. 106th over: England 375-7 (Sibley 125, Curran 13) Delight for England, and a broad smile from Stuart Broad on the balcony, as a ball from Pretorius spits off the pitch and hits Sam Curran\u2019s top hand. Curran sends a four square and that is that. South Africa will now have to make the highest score in Test history to win the game. England lead 421, 157 runs in the session. Sibley is applauded off the pitch for the best lunch of his lifetime. 105th over: England 368-7 (Sibley 125, Curran 6) I\u2019m not sure how they measure this but Maharaj is getting more turn over the wicket than around. At least I think that\u2019s right, they whipped the stat away very quickly. Anyway, Curran flays him through the covers for four. Time, with lunch approaching, to chew over a declaration? Lead 414. 104th over: England 362-7 (Sibley 124, Curran 1) Nortje sends down four byes high and getting higher over a ducking Sam Curran and then over the head of a leaping de Kock. Not a happy bowler. Stokes v Flintoff, take 2: Dylan Pugh. I think although they\u2019re both obviously the premier pace allrounders of the time for England, their skillsets are very different.It boils down to the fact that Stokes is a world class bat who is a useful change bowler, whereas Flintoff was a world-class bowler, and a more than useful bat. You could make the argument that Freddie was the more naturally gifted of the two, but stokes ha a bigger hunger for runs. I\u2019m not convinced Freddie would have always made the team as a bat, and Stokes has played more and more tests as a pure batsman. And take three: Avitaj Mitra. On the whole, I agree with Chris. Stokes for me, is still a batsman who bowls while when I think of Freddie, it is as someone who was a very reliable third choice bowler capable of the odd brilliant innings.Similarities between the two of course being that both have played starring roles in one Ashes series each. When I am asked to recall Stokes\u2019 memorable performances, 2 or 3 immediately come to mind while for Freddie it was just the 2005 Ashes. (To be fair, what a sensational series that was) One thing we will never know however, is whether Stokes would have had the same effect that Freddie did, against \u201cthat\u201d Aussie team of bonafide legends. My personal view is no. To conclude:Average Stokes &gt; Average Flintoff (without a doubt)Peak Flintoff &gt; Peak Stokes (but only just) Buttler tries to scoop but it was too short and the ball falls into the gloves of de Kock. Short but glorious. 103rd over: England 356-6 (Sibley 123, Buttler 23) Sibley fine-edges Rabada for four and with that the England lead passes a stately 400. 102nd over: England 350-6 (Sibley 119, Buttler 23) Just the 14 from Nortje\u2019s over as Buttler practises his stand and swivel. The sweetest hook for six, some pulls interspersed with a couple of drives. Despite what he said the other day, Buttler looks in very good nick indeed. Ok Flintoff v Stokes, take one: Will Padmore. In regards to Chris Goater\u2019s question the bowling stats are actually very close. Flintoff has a lower bowling average (32.78 v 33.13) and better economy (2.97 v 3.34) but Stokes has more 5 wicket hauls (4 v 3) and a better strike rate (59.4 v 66.1). I\u2019m not sure anyone would argue that Flintoff was a better batsman, I suspect it was telling that there was no real thought of him continuing as a batsman when bowling became so problematic. I would also agree with Gough on the fitness point, I always felt that the shape Flintoff got himself in for the boxing match that he fought post retirement showed that he could have made more of an effort to look after himself more whilst playing (was he trying to emulate Beefy off the pitch as well as on?). Having said all of that being too young to have seen Botham in action, both Flintoff and Stokes are two of my all time favourites and have brought me much joy! 101st over: England 338-6 (Sibley 119, Buttler 9) Hey Jos, watch this! Sibley hauls himself down on one knee and sweeps Maharaj for SIX with casual violence. Next ball Maharaj fights back with an arm ball to get Sibley in a tangle, before Sibley responds with another sweep, this time for four. 100th over: England 327-6 (Sibley 109, Buttler 8) Nortje comes into the attack for the first time today and Buttler off-drives him for six! Like you do. Casually, in his tracksuit bottoms, skulking round the corner shop for a morning pick-me-up lucozade. 99th over: England 318-6 (Sibley 108, Buttler 1) Buttler and Sibley nurdle and nudge through Maharaj\u2019s over. A timely stat from Sky - nine wickets fell on the first two days, six on the second, two today. A glimmer of hope for South Africa? My lovely colleague Tim de Lisle has sent me this of Sibley\u2019s Warwickshire teammates. He\u2019s a very popular chap. 98th over: England 316-6 (Sibley 107, Buttler 1) Sibley and Pope dab Rabada around before Pope drags on. Briefly, it all got a lot slower but, heck, what does it matter. Anyway, Buttler is in now. Both he and Stokes average in the mid 30s. But is unfair to expect much more giving firstly, where Buttler bats, and secondly, Stokes\u2019s duties with the ball? Paul Hand sums up Sibley simply, but perfectly, all the way from Kazakhstan IMO a selfless and for the team innings. A good rest for the bowlers.England are almost in an unassailable position.Thanks Dom. Rabada comes wide of the wicket and Pope rocks back and gets an inside edge, plop, onto his stumps. 97th over: England 313-5 (Sibley 106, Pope 1) What an innings that was from Ben Stokes. Do catch the highlights later if you can. To be honest, the whole innings was a highlights package. The perfect combination of gay abandon and absolute skill. Plus he got Sibley safely to his hundred and England into a place of complete supremacy - lead currently 359. Ollie Pope gets off the mark with a reverse sweep off Maharaj. Ian Forth is a happy man too. Cape Town is an even more perfect timezone for expats following England from Australia. A tough day on the corporate coalface (incorporating a little snooze early afternoon in the car park) then the evening slot from 7.30 through to 3 am. Hopefully no one notices if you\u2019re not operating on all four cylinders the first week in January. I thought you lot had most of January off? Maharaj gets his man at last. Stokes gets down on one knee, but doesn\u2019t quite get the distance this time and the balls falls to van der Dussen at long on, who takes a more than decent catch, sliding down onto his ankles. Stokes walks off with the broadest of smiles. Just 47 balls, and a whole heap of joy. 96th over: England 310-4 (Sibley 105, Stokes 72) South Africa have spread the field, a field of du Plessis\u2019s nightmares. There is one slip and eight men on the boundary. And that\u2019s a partnership of 100 runs in 92 balls. Chris Goater has a cracking question. On Talk Sport Goughy has just said that he rates Stokes higher than Flintoff, partially because he thinks Flintoff was rarely fit enough to make the most of his talent. It is an interesting question. I don\u2019t think there is much doubt that Stokes is a better batsman. But as a bowler, he is nowhere near as good as Freddy, in my opinion. Flintoff\u2019s ability to bowl reverse, and especially his angle to left-handers, made him a much more genuine allrounder, in my opinion. But what does the wisdom of the OBO crowd think? 95th over: England 307-4 (Sibley 104, Stokes 70) Memories flooding back of Stokes\u2019s double hundred he gathered four years ago as he clobbers Maharaj with a wide-legged reverse sweep, a smash through mid-wicket and a stick-that-up-your-jumper casual six. Brutal. 94th over: England 294-4 (Sibley 104, Stokes 55) Three off Rabada, and that\u2019s drinks and the morning has gone better than England could have dreamt. South Africa, ye gods, have not had such a good morning. A special mention here to all those county cricket readers who have been championing Sibley for two or three years, and to him for churning out those hundreds for Warwickshire - it is his Championship performances that got him picked for England, no hunch, no admiration of his Vince-like flair. 93rd over: England 289-4 (Sibley 103, Stokes 54) Yes! Sibley sweeps Maharaj for four - such panache! He pumps the air, pulls off his helmet to reveal the broadest of smiles, gets a big hug from Ben Stokes, kisses the badge, and on the balcony everyone is standing and smiling, Sam Curran leaps in the air. What a cracking innings, playing to his strengths, doing it for the team. From Surrey to Warwickshire to England - here\u2019s to many , many more. The first century of the series too. 92nd over: England 282-4 (Sibley 99, Stokes 50) And that\u2019s the Ben Stokes 50 with a touch behind square and the Dom Sibley 99 as he edges Rabada, not completely convincingly, down to the boundary and on the England balcony everyone is smiling. Come on Dom! A lovely email from David Murray. What a morning! An England win in prospect and suddenly 3 or 4 choices for the-future-of-England cricket (Sibley, Pope, Crawley, Burns). Newlands is in the perfect timezone for following OBO back in the UK - none of this awful waiting around until 11.00am or staying up all night. Something to look forward to as soon as you switch on your computer. It\u2019s a perfect timezone for OBO-ing too! 90th over: England 277-4 (Sibley 95, Stokes 49) Stokes is seeing the new ball like a new year\u2019s resolution he needs to finish off, he reverse-sweeps Maharaj with such quick, loose hands. It is Jack Spratt and his Mrs Spratt out there in the middle for England but, oh, such a perfect combination. Especially with all the Christmas leftovers to finish off. 89th over: England 272-4 (Sibley 94, Stokes 45) Oh dear, nothing going for South Africa this morning. Stokes pulls Rabada high and a sprinting de Koch calls for it, he must cover 50 yards sprinting down towards fine leg, but then muffs the (difficult) chance. Stokes rubs salt into the wound by rocking back onto his heels, rolling his wrists and slamming a juicy full toss back over the boundary next ball. And that\u2019s the fifty partnership of which Stokes has scored 45! And now Sibley gets in on the act with a nicely played boundary through the covers. Charles Shedrick writes: Still in the bunker.... Following OBO for a little second-hand sunlight... What are the odds on Stokes getting to a ton before Sibley.... It\u2019s certainly possible... especially if South Africa keep sending down these fat, juicy, easy pickings. 88th over: England 261-4 (Sibley 90, Stokes 38 ) Sibley enters the 90s with a prosaic two off Maharaj into the leg side. It takes some mental strength to just plod away while a cartoon hero throws the bat at the other end. Michael Anderson, you\u2019re my hero Re John Starbuck\u2019s question 80th over, I took it upon myself to have a look through Root\u2019s declaration history as England captain. In 36 matches before this one he has declared nine times, winning six, drawing two, and losing that one against Shai Hope at Headingley in 2017. Don\u2019t know how this compares to other captains, but if it helps, of the six wins, the margins have been 211, 232, 239, innings and 119, innings and 159, innings and 209, so all quite safe. Whilst looking through, I noticed that our second innings total is often larger than our first. The total aggregate of runs doesn\u2019t help much because we don\u2019t always bat twice, but looking at our average runs per wicket since Root became captain: in first innings is 29.14, and in second innings 29.72. Ok pretty much identical. But surely there can\u2019t be many teams who average more in second innings that first? 87th over: England 259-4 (Sibley 88, Stokes 38 ) Philander trundels in and for no apparent reason turns carthorse as Stokes climbs into his farmyard galoshes and throws the bat for fours through backward point and square leg and runs any old place his can slam them. The England lead passes 300. 86th over: England 247-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 27) Maharaj is kept on with the new ball. Sibley almost in trouble from one round the wicket that spins past the outside of his prodding bat. He looks a little leaden footed, but survives. It\u2019s dusty out there. Oh Andy, that\u2019s harsh. 85th over: England 246-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 26) And we have the new ball at last, after that expensive experiment, in the rightful mitts of Vernon Philander bowling from the Wynberg end to restore some order. Sibley with that dot-to-dot stubble perfection prods the pitch to see out a maiden. Norje, incidentally, is back on the pitch. Tom! Tom! I hope you\u2019re still reading... a message to cheer up your Monday: Morning Tanya, Morning, Michael Robinson. First Monday back today and it\u2019s already a struggle. Cheers for providing some OBO respite. Can I just say that the 222/22.22 stat you posted earlier is hands down the best email input I\u2019ve ever seen to OBO. Excellent stuff. 84th over: England 246-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 26) Just a massive Stokes six, down on one knee, thanks very much, straight bat, straight legs, gorgeous. Maharaj get the better of him later in the over when a ball spins out of a huge puff of dust - more good news for England. 83rd over: England 236-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 16) That could be the end of the no ball. Ben Stokes decides to get his eye in by destroying Pretorius\u2019s morning confidence with a six farted straight back whence it came, followed by a reverse switch for four. He\u2019s got the bit between his teeth this morning, don\u2019t go anywhere. 83rd over: England 225-4 (Sibley 87, Stokes 5) 82nd over: England 223-4 (Sibley 85, Stokes 5) A disdainful swat from Ben Stokes dispatches Pretorius for the first boundary of the day. Still with the old ball here, apparently Anrich Nortje is not on the field, sick. An email pops up from Tom Bowtell entitled \u201cexciting Philander Stat.\u201d Morning Tanya! It\u2019s going to be a hugely tense day for stats lovers. A glance at Philander\u2019s current career stats shows he has 222 wickets at 22.05. However, if he concedes another 32 runs without taking a wicket, he\u2019ll momentarily have the holy grail career figures of 222 wickets at 22.22. There is so much that can go wrong: a wicket with the new ball, a selfish slog from a batter which skips the average from 22.21 to 22.23, there are even rumours he isn\u2019t fit, so he might not even bowl enough overs to concede the runs. All we can do is watch and hope. 81st over: England 219-4 (Sibley 85, Stokes 1) Ok, so that wasn\u2019t the last over with the old ball. du Plessis gives Maharaj a go from the other end. It was nearly a seven ball over actually as the umpire lost count of how many balls Maharaj had bowled. Not sure if they still transfer pebbles from hand to hand to count the over out. Just a single to Stokes with a sweep behind square 80th over: England 218-4 (Sibley 85, Stokes 0) Dwaine Pretorius bowls a last over with the old ball, Dom Sibley is watchful. A maiden. A few hazy clouds float above Table Mountain but the sky is blue and the temperature a blissful 22 degrees. John Starbuck has been musing in Yorkshire: Good morning, Tanya, from windswept Yorkshire. As a matter of curiosity, are there any stats on Root\u2019s declaration/win history? And how do they compare with other England captains? Who do you think I am, Rob Smyth? If Rob happens to be reading he\u2019s probably got those stats in his morning milk jug. If not, I promise to try and research at drinks. The players are on their way out, Dom Sibley has a new batting partner in Ben Stokes. A pre-start email! Hi Danny Outram. Whilst it was refreshing to see Dom Sibley\u2019s long drawn out openers innings, I hear time and time again that it is the duty of the openers to take the \u2018bite\u2019 out of the new ball and allow the lower order batsman to get their eye in with a scuffed cherry that has less zip to it. Therefore would it have not been better had Sibley given away his wicket 10 overs ago? Unless an opener carries his bat, what is the ideal time they should spend at the crease? I\u2019m not sure if there is an ideal time, it would all depend on game circumstances, pitch, weather etc etc. But I think in this England line-up which has such a propensity for collapsing, but such an abundance of stroke-players, actually staying in at one end and scoring, however slowly, gives the others the freedom to play their own game. Interesting interview with Graham Thorpe, England\u2019s batting coach . He talks about the simplicity of Dom Sibley\u2019s technique. Says he said to him, there\u2019s time to talk about the areas of where to develop your game but when you\u2019re in the heat of the battle keep doing what you do. Important to work on his technique outside off stump but without getting into his head too much. Vic Marks was on the radio this morning and saying that this is the first time England have ever played four players under 23 in the same match. I\u2019m not doubting Vic\u2019s stats, but can this really be true? Anyway, it looks a beautiful day at Newlands. Shaun Pollock is in a suit and Mike Atherton and Ian Ward are in shirt sleeves. Ward\u2019s hand is in his pocket, of course. The only other person I\u2019ve noticed with such a pocket obsession is Aussie PM Scott Morrison. Apparently whereas in England you need overcast conditions to move the ball about, in South Africa the heat bakes the pitch a bit and the edges come up and it jags around. That\u2019s the science bit. South Africa have this morning to try and keep in the game with the new ball. And Sachin Tendulkar follows where Virat Kohli dared to tread: \u201cSpinners look forward to bowling with the scruffed ball, taking advantage on day five of the roughs created on the wickets.\u201d \u201cAll that is part of Test cricket. Is it fair to take that advantage away from spinners? There is T20, there is one-dayers and then there are T10 and 100-ball cricket. Test is the purest form of cricket. It SHOULD NOT BE TINKERED WITH.\u201d Nice gesture here by Shane Warne: It\u2019s all over at the SCG. Another century for David Warner, five wickets for Nathan Lyon and, as crackle follows snap, Australia claimed all five Tests of the summer inside four days for the first time. Good morning! It\u2019s all a bit back-to-work-Monday here in the UK, but over in Cape Town England have been busy putting in the hard yards all weekend thanks very much. Dom Sibley, England\u2019s answer to Desperate Dan, has, in between lunging awkwardly and munching cow pie, done what England\u2019s team of cavaliers has been desperate for someone to do: score slow (his first 50 runs took 50 overs), boring, unremarkable and steady runs. In the words of James Anderson \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been missing for a couple of years. Hopefully he\u2019s going to cement his place and will get confidence from this knock and go on tomorrow. More importantly, hopefully he can go on in his career in the next few years.\u201d Sibley will start tomorrow just 15 short of a century, with the middle-order guns for company. By mid-morning drinks he should be nearly there - the perfect morale booster for the rest of the tour and just what England need with his opening partner Rory Burns now likely to be nursing his ankle and off cricket for the rest of the winter. Of course there\u2019s always the possibility that England will pull out of their classic collapses - South Africa lost their last 7 wickets for 66 after all. But with a lead of 264 already, and a change in the wind direction to help the fast bowlers, another 50-100 runs and they\u2019ll be safe. Safeish. Pretty safe. Let\u2019s settle on safe enough.",

      "bodyText": "The average carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold in the UK rose for the third year in a row during 2019 as falling diesel sales and the rising popularity of SUVs dealt a blow to Britain\u2019s hopes of reaching climate targets. Average CO2 emissions rose for the third year in a row, up 2.7% year on year to 127.9g of CO2 per kilometre, according to data from the car industry body. This is far above the newly introduced EU target of 95g per kilometre carmakers need to achieve over this year and next for all new cars. Cars account for just over 18% of UK emissions, according to government figures. Transport emissions as a whole account for a third of the UK total, with the sector viewed as vital contributor if the country is to achieve goals of cutting emissions to 51% of 1990 levels by 2025 and to reach net zero by 2050. All manufacturers selling in the EU are rushing to meet emissions regulations that came into force on 1 January. The regulations were introduced in response to the climate crisis, with road transport a major contributor to global CO2 emissions. Overall UK car sales fell by 2.4% year on year to about 2.3m, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, with the industry body blaming Brexit uncertainty and the slump in diesel sales as the main factors. This indicates the worst year for the UK market since 2013, when sales were 2.26m. They reached a peak of 2.7m in 2016 but have declined steadily since. A quarter of the CO2 increase was caused by the 21.8% drop in diesel sales over the year. Newer diesels on average have lower CO2 emissions than petrol cars, despite a backlash prompted by air quality concerns. Another quarter was caused by increased sales of SUVs, which are often heavier and have much worse aerodynamic profiles than smaller cars. Increased fuel use by SUVs was the second largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2018, according to the International Energy Agency. The other half of the headline CO2 increase was caused by a change to testing standards. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, acknowledged the CO2 figures showed the challenge facing the industry. He said: \u201cThe step change that is required is significant.\u201d Under the EU regulations, carmakers face fines potentially running into billions of euros across the UK and the rest of Europe if they surpass individual limits designed to ensure that average fleet emissions hit the 95g target. One bright spot in an otherwise declining market was the rapid increase in sales of battery electric vehicles, which have zero CO2 tailpipe emissions, and hybrid vehicles, which combine an internal combustion engine with a battery-powered motor. Annual sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles rose by 20.6% to a record market share of 7.4%. That was driven by the surge in battery electric sales, which were up by 144%. However, sales of battery electric vehicles would need to rise from the 1.6% market share for 2019 to 27% to hit the 95g target alone, according to the SMMT\u2019s calculations. Hawes repeated his industry\u2019s plea for a post-Brexit trade deal that preserves frictionless trade between the EU and the UK, and that prevents the imposition of tariffs. He added that Brexit uncertainty remained his number one fear for the industry. \u201cUndoubtedly consumer confidence around our big-ticket items is weak,\u201d said Hawes, speaking at a briefing in London before the publication of the final figures.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>IT WAS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO TODAY \u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>So Everton didn\u2019t start the Twenties particularly well, did they? The 1920s, that is. The first match of that roaring era saw the Toffees miss two penalties against Sheffield Wednesday in the league. Then a few days later they played their first FA Cup tie of the new decade, and went down miserably at second-tier Birmingham after passing up a series of decent chances. Whether things have improved much a century on, after a supine loss at Manchester City, and then <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/liverpool-everton-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">that</a></em>, against Liverpool, a mid-table rabble from the Professional U23 Development League, is a moot point. It\u2019s up to you to decide, The Fiver\u2019s not getting involved.</p> \n<p>To be fair, Everton certainly improved during the previous Twenties, and by the end of the decade they\u2019d gone on to win the league \u2026 after which they embarked on a berserk four-year journey of getting themselves relegated, winning the second division, winning the first division, and then landing a Cup. So if ancient history is any guide, Evertonians only have to show some patience for a few years and they\u2019ll be top of the tree again before long. Admittedly they\u2019ve been repeatedly sold this empty promise since 1988, and perhaps the true harbinger is that relegation season, in which case they\u2019ll need to brace themselves for a first period outside the top flight since 1954. It could be either, it could be both. Or it could be yet another long series of mid-table non-events.

The US does not recognise most of these treaties as it concedes extraterritorial sovereignty, but it normally obeys them.</p> <p>What is clear is that modern weaponry is making a mockery of the legality \u2013 let alone the ethics \u2013 of war. The drone has turned an onscreen war game into reality. Its invulnerability has raised it beyond the realm of international law. The drone is its own ethicist.

The president ordered the action, as might Genghis Khan, in a fit of pique after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/us-embassy-stormed-in-baghdad\" title=\"\">attack on the US\u2019s Baghdad embassy</a>.

Few hands are clean in this area of conflict. Britain\u2019s terrorist bombing by the RAF against Germany in the second world war was blatantly aimed at historic towns. Arthur \u201cBomber\u201d Harris, the head of RAF Bomber Command, held that <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/europe/2009/12/germany-air-bomber-war-bombing\" title=\"\">destroying Germany\u2019s heritage</a> would break the enemy\u2019s spirit and force it to surrender. That he \u2013 and Winston Churchill \u2013 thought bombing Lubeck, Nuremberg and Dresden would somehow persuade Adolf Hitler of the error of his ways shows only that war drives men insane. Hitler merely retaliated with <a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/what-were-the-baedeker-raids\" title=\"\">the Baedeker raids</a> on English cathedral cities.</p> <p>Harris is born again in Trump. Nothing could be more calculated to bond Iranians to their leaders \u2013 and demand revenge \u2013 than the destruction of their history. Policy should be aimed at precisely the reverse, creating conditions in which opposition to the military/clerical regime can prosper and strengthen. Bombing Persepolis would not only be grotesque, it would be utterly counterproductive. It is the act of a belligerent personality craving war.</p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s threat to destroy the sites of ancient Persia should send a shiver down the spine of any civilised person. How can anything justify American bombing of Persepolis or the mosques of Isfahan? Only the demented can see them as \u201cthreatening America\u201d. It is on the same ethical plane as the Islamic State vandalism of Palmyra and Mosul. The destruction of cultural artefacts in war is specifically outlawed under the Hague convention of 1954 and subsequent protocols. It ranks with genocide, chemical weapons and the \u201cstrategic\u201d bombing of civilians as beyond the pale of human behaviour. The US does not recognise most of these treaties as it concedes extraterritorial sovereignty, but it normally obeys them. What is clear is that modern weaponry is making a mockery of the legality \u2013 let alone the ethics \u2013 of war. The drone has turned an onscreen war game into reality. Its invulnerability has raised it beyond the realm of international law. The drone is its own ethicist. Even Barack Obama caught the bug in 2011, justifying a drone assassination in Yemen despite national and international laws and conventions. British governments have behaved likewise. Superpowers don\u2019t obey laws, they make them. The assassination of leaders has long been seen as senseless, if only for inviting violent retaliation. The drone has merely raised the stakes of such tit-for-tat escalation. Reports from Washington suggest military officials didn\u2019t seriously think Trump would take the most extreme option of those presented to him, in killing Qassem Suleimani as a response to what was believed to be Iranian-prompted violence in Iraq. The president ordered the action, as might Genghis Khan, in a fit of pique after an attack on the US\u2019s Baghdad embassy. The famed checks and balances in the American constitution are clearly ineffective. Retaliation against sites termed by Trump as \u201cimportant to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture\u201d is a new escalation. Few hands are clean in this area of conflict. Britain\u2019s terrorist bombing by the RAF against Germany in the second world war was blatantly aimed at historic towns. Arthur \u201cBomber\u201d Harris, the head of RAF Bomber Command, held that destroying Germany\u2019s heritage would break the enemy\u2019s spirit and force it to surrender. That he \u2013 and Winston Churchill \u2013 thought bombing Lubeck, Nuremberg and Dresden would somehow persuade Adolf Hitler of the error of his ways shows only that war drives men insane. Hitler merely retaliated with the Baedeker raids on English cathedral cities. Harris is born again in Trump. Nothing could be more calculated to bond Iranians to their leaders \u2013 and demand revenge \u2013 than the destruction of their history. Policy should be aimed at precisely the reverse, creating conditions in which opposition to the military/clerical regime can prosper and strengthen. Bombing Persepolis would not only be grotesque, it would be utterly counterproductive. It is the act of a belligerent personality craving war. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

Also, rumours spread that Hallstatt was the inspiration for the village of Arendelle in the Disney film Frozen. You mean people are travelling thousands of miles to visit the alleged setting for a kids\u2019 movie? Yes, largely from China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. What do they do when they get there? They try to find a place to take an uncrowded selfie \u2013 to no avail \u2013 and then they leave. I\u2019m guessing this influx is a bit of a mixed blessing for the good people of Hallstatt. You got that right. On the one hand, the town is financially independent and well able to fund local amenities including schools and a concert hall. Once-seasonal businesses can now stay open all year. And on the other hand? They are overrun. They have a litter problem, not to mention a drone problem. Prices have sky-rocketed. Locals feel as though they are living in a theme park. In November, a fire destroyed a large chunk of the waterfront, yet still the tourists came. Is there a solution? The mayor is looking at ways to reduce the number of tourist buses \u2013 20,000 a year \u2013 by a third, but there are limits to what can be done legally. You can\u2019t just stop people turning up. He should just tell the tourists to Let it Go. I\u2019m sure he would, if the village wasn\u2019t charging them \u20ac1 each just to use the toilets. Do say: \u201cElsa doesn\u2019t live here any more.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cI\u2019ve been to both, and the one in Guangdong has better food.\u201d",

It\u2019s not an easy read, but I think it\u2019s worth the effort. If I had young daughters, I\u2019d give them it to read. PatLux has found connections in Winifred Watson\u2019s Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day: In early December I was enjoying one of my Edinburgh charity shop forays and was delighted in the Shelter bookshop in Stockbridge to find a pristine copy of Winifred Watson\u2019s Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day. I did wonder whether it had been donated by a fellow Guardian reader who had participated in the Guardian\u2019s Reading group discussion a few months previously. I spot connections everywhere and so I was pleased to read in the preface that the author was a fellow Northumbrian who had gone to school in the town where I was born and which I still visit regularly. It was a pleasure after reading the book to turn to the articles and comments from the Guardian Reading group and check my impressions with those of other readers. Some of the highlights of the book for me were the delightful illustrations by Mary Thomson which enhanced my reading pleasure. Finally, JayZed says The Years by Annie Ernaux is a \u201cgem\u201d: It spans the years of Ernaux\u2019s life from her birth in 1940 to the book\u2019s publication in 2006. Although you get glimpses of the events of her personal life, the book is much more about the shared social and cultural experiences of French women of her generation.

It\u2019s a difficult book to describe and categorise, and I feel that I\u2019m not doing justice to it, but it\u2019s really quite wonderful. \u201cDifficult to categorise\u201d and \u201creally quite wonderful\u201d sounds like just the kind of book we need.

Business leaders representing 12 sectors in the region have received cross-party support from the Democratic Unionist party, Sinn F\u00e9in and two newly elected Northern Irish parties for four amendments to Brexit legislation. They will be debated this Wednesday. Senior government sources have warned of the \u201chigh hurdles\u201d that the group faces to get its amendments through but the business groups say they will continue the fight in London, Dublin and Brussels to mitigate the profound impact Brexit will have locally. \u201cIn the best-case scenario, these amendments go through, and we have protected Northern Irish businesses and consumers. \u201cIn the worst-case scenario, we have raised and waved a very large flag in Dublin, London and Brussels that Northern Ireland \u2018sorted\u2019 is simply not true,\u201d said Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, one of the 12 groups behind the amendments. They are seeking legal guarantees for \u201cunfettered\u201d trade across the Irish Sea and future consultation with the devolved government over any new Brexit regulation affecting Northern Ireland. Their fourth amendment, which was not published over the weekend, calls for compensation. It states \u201cno additional official or administrative costs consequent on any such regulations may be recouped from the private sector\u201d. While no figure has been put on the cost, Connolly said the scale of it was clear. \u201cAround the room on Friday it was very clear that for each of the industries the additional costs could run to tens of millions each,\u201d he said, spelling out a potential cost of more than \u00a3100m across the board. The groups behind the amendments include the Ulster Farmers Union, the Confederation of British Industry, Manufacturing Northern Ireland, the Dairy Council and the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association. The government is unlikely to be defeated but Johnson could face political pressure as he promised unfettered trade during the election campaign. Johnson has promised that Northern Ireland businesses will face \u201cno barriers of any kind\u201d, even telling exporters during the election campaign that if they were asked to fill in any paperwork, they should telephone him directly and he would tell them to throw it in the bin. His remarks were challenged by the EU and by Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who said it was \u201cvery clear\u201d when the deal was done that there would have to be checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because under Johnson\u2019s revised withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU customs code, which includes customs declarations and other formalities. Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, also accused Johnson of breaking a personal promise he had made to the party. Connolly said the business groups were trying to work with the government and not \u201cbash\u201d them over Brexit.

The news comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Iran, after the killing of Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top general, in a drone strike ordered by Donald Trump. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) in Seattle said many more Iranians were refused entry to the US due to a lack of capacity for Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) to detain them as they returned from an Iranian pop concert in Vancouver, Canada. Cair, a civil liberties and advocacy organization, said many had passports confiscated and were questioned about their political views and allegiances. \u201cThese reports are extremely troubling and potentially constitute illegal detentions of United States citizens,\u201d Masih Fouladi, executive director of Cair-WA, said in a statement. Fouladi said the group was \u201cworking to verify reports of a broad nationwide directive to detain Iranian-Americans at ports of entry so that we can provide community members with accurate travel guidance\u201d. One of those detained, according to Cair, was a 24-year-old US citizen and medical student who was allegedly held and questioned for more than 10 hours with her family. \u201cThe vast majority of people being held last night were American citizens,\u201d said the student, who gave her name as Crystal. \u201cWe kept asking why we were being detained and asked questions that had nothing to do with our reason for traveling and was told \u2018I\u2019m sorry this is just the wrong time for you guys.\u2019\u201d Michael Friel, a CBP spokesman, disputed the account, as well as an allegation that officials had been ordered to hold travelers with an Iranian background, regardless of their immigration status. \u201cSocial media posts that CBP is detaining Iranian-Americans and refusing their entry into the US because of their country of origin are false. Reports that DHS/CBP has issued a related directive are also false,\u201d he said. The Cair statement included a claim that an order had been issued to border agents to \u201creport\u201d and detain anyone of Iranian heritage, regardless of citizenship status, who is deemed potentially suspicious or \u201cadversarial\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A man described as \u201cBritain\u2019s most prolific rapist\u201d will never be safe to be released, a court heard on Monday, as he was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for 136 rapes against dozens of young men in Manchester. Reynhard Sinaga, 36, a mature student from Indonesia, is thought by police to have abused at least 195 men over two and a half years after luring them to his flat under the guise of being a \u201cgood samaritan\u201d, drugging his victims and then attacking them after they passed out. All but four of the 48 victims whose cases came to court were raped. The student was proved to have committed 159 offences, including 136 rapes, which he filmed on two mobile phones. Police have yet to identify at least 70 of his victims. The lifting of a two-year media blackout at the end of Sinaga\u2019s fourth trial on Monday meant that he could be identified for the first time and drew expressions of horror from police and victims, as well as calls for a review of controls on so-called \u201cdate rape drugs\u201d. Ian Rushton, the north-west deputy chief crown prosecutor, called Sinaga the \u201cmost prolific rapist in British legal history\u201d. Meanwhile, Priti Patel, the home secretary, urged the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to examine control on substances like GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid), believed to have been used by Sinaga. Sinaga is already serving 88 concurrent life sentences with a minimum of 20 years before he can be considered for parole after his first two trials, which related to 25 victims and were heard between 2018 and last year. He was sentenced on Monday for trials three and four, where he was convicted of counts relating to a further 23 victims. Sentencing him at Manchester crown court on Monday, Judge Suzanne Goddard QC described Sinaga as a \u201cdangerous, deeply disturbed and perverted individual with no sense of reality\u201d, who should never be released from prison. The judge said she had strongly considered ordering Sinaga to serve a whole life term, meaning he would never be released, which would have been the first such sentence imposed for a crime other than murder. Goddard said it was a \u201cborderline case\u201d, therefore she could only pass a term for a minimum of 30 years, but added: \u201cIn my judgment you are a highly dangerous, cunning and deceitful individual who will never be safe to be released, but that is a matter for the Parole Board.\u201d The defendant, who wore a knitted sweatshirt and black-rimmed glasses, smirked as he entered the dock beside two custody officers but appeared expressionless and bored for much of the sentencing. He yawned and played with his hair as harrowing evidence of the impact on his victims was read to a packed courtroom. Addressing Sinaga, Goddard said he had shown \u201cnot one jot of remorse\u201d and told him: \u201cAgain, you seem to be actively enjoying the court process even as you stand there waiting to be sentenced.\u201d She added: \u201cYou are an evil serial sexual offender who preyed on young men who came into the city centre wanting nothing more than a good night with their friends. \u201cOne of the victims in their victim personal statement described you as a monster. The scale and enormity of your offending establishes that is an accurate description. \u201cRarely if ever have the courts seen such a campaign of rape covering so many victims over such a prolonged period.\u201d Sinaga claimed his victims were enjoying acting out his sexual fantasy of playing dead during intercourse, but the defence was described as \u201cludicrous\u201d and unanimously rejected by the four trial juries at Manchester crown court. Many of the men could be heard on film snoring while he raped them. One man told the court he showed Sinaga a scan of his unborn child before he fell unconscious, dismissing the idea that he would have consented to what Sinaga claimed was \u201cFifty Shades of Grey-type stuff\u201d.

The court heard Sinaga had a tried-and-tested formula for finding his victims outside clubs within a few minutes\u2019 walk of his flat on Princess Street in central Manchester. He would go out after midnight to wait outside clubs, usually Factory or Fifth, and prey on mostly heterosexual young men who had been kicked out by bouncers or lost their friends or partners.

When he asked the men if they wanted to come back to his flat and sleep on the floor or have a few more drinks, they agreed.

He texted a friend to boast about one victim: \u201cHe was straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha.\u201d Police believe Sinaga would have carried on had one of his victims not woken up during an attack and called 999 on 2 June 2017. Following Sinaga\u2019s arrest, police discovered films on two iPhones showing him raping scores of apparently sleeping young men. When Greater Manchester police examined Sinaga\u2019s digital devices, they discovered 3.29TB of extremely graphic material \u2013 equivalent to 250 DVDs or 300,000 photos \u2013 depicting sexual assaults lasting in one case for eight hours. Whenever groggy victims regained consciousness, Sinaga could be seen pushing them back to the floor to continue the assault or snatching away his phone to avoid suspicion. Few had any idea they had been raped until police knocked on their doors several years later. Many months of excruciating analysis identified 195 victims, all of whom were unconscious when Sinaga abused them. Investigators never found the drugs he had used to knock his victims out. But experts told the jury they believed the men must have been drugged, probably with GHB or something with very similar effects. Even at quantities as low as 1ml, GHB can render a person unconscious. Victims described how their careers and personal relationships had suffered as a result of the abuse. Several said they had turned to alcohol and become socially isolated, unable even to tell close relatives or friends about what happened. One teenager described Sinaga as \u201can evil predator\u201d and \u201cfaceless monster\u201d, and said the day he was told by police that he had been raped \u201cchanged my life for ever\u201d. He said he began drinking heavily and having panic attacks, and considered self-harm, abandoning a teaching course. Another man, who had a promising career when he was attacked by Sinaga, said he would have killed himself were it not for his mother, one of the only family members or friends he had been able to tell what had happened. \u201cI\u2019m at the point now where I feel life could not get any worse.

      "bodyText": "Students have protested in cities across India after a masked mob stormed a high-profile university in Delhi and attacked students and teachers with weapons including sledgehammers, iron rods and bricks, injuring more than 30. Opposition parties and injured students blamed Sunday night\u2019s violence on a student organisation linked to the prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which has increasingly targeted the institution. The attack at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), long seen as a bastion of leftwing politics, comes as students lead a nationwide campaign against a citizenship law introduced last month by Modi that is seen as targeting Muslims. Videos that emerged after the assault showed people in masks roaming inside the corridors of the university and beating students who were protesting against a fee rise. Students at the Sabarmati hostel, which bore the brunt of the violence, described on Monday how they had locked themselves into their rooms when they heard glass being smashed or ran outside and hid in bushes until the attackers dispersed. \u201cEven after it was over, I had the most fearful night of my life, lying awake listening to every footstep in the corridor,\u201d said Arjit Sharma, 23, a student of ancient history at JNU. One attacker told him: \u201cWe\u2019ll come back for you.\u201d The violent clashes have further polarised an already poisonous atmosphere that\u2019s prevailed for three weeks over the citizenship law. Although the JNU clashes were not about the law, which has triggered massive nationwide protests, they have added to the growing sense of unrest. Scores of students left JNU on Monday, ignoring a plea by the university\u2019s proctor to stay. One of those preparing to leave, Gayatri Basumatary, 23, said: \u201cMy parents are frantic.

Today\u2019s violence in JNU is a reflection of that fear,\u201d tweeted Rahul Gandhi, a leading Congress politician. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the BJP, denied accusations that it was behind the attack, which it blamed instead on rival leftist unions. Authorities faced criticism for failing to rein in the violence on a campus viewed as a centre of resistance to Modi\u2019s policies, including the abolition last year of special status for Muslim-majority Kashmir. Amit Thorat, who teaches economics at JNU, said he called the police a little after 7pm on Sunday but they didn\u2019t come until an hour later. Nearly a dozen students Reuters spoke to said police watched as the mob rampaged inside the campus. Surya Prakash, 25, a research scholar at the university\u2019s Sanskrit school, said he had been brutally beaten in his dorm room despite telling them he was blind. They broke the door and windows of the room, barged inside and hit his head with a rod, said Prakash. One floor up from Prakash, above the dorm wardens\u2019 residence, students said two Kashmiri Muslim students living in adjacent rooms were targeted. While the attackers used a fire extinguisher to ram open a door, one student climbed over his balcony into the next-door room while another jumped on to the ground below, sustaining an injury, according to Mukesh Kumar, a research scholar who lives across the hall. An ambulance carrying injured people off campus was attacked by a group of men with sticks while police stood by, bystanders said. Critics accuse Modi of pushing a Hindu-first agenda that undermines India\u2019s foundations as a secular democracy. The citizenship law lays out a path for Indian nationality for minorities from six religious groups in neighbouring countries but excludes Muslims. The government condemned the violence. \u201cHorrifying images from JNU the place I know and remember was one for fierce debates and opinions but never violence.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.baldessari.org/\">John Baldessari</a>, the Californian conceptual artist known for his witty and provocative image-making, has died aged 88.</p> <p>Baldessari was known for countering what he saw as a po-faced conceptual art scene with colour and humour. He once videoed himself being forced to write lines in a notebook: \u201cI will not make any more boring art.\u201d Such pieces were devised in the 1970s, after Baldessari had grown so disillusioned with his painted works that he took them to a San Diego funeral home and had them incinerated. He called the work The Cremation Project. Baldessari then baked the ashes into cookies and exhibited them at the seminal 1970 show Information at Moma in New York. After this, he felt free to embrace a wider palette beyond painting, working with text, video, photo collage and sculpture, among other forms. Recently, he had turned his attention to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/27/john-baldessari-emoji-exhibition-spruth-magers-gallery-los-angeles\">the world of emojis</a>, blowing them up on canvases in a playful exploration of one of his key fascinations \u2013 the intersection between images and words. \u201cHow can you not be interested in emojis?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-john-baldessari-mixografia-20170520-htmlstory.html\">he told the LA Times in 2017</a>. \u201cThey just look so stupid!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/nov/27/john-baldessari-emoji-exhibition-spruth-magers-gallery-los-angeles\">John Baldessari on his giant emoji paintings: 'I just wondered what they'd look like large'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Born John Anthony Baldessari in National City, California, Baldessari studied at San Diego State College before taking various teaching jobs, including one at a camp for juvenile delinquents. His teaching experience was directly referenced \u2013 and mocked \u2013 in 1972\u2019s Teaching a Plant the Alphabet, in which he held up flash cards of letters in front of an uninterested pot plant.</p> <p>Baldessari\u2019s feelings of being constricted by painting became clear before his bonfire ceremony. In the mid-60s he produced <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/john-baldessari-what-is-painting-1966-68/\">What Is Painting</a>, which adorned a beige canvas with the text: \u201cDO YOU SENSE HOW ALL THE PARTS OF A GOOD PICTURE ARE INVOLVED WITH EACH OTHER, NOT JUST PLACED SIDE BY SIDE?

He taught the likes of <a href=\"http://www.davidsallestudio.net/\">David Salle</a>, <a href=\"https://artmetropole.com/shop/5919\">Barbara Bloom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/jack-goldstein/\">Jack Goldstein</a> and <a href=\"http://www.meliksetianbriggs.com/artists/meg-cranston\">Meg Cranston</a> and held posts at the California Institute of the Arts (1970 to 1988) and the University of California, Los Angeles (1996 to 2005).</p> <p>As part of a 2010 New Yorker profile he recalled meeting Barbara Kruger and Cindy Sherman at a party: \u201c[They] came up to me, and Cindy said, \u2018You know, we couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Between 2009 and 2011, a retrospective of Baldessari\u2019s work visited London\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/14/john-baldessari-review\">Tate Modern</a>, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and then Moma.

      "bodyText": "John Baldessari, the Californian conceptual artist known for his witty and provocative image-making, has died aged 88. Baldessari was known for countering what he saw as a po-faced conceptual art scene with colour and humour. He once videoed himself being forced to write lines in a notebook: \u201cI will not make any more boring art.\u201d Such pieces were devised in the 1970s, after Baldessari had grown so disillusioned with his painted works that he took them to a San Diego funeral home and had them incinerated. He called the work The Cremation Project. Baldessari then baked the ashes into cookies and exhibited them at the seminal 1970 show Information at Moma in New York. After this, he felt free to embrace a wider palette beyond painting, working with text, video, photo collage and sculpture, among other forms. Recently, he had turned his attention to the world of emojis, blowing them up on canvases in a playful exploration of one of his key fascinations \u2013 the intersection between images and words. \u201cHow can you not be interested in emojis?\u201d he told the LA Times in 2017. \u201cThey just look so stupid!\u201d Born John Anthony Baldessari in National City, California, Baldessari studied at San Diego State College before taking various teaching jobs, including one at a camp for juvenile delinquents. His teaching experience was directly referenced \u2013 and mocked \u2013 in 1972\u2019s Teaching a Plant the Alphabet, in which he held up flash cards of letters in front of an uninterested pot plant. Baldessari\u2019s feelings of being constricted by painting became clear before his bonfire ceremony. In the mid-60s he produced What Is Painting, which adorned a beige canvas with the text: \u201cDO YOU SENSE HOW ALL THE PARTS OF A GOOD PICTURE ARE INVOLVED WITH EACH OTHER, NOT JUST PLACED SIDE BY SIDE? ART IS A CREATION FOR THE EYE AND CAN ONLY BE HINTED AT WITH WORDS.\u201d Ideas interested him more than craft, and over a career spanning seven decades he gained a reputation for being one of the world\u2019s most important and influential conceptual artists. \u201cI think, maybe too optimistically, that art is a language in itself, and people anywhere can get it,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2017. Baldessari was also instrumental in turning the Los Angeles art scene into a force. He taught the likes of David Salle, Barbara Bloom, Jack Goldstein and Meg Cranston and held posts at the California Institute of the Arts (1970 to 1988) and the University of California, Los Angeles (1996 to 2005). As part of a 2010 New Yorker profile he recalled meeting Barbara Kruger and Cindy Sherman at a party: \u201c[They] came up to me, and Cindy said, \u2018You know, we couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u2019\u201d Between 2009 and 2011, a retrospective of Baldessari\u2019s work visited London\u2019s Tate Modern, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and then Moma. President Barack Obama presented him with the National Medal of Arts in 2014.",

The Children\u2019s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines, while the children\u2019s commissioner estimated at least 46,000 children in England were caught up in gangs.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many children have been affected</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 \u2013 nearly three times the 720 previously established.<br><br>Police estimate the phone numbers are linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making \u00a3800,000 profits in a year.</p>\n    <p>The Children's Commissioner estimates at least 46,000 children in England are caught up in gangs.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Insp Jon Aspinall of North Wales police said the force was aware of the problem in their area and working closely with Bangor University to safeguard students. \u201cWe have a number of county lines running in from Merseyside, one of the highest areas of county lines numbers being released,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have found on occasions that if we stop individuals, they do purport to be students.

      "body": "<p>One of the most peculiar aspects of realising that you are LGBTQ is the loneliness. Your immediate family is unlikely to belong to the minority you may feel you have been arbitrarily parachuted into. You may be fortunate that they have supportive attitudes; many are not. The odds are that you have heard derogatory terms about LGBTQ people thrown around the playground not once or twice but like confetti. On TV and film screens, on advertising billboards, in magazines and in books, society\u2019s expectations about settling down with someone of a different gender will bellow at you. You may struggle to come out to yourself, let alone anyone else, and fear judgment and rejection.</p> <p>That is why major cultural events, such as the <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/12/23/dancing-on-ice-ian-h-watkins-matt-evers-same-sex-tears-of-joy/\" title=\"\">first same-sex performance</a> on ITV\u2019s Dancing on Ice last night, are so important: they can be lifelines for the closeted, whether they are aged 13 or 78. Acceptance for LGBTQ people struggling with their sexuality is like water to a sponge: anything that showcases and values our existence has a profound impact. That\u2019s why H from Steps \u2013 one half of the couple \u2013 told the judges that it was emotional, in part because \u201cit means so much to so many people and the world is ready for this\u201d. It\u2019s why the actor John Barrowman broke down in tears \u201cbecause of seeing two men who represent someone who is like me and to skate as well as you did\u201d. What\u2019s all the fuss, the usual suspects will cry, but it matters precisely because society, and particularly currently emboldened bigots, makes such a fuss about anyone who deviates from a heterosexual norm.</p> <p>Even for those of us in our 30s, there were all too few representations of LGBTQ people in popular culture growing up.

      "bodyText": "One of the most peculiar aspects of realising that you are LGBTQ is the loneliness. Your immediate family is unlikely to belong to the minority you may feel you have been arbitrarily parachuted into. You may be fortunate that they have supportive attitudes; many are not. The odds are that you have heard derogatory terms about LGBTQ people thrown around the playground not once or twice but like confetti. On TV and film screens, on advertising billboards, in magazines and in books, society\u2019s expectations about settling down with someone of a different gender will bellow at you. You may struggle to come out to yourself, let alone anyone else, and fear judgment and rejection. That is why major cultural events, such as the first same-sex performance on ITV\u2019s Dancing on Ice last night, are so important: they can be lifelines for the closeted, whether they are aged 13 or 78. Acceptance for LGBTQ people struggling with their sexuality is like water to a sponge: anything that showcases and values our existence has a profound impact. That\u2019s why H from Steps \u2013 one half of the couple \u2013 told the judges that it was emotional, in part because \u201cit means so much to so many people and the world is ready for this\u201d. It\u2019s why the actor John Barrowman broke down in tears \u201cbecause of seeing two men who represent someone who is like me and to skate as well as you did\u201d. What\u2019s all the fuss, the usual suspects will cry, but it matters precisely because society, and particularly currently emboldened bigots, makes such a fuss about anyone who deviates from a heterosexual norm. Even for those of us in our 30s, there were all too few representations of LGBTQ people in popular culture growing up. LGBTQ folks were often portrayed as two-dimensional, as clowns to be mocked, or as tragedies to be pitied or feared. The press subjected LGB people to the same moral panic and bile now being meted out to transgender people. The first gay kiss in EastEnders was described by the Sun in 1987 as a \u201clove scene between yuppie poofs\u201d. We\u2019ve come a long way, thanks to pioneering heroes such as Russell T Davies.

      "body": "<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m a masochist,\u201d Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez had said and maybe that explains everything: it explains why they called and why he came; it might even explain why this could just work. That, at least, is the hope and at least there is hope now. The noise had just about died down, supporters heading home happy, when Espanyol\u2019s new coach appeared, their third in half a season. It was almost midnight, cold outside, and his throat was raw but he was smiling. \u201cYou have a bad time of it, you suffer, but you enjoy it,\u201d he admitted, \u201cand I tell them to enjoy it too.\u201d This time, they had. Espanyol are still the worst team in Spain, and by some way, but it\u2019s a new year, a new them.</p> \n<p>Before Saturday\u2019s Catalan derby an I Will Survive remix boomed round Cornell\u00e0; by the end, some had started to believe they actually might. As the whistle went on a 2-2 draw, another song went round: \u201cYes, we can!\u201d they chanted. Unable to beat Barcelona in the league in the 2010s, Espanyol had been unable to beat them at the start of 2020 too, but this wasn\u2019t the same. Sometimes a draw feels like a victory. When they\u2019re top and you\u2019re bottom, when you\u2019ve barely even drawn at home all season let alone actually won a game, you\u2019ve blown a lead and you\u2019re losing with two minutes left, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/espanyol-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">is one of those times</a>. When you\u2019re desperate, searching for something, anything, to hold on to definitely is.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/espanyol-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">Barcelona frustrated by Wu Lei\u2019s late equaliser as Espanyol fight back</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One-nil up through a David L\u00f3pez header out of nothing, two superb moments from Luis Su\u00e1rez, who has scored or assisted each of Barcelona\u2019s last 10 goals and added one more of each here, had left Espanyol trailing again. \u201cWhen that happens, you fear the team will collapse, but it wasn\u2019t like that, quite the opposite,\u201d Abelardo said. On the touchline, Mat\u00edas Vargas and Wu Lei were warming up. Talking, too. \u201cI\u2019ll play you in,\u201d Vargas said. Soon, both were on. And on 88 minutes, he did. The Chinese striker hit his shot low and hard across Neto by the far post to grab an equaliser. Running to the corner, teammates piled on. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost two points,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said, standing pitchside at the end, as Espanyol\u2019s players embraced, still applauding the fans. They had gained one.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a point, but it\u2019s a turning point,\u201d Abelardo said.</p> \n<p>It has to be. Espanyol ended last season qualifying for Europe for the first time in a decade but they ended 2019 facing relegation for the first time in quarter of a century. In the summer, they lost centre-back Mario Hermoso, centre-forward Borja Iglesias, and manager Rubi. They lost two more since: under David Gallego, they collected just five points from 24; under Pablo Mach\u00edn, it was five from 30. Gallego stood accused of being too flexible \u2013 the players ran the place, did what they wanted \u2013 and Mach\u00edn of being too rigid, wedded to wing-backs when he didn\u2019t really have them or the authority to convince them. There were whistles from fans, chants for the board to resign, accusations that players were mercenaries \u2013 although that would at least mean they fought.</p> \n<p>\u201cI understand them,\u201d Mach\u00edn said, which was another way of saying he agreed. Espanyol\u2019s manager complained that all he had were <em>pipiolos</em>, a weird word which sent everyone to Wikipedia: a 19th century Chilean liberal, young, naive, and unprepared. Defeated, too. He wanted \u201creal blokes\u201d, players who \u201cfeel their profession\u201d, not <em>pipiolos</em>. Defeated at Legan\u00e9s just before Christmas, what he got was the sack. Espanyol were bottom, five points from safety. Their record at home read: played nine, won none, lost <em>seven</em>. No one had been in a worse situation than this.</p> \n<p>Well, almost no one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1213603171488206849\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Espanyol's survival dream was boosted as Wu Lei earned a point in the Barcelona derby! \ud83d\udc99\u2728<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EspanyolBar%C3%A7a?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EspanyolBar\u00e7a</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/waenS0RaGH\">pic.twitter.com/waenS0RaGH</a></p>\u2014 LaLiga (@LaLigaEN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaLigaEN/status/1213603171488206849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Abelardo had, and he quite fancied doing so again. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a masochist, but I like the challenge,\u201d he said at his presentation. The situation was very, very bad, he admitted, an inescapable reality. But, he insisted, if he didn\u2019t think there was some way out, he wouldn\u2019t have accepted \u2013 and that was at least partly borne out by the fact that he, like Gus Poyet, had just turned down the job at fellow-strugglers Legan\u00e9s, which was instead taken by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/23/javier-aguirre-leganes-la-liga-survival-espanyol\">Javier Aguirre</a>. He also thinks it was harder at Sporting Gij\u00f3n, the club in \u201cruins\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/aug/24/sporting-gijon-real-madrid-miraculous-la-liga-return\">where he led a revolution</a>, winning promotion and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/16/how-barcelona-lost-la-liga-title-then-won-it-again\">avoiding relegation</a>, and at Alav\u00e9s, where he performed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/feb/19/alaves-performing-another-miracle-salvation-in-sight\">a miracle</a>.</p> \n<p>The day Abelardo took over at Alav\u00e9s, he was their fourth manager of the season. At his presentation he insisted they would survive, but few truly believed him. After 13 games, they were six points from safety. Within two games, he had won as many times as the previous three managers put together. They eventually finished 18 points clear of relegation. He found enjoyment in suffering, release, and helped his players find it too. Now, at Espanyol, he had been called to do the same again. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve only got 10 of 54 points, players lose confidence in their ability; they stop daring to do things; we have to change that,\u201d he said. \u201cBit by bit, day by day, session by session, game by game.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cc15ab7001f491ed5496e9e94a5fe2c1649614a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc15ab7001f491ed5496e9e94a5fe2c1649614a/0_0_3500_2218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi in action against Espanyol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Messi in action against Espanyol.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He didn\u2019t have long to prepare for the game against Barcelona, the team where he had played, but something shifted. The system for a start: 4-4-2, tighter, more physical; short, simple messages. \u201cHe told us to be strong, compact, to press, don\u2019t let them think, closed space,\u201d Javi L\u00f3pez said. \u201cWith Abelardo we\u2019re happy,\u201d Vargas added.</p> \n<p>He was happy too. \u201cI missed this; I feel lucky to be able to do what I love,\u201d the manager said. \u201cYou have a bad time of it. Just look at me: my voice is rough. It\u2019s not easy: it\u2019s not like basketball where you have time-outs or five players near you. You shout, and they can\u2019t hear you amid all the noise, with all the people there. But I enjoy it and I tell them to enjoy it too. I said to them before the game: I would have paid to pull on this shirt and listen to the fans, to play in an atmosphere and a game like this. You have to enjoy it or you go out there and can\u2019t perform, you suffer a mental block. When you compete, you enjoy it more.\u201d Moribund for months, on Saturday, they did, belief returning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"639313fa2c578e59d42515260c2b8a56c95a7514\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/639313fa2c578e59d42515260c2b8a56c95a7514/0_0_3112_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abelardo and his bench celebrate their late goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abelardo and his bench celebrate their late goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c1lex Caparr\u00f3s/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cNew year, new manager,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. It could yet be that gym membership, long forgotten by the spring, and Espanyol\u2019s situation remains dramatic. Bottom of the table, four points from safety and with Legan\u00e9s fast improving. They have just 11 points at the halfway stage. They have won just twice and probably need to win nine more times in 19. \u201cFor ever swimming against the tide,\u201d ran the banner unfurled before the game and this is more like a tsunami. No team has ever survived on fewer than 12 points at halfway. Only four have ever ended the first half of the season without a home win and none of them came close to survival. It is hard still, they know, almost impossible, and suffering lies ahead. But that\u2019s Abelardo\u2019s thing and on Saturday, Espanyol felt a little closer.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the turning point,\u201d Vargas said, although he also warned: \u201cIt was [supposed to be on] the day we beat Betis too.\u201d The headline on the front of the Espanyol-supporting daily La Grada cheered: \u201cReady for the revival.\u201d And the goalscorer was beaming. \u201cThis is a great point. You could see in the dressing room, that everyone has more confidence and believes the run will change in the new year,\u201d Wu said before leaving Cornell\u00e1, pausing for group of Chinese fans outside.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t allow ourselves to be where we are,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. \u201cThis is a new start, I am convinced, absolutely certain. We have to give the best of us, think only of football, be aware that we represent a historic club. All I can say to the fans is: sorry, thanks, and we\u2019ll get out of this. People might say I\u2019m mad, but we\u2019re going to survive.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4ba587f02734d8210e311e101c45978045b5918\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4ba587f02734d8210e311e101c45978045b5918/0_0_4712_3142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Espanyol\u2019s players after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Espanyol\u2019s players after the match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c1lex Caparr\u00f3s/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cCourtois is the best in the world,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said after he had saved Real Madrid three times against Getafe. \u201cOblak is the best goalkeeper in the world,\u201d Diego Simeone said after he had saved Atl\u00e9tico with an astonishing save in the last minute against Levante.\u201d Ernesto Valverde didn\u2019t say anything this time, at least not on this debate: Ter Stegen wasn\u2019t playing against Espanyol.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cThe worst La Liga \u2026 or the best\u201d ran the headline in El Mundo. The season reaches the halfway stage, when everyone has played everyone once, and Barcelona are \u201cwinter champions\u201d on the lowest points total any winter champion has had and having picked up only half of their points on the road. Madrid have not entirely convinced but are level with them. And the worst Atl\u00e9tico under Simeone are only five points behind. It\u2019s more competitive, but the question they\u2019re asking is: why?</p> \n<p>\u2022 Whoever invented that line about easy as taking sweets from a child has never been on a Kings parade in Spain. Yep, it was Reyes, the event so important Spain\u2019s footballers took a two-hour break on Sunday and Marca just couldn\u2019t help <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1214079510288719873?s=20\">pouring on the puns</a>. Oddly, no one made much of E Royal getting Betis\u2019s equaliser against Alav\u00e9s. Or Santi Clause, despite Santi Mina scoring against Osasuna and Mara declaring Santi Cazorla a \u201cgift\u201d after he got the winner as Villarreal added Real Sociedad to a run that has also seen them beat Sevilla and Getafe in the last three league games, suggesting that maybe Europe isn\u2019t beyond them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

      "bodyText": "\u201cMaybe I\u2019m a masochist,\u201d Abelardo Fern\u00e1ndez had said and maybe that explains everything: it explains why they called and why he came; it might even explain why this could just work. That, at least, is the hope and at least there is hope now. The noise had just about died down, supporters heading home happy, when Espanyol\u2019s new coach appeared, their third in half a season. It was almost midnight, cold outside, and his throat was raw but he was smiling. \u201cYou have a bad time of it, you suffer, but you enjoy it,\u201d he admitted, \u201cand I tell them to enjoy it too.\u201d This time, they had. Espanyol are still the worst team in Spain, and by some way, but it\u2019s a new year, a new them. Before Saturday\u2019s Catalan derby an I Will Survive remix boomed round Cornell\u00e0; by the end, some had started to believe they actually might. As the whistle went on a 2-2 draw, another song went round: \u201cYes, we can!\u201d they chanted. Unable to beat Barcelona in the league in the 2010s, Espanyol had been unable to beat them at the start of 2020 too, but this wasn\u2019t the same. Sometimes a draw feels like a victory. When they\u2019re top and you\u2019re bottom, when you\u2019ve barely even drawn at home all season let alone actually won a game, you\u2019ve blown a lead and you\u2019re losing with two minutes left, is one of those times. When you\u2019re desperate, searching for something, anything, to hold on to definitely is. One-nil up through a David L\u00f3pez header out of nothing, two superb moments from Luis Su\u00e1rez, who has scored or assisted each of Barcelona\u2019s last 10 goals and added one more of each here, had left Espanyol trailing again. \u201cWhen that happens, you fear the team will collapse, but it wasn\u2019t like that, quite the opposite,\u201d Abelardo said. On the touchline, Mat\u00edas Vargas and Wu Lei were warming up. Talking, too. \u201cI\u2019ll play you in,\u201d Vargas said. Soon, both were on. And on 88 minutes, he did. The Chinese striker hit his shot low and hard across Neto by the far post to grab an equaliser. Running to the corner, teammates piled on. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost two points,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said, standing pitchside at the end, as Espanyol\u2019s players embraced, still applauding the fans. They had gained one. \u201cIt\u2019s only a point, but it\u2019s a turning point,\u201d Abelardo said. It has to be. Espanyol ended last season qualifying for Europe for the first time in a decade but they ended 2019 facing relegation for the first time in quarter of a century. In the summer, they lost centre-back Mario Hermoso, centre-forward Borja Iglesias, and manager Rubi. They lost two more since: under David Gallego, they collected just five points from 24; under Pablo Mach\u00edn, it was five from 30. Gallego stood accused of being too flexible \u2013 the players ran the place, did what they wanted \u2013 and Mach\u00edn of being too rigid, wedded to wing-backs when he didn\u2019t really have them or the authority to convince them. There were whistles from fans, chants for the board to resign, accusations that players were mercenaries \u2013 although that would at least mean they fought. \u201cI understand them,\u201d Mach\u00edn said, which was another way of saying he agreed. Espanyol\u2019s manager complained that all he had were pipiolos, a weird word which sent everyone to Wikipedia: a 19th century Chilean liberal, young, naive, and unprepared. Defeated, too. He wanted \u201creal blokes\u201d, players who \u201cfeel their profession\u201d, not pipiolos. Defeated at Legan\u00e9s just before Christmas, what he got was the sack. Espanyol were bottom, five points from safety. Their record at home read: played nine, won none, lost seven. No one had been in a worse situation than this. Well, almost no one. Abelardo had, and he quite fancied doing so again. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m a masochist, but I like the challenge,\u201d he said at his presentation. The situation was very, very bad, he admitted, an inescapable reality. But, he insisted, if he didn\u2019t think there was some way out, he wouldn\u2019t have accepted \u2013 and that was at least partly borne out by the fact that he, like Gus Poyet, had just turned down the job at fellow-strugglers Legan\u00e9s, which was instead taken by Javier Aguirre. He also thinks it was harder at Sporting Gij\u00f3n, the club in \u201cruins\u201d where he led a revolution, winning promotion and avoiding relegation, and at Alav\u00e9s, where he performed a miracle. The day Abelardo took over at Alav\u00e9s, he was their fourth manager of the season. At his presentation he insisted they would survive, but few truly believed him. After 13 games, they were six points from safety. Within two games, he had won as many times as the previous three managers put together. They eventually finished 18 points clear of relegation. He found enjoyment in suffering, release, and helped his players find it too. Now, at Espanyol, he had been called to do the same again. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve only got 10 of 54 points, players lose confidence in their ability; they stop daring to do things; we have to change that,\u201d he said. \u201cBit by bit, day by day, session by session, game by game.\u201d He didn\u2019t have long to prepare for the game against Barcelona, the team where he had played, but something shifted. The system for a start: 4-4-2, tighter, more physical; short, simple messages. \u201cHe told us to be strong, compact, to press, don\u2019t let them think, closed space,\u201d Javi L\u00f3pez said. \u201cWith Abelardo we\u2019re happy,\u201d Vargas added. He was happy too. \u201cI missed this; I feel lucky to be able to do what I love,\u201d the manager said. \u201cYou have a bad time of it. Just look at me: my voice is rough. It\u2019s not easy: it\u2019s not like basketball where you have time-outs or five players near you. You shout, and they can\u2019t hear you amid all the noise, with all the people there. But I enjoy it and I tell them to enjoy it too. I said to them before the game: I would have paid to pull on this shirt and listen to the fans, to play in an atmosphere and a game like this. You have to enjoy it or you go out there and can\u2019t perform, you suffer a mental block. When you compete, you enjoy it more.\u201d Moribund for months, on Saturday, they did, belief returning. \u201cNew year, new manager,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. It could yet be that gym membership, long forgotten by the spring, and Espanyol\u2019s situation remains dramatic. Bottom of the table, four points from safety and with Legan\u00e9s fast improving. They have just 11 points at the halfway stage. They have won just twice and probably need to win nine more times in 19. \u201cFor ever swimming against the tide,\u201d ran the banner unfurled before the game and this is more like a tsunami. No team has ever survived on fewer than 12 points at halfway. Only four have ever ended the first half of the season without a home win and none of them came close to survival. It is hard still, they know, almost impossible, and suffering lies ahead. But that\u2019s Abelardo\u2019s thing and on Saturday, Espanyol felt a little closer. \u201cThis is the turning point,\u201d Vargas said, although he also warned: \u201cIt was [supposed to be on] the day we beat Betis too.\u201d The headline on the front of the Espanyol-supporting daily La Grada cheered: \u201cReady for the revival.\u201d And the goalscorer was beaming. \u201cThis is a great point. You could see in the dressing room, that everyone has more confidence and believes the run will change in the new year,\u201d Wu said before leaving Cornell\u00e1, pausing for group of Chinese fans outside. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow ourselves to be where we are,\u201d L\u00f3pez said. \u201cThis is a new start, I am convinced, absolutely certain. We have to give the best of us, think only of football, be aware that we represent a historic club. All I can say to the fans is: sorry, thanks, and we\u2019ll get out of this. People might say I\u2019m mad, but we\u2019re going to survive.\u201d Talking points \u2022 \u201cCourtois is the best in the world,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said after he had saved Real Madrid three times against Getafe. \u201cOblak is the best goalkeeper in the world,\u201d Diego Simeone said after he had saved Atl\u00e9tico with an astonishing save in the last minute against Levante.\u201d Ernesto Valverde didn\u2019t say anything this time, at least not on this debate: Ter Stegen wasn\u2019t playing against Espanyol. \u2022 \u201cThe worst La Liga \u2026 or the best\u201d ran the headline in El Mundo. The season reaches the halfway stage, when everyone has played everyone once, and Barcelona are \u201cwinter champions\u201d on the lowest points total any winter champion has had and having picked up only half of their points on the road. Madrid have not entirely convinced but are level with them. And the worst Atl\u00e9tico under Simeone are only five points behind. It\u2019s more competitive, but the question they\u2019re asking is: why? \u2022 Whoever invented that line about easy as taking sweets from a child has never been on a Kings parade in Spain. Yep, it was Reyes, the event so important Spain\u2019s footballers took a two-hour break on Sunday and Marca just couldn\u2019t help pouring on the puns. Oddly, no one made much of E Royal getting Betis\u2019s equaliser against Alav\u00e9s. Or Santi Clause, despite Santi Mina scoring against Osasuna and Mara declaring Santi Cazorla a \u201cgift\u201d after he got the winner as Villarreal added Real Sociedad to a run that has also seen them beat Sevilla and Getafe in the last three league games, suggesting that maybe Europe isn\u2019t beyond them.",

On leaving school she went to work as a fiction buyer for John Smith &amp; Son in St Vincent Street, the oldest bookshop in Glasgow. It was there that she pursued her love of crime fiction.</p> <p>Frustrated by bookselling and harbouring ambitions to be a writer, she talked herself into a job as a theatre critic on the Scottish Daily Express, graduating to a reporter covering fashion and then crime, and moving to the head office of the Express in London in the \u201cglory days\u201d of Fleet Street. In the 1960s she reported on the Profumo/Keeler affair and on the return to political life of the fascist leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/oswald-mosley\" title=\"\">Oswald Mosley</a>. Trying to interview Mosley when he was walking down the Strand, she was caught on camera by a BBC news crew. When the film was broadcast, to her horror the voiceover described the scene as \u201cMosley and his loyal followers\u201d.</p> <p>In 1969 she married a fellow journalist, the Express correspondent Harry Scott Gibbons, with whom she had a son, Charles, after both had decided to quit Fleet Street and travel, eventually moving to the US, where Harry found work as a newspaper editor in Virginia and Connecticut. It was in America, while reading \u201csome imitators of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/05/georgette-heyer-novelist-regency-romance-blue-plaque\" title=\"\">Georgette Heyer</a>\u2019s Regency romances\u201d, that Marion uttered the fateful words \u201cI could do better\u201d and, challenged by her husband, started a novel. Harry took the early chapters to the literary agent who was to represent her in the US for more than 30 years, and a prolific career was born.</p> <p>On returning to the UK, the Gibbons family established themselves in the Cotswolds on the assumption that their son would be going to Oxford University. In fact he went to Cambridge, but the Cotswolds provided the inspiration and the setting for Marion\u2019s next foray into cosy crime fiction, though \u201ccosy crime\u201d was a term she disliked and she said so quite forcefully in public. It did not prevent her publishers from describing her as \u201cthe queen of the village mystery\u201d.</p> <p>Immensely popular in the US and the seventh most borrowed author from British libraries, Chesney Gibbons is thought to have sold around 21m books. She was vague about the number of titles she had written, putting her impressive total down to <a href=\"http://www.shotsmag.co.uk/interview_view.aspx?interview_id=12\" title=\"\">\u201cthe curse of the Scottish work ethic</a><a href=\"http://www.shotsmag.co.uk/interview_view.aspx?interview_id=12\" title=\"\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Like her fictional characters, she was flamboyant and wielded a razor-sharp, Glasgow-honed wit. She was generous to fellow writers and a big draw at festivals and crime-writing conventions, although she rationed her appearances, saying: \u201cNot many people know who I am and I do like it that way.\u201d</p> <p>Harry died in 2016.

Frustrated by bookselling and harbouring ambitions to be a writer, she talked herself into a job as a theatre critic on the Scottish Daily Express, graduating to a reporter covering fashion and then crime, and moving to the head office of the Express in London in the \u201cglory days\u201d of Fleet Street. In the 1960s she reported on the Profumo/Keeler affair and on the return to political life of the fascist leader Oswald Mosley. Trying to interview Mosley when he was walking down the Strand, she was caught on camera by a BBC news crew. When the film was broadcast, to her horror the voiceover described the scene as \u201cMosley and his loyal followers\u201d. In 1969 she married a fellow journalist, the Express correspondent Harry Scott Gibbons, with whom she had a son, Charles, after both had decided to quit Fleet Street and travel, eventually moving to the US, where Harry found work as a newspaper editor in Virginia and Connecticut. It was in America, while reading \u201csome imitators of Georgette Heyer\u2019s Regency romances\u201d, that Marion uttered the fateful words \u201cI could do better\u201d and, challenged by her husband, started a novel. Harry took the early chapters to the literary agent who was to represent her in the US for more than 30 years, and a prolific career was born. On returning to the UK, the Gibbons family established themselves in the Cotswolds on the assumption that their son would be going to Oxford University. In fact he went to Cambridge, but the Cotswolds provided the inspiration and the setting for Marion\u2019s next foray into cosy crime fiction, though \u201ccosy crime\u201d was a term she disliked and she said so quite forcefully in public. It did not prevent her publishers from describing her as \u201cthe queen of the village mystery\u201d. Immensely popular in the US and the seventh most borrowed author from British libraries, Chesney Gibbons is thought to have sold around 21m books. She was vague about the number of titles she had written, putting her impressive total down to \u201cthe curse of the Scottish work ethic\u201d. Like her fictional characters, she was flamboyant and wielded a razor-sharp, Glasgow-honed wit. She was generous to fellow writers and a big draw at festivals and crime-writing conventions, although she rationed her appearances, saying: \u201cNot many people know who I am and I do like it that way.\u201d Harry died in 2016. Chesney Gibbons is survived by Charles. \u2022 MC Beaton (Marion Chesney Gibbons), journalist and author, born 10 June 1936; died 30 December 2019",

I told him I was ready for more and he was like: \u2018OK, bye.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite that,\u201d Tim laughs. \u201cBut I admit I was a bit scared of my feelings. I\u2019d had relationships fall apart before.\u201d By May, it was clear that they were meant to be, and Tim asked if she would like to be his girlfriend. \u201cThe next day, my face hurt from smiling so much,\u201d Abi remembers. The following September, Abi went to Belgium for five months as part of her degree. \u201cI would go to visit her and we\u2019d have fun cycling around and going for beers,\u201d says Tim. They also enjoyed plenty of nights out, spending time with friends and other church members. \u201cI knew I always wanted to meet someone who shared my faith,\u201d Abi says. In 2004, Tim proposed with a necklace, as he wanted her to have the opportunity to choose her ring. The couple married at their church in Glossop the following year, followed by a reception at the University of Manchester. \u201cThe photographer told me she\u2019d never seen a bride smile so much,\u201d Abi says. After the wedding, Tim realised he wanted to leave his job. \u201cI told Abi that I wanted to become a vicar,\u201d he says. \u201cAt first, she wasn\u2019t sure \u2013 I don\u2019t think she wanted to be a vicar\u2019s wife.\u201d Abi, who describes herself as a feminist Christian, says she didn\u2019t want to be left making cucumber sandwiches and tea. But she was keen to support her husband, so they began to explore his options. In 2012, he left his job for a two-year training programme in Bristol. \u201cOur income dropped off a cliff,\u201d he says. After spending three years as a curate in Salford, Tim became a vicar in Bradford. The couple live in the vicarage with their three children. While Tim spends much of his time in community work, Abi runs a Christian podcast. \u201cI love her heart and generosity,\u201d says Tim. \u201cShe\u2019s so compassionate, but she\u2019ll always stand up for what\u2019s right.\u201d Abi feels the same way about her husband. \u201cHe\u2019s very honest and open. He cares so much about his faith and his work supporting the local community. I feel blown away that I get to be married to him.\u201d Want to share your story?

      "body": "<h2>Netflix stumbles at final hurdle</h2> <p>Before the Globes, Hollywood was readying the knee cushions as it prepared to genuflect before the streaming giant, whose 34 nominations suggested it was about to do to the film industry what it has already done to TV.

      "body": "<p>The actor Elizabeth Sellars, who has died aged 98, had a fulfilling career on television and on stage, and took leading roles in low-budget British thrillers, as well as supporting roles to bigger stars in bigger pictures, in the 1950s and 60s.</p> <p>She emerged at a rich time for British television drama, often appearing on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Night Theatre (1951-59) and ITV\u2019s Play of the Week (1959-67). In the theatre, she had long runs in West End productions, and was one of the stars at Stratford-upon-Avon during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/peter-hall-obituary-british-theatre-rss-national\" title=\"\">Peter Hall</a>\u2019s first season as artistic director of the newly formed Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1960-61.</p> <p>Sellars, who was born in Glasgow, the daughter of Jean (nee Sutherland) and Stephen Sellars, was educated at Queenswood school in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and was classically trained as an actor at Rada in London, graduating in 1940. During the second world war she joined Ensa, the troops\u2019 entertainment unit. </p> <p>She made her London stage debut in 1946 in The Brothers Karamazov at the Lyric, Hammersmith, directed by Peter Brook and featuring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/aug/08/guardianobituaries.tomsutcliffe\" title=\"Alec Guinness obituary\">Alec Guinness</a> as Mitya. Sellars then joined the second season of the Bristol Old Vic (1947-48) before embarking on a film career. Floodtide (1949), an uplifting drama set in the Clyde shipyards, had Gordon Jackson leading an all-Scottish cast, among them Sellars in her screen debut, who reverted to the brogue that had been ironed out by Rada.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/04/features\" title=\"\">David Lean</a>\u2019s Madeleine (1950), set in Glasgow, Sellars played the sassy Scots maid and confidante of flighty <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-ann-todd-2321403.html\" title=\"\">Ann Todd</a> in the title role. Sellars then starred in several quota quickies (usually shown on the lower half of a double-feature bill), most of them crime melodramas in which she was involved in a murder in some way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eca327d65169398c0bf7823d2045fa2cf669106d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eca327d65169398c0bf7823d2045fa2cf669106d/488_352_3542_4426/800.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Sellars working in her Buckinghamshire garden in 1967.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Sellars working in her Buckinghamshire garden in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slightly more prestigious was her short appearance as the adulterous wife of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/10/features\" title=\"\">Dirk Bogarde</a> while he is on the run for murder in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/15/guardianobituaries3\" title=\"\">Charles Crichton</a>\u2019s Hunted (1952). She was with Bogarde again in the well-meaning The Gentle Gunman (1952). In it, Bogarde and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/25/2005inreview\" title=\"\">John Mills</a> played unlikely Irish brothers, both members of the IRA, both in love with a fellow member, Sellars, all three with wonky Irish accents. However, Sellars gave a passionate performance as a determined woman of whom it is said: \u201cIf she ever had a child it\u2019d be born in uniform with a tommy gun for a rattler.\u201d</p> <p>There followed supporting roles in three glamorous Hollywood movies, a world away from the gloomy monochrome British films with which Sellars had become associated. The screenwriter and director Joseph Mankiewicz\u2019s The Barefoot Contessa (1954), shot in Italy, cast Sellars as the warm and witty girlfriend of a has-been screenwriter and director (Humphrey Bogart), who gains the trust of his new star discovery (Ava Gardner). To a drunken woman who says of the Gardner character, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t even got what I\u2019ve got\u201d, Sellars retorts: \u201cWhat she\u2019s got you couldn\u2019t spell \u2013 and what you\u2019ve got, you used to have.\u201d</p> <p>In 20th Century Fox period movies in CinemaScope, Sellars was ornamental as sister-in-law to Napoleon (<a href=\"http://theguardian.com/news/2004/jul/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Marlon Brando</a>) in D\u00e9sir\u00e9e (1954) and as the sister of the American tragedian Edwin Booth (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-burton\" title=\"\">Richard Burton</a>) in Prince of Players (1955).</p> <p>Back from California, Sellars appeared as the official wife of the lovable bigamist (Nigel Patrick) in a transfer of the Broadway hit The Remarkable Mr Pennypacker (1955) to the New theatre, London. More significantly, she had the lead in the first British production of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/19/obituary-robert-anderson\" title=\"Robert Anderson obituary\">Robert Anderson</a>\u2019s Tea and Sympathy, four years after the 1953 Broadway opening. Sellars played Laura Reynolds, the sympathetic and tea-dispensing wife of a sports master at a private school who gives herself to a sensitive student to prove that he is not homosexual. \u201cYears from now, when you speak of this \u2013 and you will \u2013 be kind,\u201d she tells him. Because the Lord Chamberlain felt that the subject matter of the play was unseemly, he refused to allow a public performance, which meant that the Comedy theatre had to reinvent itself for the occasion as a club.</p> <p>On television, Sellars had the chance to impress in substantial roles denied her on the big screen, in plays including The Browning Version, Dial M For Murder and The Philadelphia Story.

      "bodyText": "The actor Elizabeth Sellars, who has died aged 98, had a fulfilling career on television and on stage, and took leading roles in low-budget British thrillers, as well as supporting roles to bigger stars in bigger pictures, in the 1950s and 60s. She emerged at a rich time for British television drama, often appearing on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Night Theatre (1951-59) and ITV\u2019s Play of the Week (1959-67). In the theatre, she had long runs in West End productions, and was one of the stars at Stratford-upon-Avon during Peter Hall\u2019s first season as artistic director of the newly formed Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1960-61. Sellars, who was born in Glasgow, the daughter of Jean (nee Sutherland) and Stephen Sellars, was educated at Queenswood school in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and was classically trained as an actor at Rada in London, graduating in 1940. During the second world war she joined Ensa, the troops\u2019 entertainment unit. She made her London stage debut in 1946 in The Brothers Karamazov at the Lyric, Hammersmith, directed by Peter Brook and featuring Alec Guinness as Mitya. Sellars then joined the second season of the Bristol Old Vic (1947-48) before embarking on a film career. Floodtide (1949), an uplifting drama set in the Clyde shipyards, had Gordon Jackson leading an all-Scottish cast, among them Sellars in her screen debut, who reverted to the brogue that had been ironed out by Rada. In David Lean\u2019s Madeleine (1950), set in Glasgow, Sellars played the sassy Scots maid and confidante of flighty Ann Todd in the title role. Sellars then starred in several quota quickies (usually shown on the lower half of a double-feature bill), most of them crime melodramas in which she was involved in a murder in some way. Slightly more prestigious was her short appearance as the adulterous wife of Dirk Bogarde while he is on the run for murder in Charles Crichton\u2019s Hunted (1952). She was with Bogarde again in the well-meaning The Gentle Gunman (1952). In it, Bogarde and John Mills played unlikely Irish brothers, both members of the IRA, both in love with a fellow member, Sellars, all three with wonky Irish accents. However, Sellars gave a passionate performance as a determined woman of whom it is said: \u201cIf she ever had a child it\u2019d be born in uniform with a tommy gun for a rattler.\u201d There followed supporting roles in three glamorous Hollywood movies, a world away from the gloomy monochrome British films with which Sellars had become associated. The screenwriter and director Joseph Mankiewicz\u2019s The Barefoot Contessa (1954), shot in Italy, cast Sellars as the warm and witty girlfriend of a has-been screenwriter and director (Humphrey Bogart), who gains the trust of his new star discovery (Ava Gardner). To a drunken woman who says of the Gardner character, \u201cShe hasn\u2019t even got what I\u2019ve got\u201d, Sellars retorts: \u201cWhat she\u2019s got you couldn\u2019t spell \u2013 and what you\u2019ve got, you used to have.\u201d In 20th Century Fox period movies in CinemaScope, Sellars was ornamental as sister-in-law to Napoleon (Marlon Brando) in D\u00e9sir\u00e9e (1954) and as the sister of the American tragedian Edwin Booth (Richard Burton) in Prince of Players (1955). Back from California, Sellars appeared as the official wife of the lovable bigamist (Nigel Patrick) in a transfer of the Broadway hit The Remarkable Mr Pennypacker (1955) to the New theatre, London. More significantly, she had the lead in the first British production of Robert Anderson\u2019s Tea and Sympathy, four years after the 1953 Broadway opening. Sellars played Laura Reynolds, the sympathetic and tea-dispensing wife of a sports master at a private school who gives herself to a sensitive student to prove that he is not homosexual. \u201cYears from now, when you speak of this \u2013 and you will \u2013 be kind,\u201d she tells him. Because the Lord Chamberlain felt that the subject matter of the play was unseemly, he refused to allow a public performance, which meant that the Comedy theatre had to reinvent itself for the occasion as a club. On television, Sellars had the chance to impress in substantial roles denied her on the big screen, in plays including The Browning Version, Dial M For Murder and The Philadelphia Story. In the cinema, Sellars was seen as an Irish widow helping an IRA gang and providing sexual tension between two of its members (Aldo Ray and Kieron Moore) in The Day They Robbed the Bank of England (1960), and was the faithful stay-at-home wife of a meek salesman (Richard Todd) in the thriller Never Let Go (1960), trying to dissuade him from seeking his stolen car. Sellars was almost lost in the yawning epic 55 Days at Peking (1963), in which she portrayed the wife of the British consul (David Niven). In The Chalk Garden (1964), she had the small but crucial role as Olivia, estranged loveless daughter of Mrs St Maugham (Edith Evans) and mother to a teenage daughter (Hayley Mills), the child she gave up when she remarried and whom she now wants back. But, as she says, \u201cTo have a child doesn\u2019t always make a mother.\u201d Sellars\u2019s forte was a certain neuroticism which she displayed to effect in The Italian Girl (1968), the stage adaptation of the Iris Murdoch novel, which ran for 315 performances at Wyndham\u2019s theatre in 1968, with Richard Pasco and Timothy West. Sellars signed off her film career as the cold, self-absorbed, aristocratic mother of emotionally disturbed Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles) in The Hireling (1973). On television, she was the placid, supportive, note-taking mother of John Mortimer (played by Alan Bates) and wife of his maddening father Clifford (played by Laurence Olivier) in A Voyage Round My Father (1982). Sellars, who was married to the surgeon Francis Henley from 1960 until his death in 2009, is survived by a stepson, Raymond. \u2022 Elizabeth McDonald Sellars, actor, born 6 May 1921; died 30 December 2019",

      "body": "<p>There is no such thing as a typical rapist. But both Reynhard Sinaga\u2019s friends and victims agree there was nothing about his friendly and unthreatening appearance to suggest he was capable of any kind of violence, let alone a two-and-a-half year campaign of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-jailed-life-drugging-raping-men-manchester\">rape and degradation</a>.</p> <p>Barely 5ft 7in (170cm) tall, with a soft voice, ready smile and thick-rimmed glasses, he cut an unassuming figure. \u201cHe\u2019s just nice, meek and inoffensive,\u201d said one friend from the Gay Village in Manchester. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine him getting a parking ticket or telling off. He\u2019s such a square.\u201d</p> <p>Born in 1983 to a Catholic family in Jambi in the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Sinaga came to the UK in 2007 on a student visa when he was 24. For the next 10 years, up until his arrest on 2 June 2017, he lived off money wired from Indonesia by his father, a banker. As well as paying tens of thousands of pounds in tuition fees, his father financed Sinaga\u2019s flat in Montana House, a few doors down from Factory nightclub, which became his favourite place to look for men.</p> <p>Sinaga, known as Rey, rarely talked about his family or life back home, where he had two siblings. His mother came to the first pre-trial hearing, but was not present for any of the four trials her son insisted on putting his victims through, with the defence claiming the men he drugged and filmed himself raping were only pretending to be asleep.</p> <p>He never hid his sexuality in Manchester, where he was a regular on Canal Street and in the Gay Village. Giving evidence in the fourth trial, Sinaga told of using gay dating apps including Grindr and Hornet.</p> <p>His friends say they had no knowledge of his crimes. Some had heard him describe \u201cturning\u201d heterosexual men as a sport. He would boast to certain friends of his sexual misadventures, often with the heterosexual men he was later accused of raping.</p> <p>In July 2015, in a WhatsApp exchange read to the jury, he told a friend that his flatmate was moving out. \u201cYou can get in lots of straight boys darling,\u201d said his friend. Sinaga responded with a photograph of his latest victim, passed out: \u201cHahaha. You mean like this one?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8eaaa384c401b21489f486ceab1f580149acd3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8eaaa384c401b21489f486ceab1f580149acd3f/0_83_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A CPS handout photo of the bedroom of the rapist Reynhard Sinaga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Friends said Sinaga was secretive about his bedroom and they joked on WhatsApp that bodies might be \u2018piling under the bed\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CPS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a new one,\u201d said his friend, adding: \u201cFucking hell darling u get a dif straight every week.\u201d</p> <p>Friends said he was secretive about his bedroom. In January 2015, after raping a 19-year-old man, Sinaga told a WhatsApp group that he had picked up a man the previous night who had argued with his girlfriend in Factory. \u201cSuperRey saves straight boys from their monstrous girlfriend,\u201d he boasted, sending a photograph of the victim. One friend replied: \u201cFinally I can see the inside of Rey\u2019s room, I was always forbidden to go behind the magic door hahaha. \u201cYou were always screaming \u2018nooo it\u2019s too messy!\u2019 Then we were joking male dead body were piling under the bed haha.\u201d</p> <p>Sinaga had a few short-term relationships. One female friend recalled a boyfriend who worked at the Ibis hotel opposite his flat on Princess Street. He did not cope well with rejection, she said, recalling how he threatened to drink bleach when a boyfriend broke up with him.</p> <p>Another friend said it was a mystery where Sinaga got his money from \u2013 he once had seasonal work in Next and was briefly an exam invigilator, but he could not hold down a job and yet never seemed short of cash. \u201cHe was always out, always going on holiday. We wondered where he got his money because he never seemed to work,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was always in the Village. He was one of those people who were always out. He would never be with anyone. He would cling to you and just be with you for the rest of the night.\u201d</p> <p>When word started to spread in the Gay Village that Sinaga had been arrested, many friends thought there must have been a mistake \u2013 until they learned Sinaga had filmed his attacks, cataloguing them alongside photos he took of his victims\u2019 ID or bank cards. That he had spiked their drinks was a further shock.

      "bodyText": "There is no such thing as a typical rapist. But both Reynhard Sinaga\u2019s friends and victims agree there was nothing about his friendly and unthreatening appearance to suggest he was capable of any kind of violence, let alone a two-and-a-half year campaign of rape and degradation. Barely 5ft 7in (170cm) tall, with a soft voice, ready smile and thick-rimmed glasses, he cut an unassuming figure. \u201cHe\u2019s just nice, meek and inoffensive,\u201d said one friend from the Gay Village in Manchester. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine him getting a parking ticket or telling off. He\u2019s such a square.\u201d Born in 1983 to a Catholic family in Jambi in the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Sinaga came to the UK in 2007 on a student visa when he was 24. For the next 10 years, up until his arrest on 2 June 2017, he lived off money wired from Indonesia by his father, a banker. As well as paying tens of thousands of pounds in tuition fees, his father financed Sinaga\u2019s flat in Montana House, a few doors down from Factory nightclub, which became his favourite place to look for men. Sinaga, known as Rey, rarely talked about his family or life back home, where he had two siblings. His mother came to the first pre-trial hearing, but was not present for any of the four trials her son insisted on putting his victims through, with the defence claiming the men he drugged and filmed himself raping were only pretending to be asleep. He never hid his sexuality in Manchester, where he was a regular on Canal Street and in the Gay Village. Giving evidence in the fourth trial, Sinaga told of using gay dating apps including Grindr and Hornet. His friends say they had no knowledge of his crimes. Some had heard him describe \u201cturning\u201d heterosexual men as a sport. He would boast to certain friends of his sexual misadventures, often with the heterosexual men he was later accused of raping. In July 2015, in a WhatsApp exchange read to the jury, he told a friend that his flatmate was moving out. \u201cYou can get in lots of straight boys darling,\u201d said his friend. Sinaga responded with a photograph of his latest victim, passed out: \u201cHahaha. You mean like this one?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s always a new one,\u201d said his friend, adding: \u201cFucking hell darling u get a dif straight every week.\u201d Friends said he was secretive about his bedroom. In January 2015, after raping a 19-year-old man, Sinaga told a WhatsApp group that he had picked up a man the previous night who had argued with his girlfriend in Factory. \u201cSuperRey saves straight boys from their monstrous girlfriend,\u201d he boasted, sending a photograph of the victim. One friend replied: \u201cFinally I can see the inside of Rey\u2019s room, I was always forbidden to go behind the magic door hahaha. \u201cYou were always screaming \u2018nooo it\u2019s too messy!\u2019 Then we were joking male dead body were piling under the bed haha.\u201d Sinaga had a few short-term relationships. One female friend recalled a boyfriend who worked at the Ibis hotel opposite his flat on Princess Street. He did not cope well with rejection, she said, recalling how he threatened to drink bleach when a boyfriend broke up with him. Another friend said it was a mystery where Sinaga got his money from \u2013 he once had seasonal work in Next and was briefly an exam invigilator, but he could not hold down a job and yet never seemed short of cash. \u201cHe was always out, always going on holiday. We wondered where he got his money because he never seemed to work,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was always in the Village. He was one of those people who were always out. He would never be with anyone. He would cling to you and just be with you for the rest of the night.\u201d When word started to spread in the Gay Village that Sinaga had been arrested, many friends thought there must have been a mistake \u2013 until they learned Sinaga had filmed his attacks, cataloguing them alongside photos he took of his victims\u2019 ID or bank cards. That he had spiked their drinks was a further shock. Friends from the Village said he was never into drugs when they knew him, in the early 2010s, and had never spoken of chemsex parties or GHB, sticking to alcohol on his many nights out. One close friend, who collaborated with Sinaga on a photography project, said he was \u201ca sweet, happy guy, always smiling and laughing\u201d, liked by all. He attended St Chrysostom\u2019s church, which prides itself on welcoming \u201call people regardless of ethnicity, age, relationship status, disability or sexual orientation, and regardless of how much or how little faith people have\u201d. Until recently, Sinaga was still pictured on a church blogpost from 2012, when he helped with a children\u2019s Easter project and talked about the children having a \u201cfabulous time\u201d. The church provided a character reference for Sinaga, with the judge, Suzanne Gooddard QC, remarking during the sentencing of the second trial: \u201cIt is almost beyond belief that someone who could profess some Christian faith could at the same time have been committing such wicked and evil crimes.\u201d The other two references came from his mother and sister, based in Indonesia, neither of whom, said the judge, know of \u201cthe cold, cunning and calculated rapist that you are\u201d. His barrister struggled to find anything to say in his favour, accepting the \u201cobvious aggravating factors in the case\u201d and the assessment of psychiatrists and prison staff that he was highly dangerous and at great risk of reoffending. Another friend remembered how someone from the church was helping Sinaga try to apply for refugee status \u201con the grounds he couldn\u2019t be gay in Indonesia\u201d. Whether he ever submitted an asylum claim is unclear, but Sinaga managed to keep extending his stay in the UK by eking out his PhD. \u201cHe was trying to avoid returning to Indonesia and one way to avoid that was to stay a student for ever,\u201d said his photography friend. Sinaga studied at Manchester University from August 2007 for an MA in sociology, and then in August 2012 began studying at Leeds University for a PhD in human geography, which he never finished. He submitted his thesis, entitled \u201cSexuality and everyday transnationalism among South Asian gay and bisexual men in Manchester\u201d, in August 2016, but it failed and he was given time to make corrections. Sinaga flitted between various groups of friends. One woman who knew him well until 2013 said he thought of himself as \u201ca bit of a Peter Pan\u201d. He looked younger than his age and acted it, being \u201cnarcissistic and somewhat naive to everything\u201d. He loved taking selfies and lived his life online, posting daily photographs. The final shot was taken on 1 June 2017, the day before he was arrested, using a filter that gave him pink ears and sunglasses.",

      "body": "<p>Reynhard Sinaga\u2019s luck ran out shortly before 6am on 2 June 2017. For at least two-and-a-half years, the Indonesian student had honed his tactic of inviting men back to his flat in central Manchester and handing them a spiked drink on arrival.</p> <p>But that morning, the drugs failed. Or perhaps he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-peter-pan-phd-student-who-raped-scores-of-men\">become so complacent</a> that he did not use any. Either way, his final victim, an 18-year-old he had met outside Factory nightclub, woke up face down with his jeans and boxer shorts around his knees. He realised Sinaga was sexually assaulting him and pushed his shorter and slighter attacker off, beating him up so badly he thought he might have killed him.</p> <p>The teenager called 999 and an ambulance soon arrived at Montana House, where Sinaga had lived for five years, around the corner from the clubs where he found many of his victims. Sinaga was stretchered out and taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain, while police arrested the teenager on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.</p> <p>Detectives from Greater Manchester police soon realised they had detained the wrong person. They went to Manchester Royal Infirmary to question Sinaga and noticed he was behaving oddly. He was obsessed with being given his phone and repeatedly gave police the wrong password, trying to grab it from an officer when he reluctantly revealed the correct pin. After unlocking the phone, they discovered films showing Sinaga raping a series of apparently sleeping young men.</p> <p>Another iPhone contained more films of more men. Months of analysis identified more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/06/reynhard-sinaga-jailed-life-drugging-raping-men-manchester\">195 different victims</a>, who were all unconscious while Sinaga abused them. DI Zed Ali, the senior investigating officer, said it was \u201clike trying to put together a million-piece jigsaw without the jigsaw cover\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61dc3ba3f1511547df0e8c9126e18cd38488e098\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61dc3ba3f1511547df0e8c9126e18cd38488e098/0_101_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sinaga\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On one occasion, Sinaga was filmed on CCTV leaving the block where he lived and returning within a minute with his next victim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Investigators did not find any of the drugs Sinaga is believed to have used to knock his victims out. Police waited two days to interview the final complainant, by which time any drugs would have disappeared from his system. But the prosecution insisted the men must have been drugged, probably with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid \u2013 commonly known as GHB \u2013 or something with very similar effects.</p> <p>Sometimes known as liquid ecstasy, Gina or G, the drug is popular in the gay chemsex scene. It can cause the levels of sedation, unconsciousness and incapacity seen on the videos Sinaga recorded as he abused his victims. Regular users call it \u201cG-ing out\u201d. On one of the clips, a mobile phone could be heard ringing at full volume but the victim did not stir; in many others, the men could be heard snoring loudly while Sinaga repeatedly raped them.</p> <p>Many of Sinaga\u2019s victims remembered him giving them a drink when they went to his flat. Some recalled being promised a \u201cparty\u201d or simply somewhere to sleep for the night, but then had a total blackout until the following day. Only one, a 21-year-old man raped four times by Sinaga in the early hours of 21 May 2017, told the jury there was something odd about the drink he was handed.</p> <p>\u201cIt looked like water but there was a solution in it, almost like salt. It wasn\u2019t as transparent as water,\u201d the man said, giving evidence via video link. \u201cI think I said to him, \u2018What\u2019s this? This isn\u2019t water\u2019, and he said, \u2018It\u2019s water, you need to drink water\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The heterosexual man said he remembered nothing after that point until he woke up the next day in Sinaga\u2019s flat with what he thought was \u201cthe worst hangover ever\u201d. He noticed a used condom underneath a set of drawers \u2013 one of the rare times Sinaga is believed to have used protection \u2013 and asked him what had happened. \u201cHe said he had saved me, that I was passed out on the sidewalk next to Factory [a nightclub], and I said \u2018OK, thank you for giving me a place to stay\u2019. It was plausible: I was really drunk,\u201d the man said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7829678cf39e8af1b00d2ae6a9866d0fd0a5426c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7829678cf39e8af1b00d2ae6a9866d0fd0a5426c/0_128_3216_1929/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The inside of the home of the serial rapist Reynhard Sinaga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sinaga would lure men to his flat in Princess Street with the promise of a \u2018party\u2019 or simply a place to stay for the night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CPS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a WhatsApp group where he would boast of his sexual conquests, Sinaga once made reference to a \u201csecret poison\u201d he used to make heterosexual men fall in love with him. He sent the message after raping a 21-year-old man he had spotted trying to walk home after losing his bank card and running out of phone battery on a night out. Asked for his \u201cformula\u201d for seducing these men, Sinaga responded with: \u201cBlack magic yeah! Rey makes drink potion of gay love haha \u2026 Take a sip of my secret poison, I\u2019ll make you fall in love.\u201d</p> <p>The drugs were so effective that only Sinaga\u2019s final victim knew with any certainty that he had been assaulted. Until police knocked on their doors several years later, some remembered Sinaga only as the \u201cgood samaritan\u201d who gave them a place to stay when they lost their friends or bank card, or their phone had run out of battery.</p> <p>They thanked him for looking after them and felt guilty for imposing on him. Some even agreed to be his friend on Facebook. One returned with his girlfriend the following day to prove he had innocently spent the night at Sinaga\u2019s, rather than with another woman.</p> <p>Forty-eight of Sinaga\u2019s victims agreed to give evidence against him at Manchester crown court, which meant the case had to be split into four separate trials, the first beginning in May 2018 and the final one finishing just before Christmas 2019. Some of the victims were shielded from Sinaga by screens or appeared via video link. Others were in open court.</p> <p>A media blackout was imposed, banning any reporting so as not to prejudice the next jury, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) keeping open the possibility of charging Sinaga with more of the hundreds of rapes and sexual assaults he had filmed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-3902iXbM7FG0N0gz/\" data-alt=\"Reynhard Sinaga graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-3902iXbM7FG0N0gz/\">Reynhard Sinaga graphic</a> </figure>  <p>He kept souvenirs to remember his crimes \u2013 passports, watches, bank cards and driving licences \u2013 and often took screenshots of his victims\u2019 Facebook profiles to create what the prosecutor, Iain Simkin QC, likened to a \u201cTop Trumps\u201d collection.</p> <p>Giving evidence in the first and last of his four trials, Sinaga described himself as an \u201ceffeminate gay man\u201d and claimed he was perceived as a \u201cladyboy\u201d by his \u201csexually curious\u201d victims. He said each of the 48 men approached him on the street near his flat and propositioned himbefore agreeing to go to his flat to take part in sexual role play that involved them pretending to be asleep while he penetrated them, sometimes for hours. They were lying in court, Sinaga suggested, because \u201cit is not an easy thing to come out as gay\u201d, and \u201cinternalised homophobia\u201d remains widespread.</p> <p>Sentencing him after the first trial, the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, dismissed his defence as \u201cludicrous \u2026 that each of the males had asked you for oral sex or anal sex and had agreed to take part in your sexual fantasy by lying completely still throughout and not speaking or making any sounds, and had agreed to be filmed in the most intimate ways imaginable.\u201d</p> <p>Because Sinaga persisted with his defence, jurors had to watch the footage. All were later uniquely offered counselling.</p> <p>A number of the victims vomited and still did not wake up while being abused. The films showed Sinaga carefully checking the younger men were unconscious, putting his finger in their belly buttons to see if they would react, before raping them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b2cedf66858ba8c6e5ace86e7c7104c8805333c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b2cedf66858ba8c6e5ace86e7c7104c8805333c/0_0_431_611/353.jpg\" alt=\"A CCTV still of Reynhard Sinaga\" width=\"353\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A CCTV still of Sinaga, who would often walk the streets near his flat after midnight in search of victims.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Martin/CPS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sinaga rarely wore a condom, meaning all of the victims had to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, though he tested negative after his arrest.</p> <p>The earliest rape to come to court took place in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day in 2015. A 22-year-old man who, like the vast majority of Sinaga\u2019s targets, was heterosexual, could remember nothing after going to the Ritz club in Manchester until he woke up on Sinaga\u2019s floor covered in vomit. After the victim left the flat, embarrassed at imposing on a stranger, Sinaga texted a friend to boast that he had had his first sexual intercourse of the year with a man who was not gay. \u201cHe was straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha. Well, he was straight until we woke up naked,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Sinaga would typically leave his flat at about midnight and go looking for men, most often outside Factory, which was almost next door. Sometimes, he walked for a few minutes and loitered outside 5th Avenue, another club popular with students now known as Fifth Manchester. On one occasion, he was filmed on CCTV leaving Montana House and returning within a minute with his next victim.</p> <p>On one weekend in September 2016, Sinaga raped two men in the space of 24 hours, one in the early hours of Saturday and the other on Sunday. The second man, a 19-year-old who had been out with his mother on Canal Street, remembered Sinaga helping him up from the pavement after he had been kicked out of a taxi. He recalled going back to Montana House but then nothing until he woke up naked in Sinaga\u2019s bedroom the next morning. He asked Sinaga why he was not wearing clothes and was told he had been sick, so Sinaga had undressed him. They ended up having a drink together before Sinaga asked if he would have sex. The man refused, saying he had a girlfriend.</p> <p>\u201cTellingly, you may think, there was never any conversation concerning the eight instances of sexual activity which had already taken place that morning, nor was there any mention of the defendant recording any sexual acts,\u201d Simkin told the jury in the second trial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcdfd84a498e050c8afbf2f80d6d9aa892f792c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcdfd84a498e050c8afbf2f80d6d9aa892f792c2/0_96_960_576/500.jpg\" alt=\"Reynhard Sinaga\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sinaga was well known in Manchester\u2019s Gay Village and people who regularly saw him at clubs were shocked when he was arrested.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When word began to spread in Manchester\u2019s Gay Village that Sinaga had been arrested, there was widespread incredulity that the slight, cheerful man they often saw out dancing and giggling could be capable of such acts.

      "bodyText": "Reynhard Sinaga\u2019s luck ran out shortly before 6am on 2 June 2017. For at least two-and-a-half years, the Indonesian student had honed his tactic of inviting men back to his flat in central Manchester and handing them a spiked drink on arrival. But that morning, the drugs failed. Or perhaps he had become so complacent that he did not use any. Either way, his final victim, an 18-year-old he had met outside Factory nightclub, woke up face down with his jeans and boxer shorts around his knees. He realised Sinaga was sexually assaulting him and pushed his shorter and slighter attacker off, beating him up so badly he thought he might have killed him. The teenager called 999 and an ambulance soon arrived at Montana House, where Sinaga had lived for five years, around the corner from the clubs where he found many of his victims. Sinaga was stretchered out and taken to hospital with a suspected bleed on the brain, while police arrested the teenager on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Detectives from Greater Manchester police soon realised they had detained the wrong person. They went to Manchester Royal Infirmary to question Sinaga and noticed he was behaving oddly. He was obsessed with being given his phone and repeatedly gave police the wrong password, trying to grab it from an officer when he reluctantly revealed the correct pin. After unlocking the phone, they discovered films showing Sinaga raping a series of apparently sleeping young men. Another iPhone contained more films of more men. Months of analysis identified more than 195 different victims, who were all unconscious while Sinaga abused them. DI Zed Ali, the senior investigating officer, said it was \u201clike trying to put together a million-piece jigsaw without the jigsaw cover\u201d. Investigators did not find any of the drugs Sinaga is believed to have used to knock his victims out. Police waited two days to interview the final complainant, by which time any drugs would have disappeared from his system. But the prosecution insisted the men must have been drugged, probably with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid \u2013 commonly known as GHB \u2013 or something with very similar effects. Sometimes known as liquid ecstasy, Gina or G, the drug is popular in the gay chemsex scene. It can cause the levels of sedation, unconsciousness and incapacity seen on the videos Sinaga recorded as he abused his victims. Regular users call it \u201cG-ing out\u201d. On one of the clips, a mobile phone could be heard ringing at full volume but the victim did not stir; in many others, the men could be heard snoring loudly while Sinaga repeatedly raped them. Many of Sinaga\u2019s victims remembered him giving them a drink when they went to his flat. Some recalled being promised a \u201cparty\u201d or simply somewhere to sleep for the night, but then had a total blackout until the following day. Only one, a 21-year-old man raped four times by Sinaga in the early hours of 21 May 2017, told the jury there was something odd about the drink he was handed. \u201cIt looked like water but there was a solution in it, almost like salt. It wasn\u2019t as transparent as water,\u201d the man said, giving evidence via video link. \u201cI think I said to him, \u2018What\u2019s this? This isn\u2019t water\u2019, and he said, \u2018It\u2019s water, you need to drink water\u2019.\u201d The heterosexual man said he remembered nothing after that point until he woke up the next day in Sinaga\u2019s flat with what he thought was \u201cthe worst hangover ever\u201d. He noticed a used condom underneath a set of drawers \u2013 one of the rare times Sinaga is believed to have used protection \u2013 and asked him what had happened. \u201cHe said he had saved me, that I was passed out on the sidewalk next to Factory [a nightclub], and I said \u2018OK, thank you for giving me a place to stay\u2019. It was plausible: I was really drunk,\u201d the man said. In a WhatsApp group where he would boast of his sexual conquests, Sinaga once made reference to a \u201csecret poison\u201d he used to make heterosexual men fall in love with him. He sent the message after raping a 21-year-old man he had spotted trying to walk home after losing his bank card and running out of phone battery on a night out. Asked for his \u201cformula\u201d for seducing these men, Sinaga responded with: \u201cBlack magic yeah! Rey makes drink potion of gay love haha \u2026 Take a sip of my secret poison, I\u2019ll make you fall in love.\u201d The drugs were so effective that only Sinaga\u2019s final victim knew with any certainty that he had been assaulted. Until police knocked on their doors several years later, some remembered Sinaga only as the \u201cgood samaritan\u201d who gave them a place to stay when they lost their friends or bank card, or their phone had run out of battery. They thanked him for looking after them and felt guilty for imposing on him. Some even agreed to be his friend on Facebook. One returned with his girlfriend the following day to prove he had innocently spent the night at Sinaga\u2019s, rather than with another woman. Forty-eight of Sinaga\u2019s victims agreed to give evidence against him at Manchester crown court, which meant the case had to be split into four separate trials, the first beginning in May 2018 and the final one finishing just before Christmas 2019. Some of the victims were shielded from Sinaga by screens or appeared via video link. Others were in open court. A media blackout was imposed, banning any reporting so as not to prejudice the next jury, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) keeping open the possibility of charging Sinaga with more of the hundreds of rapes and sexual assaults he had filmed. He kept souvenirs to remember his crimes \u2013 passports, watches, bank cards and driving licences \u2013 and often took screenshots of his victims\u2019 Facebook profiles to create what the prosecutor, Iain Simkin QC, likened to a \u201cTop Trumps\u201d collection. Giving evidence in the first and last of his four trials, Sinaga described himself as an \u201ceffeminate gay man\u201d and claimed he was perceived as a \u201cladyboy\u201d by his \u201csexually curious\u201d victims. He said each of the 48 men approached him on the street near his flat and propositioned himbefore agreeing to go to his flat to take part in sexual role play that involved them pretending to be asleep while he penetrated them, sometimes for hours. They were lying in court, Sinaga suggested, because \u201cit is not an easy thing to come out as gay\u201d, and \u201cinternalised homophobia\u201d remains widespread. Sentencing him after the first trial, the judge, Suzanne Goddard QC, dismissed his defence as \u201cludicrous \u2026 that each of the males had asked you for oral sex or anal sex and had agreed to take part in your sexual fantasy by lying completely still throughout and not speaking or making any sounds, and had agreed to be filmed in the most intimate ways imaginable.\u201d Because Sinaga persisted with his defence, jurors had to watch the footage. All were later uniquely offered counselling. A number of the victims vomited and still did not wake up while being abused. The films showed Sinaga carefully checking the younger men were unconscious, putting his finger in their belly buttons to see if they would react, before raping them. Sinaga rarely wore a condom, meaning all of the victims had to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, though he tested negative after his arrest. The earliest rape to come to court took place in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day in 2015. A 22-year-old man who, like the vast majority of Sinaga\u2019s targets, was heterosexual, could remember nothing after going to the Ritz club in Manchester until he woke up on Sinaga\u2019s floor covered in vomit. After the victim left the flat, embarrassed at imposing on a stranger, Sinaga texted a friend to boast that he had had his first sexual intercourse of the year with a man who was not gay. \u201cHe was straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha. Well, he was straight until we woke up naked,\u201d he wrote. Sinaga would typically leave his flat at about midnight and go looking for men, most often outside Factory, which was almost next door. Sometimes, he walked for a few minutes and loitered outside 5th Avenue, another club popular with students now known as Fifth Manchester. On one occasion, he was filmed on CCTV leaving Montana House and returning within a minute with his next victim. On one weekend in September 2016, Sinaga raped two men in the space of 24 hours, one in the early hours of Saturday and the other on Sunday. The second man, a 19-year-old who had been out with his mother on Canal Street, remembered Sinaga helping him up from the pavement after he had been kicked out of a taxi. He recalled going back to Montana House but then nothing until he woke up naked in Sinaga\u2019s bedroom the next morning. He asked Sinaga why he was not wearing clothes and was told he had been sick, so Sinaga had undressed him. They ended up having a drink together before Sinaga asked if he would have sex. The man refused, saying he had a girlfriend. \u201cTellingly, you may think, there was never any conversation concerning the eight instances of sexual activity which had already taken place that morning, nor was there any mention of the defendant recording any sexual acts,\u201d Simkin told the jury in the second trial. When word began to spread in Manchester\u2019s Gay Village that Sinaga had been arrested, there was widespread incredulity that the slight, cheerful man they often saw out dancing and giggling could be capable of such acts. In the early 2010s, he was a fixture on Canal Street, out most nights of the week at the Thompson Arms, G-A-Y or the club night Poptastic. He had a large circle of friends, but few were close. \u201cHe was very flamboyant, had highlighted hair and was very camp,\u201d said one man who went out regularly with Sinaga until 2013. \u201cHe was always out, always going on holiday. We wondered where he got his money because he never seemed to work.\u201d Others thought he was a sex worker, or involved with a well-off man who funded his lifestyle. One of his female friends remembered Sinaga had a couple of boyfriends: one who worked at the Ibis hotel opposite his flat, and another who left him distraught. \u201cHe left Rey and Rey threatened to drink bleach. He had an extreme behaviour [in response] to rejection, if that\u2019s the right term for it,\u201d she said. Sinaga was constantly chatting to men on the gay dating apps Grindr and Hornet, and was very active on Facebook and Instagram. His final Facebook post was the day before his arrest. When the updates stopped, some of his friends wondered where he had gone. In the end, it was Sinaga\u2019s compulsion to document his crimes that caused his downfall. During sentencing after the second trial, Goddard told him: \u201cIt is ironic that were it not for the films that you took of your evil crimes, it seems that most of these offences would not have even been discovered, let alone prosecuted.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Seattle Seahawks defensive end Jadeveon Clowney has been accused of a \u201cdirty\u201d hit that knocked Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz out of Sunday\u2019s wildcard playoff game. Wentz left the game, which the Eagles lost 17-9, with a head injury in the first quarter after Clowney made contact with the quarterback\u2019s helmet during a tackle. Wentz\u2019s head also slammed into the turf as he went down and he was replaced by back-up quarterback Josh McCown for the rest of the game. Eagles tackle Jason Peters said he confronted Clowney about the tackle during the game. \u201cI checked Clowney about it,\u201d Peters said. \u201cHe was mouthing, I was mouthing back at him ... I just told him, \u2018Man, that\u2019s a dirty play. And he\u2019s like, \u2018My bad,\u2019 and we just kept playing. I just kept reminding him, \u2018Man, stay off my quarterback.\u2019 I\u2019m a left tackle. I\u2019ve got his back. I\u2019m the blindside. And I just take it personal when somebody is taking a late hit or trying to rough up the quarterback.\u201d Eagles tight end Zach Ertz also questioned the legality of the play. \u201cI thought it was late,\u201d said Ertz, who played the game with fractured ribs. \u201cI kinda knew something was wrong right away \u2013 just the way he got up. Devastated for my guy. Really tough.\u201d After the game, referee Shawn Smith said Clowney had done nothing wrong. \u201c[Wentz] was a runner, and he did not give himself up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw incidental helmet contact, and in our judgment, we didn\u2019t rule that to be a foul.\u201d Clowney himself said he had not meant to hurt Wentz. \u201cIt was a bang-bang play. I don\u2019t intend to hurt anybody in this league, let me just put that out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been down the injury road; it\u2019s not fun. My intention was not to hurt him. I was just playing fast.\u201d He also said there \u201cmight be death threats\u201d from Eagles fans, who he described as \u201cthe worst \u2026 in the world\u201d. On Monday, Wentz posted a message to his Instagram account saying he was feeling better. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good today and will be just fine! Head injuries are a scary thing so I appreciate everybody\u2019s thoughts and prayers,\u201d he wrote.

Next door is the remains of a burnt-out cafe. Across the road are the charred ruins of what used to be a leather shop, a yoga studio and an incense shop.</p> <p>\u201cWe were told that the fireys really fought to save the post office because they didn\u2019t want to lose it,\u201d Moser says. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, you know? Why do we deserve that?\u201d</p> <p>Moser and Wilson have not been entirely lucky. The couple moved here from Sydney four years ago to start a new life together running the post office.

It was just so scary. I just packed the car. Dave did want to fight it in the beginning but we were worried about getting out. There\u2019s only one road in here.\u201d</p> <p>With their four dogs they headed for the nearby seaside town of Bermagui, which, by 10am, was \u201cpitch black\u201d from smoke. The rumour mill there was in overdrive. They were told the post office had gone, that the whole town was gone.</p> <p>When they returned home a few days later, they found the remains of their<strong> </strong>house.</p> <p>\u201cI was just numb,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cI think your body just sort of shuts down. I still don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really processed it yet. I\u2019ve literally just found out that we\u2019re covered by insurance and I just feel flat. I think I\u2019ve been carrying around all that stress and now I\u2019m just empty.\u201d</p> <p>There is a terrible irony: as Guardian Australia drives through Cobargo to inspect the blackened ruins of the village and surrounding district, rain falls.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"660ae7cecc39d295854d4ab9973f815aa4d8a8e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/660ae7cecc39d295854d4ab9973f815aa4d8a8e4/0_83_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sheep and goats amid the ruins of Moser and Wilson\u2019s destroyed home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheep and goats amid the ruins of Moser and Wilson\u2019s destroyed home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Quilty/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mild temperatures and wet weather that have helped firefighters in NSW come to grips with the dozens of blazes still burning out of control came too late for many places.</p> <p>On Monday police confirmed an eighth person had died in the south coast fires, bringing the total number of deaths in the state since the start of this bushfire season to 20.

      "bodyText": "The joey rescued from his mother\u2019s pouch after the bushfires that tore through the village of Cobargo on the south coast of New South Wales last week has no name yet, but Kyle Moser is leaning towards \u201cAli\u201d. \u201cLike the fighter,\u201d he explains. In a room at the back of the Cobargo post office, Moser and his partner, David Wilson, are caring for the kangaroo soon to be known as Ali and two wallaby joeys. Next door is the remains of a burnt-out cafe. Across the road are the charred ruins of what used to be a leather shop, a yoga studio and an incense shop. \u201cWe were told that the fireys really fought to save the post office because they didn\u2019t want to lose it,\u201d Moser says. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, you know? Why do we deserve that?\u201d Moser and Wilson have not been entirely lucky. The couple moved here from Sydney four years ago to start a new life together running the post office. After the weekend\u2019s fire, it has become their home. On Monday they take the Guardian to see what was left of their house in neighbouring Wandella. While they feed the sheep, cows and goats that miraculously survived the blaze amid the rubble of what used to be their home, they explain how they watched in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Eve as the fire approached their town. \u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d Moser says. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be involved in a bushfire \u2013 and never again, hopefully. It was just so scary. I just packed the car. Dave did want to fight it in the beginning but we were worried about getting out. There\u2019s only one road in here.\u201d With their four dogs they headed for the nearby seaside town of Bermagui, which, by 10am, was \u201cpitch black\u201d from smoke. The rumour mill there was in overdrive. They were told the post office had gone, that the whole town was gone. When they returned home a few days later, they found the remains of their house. \u201cI was just numb,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cI think your body just sort of shuts down. I still don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really processed it yet. I\u2019ve literally just found out that we\u2019re covered by insurance and I just feel flat. I think I\u2019ve been carrying around all that stress and now I\u2019m just empty.\u201d There is a terrible irony: as Guardian Australia drives through Cobargo to inspect the blackened ruins of the village and surrounding district, rain falls. The mild temperatures and wet weather that have helped firefighters in NSW come to grips with the dozens of blazes still burning out of control came too late for many places. On Monday police confirmed an eighth person had died in the south coast fires, bringing the total number of deaths in the state since the start of this bushfire season to 20. A 71-year-old man was found at his property in Nerrigundah, a tiny village about an hour north of Cobargo. What happens to people like Moser and Wilson after the initial crisis has passed? \u201cThat was my first thought. My initial thought was, like, what\u2019s next?,\u201d Moser says. \u201cLike, what happens now? I still don\u2019t know.\u201d It has been a week since a father and son, Robert and Patrick Salway, died fighting the same fire at their home in neighbouring Coolagolite. The blaze destroyed dozens of homes and businesses in Cobargo and the surrounding district, and the village became the subject of international focus after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was heckled during a visit. But after the spotlight moves on to the next town in the fire\u2019s path, life for many here has hit an impasse. The village remains without power and the local showground has become the shelter for a number of people left homeless. It has become a place to find information, get a place to stay, and pick up supplies at a donation stall better stocked than most local general stores. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where most of the donations are coming from any more,\u201d Jess Collins says. \u201cThings show up and are gone again before I know where they came from. Some guys from Jindabyne [about 200km west] dropped some stuff off before.\u201d Collins has been here most days since the fire hit. Though she grew up in Cobargo, she now lives about four hours north, in the town of Goulburn. She came home for Christmas to visit her father, and took shelter at the showgrounds when the hills around his home became engulfed by fire. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go home eventually but for now I just want to help,\u201d she says.",

      "body": "<p>If you enjoy a thing, it\u2019s only natural to want more of it, as those of us who have done extremely well at the trough in the past fortnight are keenly aware. How, then, do we explain the recent Twitter polls which have come out resoundingly against the idea of adding a fifth day to the Cheltenham Festival?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinblake2011/status/1213532590080241665\">Here is one</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HonestFrank/status/1212647954479235073\">Here is another</a>. In both cases, votes in favour of an extra day failed to make it as high as 20% after the idea <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvracing/status/1212388530384715778\">was discussed on ITV</a> by Cheltenham\u2019s new chairman.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/05/george-mcgrath-jamie-osborne-bad-practices\">Bad practices list for horse racing trainers includes allegation of assault</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This, in my view, goes a long way beyond mere resistance to change. People are concerned, rightly, about dilution of competition and its potential to kill off the Festival\u2019s appeal.</p> \n<p>One of flat racing\u2019s biggest problems is over-provision of top-class races, enabling the best horses to avoid each other for much of the summer. It\u2019s not such a hot topic in jump racing because almost everyone wants to win at the Festival, so the best horses tend to turn up there if they\u2019re fit and we find out who\u2019s best.</p> \n<p>But, as extra races are added to the Festival, it becomes less The Place Where Champions Clash and more The Place Where Champions Duff Up Inferior Rivals At Short Odds. Contrary to what some may believe, 70,000 people will not pay top dollar for the pleasure of being close to really talented horses. What they want is to see them race against each other; instead, we are in danger of creating a race for each high-quality animal, so they can all start at 1-5 and win easily.</p> \n<p>When the Festival was just three days long, odds-on favourites were rare. There were none in 2002 or 2003. There were three in 2004, the last year of the three-day Festival, because those great champions Best Mate, Baracouda and Moscow Flyer were all at the height of their reputations. Three odds-on favourites from 60 races over the three years is a rate of 5%.</p> \n<p>Over the last three years, 84 Festival races have produced 11 odds-on favourites, a rate of 13%. In other words, odds-on favourites are more than twice as common at the Festival and while that probably has something to do with the concentration of equine talent in fewer hands, it is mostly because of the mushrooming opportunities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/05/david-muir-racehorse-welfare\">David Muir, racing\u2019s conscience, has his eyes on another hurdle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Those short-priced favourites are shorter than they used to be, too. In 2004, nothing went off shorter than 8-11. In the last three years, we\u2019ve had favourites at 4-11, 4-6, 1-2, 4-7, 1-4 and 2-9.

      "bodyText": "If you enjoy a thing, it\u2019s only natural to want more of it, as those of us who have done extremely well at the trough in the past fortnight are keenly aware. How, then, do we explain the recent Twitter polls which have come out resoundingly against the idea of adding a fifth day to the Cheltenham Festival? Here is one. Here is another. In both cases, votes in favour of an extra day failed to make it as high as 20% after the idea was discussed on ITV by Cheltenham\u2019s new chairman. This, in my view, goes a long way beyond mere resistance to change. People are concerned, rightly, about dilution of competition and its potential to kill off the Festival\u2019s appeal. One of flat racing\u2019s biggest problems is over-provision of top-class races, enabling the best horses to avoid each other for much of the summer. It\u2019s not such a hot topic in jump racing because almost everyone wants to win at the Festival, so the best horses tend to turn up there if they\u2019re fit and we find out who\u2019s best. But, as extra races are added to the Festival, it becomes less The Place Where Champions Clash and more The Place Where Champions Duff Up Inferior Rivals At Short Odds. Contrary to what some may believe, 70,000 people will not pay top dollar for the pleasure of being close to really talented horses. What they want is to see them race against each other; instead, we are in danger of creating a race for each high-quality animal, so they can all start at 1-5 and win easily. When the Festival was just three days long, odds-on favourites were rare. There were none in 2002 or 2003. There were three in 2004, the last year of the three-day Festival, because those great champions Best Mate, Baracouda and Moscow Flyer were all at the height of their reputations. Three odds-on favourites from 60 races over the three years is a rate of 5%. Over the last three years, 84 Festival races have produced 11 odds-on favourites, a rate of 13%. In other words, odds-on favourites are more than twice as common at the Festival and while that probably has something to do with the concentration of equine talent in fewer hands, it is mostly because of the mushrooming opportunities. Those short-priced favourites are shorter than they used to be, too. In 2004, nothing went off shorter than 8-11. In the last three years, we\u2019ve had favourites at 4-11, 4-6, 1-2, 4-7, 1-4 and 2-9. No, they didn\u2019t all win but anticipation is a huge part of the Festival\u2019s appeal and, in anticipation, those races were widely seen as foregone conclusions. If we add the necessary races to give the Festival a fifth day, I worry that we\u2019ll end up with odds-on favourites in every fifth race. Unless we somehow increase the available pool of equine talent, the best horses will simply be more spaced out than ever before. Trainers and owners are bound to love the idea of more Festival races, because it increases their chance of enjoying that moment in the winner\u2019s enclosure that everyone covets. But those who love the sport must tell them, politely but firmly, that it is a terrible idea. The Festival is a massively successful event which puts racing at the centre of the sporting world every March. But there is no law that it has to remain that way. Fortunately, there are lots of intelligent, sensible people running the racecourse and in senior positions at the Jockey Club. I have every hope that, despite the financial temptations, they will see a fifth day for the elephant trap it really is.

Exelerator Express (1.50) appeals for his hurdles debut at 6-1 in what looks a weak maiden contest. Second in two bumpers, Neil Mulholland\u2019s charge is bred to make a hurdler.

      "bodyText": "The UK service sector rebounded in December as business optimism jumped in the wake of Boris Johnson\u2019s unexpectedly decisive election victory, lifting some of the political uncertainty facing the British economy. The latest health check of a sector that includes hotels, restaurants, transport and the City from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) found that business optimism soared to the highest level since September 2018. Companies reported the sharpest rise in new work since July amid signs that service providers have become hopeful that a more stable political backdrop should help business in 2020. The monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index from IHS Markit/Cips rose to 50.0 last month, up from 49.3 during November, to signal a stabilisation of overall service sector activity on a scale where 50.0 separates growth from contraction. The survey of about 650 service sector companies straddled the election, with firms responding between 5 December and 19 December, suggesting the unexpectedly decisive result may have influenced business optimism. The Institute of Directors, which polled almost 1,000 of its members the day after the election, found optimism among company bosses leapt to its highest level for more than three years following the Conservatives\u2019 election win. Tim Moore, the economics associate director at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe modest rebound in new work provides another signal that business conditions should begin to improve in the coming months, helped by a boost to business sentiment from greater Brexit clarity and a more predictable political landscape.\u201d Despite the improving outlook, the snapshot for December from service sector firms, manufacturers and the construction industry together signalled an overall stagnation in the UK economy at the end of 2019. IHS Markit and Cips said those reporting a drop in activity generally cited delayed spending decisions ahead of the general election. However, export orders dropped amid Brexit concerns, with European customers in particular less willing to place orders with UK firms. Duncan Brock, group director at Cips, said rising fuel and salary costs could dampen service sector companies\u2019 hopes of greater profitability in the coming months. The government announced an above-inflation increase in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d paid to workers over the age of 25, which business leaders said could make it harder for them to operate in a challenging economic environment. The price of oil has also spiked in recent days amid mounting tensions in the Middle East, which could push up energy costs. Companies could face renewed pressure over the coming months as the government seeks to strike a trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020. Johnson has said that he would not extend the transition period for holding talks, raising the prospect of a no-deal departure. Brock added: \u201cOther clouds of uncertainty must also include the potential for further political instability as negotiators and policymakers take the next steps.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Why is no one talking to me? I\u2019ve been sitting in an ice-cream parlour at a designated <a href=\"https://thechattycafescheme.co.uk/about/\" title=\"\">chatter and natter table</a> for over an hour, waiting to have a meaningful conversation \u2013 or any conversation at all. Why has no one approached me yet? A moment or two later I realise I am wearing my headphones. I always wear them, even if I\u2019m not listening to anything, because they are an effective way to avoid conversation \u2013 especially with any clipboardy types. But clearly they are counterproductive here. I take them off, and wait.</p> <p>I\u2019m spending a month trying to have a meaningful conversation with a stranger every day, to see whether it\u2019s possible to strike up new friendships or discussions in a world where we can often seem cut off from one another, with or without our headphones. There are all kinds of schemes set up to facilitate impromptu connections \u2013 the chatter and natter table I\u2019m visiting is just one. There are chatty badges, buses, benches and cafes, each designed to help address the UK\u2019s loneliness crisis. According to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/community-life-survey-2018-19\" title=\"\">Community Life survey</a>, almost half of England\u2019s adult population experienced loneliness between 2016 and 2017: 5% reported feeling lonely \u201coften\u201d or \u201calways\u201d; 16% were lonely sometimes; and 24% occasionally. The survey\u2019s findings also showed loneliness is more likely to affect women: 18-to-24-year-olds reported feelings of loneliness more than any other age group, while single people and widows are the most at-risk group. Research has suggested loneliness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/20/loneliness-britains-silent-plague-hurts-young-people-most\" title=\"\">can be as bad for us as smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>.</p> <p>Bethan Harris, the founder of <a href=\"https://lonelinesslab.org/\" title=\"\">the Loneliness Lab</a>, a project that aims to make cities less lonely, likens loneliness to hunger: \u201cIf you and I are hungry we eat some food and feel better. When we feel lonely we need social contact but can\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>I Iive in a shared house with a lot of people and so, if you were to ask in passing, I would say I don\u2019t feel particularly lonely. I\u2019m content with my own company \u2013 but to the extent that I often go out of my way to avoid social contact (I\u2019ve preferred to get lost than ask directions from strangers). Come to think of it, I suffer from social anxiety. I\u2019m so terrified of saying the wrong thing that I have become a crashing bore: why would anyone want to talk to me? Ignore what I said at the start of this paragraph. Maybe I am a little bit lonely after all.</p> <p>As the month begins, I try to speak to strangers at random, but can\u2019t pluck up the courage. London, where I live, is crammed with the perpetually frantic. People are more stationary on public transport, but making eye contact, especially on the tube, is almost considered a crime, which explains why some Londoners had a collective meltdown when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/tube-chat-campaign-provokes-horror-among-london-commuters\" title=\"\">\u201cTube chat\u201d badges</a> \u2013 designed to signal that you are up for a conversation \u2013 were distributed to commuters in 2016. On social media, people replaced the \u201cTube chat\u201d slogan with \u201cWake me up if a dog gets on\u201d or simply \u201cNope!\u201d, while one Twitter user wrote: \u201cThe worst thing about the Tube Chat badges is that they haven\u2019t even considered the rest of us, who\u2019ll have to listen to it happening.\u201d</p> <p>Luckily, there are other ways to bring people together. The <a href=\"https://thechattycafescheme.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Chatty Cafe scheme</a> invites cafes to designate a table for strangers to meet and chat; you can find a table near you on the scheme\u2019s website. The first table I try to visit is at Costa Coffee inside the Odeon cinema in Leicester Square, London, but there is no designated table in sight and when I ask a barista they tell me they have never heard of it.</p> <p>I have slightly more luck at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/29/the-humble-bee-cafe-stepney-city-farm-london-a-meal-in-a-very-happy-place-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Humble Bee</a> community cafe, an oasis in east London\u2019s concrete jungle, which offers homemade cakes and the opportunity to meet some farm animals. I don\u2019t see a chatty table when I get there, but I do get talking to Matt, one of the cafe\u2019s proprietors. He says people felt too shy to use the chatty table, but strangers often engage with each other in more organic ways in the cafe. Like me, Matt is a Manchester United fan and we have a brief exchange about how disappointing they are at the moment. He also tells me about the cafe\u2019s history and how they support people with learning difficulties. I like Matt; I like the cafe. I think, if I visit again, Matt and I could, at least, become acquaintances.</p> <p>I visit a few more Costas on the scheme\u2019s website, with no joy. The Costa on Holloway Road in London tells me a church group meets a couple of times a week to use the chatty tables, but there are no tables for the churchless. I\u2019m sure there are loads of cafes committed to making this scheme work, but the only one I found with a designated table was at <a href=\"http://www.yummylicks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Yummy Licks</a>, the ice-cream parlour in Maida Vale, west London, where I sit all that time with my headphones on. After I take them off, I\u2019m still left alone. I leave feeling glum, worrying there\u2019s something wrong with me. At the Humble Bee, even one of the pigs turns its back on me and shuffles back into its sty when I say hello. Do I simply look too unattractive to sit with? I\u2019m not exactly an oil painting, but I\u2019m not a complete eye-sore either. Honest, ask my mum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9adae9e26d4ebd9ca346bd8a96f75ae2be30f08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9adae9e26d4ebd9ca346bd8a96f75ae2be30f08/2572_675_3814_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Lavelle in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Lavelle in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I decide to visit Alexandra Hoskyn, the founder of the Chatty Cafe scheme, to find out where I am going wrong. I meet Hoskyn in a coffee shop in Uppermill, one of a collection of sleepy villages in Saddleworth, Oldham. She had the idea for the scheme three years ago, when she was a new mother. Her job as a social worker entails constant interaction with people, but while on maternity leave she began to feel isolated. \u201cI spent a lot of time walking around Oldham town centre, pushing the pram, going into shops and cafes,\u201d she says. \u201cI was just aware that you could be out of the house for a lot of the day and actually not have much interaction with other people. You\u2019re there, you\u2019re out, but no one notices you, no one talks to you and I thought: \u2018God, how many people must feel like this?\u2019 People pushing their shopping trolley around, going into the same shop every day and not having any conversation with anyone.\u201d</p> <p>One morning at a local cafe, she had an epiphany. \u201cThere was an elderly lady on her own. She looked really down and fed up and then on another table there was a guy with disabilities with a carer and they were just sat looking around the room. Then there was me on another table with my newborn. It\u2019s a shame, because maybe we would have all benefited from a bit of company.\u201d</p> <p>Hoskyn sat on her idea for a year before she began approaching local cafes. Since then, the Chatty Cafe scheme has spread across the UK and has recently begun in Canada. I tell Hoskyn I haven\u2019t had much luck so far. \u201cThe thing about the scheme that I really want to get across,\u201d she says, \u201cis we\u2019re not saying that every time someone will sit with you, because they might not do. What we\u2019re saying is, if there\u2019s a table there and you\u2019re sat at it, you\u2019re saying: I\u2019m open, if anyone else is.\u201d</p> <p>As we get up to leave, I tell her that approaching her chatty tables fills me with anxiety, but I was able to talk to her because there was a clear purpose behind our conversation. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s how you should approach it. Your purpose is to chat to people,\u201d Hoskyn says. \u201cIt is nerve-racking; it\u2019s not instant. Sometimes it will take time for people to understand and be brave. When you start chatting to someone it\u2019s never as bad as you think it is and also it could be five minutes of meaningless conversation \u2013 what was on telly last night or what the weather\u2019s like. But just that interaction can make you feel human and part of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Harris praises initiatives such as the Chatty Cafe scheme, but thinks the solutions they offer can be too simplistic. \u201cThe thing that people probably need is more meaningful connections. Meaningful interaction is what we\u2019re aiming for, not just chance interaction, not one-off collisions. The opportunity to build relationships.\u201d</p> <p>The Loneliness Lab is a research project that brings together charities, local authorities and property developers to explore the best ways to \u201cdesign loneliness out of cities\u201d. Harris began the project after experiencing loneliness when she moved to London in her early 20s. \u201cI was working from home a lot during the week. A lot of my social relationships were being conducted on WhatsApp. And when I realised that what I needed was to be around more people during the week, and to invest more in social contact in my community, my mental health improved drastically.\u201d The first steps Harris took were to tell people she was lonely and attempt to make friends in the \u201creal\u201d world. Working on the lab allowed her to meet other freelancers; she now hikes with a group of them on Friday mornings. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to get out of the house and meet up with people who work from home a lot and are alone a lot during the week.\u201d</p> <p>I decide to follow Harris\u2019s lead and invest more time in my local community. The first place I try this is at home. Embarrassingly, in the big house-share I live in, there are three men I\u2019ve been living with for two years whose names I don\u2019t even know. We keep very different timetables, but that\u2019s a rubbish excuse, as they have often invited me for drinks in the garden. When I start talking to them I learn that the three men, who share a room on the ground floor, are brothers from Romania, all work in construction and are strangely enthusiastic about Brexit. We have a long, albeit broken, chat about wine, because they really like it and their folks make their own in Romania.</p> <p>I have visited the same corner shop on a daily basis for two years and never said anything beyond \u201cthanks\u201d to the family \u2013 and dog \u2013 who run the place. Now I finally learn the name of the shop\u2019s owner. He\u2019s called Sam and he runs the shop with his wife and three children. We\u2019ve not become chatty as such, but Sam greets and says goodbye to me warmly every time I come and go now.</p> <p>I also decide to visit places I would never usually go. I visit a few churches on Sunday, and drink at a few new pubs, but I still don\u2019t make any new connections. Then I remember a visit I made to a West Indian barbershop near me in the summer. Two of the barbers were having a wildly entertaining conversation about a man across the road who had opened his car door, only for a speeding bus to take it off: \u201cOne second more and BOOM! That would\u2019ve been him!\u201d said the barber, miming the man\u2019s comic horror. I really wanted to join the conversation, but felt too shy. I go back for a haircut, and this time I find my voice. I ask what became of the man across the road. They seem really impressed I remember and a similarly hilarious conversation ensues between the barbers and other punters.</p> <p>After reminiscing about the unfortunate bus man I speak to my barber. He is very funny, knows a lot about the crown court and speaks rapidly in an accent that shifts between Jamaican patois and traditional cockney, depending on who he\u2019s talking to. \u201cAre you from Scotland?\u201d he asks. \u201cManchester,\u201d I reply. \u201cManchester, yeah man!\u201d he says. This leads us quickly to football chat. He is a Spurs fan. The night before our conversation, Son Heung-min dribbled the length of the pitch to score a wonder goal. We talk about this, as well as how badly Man Utd are doing and debate whether Manchester City winning the title is preferable to Liverpool winning it. Then another group chat erupts about young people\u2019s preoccupation with digital devices. One man hypothesises that constantly leaning into their phones will stunt the next generation\u2019s growth, a quip that\u2019s not entirely frivolous, as smartphones have been linked to spinal injuries.

Before doing this, I was comfy in the cocoon I have built around my life and, to a large extent, I still am. But withdrawing into my headphones is causing me to miss out on meeting interesting people, hearing entertaining stories and making new friends. Maybe I\u2019ll wear them less often.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why is no one talking to me? I\u2019ve been sitting in an ice-cream parlour at a designated chatter and natter table for over an hour, waiting to have a meaningful conversation \u2013 or any conversation at all. Why has no one approached me yet? A moment or two later I realise I am wearing my headphones. I always wear them, even if I\u2019m not listening to anything, because they are an effective way to avoid conversation \u2013 especially with any clipboardy types. But clearly they are counterproductive here. I take them off, and wait. I\u2019m spending a month trying to have a meaningful conversation with a stranger every day, to see whether it\u2019s possible to strike up new friendships or discussions in a world where we can often seem cut off from one another, with or without our headphones. There are all kinds of schemes set up to facilitate impromptu connections \u2013 the chatter and natter table I\u2019m visiting is just one. There are chatty badges, buses, benches and cafes, each designed to help address the UK\u2019s loneliness crisis. According to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 Community Life survey, almost half of England\u2019s adult population experienced loneliness between 2016 and 2017: 5% reported feeling lonely \u201coften\u201d or \u201calways\u201d; 16% were lonely sometimes; and 24% occasionally. The survey\u2019s findings also showed loneliness is more likely to affect women: 18-to-24-year-olds reported feelings of loneliness more than any other age group, while single people and widows are the most at-risk group. Research has suggested loneliness can be as bad for us as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Bethan Harris, the founder of the Loneliness Lab, a project that aims to make cities less lonely, likens loneliness to hunger: \u201cIf you and I are hungry we eat some food and feel better. When we feel lonely we need social contact but can\u2019t get it.\u201d I Iive in a shared house with a lot of people and so, if you were to ask in passing, I would say I don\u2019t feel particularly lonely. I\u2019m content with my own company \u2013 but to the extent that I often go out of my way to avoid social contact (I\u2019ve preferred to get lost than ask directions from strangers). Come to think of it, I suffer from social anxiety. I\u2019m so terrified of saying the wrong thing that I have become a crashing bore: why would anyone want to talk to me? Ignore what I said at the start of this paragraph. Maybe I am a little bit lonely after all. As the month begins, I try to speak to strangers at random, but can\u2019t pluck up the courage. London, where I live, is crammed with the perpetually frantic. People are more stationary on public transport, but making eye contact, especially on the tube, is almost considered a crime, which explains why some Londoners had a collective meltdown when \u201cTube chat\u201d badges \u2013 designed to signal that you are up for a conversation \u2013 were distributed to commuters in 2016. On social media, people replaced the \u201cTube chat\u201d slogan with \u201cWake me up if a dog gets on\u201d or simply \u201cNope!\u201d, while one Twitter user wrote: \u201cThe worst thing about the Tube Chat badges is that they haven\u2019t even considered the rest of us, who\u2019ll have to listen to it happening.\u201d Luckily, there are other ways to bring people together. The Chatty Cafe scheme invites cafes to designate a table for strangers to meet and chat; you can find a table near you on the scheme\u2019s website. The first table I try to visit is at Costa Coffee inside the Odeon cinema in Leicester Square, London, but there is no designated table in sight and when I ask a barista they tell me they have never heard of it. I have slightly more luck at the Humble Bee community cafe, an oasis in east London\u2019s concrete jungle, which offers homemade cakes and the opportunity to meet some farm animals. I don\u2019t see a chatty table when I get there, but I do get talking to Matt, one of the cafe\u2019s proprietors. He says people felt too shy to use the chatty table, but strangers often engage with each other in more organic ways in the cafe. Like me, Matt is a Manchester United fan and we have a brief exchange about how disappointing they are at the moment. He also tells me about the cafe\u2019s history and how they support people with learning difficulties. I like Matt; I like the cafe. I think, if I visit again, Matt and I could, at least, become acquaintances. I visit a few more Costas on the scheme\u2019s website, with no joy. The Costa on Holloway Road in London tells me a church group meets a couple of times a week to use the chatty tables, but there are no tables for the churchless. I\u2019m sure there are loads of cafes committed to making this scheme work, but the only one I found with a designated table was at Yummy Licks, the ice-cream parlour in Maida Vale, west London, where I sit all that time with my headphones on. After I take them off, I\u2019m still left alone. I leave feeling glum, worrying there\u2019s something wrong with me. At the Humble Bee, even one of the pigs turns its back on me and shuffles back into its sty when I say hello. Do I simply look too unattractive to sit with? I\u2019m not exactly an oil painting, but I\u2019m not a complete eye-sore either. Honest, ask my mum. I decide to visit Alexandra Hoskyn, the founder of the Chatty Cafe scheme, to find out where I am going wrong. I meet Hoskyn in a coffee shop in Uppermill, one of a collection of sleepy villages in Saddleworth, Oldham. She had the idea for the scheme three years ago, when she was a new mother. Her job as a social worker entails constant interaction with people, but while on maternity leave she began to feel isolated. \u201cI spent a lot of time walking around Oldham town centre, pushing the pram, going into shops and cafes,\u201d she says. \u201cI was just aware that you could be out of the house for a lot of the day and actually not have much interaction with other people. You\u2019re there, you\u2019re out, but no one notices you, no one talks to you and I thought: \u2018God, how many people must feel like this?\u2019 People pushing their shopping trolley around, going into the same shop every day and not having any conversation with anyone.\u201d One morning at a local cafe, she had an epiphany. \u201cThere was an elderly lady on her own. She looked really down and fed up and then on another table there was a guy with disabilities with a carer and they were just sat looking around the room. Then there was me on another table with my newborn. It\u2019s a shame, because maybe we would have all benefited from a bit of company.\u201d Hoskyn sat on her idea for a year before she began approaching local cafes. Since then, the Chatty Cafe scheme has spread across the UK and has recently begun in Canada. I tell Hoskyn I haven\u2019t had much luck so far. \u201cThe thing about the scheme that I really want to get across,\u201d she says, \u201cis we\u2019re not saying that every time someone will sit with you, because they might not do. What we\u2019re saying is, if there\u2019s a table there and you\u2019re sat at it, you\u2019re saying: I\u2019m open, if anyone else is.\u201d As we get up to leave, I tell her that approaching her chatty tables fills me with anxiety, but I was able to talk to her because there was a clear purpose behind our conversation. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s how you should approach it. Your purpose is to chat to people,\u201d Hoskyn says. \u201cIt is nerve-racking; it\u2019s not instant. Sometimes it will take time for people to understand and be brave. When you start chatting to someone it\u2019s never as bad as you think it is and also it could be five minutes of meaningless conversation \u2013 what was on telly last night or what the weather\u2019s like. But just that interaction can make you feel human and part of the world.\u201d Harris praises initiatives such as the Chatty Cafe scheme, but thinks the solutions they offer can be too simplistic. \u201cThe thing that people probably need is more meaningful connections. Meaningful interaction is what we\u2019re aiming for, not just chance interaction, not one-off collisions. The opportunity to build relationships.\u201d The Loneliness Lab is a research project that brings together charities, local authorities and property developers to explore the best ways to \u201cdesign loneliness out of cities\u201d. Harris began the project after experiencing loneliness when she moved to London in her early 20s. \u201cI was working from home a lot during the week. A lot of my social relationships were being conducted on WhatsApp. And when I realised that what I needed was to be around more people during the week, and to invest more in social contact in my community, my mental health improved drastically.\u201d The first steps Harris took were to tell people she was lonely and attempt to make friends in the \u201creal\u201d world. Working on the lab allowed her to meet other freelancers; she now hikes with a group of them on Friday mornings. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to get out of the house and meet up with people who work from home a lot and are alone a lot during the week.\u201d I decide to follow Harris\u2019s lead and invest more time in my local community. The first place I try this is at home. Embarrassingly, in the big house-share I live in, there are three men I\u2019ve been living with for two years whose names I don\u2019t even know. We keep very different timetables, but that\u2019s a rubbish excuse, as they have often invited me for drinks in the garden. When I start talking to them I learn that the three men, who share a room on the ground floor, are brothers from Romania, all work in construction and are strangely enthusiastic about Brexit. We have a long, albeit broken, chat about wine, because they really like it and their folks make their own in Romania. I have visited the same corner shop on a daily basis for two years and never said anything beyond \u201cthanks\u201d to the family \u2013 and dog \u2013 who run the place. Now I finally learn the name of the shop\u2019s owner. He\u2019s called Sam and he runs the shop with his wife and three children. We\u2019ve not become chatty as such, but Sam greets and says goodbye to me warmly every time I come and go now. I also decide to visit places I would never usually go. I visit a few churches on Sunday, and drink at a few new pubs, but I still don\u2019t make any new connections. Then I remember a visit I made to a West Indian barbershop near me in the summer. Two of the barbers were having a wildly entertaining conversation about a man across the road who had opened his car door, only for a speeding bus to take it off: \u201cOne second more and BOOM! That would\u2019ve been him!\u201d said the barber, miming the man\u2019s comic horror. I really wanted to join the conversation, but felt too shy. I go back for a haircut, and this time I find my voice. I ask what became of the man across the road. They seem really impressed I remember and a similarly hilarious conversation ensues between the barbers and other punters. After reminiscing about the unfortunate bus man I speak to my barber. He is very funny, knows a lot about the crown court and speaks rapidly in an accent that shifts between Jamaican patois and traditional cockney, depending on who he\u2019s talking to. \u201cAre you from Scotland?\u201d he asks. \u201cManchester,\u201d I reply. \u201cManchester, yeah man!\u201d he says. This leads us quickly to football chat. He is a Spurs fan. The night before our conversation, Son Heung-min dribbled the length of the pitch to score a wonder goal. We talk about this, as well as how badly Man Utd are doing and debate whether Manchester City winning the title is preferable to Liverpool winning it. Then another group chat erupts about young people\u2019s preoccupation with digital devices. One man hypothesises that constantly leaning into their phones will stunt the next generation\u2019s growth, a quip that\u2019s not entirely frivolous, as smartphones have been linked to spinal injuries.

      "body": "<p>A bulbous hand with green fingers is how I think of Florence fennel. Every now and then, my friend Carla Tomasi brings me some she has dug up that morning from her garden just outside Rome: perfectly white bulbs with uncut fingers up to half a metre long, and surrounded by enough feathery fronds to make a Vegas headdress. Back at the market, fennel fingers are pretty much always trimmed down to human size. At the supermarket, they are trimmed even harder \u2013 and the fronds, too \u2013 which is a shame, because they are like a herb accessory for a vegetable hand.</p> <p>Florence (or bulb) fennel was developed by Renaissance gardeners in the 17th century; a domesticated cultivar of wild fennel that has been known to grow vigorously over the Mediterranean Basin, India and Pakistan for more than 2,000 years. While Florence fennel is a vegetable, its wild relative is a robust, perennial herb with hollow stalks, feathery yellow flowers and even more feathery leaves. It was in hollow stalks of wild fennel that Prometheus is said to have hidden the fire he stole from the gods, and by giving it to the human race, he raised them from their state of brutish ignorance.</p> <p>While both bitter and sweet wild fennel are herbs, they also produce seeds and have small, swollen roots, making them three times as valuable: a herb, a spice and a vegetable.

In season, it is always on her table, either cut into wedges and served in icy water, or as part of an orange and fennel salad. It\u2019s the sweetness of Florence fennel that balances its subtle but unmistakably anise flavour, which is further helped by citrus, as the Arabs and Sicilians know well. Sicilians also know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/12/nigel-slater-fennel-recipes-vegetarian-soup-ice-cream\">fennel</a> bulbs have a sex: the elongated ones being female, the rounder ones male \u2013 and sweeter, apparently. However, if you don\u2019t like anise, no wisdom about sex or sweet orange is going to convince you otherwise. That said, dislike of fennel can come from the fact you have met rather too many tough and stringy ones. When choosing, look for roundness and freshness \u2013 green fronds, even just a few of them, are a good clue to this. Also how tight the overlapping layers are at the base of the fingers.</p> <p>Always trim fennel rigorously, chopping off the fingers, base and pulling away the thicker layers (which can be used for stock); a shock because the bulb reduces to nearly half the size. I like the Roman way of serving raw fennel dipped in olive oil and salt at the start of a meal, or the Piedmontese one of using its canoe-shaped curves to scoop from a warm bath of <a href=\"https://racheleats.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/just-call-me-anchovy/\" title=\"\">anchovy</a>, garlic and butter.</p> <p>Then there is cooked fennel, where crisp is transformed to tender and velvety (my partner would say slimy, but he says the same about carrots), and the aniseed calms right down. I am a cooked fennel lover: braised with butter or tomato sauce and olives; baked with fish; as fritters with mayonnaise; also fennel parmigiana and gratin.</p> <h2>Fennel gratin</h2> <p> If you wish, you can do an <a href=\"https://sardine.london/\" title=\"\">Alex Jackson</a>-style gratin variation and press some strips of radicchio, fennel fronds and sliced garlic into the cracks, then pour over 100ml thick cream \u2013 it has won over many fennel-hating hearts. </p> <p>Prep<strong> 20 min<br></strong>Cook <strong>1 hr<br></strong>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>5 large bulbs fennel<br>Salt<br>Juice of half a lemon<br>Butter<br>A head radicchio</strong>, cut into strips (optional)<br><strong>2 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and thinly sliced (optional)<br><strong>100ml thick cream</strong> (optional)<br><strong>100g parmesan</strong>, grated</p> <p>Trim the fennel bulbs carefully, cutting the fingers off away from the base (making sure they stay intact) and pulling away the thicker outer layers: set the fronds aside.</p> <p>Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt, lemon juice and boil the bulbs whole for seven to 10 minutes, depending on their size.

However, if you don\u2019t like anise, no wisdom about sex or sweet orange is going to convince you otherwise. That said, dislike of fennel can come from the fact you have met rather too many tough and stringy ones. When choosing, look for roundness and freshness \u2013 green fronds, even just a few of them, are a good clue to this. Also how tight the overlapping layers are at the base of the fingers. Always trim fennel rigorously, chopping off the fingers, base and pulling away the thicker layers (which can be used for stock); a shock because the bulb reduces to nearly half the size. I like the Roman way of serving raw fennel dipped in olive oil and salt at the start of a meal, or the Piedmontese one of using its canoe-shaped curves to scoop from a warm bath of anchovy, garlic and butter. Then there is cooked fennel, where crisp is transformed to tender and velvety (my partner would say slimy, but he says the same about carrots), and the aniseed calms right down. I am a cooked fennel lover: braised with butter or tomato sauce and olives; baked with fish; as fritters with mayonnaise; also fennel parmigiana and gratin. Fennel gratin If you wish, you can do an Alex Jackson-style gratin variation and press some strips of radicchio, fennel fronds and sliced garlic into the cracks, then pour over 100ml thick cream \u2013 it has won over many fennel-hating hearts. Prep 20 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 5 large bulbs fennel Salt Juice of half a lemon Butter A head radicchio, cut into strips (optional) 2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced (optional) 100ml thick cream (optional) 100g parmesan, grated Trim the fennel bulbs carefully, cutting the fingers off away from the base (making sure they stay intact) and pulling away the thicker outer layers: set the fronds aside. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt, lemon juice and boil the bulbs whole for seven to 10 minutes, depending on their size. By the end of cooking, the outsides should be almost tender and the hearts a bit firm. Drain. Cut the fennel bulbs into quarters and arrange in a single layer in a well buttered ovenproof dish. If you like, press the radicchio and garlic into the cracks, then pour over the cream. Finish by sprinkling the top with parmesan, then dot with more butter and bake at 200C (180C fan)/gas 4 for 25 minutes, until the cheese is a golden lattice and the are edges bubbling madly.",

All of this, Hogan said, gets reflected on individual projects.</p> <p>Further adding to the cost is a shortage of workers. There simply aren\u2019t enough workers to build all the developments that people want to build and housing projects compete for resources with commercial and office developments<strong>,</strong> said Sarah Karlinsky, a senior policy adviser at the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association. \u201cThere\u2019s just an enormous demand for scaled construction work and not enough bodies to do the job,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9adb1316312cb2359a969d142c321b5fd0832935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9adb1316312cb2359a969d142c321b5fd0832935/0_0_4800_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The high cost of construction is one of the driving forces behind the high cost of housing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The high cost of construction is one of the driving forces behind the high cost of housing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The construction industry also took a hit during the recession that it still has not recovered from, noted Hogan,<strong> </strong>the San Francisco architect, forcing contractors to hire less experienced workers.</p> <p>It sets in motion a chain reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more difficult to hire subcontractors, like electricians, or plumbers,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThose bids are hard to get more than one or two of when the cost is higher than what seems reasonable for the general contractor.\u201d</p> <h2>Impact fees</h2> <p>In 1978, California voters passed Proposition 13, a ballot initiative that capped property taxes to a 1% tax based on a property\u2019s assessed value at the time of purchase and limited annual tax increases to no more than 2%. It reduced total property taxes by 57%, a boon to property owners, but it also reduced a significant source of necessary government funding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%242.4m&amp;title=Cost%20of%20fees%20for%20an%20average%20construction\" data-alt=\"average cost of fees\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%242.4m&title=Cost%20of%20fees%20for%20an%20average%20construction\">average cost of fees</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat that has done is really pushed local jurisdictions to find other ways to fund all the other things that they need to pay for, like parks and schools and community centers,\u201d Karlinsky said. When they couldn\u2019t get as much tax from buildings that were already built and owned, municipalities have sought to make up some of the difference through impact fees on new developments.</p> <p>Impact fees are meant to cover the expansion of city infrastructure and services needed to accommodate the expected growth stemming from a specific project. Depending on the jurisdiction and the project, a developer may be on the hook for school fees, park fees, transportation fees, environmental fees, public safety fees, library fees, capital improvement fees, utility fees and affordable housing fees.</p> <p>The fees vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. <a href=\"http://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/uploads/Residential_Impact_Fees_in_California_August_2019.pdf\">A Terner Center study</a> found that in Los Angeles, a 100-unit, multifamily project could result in nearly $1.4m in fees while that same project could result in $2.4m in fees in Oakland.</p> <p>\u201cOther states are not as reliant on those kind of fees because they can raise revenues through other means, like through property taxes\u201d, Kneebone said.</p> <h2>Zoning</h2> <p>Housing development advocates argue that it\u2019s not just important that California builds more housing, what kind of housing and where should be reconsidered in order to bring down costs and drive up supply.</p> <p>The housing crisis, said the state Senator Scott Wiener, is \u201ca supply and demand issue induced by restrictive zoning\u201d.</p> <p>Less than a quarter of the developable land in much of the state is zoned for multifamily housing, while close to three-quarters of the land is zoned for single-family homes, according to a<a href=\"https://californialanduse.org/download/Terner_California_Residential_Land_Use_Survey_Report.pdf\"> 2018 Terner Center study</a>.</p> <p>\u201cLand is extraordinarily expensive, especially land that is zoned for multifamily housing,\u201d Karlinsky said.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, Californian communities have systematically banned apartment buildings by zoning for only single-family homes,\u201d Wiener said. \u201cThat creates a major math problem when you\u2019re trying to create enough homes for everybody. Particularly in places like San Francisco and Silicon Valley and San Jose and Los Angeles, it made it impossible for us to build enough housing to meet demand and it also induced sprawl. You can\u2019t build where the jobs are, so you build farther and farther out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ea1be1bdc9ed172f14e5fe0c46c077f5e329373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ea1be1bdc9ed172f14e5fe0c46c077f5e329373/0_0_4740_3373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Housing advocates say public opposition to affordable projects has been used to delay projects.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Housing advocates say public opposition to affordable projects has been used to delay projects.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lawrence K. Ho/LA Times via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This lack of affordable housing density and sprawl of single-family homes drives the growing number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/02/sacramento-california-bay-area-gentrification-rent\">super commuters </a>\u2013 people who commute upwards of hundreds of miles to work a day because they\u2019re forced to move farther and farther out from the job centers in order to afford housing. More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/cupertino-wall-mayor-apple-joke\">200,000 people a day</a> commute into the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, snarling up traffic and adding to greenhouse gas car emissions.</p> <p>California is not the only state with a single-family home obsession. \u201cIt seems to be something baked into the American Dream ethos,\u201d Kneebone said. \u201cThis is the way America has been producing housing for decades.\u201d</p> <p>Wiener introduced legislation that would eliminate zoning restrictions around transit-rich areas and job centers and \u201cup-zone\u201d land currently set aside for single-family homes. The legislation was postponed last year, but is up for debate again in the senate in January.</p> <p>But currently local jurisdictions have the power to decide zoning. \u201cIt\u2019s called home rule,\u201d Karlinsky said. Many politicians feel pressure from constituents to not zone for housing, she notes, fearing more housing will have detrimental impacts like increased traffic. </p> <h2>Public opposition</h2> <p>Public opposition is another indirect cost of housing that may not be uniquely Californian, but plays a significant role in the state.</p> <p>The California Environmental Quality Act (Ceqa) was signed into law in 1970, requiring state and local agencies to identify significant environmental impacts of any prospective development. According to housing advocates, the law opened the door to more public involvement in projects \u2013 and more delays because of<strong> </strong>public opposition.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the way the law is written in California, there is more public involvement in any project than there would be if you were in Texas,\u201d Hogan said. Different cities have interpreted the act differently, he said. \u201cSan Francisco has a long process that any new project you have to do neighborhood notification, you can ask for discretionary review at the planning commission, most large projects have to go for approval at the planning commission, sometimes you have to go to more than one hearing and the decision will get postponed, sometimes you have to do more work with your architect,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe even have had ballot measures to stop certain proposals,\u201d Hogan added. </p> <p>Housing advocates \u2013 in particular affordable housing advocates \u2013 say people opposed to new projects have often used these laws to fight or delay construction. \u201cIf you\u2019re a more wealthy jurisdiction and you\u2019re concerned about \u2018those people\u2019 coming to your town, you might show up to a hearing,\u201d Karlinsky said. \u201cYou know it might not be seen kindly if you speak of it in those terms, so you pitch it as, \u2018Oh we just want to make sure it looks appropriate.\u2019 The project goes through several redesigns. It might go through several redesigns because people in that community might be using that process as a way to prevent affordable housing from getting developed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a117456e2a077381241eb5d2d5fe14601f8fe9bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a117456e2a077381241eb5d2d5fe14601f8fe9bd/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A lack of affordable housing has caused people to move farther from job centers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lack of affordable housing has caused people to move farther from job centers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In past years, invoking Ceqa became such a common tactic for the \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d types that legislators had to find ways to either bypass the law or streamline the process. Legislation introduced by Wiener was signed into law in August regarding navigation centers that provide beds and direct homeless people to resources \u2013 legislation he introduced after wealthy San Francisco residents filed a Ceqa lawsuit to block the construction of such a center in their waterfront neighborhood. The governor also signed into law legislation that exempts emergency homeless shelters and supportive housing in Los Angeles from Ceqa until 2025.</p> <p>\u201cI believe in Ceqa and I believe it\u2019s done for a very good purpose,\u201d said state assemblymember Miguel Santiago, who authored the Los Angeles bill. \u201cWe live in communities that are heavily polluted that are not looking for deregulation, a wild wild west of environmental pollution. But at the same time, we need to have a conversation. Here\u2019s its intent, here\u2019s what we want it to do, and here are people who can\u2019t afford to live anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>The costs of such delays and uncertainty are hard to measure.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see that as a line item in a cost sheet, the delays that came because of public opposition or because of a Ceqa lawsuit that delayed a project x months or years because the cost of labor or material went up this much over that time,\u201d Kneebone said.</p> <p>Housing development advocates understand that with so many different factors contributing to the housing crisis, it will take more than one solution to solve it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many pieces to the puzzle that it\u2019s complicated,\u201d Kneebone said. \u201cBut it is solvable. There are steps that local jurisdictions can take, there are roles for the state to play. We have seen progress in recent years. There have been steps taken to address the different pieces of the puzzle. It\u2019s just getting to a place where we can really scale the solutions to the depth of the crisis.\u201d</p>",

Homelessness surged, from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and hundreds of thousands found themselves commuting hours each way to work every day. It\u2019s gotten so bad that major tech firms \u2013 companies that contributed to an influx of wealth that has led to rapid gentrification and the displacement of longtime residents \u2013 are pledging money to help build homes. Facebook and Google each promised $1bn for housing. Apple announced a $2.5bn plan. But it\u2019s not that simple. California needs anywhere between 1.8m and 3.5m new housing units by 2025 to accommodate projected population growth. Yet in the last 10 years, production averaged less than 80,000 new homes annually, far less than half the minimum new homes needed.

You can\u2019t build where the jobs are, so you build farther and farther out.\u201d This lack of affordable housing density and sprawl of single-family homes drives the growing number of super commuters \u2013 people who commute upwards of hundreds of miles to work a day because they\u2019re forced to move farther and farther out from the job centers in order to afford housing. More than 200,000 people a day commute into the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, snarling up traffic and adding to greenhouse gas car emissions. California is not the only state with a single-family home obsession. \u201cIt seems to be something baked into the American Dream ethos,\u201d Kneebone said. \u201cThis is the way America has been producing housing for decades.\u201d Wiener introduced legislation that would eliminate zoning restrictions around transit-rich areas and job centers and \u201cup-zone\u201d land currently set aside for single-family homes. The legislation was postponed last year, but is up for debate again in the senate in January. But currently local jurisdictions have the power to decide zoning. \u201cIt\u2019s called home rule,\u201d Karlinsky said. Many politicians feel pressure from constituents to not zone for housing, she notes, fearing more housing will have detrimental impacts like increased traffic. Public opposition Public opposition is another indirect cost of housing that may not be uniquely Californian, but plays a significant role in the state. The California Environmental Quality Act (Ceqa) was signed into law in 1970, requiring state and local agencies to identify significant environmental impacts of any prospective development. According to housing advocates, the law opened the door to more public involvement in projects \u2013 and more delays because of public opposition. \u201cBecause of the way the law is written in California, there is more public involvement in any project than there would be if you were in Texas,\u201d Hogan said. Different cities have interpreted the act differently, he said. \u201cSan Francisco has a long process that any new project you have to do neighborhood notification, you can ask for discretionary review at the planning commission, most large projects have to go for approval at the planning commission, sometimes you have to go to more than one hearing and the decision will get postponed, sometimes you have to do more work with your architect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe even have had ballot measures to stop certain proposals,\u201d Hogan added. Housing advocates \u2013 in particular affordable housing advocates \u2013 say people opposed to new projects have often used these laws to fight or delay construction. \u201cIf you\u2019re a more wealthy jurisdiction and you\u2019re concerned about \u2018those people\u2019 coming to your town, you might show up to a hearing,\u201d Karlinsky said. \u201cYou know it might not be seen kindly if you speak of it in those terms, so you pitch it as, \u2018Oh we just want to make sure it looks appropriate.\u2019 The project goes through several redesigns. It might go through several redesigns because people in that community might be using that process as a way to prevent affordable housing from getting developed.\u201d In past years, invoking Ceqa became such a common tactic for the \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d types that legislators had to find ways to either bypass the law or streamline the process. Legislation introduced by Wiener was signed into law in August regarding navigation centers that provide beds and direct homeless people to resources \u2013 legislation he introduced after wealthy San Francisco residents filed a Ceqa lawsuit to block the construction of such a center in their waterfront neighborhood. The governor also signed into law legislation that exempts emergency homeless shelters and supportive housing in Los Angeles from Ceqa until 2025. \u201cI believe in Ceqa and I believe it\u2019s done for a very good purpose,\u201d said state assemblymember Miguel Santiago, who authored the Los Angeles bill. \u201cWe live in communities that are heavily polluted that are not looking for deregulation, a wild wild west of environmental pollution. But at the same time, we need to have a conversation. Here\u2019s its intent, here\u2019s what we want it to do, and here are people who can\u2019t afford to live anywhere.\u201d The costs of such delays and uncertainty are hard to measure. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see that as a line item in a cost sheet, the delays that came because of public opposition or because of a Ceqa lawsuit that delayed a project x months or years because the cost of labor or material went up this much over that time,\u201d Kneebone said. Housing development advocates understand that with so many different factors contributing to the housing crisis, it will take more than one solution to solve it. \u201cThere are so many pieces to the puzzle that it\u2019s complicated,\u201d Kneebone said. \u201cBut it is solvable. There are steps that local jurisdictions can take, there are roles for the state to play. We have seen progress in recent years. There have been steps taken to address the different pieces of the puzzle. It\u2019s just getting to a place where we can really scale the solutions to the depth of the crisis.\u201d",

The more generous guests had paid up to $50,000 (\u00a338,000) to attend a dinner and a two-hour show, curated by host Linda Perry, to raise money for sick children.

      "bodyText": "When arts charity the Art of Elysium announced the lineup for its annual Heaven Is Rock and Roll Gala in Los Angeles, the attention was on the second \u201creunion\u201d of Nirvana: Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear would come together again for just the fourth time since the band\u2019s demise in 1994. This time, St Vincent would join them (as she did at two 2014 performances heralding Nirvana\u2019s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), plus Beck. But it was the least starry name who stole the show: Grohl\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Violet. The setting was somewhat more sterile than Nirvana\u2019s febrile 2014 show at a tiny Brooklyn venue. Before the bands got under way, a host of celebrities walked the red carpet including Rufus Wainwright, Bella Hadid, Jack Black, Moby and photographer Mick Rock. The more generous guests had paid up to $50,000 (\u00a338,000) to attend a dinner and a two-hour show, curated by host Linda Perry, to raise money for sick children. But the performances were valiantly potent in the face of a largely sedentary room: 80s feminist punks L7 played their still riotously relevant call-to-arms Shitlist. \u201cRight you motherfuckers, this is a fucking rock show!\u201d screamed singer Donita Sparks, urging half a dozen game diners to form a small circle pit at the lip of the stage. Although not a performer noted for fitting in with social conventions, Marilyn Manson traded his pantomime metal for an event-appropriate crooning cabaret act with Linda Perry at the piano, offering dramatic, sombre renditions of his hit The Dope Show and Eurythmics\u2019 Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). Finally, the assembled set down their pizza and stood as close to the stage as they could for the act billed as \u201cDave and friends\u201d. In 2014 Nirvana reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Lorde, Joan Jett and St Vincent on vocals.

The sewage isn\u2019t always properly treated by the purification plants and the virus ends up in the sea, especially after the rains we have had.\u201d </p> <p>He called for the local authorities to investigate the cause of the contamination.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/l-%C3%A9tat-fran%C3%A7ais-soutenez-les-ostr%C3%A9iculteurs-du-morbihan-face-%C3%A0-la-pollution-du-littoral?recruiter=1031944005&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;recruited_by_id=5b0845f0-2cd0-11ea-97dc-9708e11b3e40&amp;utm_content=starter_fb_share_content_fr-fr%3Av2&amp;use_react=false\">petition</a> launched on 1 January, an alliance of oyster farmers called for \u201cimmediate action to deal with the ecological emergency and substantial compensation for all oyster farmers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a real economic and human disaster imposed on us by a state that is incapable of protecting our magnificent coastline,\u201d it wrote.</p> <p>Le Gal told Ouest-France newspaper: \u201cThe (fishing and farming) zones at potential risk have been closed. Suspect oyster batches have been withdrawn from sale. Those that remain don\u2019t pose a risk.

      "bodyText": "A gastroenteritis epidemic sweeping France has hit oyster farmers in Brittany after the virus was found in shellfish. Health authorities have banned the fishing and selling of oysters in the bay around Mont-Saint-Michel and other shellfish farming areas on France\u2019s north-western coast until further notice. The ban follows the discovery of norovirus \u2013 also called the winter vomiting bug \u2013 in shellfish and is the fifth to be announced covering seven zones since mid-December. Oyster farmers have blamed pollution along the coast on sewage that has not been fully treated. The regional shellfish committee, the CRC, says almost half the oyster farms in the south Brittany region \u2013 150 out of a total of 330 \u2013 are affected by the bans. Philippe Le Gal, the president of the regional CRC said: \u201cThe gastroenteritis phenomenon has been around since Christmas. The sewage isn\u2019t always properly treated by the purification plants and the virus ends up in the sea, especially after the rains we have had.\u201d He called for the local authorities to investigate the cause of the contamination. In a petition launched on 1 January, an alliance of oyster farmers called for \u201cimmediate action to deal with the ecological emergency and substantial compensation for all oyster farmers\u201d. \u201cThis is a real economic and human disaster imposed on us by a state that is incapable of protecting our magnificent coastline,\u201d it wrote. Le Gal told Ouest-France newspaper: \u201cThe (fishing and farming) zones at potential risk have been closed. Suspect oyster batches have been withdrawn from sale. Those that remain don\u2019t pose a risk. Now we have to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d The producers have blamed local officials who \u201cboast of welcoming more and more residents and tourists, signing building permits with a vengeance while forgetting to take care of the management of human waste and sanitation. \u201cAstronomical quantities of polluted water are poured into the sea without raising the eyebrows of the authorities and are poisoning our coasts and oysters, which are now laden with the human gastroenteritis virus, norovirus. The water of the Morbihan coast is now unhealthy. Oyster farmers and their coastline are dying in total indifference,\u201d they wrote. The local police prefect said it was a temporary crisis caused by an unusual combination of low temperatures and heavy rains, which had caused sewage overflows into local rivers. Patrice Faure told Agence France-Presse he would be meeting the agriculture minister to call for a speeding up of research to find a \u201crapid decontamination process\u201d for the oyster farms and to discuss compensation.",

In December 2019, all three countries have far-right leaders: Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. In Europe, center-left parties have been decimated, while mainstream right parties mainly survive by adopting frames and policies from the radical right. Only Germany still has the same center-right leader, Angela Merkel, but that will probably change in the next year, too.</p> <p>This political sea change is in large part the (delayed) consequence of demographic, economic and social shifts. After 9/11, the political debate in many countries shifted from socio-economic to socio-cultural issues. Even the Great Recession only changed this temporarily; once the dust over the bailouts had settled, immigration and security quickly replaced austerity and economic inequality as defining issues once again.</p> <p>The decade started with a concerted attack on multiculturalism by mainstream-right leaders, including the former British prime minister, David Cameron, the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and even Merkel. But while they pandered to far-right voters, they largely refused to adopt far-right frames and policies. In 2011, for example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-munich-security-conference\">Cameron</a> blamed \u201cstate multiculturalism\u201d for failed integration and Jihadi terrorism, but, he argued, \u201cinstead of encouraging people to live apart, we need a clear sense of shared national identity, open to everyone\u201d.</p> <p>This changed fundamentally with the so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d of 2015, which was a <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-2019-eu-elections-moving-the-center/\">catalyst</a> for the mainstreaming and normalization of the radical right. Immigration and security were now openly linked in the public mind. Mainstream and far right parties shot up in the polls, and radical right frames and policies were broadly shared by mainstream parties, from Austrian conservatives to Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats.</p> <p>Even politicians who defeated radical right politicians with inclusive electoral campaigns would soon start adopting part of the radical right\u2019s program. Hillary Clinton, who gained 2.5 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/hillary-clinton-europe-must-curb-immigration-stop-populists-trump-brexit\">shamelessly argued</a> that Europe should curb immigration to stop the far right, while Emmanuel Macron, who comprehensively defeated Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election, has played on anti-Islam sentiments, particularly in his <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-islamophobic-undercurrent-french-vision/\">foreign policy</a>.</p> <p>And while the 2019 European elections were largely interpreted as a defeat of the far right, mostly based on exaggerated expectations \u2013 the far right actually scored its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/far-right-european-elections-eu-politics\">best result</a> ever \u2013 the mainstreaming of far right frames had become so absolute that in September the president of the European Commission, the German Christian Democrat Ursula von der Leyen, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/world/europe/eu-ursula-von-der-leyen-migration.html\">proposed</a> a controversial new title for the commissioner that includes immigration: \u201cvice-president for protecting our European way of life.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The far right has been punching politically well above its electoral weight in the past decade</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Given the successes of rightwing populist parties and politicians in recent elections in Spain and the UK, one might think that the coming decade will see an even bigger electoral and political success for the far right, but I don\u2019t think this will be the case. To be clear, the far right is here to stay, as is the mainstreaming and normalization of radical right ideas (and politicians) that characterizes what I have called the \u201c<a href=\"http://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509536832\">fourth </a><a href=\"http://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509536832\">wave</a>\u201d of far-right politics. However, the far right has been punching politically well above its electoral weight in the past decade.</p> <p>The main reason for their disproportionate impact is the ideological weakness of liberal democratic parties. While defining themselves as the silent majority, the far right is in fact a shouting minority, which has faced little pushback from ideologically bankrupt mainstream left and parties. Forced by crushing electoral defeats, some center-left parties have started to develop new ideological programs, prioritizing economic inequality over economic growth, sometimes pandering to nativism (like in Denmark), sometimes not (like in UK and US).</p> <p>Mainstream rightwing parties have so far persisted, but their electoral success on the basis of radical right lite programs will not last forever. In the end, their only chance to sustain the electoral success is by transforming into full-fledged radical right parties, as we have seen in Hungary, Israel and the US. The only other way to survive is to re-establish conservative and Christian democratic programs that do not undermine the liberal democratic system and values.</p> <p>While still a minority, a growing number of right-wing politicians, including within the powerful European People\u2019s party, are starting to understand that, rather than having played the far right, the far right has played then. To survive, they will have to re-establish their own ideological programs and put the defense of liberal democracy at the center of their political struggle.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia.

      "bodyText": "The past decade was the decade of the far right. In January 2010, leftist and centrist politicians led three of the largest democracies in the world: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (Brazil), Manmohan Singh (India) and Barack Obama (US). In December 2019, all three countries have far-right leaders: Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump. In Europe, center-left parties have been decimated, while mainstream right parties mainly survive by adopting frames and policies from the radical right. Only Germany still has the same center-right leader, Angela Merkel, but that will probably change in the next year, too. This political sea change is in large part the (delayed) consequence of demographic, economic and social shifts. After 9/11, the political debate in many countries shifted from socio-economic to socio-cultural issues. Even the Great Recession only changed this temporarily; once the dust over the bailouts had settled, immigration and security quickly replaced austerity and economic inequality as defining issues once again. The decade started with a concerted attack on multiculturalism by mainstream-right leaders, including the former British prime minister, David Cameron, the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and even Merkel. But while they pandered to far-right voters, they largely refused to adopt far-right frames and policies. In 2011, for example, Cameron blamed \u201cstate multiculturalism\u201d for failed integration and Jihadi terrorism, but, he argued, \u201cinstead of encouraging people to live apart, we need a clear sense of shared national identity, open to everyone\u201d. This changed fundamentally with the so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d of 2015, which was a catalyst for the mainstreaming and normalization of the radical right. Immigration and security were now openly linked in the public mind. Mainstream and far right parties shot up in the polls, and radical right frames and policies were broadly shared by mainstream parties, from Austrian conservatives to Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats. Even politicians who defeated radical right politicians with inclusive electoral campaigns would soon start adopting part of the radical right\u2019s program. Hillary Clinton, who gained 2.5 million more votes than Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election, shamelessly argued that Europe should curb immigration to stop the far right, while Emmanuel Macron, who comprehensively defeated Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election, has played on anti-Islam sentiments, particularly in his foreign policy. And while the 2019 European elections were largely interpreted as a defeat of the far right, mostly based on exaggerated expectations \u2013 the far right actually scored its best result ever \u2013 the mainstreaming of far right frames had become so absolute that in September the president of the European Commission, the German Christian Democrat Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a controversial new title for the commissioner that includes immigration: \u201cvice-president for protecting our European way of life.\u201d Given the successes of rightwing populist parties and politicians in recent elections in Spain and the UK, one might think that the coming decade will see an even bigger electoral and political success for the far right, but I don\u2019t think this will be the case. To be clear, the far right is here to stay, as is the mainstreaming and normalization of radical right ideas (and politicians) that characterizes what I have called the \u201cfourth wave\u201d of far-right politics. However, the far right has been punching politically well above its electoral weight in the past decade. The main reason for their disproportionate impact is the ideological weakness of liberal democratic parties. While defining themselves as the silent majority, the far right is in fact a shouting minority, which has faced little pushback from ideologically bankrupt mainstream left and parties. Forced by crushing electoral defeats, some center-left parties have started to develop new ideological programs, prioritizing economic inequality over economic growth, sometimes pandering to nativism (like in Denmark), sometimes not (like in UK and US). Mainstream rightwing parties have so far persisted, but their electoral success on the basis of radical right lite programs will not last forever. In the end, their only chance to sustain the electoral success is by transforming into full-fledged radical right parties, as we have seen in Hungary, Israel and the US. The only other way to survive is to re-establish conservative and Christian democratic programs that do not undermine the liberal democratic system and values. While still a minority, a growing number of right-wing politicians, including within the powerful European People\u2019s party, are starting to understand that, rather than having played the far right, the far right has played then. To survive, they will have to re-establish their own ideological programs and put the defense of liberal democracy at the center of their political struggle.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Signs posted around the area showed the faces of Suleimani and Khamenei with the words \u201charsh revenge awaits\u201d, and slogans including \u201cIraqis and Iranians are friends and nobody can separate them\u201d.</p> \n<p>The phrase \u201cGod willing we\u2019ll receive the news that Tel Aviv has been turned into dust very soon\u201d blared from loudspeakers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d0481dcc853a2354dcc79f201d693fca7fce9f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d0481dcc853a2354dcc79f201d693fca7fce9f/0_74_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Hassan Rouhani pray near the coffins of Qassem Soleimani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Hassan Rouhani pray near the coffins of Qassem Soleimani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Official President\u2019S Website/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A petition asking for names and phone numbers of people in the crowd read: \u201cI am ready for jihad at any moment and awaiting my leaders\u2019 orders.\u201d</p> \n<p>The huge processions to mourn the former leader of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 elite Quds force mark the first time Iran has honoured an individual with ceremonies in various cities.

One of the things we didn\u2019t do well covering the presidential election last time was that we failed to distinguish between the serious and not so serious \u2013 the term false equivalency comes to mind. So Trump and his sexual assault claims, business record, history of racism \u2013 all those things were made equal to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Today we\u2019re calling it a little better. When things are \u201cracist\u201d we\u2019re willing sometimes to use that word. We\u2019re willing to use the word \u201clie\u201d.

I don\u2019t think we got Trump. We didn\u2019t understand how much the country was angry at elites, upset about the fallout from the economic crisis. And I don\u2019t think we understood quite how much the country just wanted to shake things up. We covered it as usual, the way we always cover elections, as a clash of two ideologies, and I think it was much, much deeper.</p> <p><strong>Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News:</strong> The media has this incredible quadrennial habit of learning all the lessons of four years ago and applying them when the medium has already moved on. So I think the media is totally prepared not to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle, like giving Trump endless livestreams and letting him use provocative tweets to dominate the conversation.

The US president is openly attacking journalists. He has convinced a third of the country that the New York Times is fake news. We can criticize the Times all we want for substantive reasons, but it\u2019s not fake news. We have to have some general understanding: outlets like the Guardian, the New Yorker, these are not fake news!</p> <p><strong>Jorge Ramos, Univision news anchor:</strong> In 2016 there were 27 million Latinos eligible to vote and 13 million of them decided to stay home \u2013 more than 50%. In 2020 there will be 32 million Latinos eligible to vote and I\u2019m very concerned that the story might repeat itself again: that Latinos decide to stay home because they don\u2019t like President Trump but don\u2019t trust the Democrats either. That would be terrible for Latinos.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Arnall, executive editor</strong><strong> of MSNBC: </strong>So one of the things that we are doing differently than in the last cycle is focusing more on issues, and coverage of issues that folks across the country are interested in.

      "bodyText": "In the weeks after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the American media went through deep soul searching. Most news outlets had been taken by surprise by Trump\u2019s victory, had failed to see the rise of the electorate that would put him in the White House, and had been led by the clickbait of his tweets. Then there was Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and an arguable failure to appreciate the importance of misinformation and Russian interference in the election. This time the press has pledged to do better. Yet, with less than a year to go before Americans go to the polls again, there are already signs that mistakes of the magnitude of 2016 may be repeated or new challenges arise. The Guardian and the Columbia Journalism Review have partnered to interview 30 top media figures and commentators, asking how ready they think we are for the 2020 presidential election. \u2018The media got the country wrong\u2019 The stakes could not be higher. With the 2020 presidential election upon us, leading media practitioners and commentators are in anxious and reflective mood. Margaret Sullivan, media columnist for the Washington Post: The press is under assault and democracy is under assault right now, and these two things are related. One of the things we didn\u2019t do well covering the presidential election last time was that we failed to distinguish between the serious and not so serious \u2013 the term false equivalency comes to mind. So Trump and his sexual assault claims, business record, history of racism \u2013 all those things were made equal to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Today we\u2019re calling it a little better. When things are \u201cracist\u201d we\u2019re willing sometimes to use that word. We\u2019re willing to use the word \u201clie\u201d. We\u2019ve come a ways in that sense, but I\u2019m still not particularly positive about how we\u2019re going to deal with 2020. Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times: In 2016 I think the media got the country wrong. I don\u2019t think we got Trump. We didn\u2019t understand how much the country was angry at elites, upset about the fallout from the economic crisis. And I don\u2019t think we understood quite how much the country just wanted to shake things up. We covered it as usual, the way we always cover elections, as a clash of two ideologies, and I think it was much, much deeper. Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News: The media has this incredible quadrennial habit of learning all the lessons of four years ago and applying them when the medium has already moved on. So I think the media is totally prepared not to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle, like giving Trump endless livestreams and letting him use provocative tweets to dominate the conversation. But I\u2019m sure we will fuck it up in some new way we aren\u2019t expecting. Samhita Mukhopadhyay, executive editor of Teen Vogue: People are worried and we don\u2019t have an answer. The US president is openly attacking journalists. He has convinced a third of the country that the New York Times is fake news. We can criticize the Times all we want for substantive reasons, but it\u2019s not fake news. We have to have some general understanding: outlets like the Guardian, the New Yorker, these are not fake news! Jorge Ramos, Univision news anchor: In 2016 there were 27 million Latinos eligible to vote and 13 million of them decided to stay home \u2013 more than 50%. In 2020 there will be 32 million Latinos eligible to vote and I\u2019m very concerned that the story might repeat itself again: that Latinos decide to stay home because they don\u2019t like President Trump but don\u2019t trust the Democrats either. That would be terrible for Latinos. Daniel Arnall, executive editor of MSNBC: So one of the things that we are doing differently than in the last cycle is focusing more on issues, and coverage of issues that folks across the country are interested in. That is going to be driving our coverage. We\u2019re going to be substantially less interested in taking like live candidate events, I think, and dealing with all of that. Charlie Sykes, editor-in-chief at the Bulwark: Going back to 2016, when I was part of what you\u2019d consider to be the conservative media, it\u2019s difficult to remember that there was still a lot of diversity of opinion. There were a lot of conservative commentators and talk show hosts who were very critical of Donald Trump. What\u2019s really changed is how increasingly tribalized the media has become. Kara Swisher, tech journalist and founder of Recode: What happened in 2016 should not come as a surprise for anyone who has been paying attention to the tech companies. Tech moguls collect all the money and pay none of the price. Trump and his tweets In 2016 Trump regularly set the 24-hour news agenda with his early morning clickbait tweets. Will the same Trump-obsession dominate again? Frank Bruni, columnist for the New York Times: We\u2019ve learned that if you write a story about the ridiculousness of Trump\u2019s latest tweet it gets a lot more traffic than an analysis of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Medicare for All plan. Trump understands what news catches people\u2019s interest, he has a very acute sense of what people will click on. So I\u2019m concerned that we are going to end up giving Trump more than the lion\u2019s share of media time all the way up to election night. Mukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: We are living amid constant cutbacks. Outlets are shrinking. I worry the story continues to be driven by what is performing, by KPIs (key performance indicators). That\u2019s where a lot of the Trump tweet coverage comes from \u2013 it\u2019s low-hanging fruit. Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today: I make no apology for the amount of coverage we give President Trump. He\u2019s the president. If he says something that\u2019s incredibly provocative or does something that has far-reaching ramifications, we have an obligation to report it. Ramos, Univision: When Trump announced his candidacy in 2015 and when he ejected me from a press conference, we told everyone, listen, this is someone who\u2019s making racist remarks, he\u2019s attacking the press, yet very few people pay attention. Today I believe it\u2019s a completely different story. Journalists are being much more aggressive than they were in 2016. Smith, BuzzFeed: This is a totally different moment to 2016 \u2013 it\u2019s an election that will be a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency. The challenge will be covering his presidency and not what he says about it. Olivia Nuzzi, Washington correspondent for New York magazine: Trump is sort of blowing everything up. And the way he has done that has provided more opportunity for reporters to be creative. In the Trump White House, nothing works like it\u2019s supposed to. Baquet, the New York Times: When you cover a theatrical politician you must try not to get caught up in the theatre. Having said that, I\u2019m one of those people who thinks theatrics are still worth covering \u2013 they are part of the way he leads the country. Todd Gitlin, professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University: During the first Gulf war, the Washington bureaus of major news organizations \u2013 spearheaded by Harper\u2019s together with the networks and a number of major news organizations \u2013 said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go along with the \u2018minders\u2019 scheme.\u201d Such collective action is not beyond the bounds of the imagination for 2020. Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist: I think there is some debate in certain quarters about whether the media should be taking one side or another \u2013 stand in opposition to Trump. And that\u2019s in part what is feeding the sense of polarisation and people living in two entirely ecosystems in the US. Lies, damn lies and factchecks Since Trump took office, the Washington Post has counted 13,435 of his false and misleading claims. This extraordinary splurge of untruths poses huge challenges for the media as we go into 2020. Glenn Kessler, editor of the Fact Checker, Washington Post: The database of Trump\u2019s false claims is a very depressing duty. It just drags you down to have to go through it, like reading one of the president\u2019s rally speeches. Just one speech will have 60 false and misleading claims, most of which you\u2019ve already factchecked and said were false. It\u2019s incredibly depressing. Page, USA Today: There is much more impressive factchecking than there was in 2016. One of the things that we\u2019ve seen happen is not to let something that we know is inaccurate stand unchallenged. Ramos, Univision: I\u2019ve covered Latin America for many decades and I think that has prepared me for what I\u2019m seeing right here in the US. To have someone leading the country who is an authoritarian, who is not telling the truth, who\u2019s constantly lying in a country that is completely divided. Bruni, the New York Times: You can only say the same thing so many times before people become numb and deaf to it. If the public is not listening, I don\u2019t know how that becomes our fault. Nicholas Johnston, editor-in-chief of Axios: What makes me somewhat optimistic is that four or six years ago we didn\u2019t even have the vocabulary to talk about deepfake, fake video and audio, misinformation, the manipulation of social media, the end of truth. Now we know that these are things, we can talk about it and help voters identify what is true and what is not. Kessler, the Washington Post: I\u2019ve covered just about every presidential administration since Reagan and this administration has the least fidelity to truth and honesty of any I\u2019ve encountered. Sullivan, the Washington Post: The Sunday TV talkshows will bring on people like Kellyanne Conway, Trump\u2019s White House counsel, who is just an inveterate liar. By having her on, she is allowed to say things that aren\u2019t true and although she can be challenged it\u2019s still a very strong message having her on air. My feeling is, don\u2019t have her on, you know she\u2019s going to lie her way through every broadcast. That\u2019s not censorship. Censorship is government action that disallows things being said, but judgments made by editors and producers are not censorship. Swisher, Recode: If you\u2019re not scared when Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg says it\u2019s okay for politicians to lie, especially in the context of a system that is so viral compared to any other media, you should be afraid. Polls Most opinion polls in 2016 predicted that Hillary Clinton would win. On election day the New York Times gave Clinton an \u201c85% chance to win\u201d through its forecasting model. There\u2019s been a lot of soul-searching since then. Have we learned the lessons? Arnall, MSNBC: I am still hesitant on polling, and I think there\u2019s been a real reluctance by a lot of major organizations to really come to terms with the failures of that through the last cycle. I think that\u2019s a potential weak point that a lot of people should be pushing their organizations on. I\u2019m still like, \u201cWhat are we doing differently this time?\u201d Larry Sabato, pollster and director of University of Virginia Center for Politics: All of us pollsters got to eat a large, bitter humble pie after election night in 2016, which came as a tremendous shock. We\u2019d all expected Hillary Clinton to win by three points or so, giving her over 300 electoral college votes. When Trump won we were forced to relearn that polling is not the word of God or handed down on the Mount to Moses. Baquet, the New York Times: All of us in the media were just so convinced Trump couldn\u2019t win. But he was outside of the paint-by-numbers game we have developed. Sabato, pollster: The polling industry has tried to correct itself after it was so badly caught off-guard. We used not to weight by educational level and it turned out that if we had done so we might have been more accurate in 2016. So now everybody is weighting by education. We also had our fingers burned over the electoral college. The polls got the popular vote more or less correct, with Clinton winning the popular vote by two percentage points, but we should have thought more about the profound electoral college impact that gave Trump his victory. Page, USA Today: You have to rely both on quantitative and qualitative interviews. Polling is really valuable, but it doesn\u2019t tell you everything. You want some quantitative data that enables you to say, \u201cHey, Pete Buttigieg is doing really well among older voters,\u201d which is one thing we\u2019ve just noticed in recent polling, then go out and talk to older voters. Sabato, pollster: As for forecasting models, they need to be dropped entirely. Most readers didn\u2019t understand what probability really means. It just confuses people, and to do it again next year would be to plant a bomb that could explode in your face. \u2018Horserace coverage is dead\u2019 2016 provoked soul searching about whether Clinton was held to different media standards than Trump, both in the extent and type of coverage. Is the same happening again within the traditional media obsession with the horserace? Bruni, the New York Times: Here\u2019s one specific way I think we will be able to judge whether we\u2019ve done our jobs well at the end of the 2020 election: we will not have gone to the Democratic finalists in the primary stage or to the ultimate Democratic nominee, whoever that person is, every time Trump hurls an insult and accusation at them. We will not have made that the main news story of the day: \u201cCandidates traded volleys in a war of words.\u201d We do that all the time. Sullivan, the Washington Post: I see sexism in the coverage of women candidates. It\u2019s improved since Hillary Clinton ran but it\u2019s still not great. The disappearance of Kamala Harris has some of that wrapped into it, and the constant discussions about whether Elizabeth Warren is likable enough to be elected reflects inherent sexism that we haven\u2019t really dealt with. Page, USA Today: On the day that Donald Trump announced, my assumption was that he was not going to be nominated for president. And it took a while for me to realize what voters were saying, which was that he would be. So that is a lesson that I think we tried to apply this time, by looking at the Democratic field \u2026 It\u2019s not up to us. It\u2019s up to voters. Mukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: One thing we\u2019re seeing with young people is that they are having trouble following the deep nuances between candidates. It\u2019s kind of boring to really point out some of these policy differences because they\u2019re not really that different. Smith, BuzzFeed: Horserace coverage is dead. Our audience actively hates it. We have to think about a way to replace it in a way that is compelling and that cares about the personalities and the policies while always keeping in mind that there are real things at stake. Now it\u2019s kids in cages. I mean, who cares that somebody fires his political consultants. Beddoes, the Economist: We are beefing up our data department, which we\u2019ll combine with traditional shoe-leather reporting. We plan to put those together with the outsider perspective we bring, and the ability to stand back from the tick-tock of the horserace minute-by-minute, to give rigorous fair-minded analysis. Smith, BuzzFeed: For our audience nobody thinks that politics is a game or that it\u2019s fun or a sport. The kind of coverage that treats it as though it\u2019s entertainment is repellant to people. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want to know who\u2019s going to win or that they don\u2019t care about polling, but just that everybody has a sense of what the stakes are. That\u2019s the brand for our coverage: the stakes 2020. Fly-over country Trump\u2019s unexpected victory four years ago led to questions about whether media organisations, in their coastal bubbles, had failed to hear the frustration of voters in the heartlands. How is it playing for 2020? Baquet, the New York Times: We have to get out in the country more. We have to talk to more people, which we\u2019ve started to do. Sarah Kendzior, St Louis, Missouri-based journalist and author of The View from Flyover Country: Dispatches from the Forgotten America: National media is making the same mistakes as in 2016. The midwest has become the sort of stand-in region for what the national media think of as the \u201cforgotten voter\u201d. What a lot of these coastal outlets are doing is parachuting in here with the narrative pre-written trying to find people who fit their preconceptions of what people in the midwest are like. Honestly the best way they could fix this problem would be to hire people who actually live in these states. Al Cross, director of the University of Kentucky Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues: It\u2019s not just boots on the ground. You can\u2019t have a parachute mentality. You have to have some appreciation of rural sensibility. The best reporters know how to do that. Sykes, the Bulwark: I\u2019m in Wisconsin and I do a lot of work on the coast as well. I\u2019ll be on an MSNBC show, and people on the panels start talking about Wisconsin voters as these strange throwback figures, \u201cnostalgic for a time when men were able to slap women around\u201d. And it was like, \u201cWait, no.\u201d First of all, understand that these are people who have their own values, their own communities, and every time you talk about them in this way, you deepen this red, blue divide, this thing. You need to not treat them as these \u2026 deplorable troglodytes. Caitlin Byrd, political reporter for the Charleston Post and Courier: Growing up in the south, you see the same descriptors used to talk about places where I was from: backwoods, dirt road, small town, quiet. The same tropes over and over. But this cycle is it seems that more national reporters in particular are realizing that the south is more complicated. Gitlin, Columbia University: There was a sense after 2016 that we weren\u2019t listening to enough people in diners in Ohio. That wasn\u2019t so much misguided as it was inflated. The average Trump voter has above-average income! News media went from not noticing people whose life chances are impacted by the rustification of the midwest to thinking that they are now the central story. It\u2019s an absurd overcompensation. Kendzior, journalist and author: I meet a lot of people who have some regret about voting for Trump, who are reluctant at times to admit that regret on record. Some are embarrassed about having made this regrettable decision \u2026 The base is still there, they\u2019re very frenetic \u2026 But I do think that base is much smaller than the media portrays it. The need to reach young voters Only 46% of 18-29 year olds voted in 2016. Was the failure of media to address young people\u2019s interests partly to blame, and if so how to fix it? Mukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: The way the media talks about the youth vote is as social media Snapchat-obsessed young people, who don\u2019t care about politics and are not engaged because it\u2019s above their head and they are so selfish and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t vote. If I was Gen Z that kind of narrative would turn me off too. When you do have outlets that speak to their interests you notice that they do become engaged. Swisher, Recode: When I started my podcast, someone said to me: \u201cYou know, Kara, millennials like snackable content.\u201d And I was like: \u201cI don\u2019t want to write for people who want snacks. Everyone who\u2019s substantive wants substance.\u201d They said: \u201cMillennials are twitchy. They can\u2019t focus on anything long.\u201d And what\u2019s interesting about it is, they were dead wrong. Mukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: None of the presidential candidates have a very well-fleshed-out strategy for Gen Z. Nobody really knows how the 18-year-old who is in St Louis who works in a fast-food place, we have no idea what they want. We don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to vote. At Teen Vogue we see it as an opportunity for a generation that has not had somebody actually speak to their needs: climate change, immigration, juvenile justice, student debt. Race in the race Diversity in media \u2013 both in terms of the internal makeup of news teams and the way those teams cover Trump\u2019s stoking of racial fears \u2013 will be a running theme in 2020. Errin Haines Whack, national writer on race and ethnicity for the Associated Press: As we head into 2020, I am still on the campaign trail quite frequently the only black woman in a room. Sometimes the only black person. The reality is that two thirds of the people who cover political journalism are white men. Yet we have the most diverse field in the history of Democratic politics in the upcoming primary: a record number of women, a record number of people of color. Responding to that diversity in newsrooms seems to be a journalistic imperative. Dwight Watkins, Salon editor and bestselling author: I\u2019ve been seeing the same people \u2026 get out there and basically tell similar stories and make assumptions about whole groups of people. They talk about the black vote as if it\u2019s just one thing. So I think when you utilize the same players and the same people, they take their biases and they apply these biases to our whole group. And this is just not fair. Ramos, Univision: Many news organisations have started calling Trump a racist \u2013 that\u2019s something that didn\u2019t happen in 2016. When Trump said in June 2015 that Mexican immigrants are criminals and rapists, that was a racist statement but many people were not comfortable calling him out on that. Since then he\u2019s made many other racist remarks and reporters and news media feel more comfortable now in calling Trump a racist. Baquet, the New York Times: People who think that Trump only won because 40% of America is racist are not looking closely at the numbers, and do not have a fully empathetic understanding of America. I\u2019m not saying he didn\u2019t stoke racism and get votes from racists. But that\u2019s a very easy answer. I don\u2019t think that journalists should deal with easy answers. Mukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: I felt a lot of the conversations after 2016 were \u201cOh no! we focused so much on getting all these women in the newsroom we alienated all these white men\u201d. After the election, editors felt they needed less diverse newsrooms because they were concerned they had gone \u201ctoo far left\u201d or had incorporated identity politics too much and were alienating this white base that was all riled up for Trump. Ramos, Univision: The numbers of Latinos represented in the US \u2013 whether in newsrooms or in Congress \u2013 are abysmal. We don\u2019t have enough Latinos on the air or reporting. I do see changes. The first presidential debate among Democratic candidates was organised by NBC and Telemundo, and Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart was one of the moderators. That alone meant that Spanish was spoken in that debate, immigration was addressed and Hispanic issues were talked about. I was one of the moderators in the second debate, and for the first time not only did we talk about Latino issues and immigration but I brought in Latin American issues. Escape the Twitter bubble Where will 2020 election news come from? The other 500 journalists pontificating in a journalist\u2019s Twitter feed? Johnston, Axios: My social media policy for the newsroom would be: delete your Twitter account and don\u2019t use that as your window on the world, it\u2019s a journalists\u2019 echo chamber. OK, that\u2019s a joke \u2013 we are not going to un-invent the internet. But I do think it\u2019s important in newsrooms to talk about the impact that it has. We tell our reporters to call people on the telephone, get out of the house, go wander the halls of Congress, fly someplace and talk to people. Mukhopadhyay, Teen Vogue: If you looked at Twitter after the recent Democratic presidential debate, my entire timeline was filled with criticism of Pete Buttigieg. Meanwhile he\u2019s polling really well. That discrepancy reminds me of that we thought Trump couldn\u2019t win in 2016 because we all hated him and thought he was a joke. That to me indicates that we haven\u2019t learned anything. Nuzzi, New York magazine: I try to remind myself that the entire electorate is not represented in these couple hundred Twitter accounts.

      "body": "<h2>1) Heinz can justify Jones\u2019s faith</h2> <p>Willi Heinz was one of the more left-field selections in last year\u2019s World Cup, called up by England at the age of 32 as one of two scrum-halves in their squad. The promotion of the New Zealander, who qualified through a grandmother, annoyed Danny Care, who for three years had appeared to be bound for Japan. Judging by the performances of the pair over the weekend, Eddie Jones not only made the right call but may be reluctant to jettison Heinz, who is now 33. The biggest single reason Gloucester came from behind to defeat Bath was Heinz\u2019s ability to react to what he saw rather than read from a script. Gloucester are a curious mix of a side: on the one hand they make basic mistakes and creak in the set pieces but on the other they have the ability to make much from little, the likes of Heinz, Danny Cipriani and Mark Atkinson loading the gun for Ollie Thorley, Louis-Rees Zammit, Jason Woodward and Jake Polledri to fire. They are the Premiership\u2019s wild cards. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/04/gloucester-bath-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">\u2022 Match report: Gloucester 29-15 Bath</a></em></p> <h2>2) Tigers show signs of improvement</h2> <p>Suddenly Welford Road feels a more uplifting place. This was a second consecutive match at the grand old fortress of English rugby that might be accounted \u201cgood\u201d. Better still, unlike the preceding example (a home defeat by Exeter), Leicester won it. It seems ridiculous, given their personnel, to note how well Leicester can play when the mood takes them. Whatever else happens, this will not be their last win of the season, even if the Six Nations looms into view to disrupt them, just as they find some form. Bristol, meanwhile, drop out of the top four to join a band of seven clubs frantically scrambling for the higher ground as the black tide rises angrily beneath them. None of them is safe \u2013 not even Leicester. <strong>Michael Aylwin</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/04/saracens-worcester-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">\u2022 Match report: Leicester 31-18 Bristol</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Attack-minded Kidney has cause for optimism</h2> <p>The former Munster and Ireland coach Declan Kidney does not even want to hear the word relegation mentioned with his promoted side sitting third bottom of the Premiership table having picked up a solitary point in their three league games either side of Christmas. He favours a glass-half-full approach, suggesting attack remains the Exiles\u2019 best form of defence as they seek to work their way up the table. Given they scored four tries against the league leaders he may have a point. If Irish can also get all their best players fit for the run-in, they will remain hopeful of recovering from their midwinter slump. \u201cIt\u2019s the first half of games that we\u2019re doing damage to ourselves,\u201d suggested Kidney. That\u2019s where we need to make ourselves better.\u201d For the moment, though, Kidney must soldier on without his Irish internationals Paddy Jackson and Sean O\u2019Brien, neither of whom is set to be available for several more weeks, and hope that the Wallaby lock Adam Coleman\u2019s shoulder problem is not overly serious. <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/05/london-irish-exeter-premiership-match-report-rugby\" title=\"\">\u2022 Match report: London Irish 28-45 Exeter</a></em></p> <h2>4) Quins need to get a grip \u2013 and fast</h2> <p>Paul Gustard\u2019s arrival at Harlequins last season was meant to sort out their defence but the six-try thrashing at Sale took them to 12 conceded in the last three matches with strugglers Wasps and Leicester the first two opponents. Quins were narrow in Salford and bypassed all too often. The experience of Mike Brown is being missed at full-back and Sale have one of the strongest squads in the Premiership. Quins have a core of hardened international experience yet they have conceded at least 30 points in five league and Champions Cup matches this season. \u201cWe were not good enough and got beaten up,\u201d said their director of rugby, Gustard, who took aim at his England prop Joe Marler for a loss of discipline at the start of the second half that cost him 10 minutes in the sin-bin. \u201cIt was ridiculous,\u201d said Gustard about the prop putting his forearm in the face of an opponent. \u201cThere was no need for it.\u201d It is not just Marler who needs to get a grip. <strong>PR</strong></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/03/sale-harlequins-premiership-rugby\" title=\"\">\u2022 Match report: Sale 48-10 Harlequins</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf1d7971713d38a403a430c98ba42f341d8dff3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf1d7971713d38a403a430c98ba42f341d8dff3/0_0_4928_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryn Evans of Sale wins a line-out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryn Evans of Sale wins a line-out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Fingers crossed for Fatialofa</h2> <p>There was a lot to talk about for such a one-sided and eminently predictable match. First of all Michael Fatialofa. Rugby is familiar with the long pause in play while a stricken player is tended to, so we know the precautions need not mean serious injury. Alan Solomons\u2019 openness afterwards, however, about how concerned he is gives us pause, as does the news that Fatialofa has been retained in hospital with his neck injury. Fingers remain crossed. Otherwise Saracens were content, in their bubble against an angry world, to celebrate the retirement of Nigel Wray in style. Ten tries \u2013 and it could have been more \u2013 is a statement in this league, whoever cops it.

Then again, they won right at the end in Bristol a week earlier and will also know that home improvement will be fundamental if they want to avoid being sucked down into the relegation morass in the coming months. Their next three away league games, against Worcester, Leicester and London Irish, will be equally telling: there are signs of improvement visible but two wins out of eight is clearly less than ideal. Saints, on the other hand, have won six out of eight and have scored more tries and points than any other side in the Premiership.

First, let\u2019s look at who she was up against. She beat Nicole Kidman, who held the second season of Big Little Lies together with her complex portrayal of a woman grieving a man she helped to murder. She beat Jodie Comer, who managed to be even more dazzling and confident in the second season of Killing Eve than she was in the first, which nobody thought possible.

Yes, they were nice chairs. And yes, sometimes they were in different places. And, true, sometimes she did more than sit in a chair. Sometimes she looked out of windows. Sometimes, when something made her furious beyond all comprehension, she very infinitesimally flared her nostrils. But that\u2019s all.</p> \n<p>This isn\u2019t a failing of Colman. It\u2019s a failing of The Crown for underusing her, and a failing of Queen Elizabeth II for not being more demonstrative. Had the material been there, Colman would have clearly given a world\u2019s best performance. But it wasn\u2019t, so she spent an entire series of television sitting on her thumb. What a waste of a brilliant performer.</p> \n<p>So Olivia Colman shouldn\u2019t have won her Golden Globe, but it\u2019s Olivia Colman so I\u2019m glad she did. Hopefully next year the Golden Globes will go back to being terrible so I have something more substantial to write about.</p>",

It\u2019s a failing of The Crown for underusing her, and a failing of Queen Elizabeth II for not being more demonstrative. Had the material been there, Colman would have clearly given a world\u2019s best performance. But it wasn\u2019t, so she spent an entire series of television sitting on her thumb. What a waste of a brilliant performer. So Olivia Colman shouldn\u2019t have won her Golden Globe, but it\u2019s Olivia Colman so I\u2019m glad she did. Hopefully next year the Golden Globes will go back to being terrible so I have something more substantial to write about.",

I\u2019d recommend reading it all:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To deal with the climate change we cannot prevent and that is already here we must immediately begin work on the framework we need for effective mega-crisis management. It is well beyond time that some serious national strategic planning was initiated to address the extreme disaster amplification generated by climate change. <br></p> <p>The fire season has extended by 19% since the 1970s, and this in the first instance poses significant problems in accessing the air support that we often share with the northern hemisphere. This was illustrated in the current situation where early and out of season fires in California and NSW overlapped. As was set out in the policy Labor took to the 2019 election, we need to seriously expand our self-sufficiency in air firefighting capability. For the long term, this means that in acquiring future ADF air assets we need to ensure there is modularity factored in to their design to reconfigure for firebombing.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mike Kelly's facebook\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMikeKellyEdenMonaro%2Fposts%2F10158008320401528&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"270\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T01:06:26.155Z\">at 1.06am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1286778f08c3972264561a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T01:01:10.067Z\">1.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our correspondents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/eleanor-ainge-roy\">Eleanor Ainge Roy</a> in Dunedin and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-lyons\">Kate Lyons </a>have an update on what our Pacific neighbours have offered:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Australia\u2019s neighbouring countries, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\">New Zealand</a>, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea, have offered support as the country continues to fight massive bushfires burning in New South Wales and Victoria.</p> <p>Members of the New Zealand military are en route to Australia to assist with the efforts, adding to the 157 New Zealand firefighters already deployed in Australia, some of whom have been assisting their Australian colleagues since October.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s minister of defence, <strong>Ron Mark</strong>, said more help was urgently needed because the fires showed no signs of abating and thousands of people and homes remained in harm\u2019s way.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/06/new-zealand-sends-troops-to-help-with-australian-bushfires-as-pacific-nations-offer-support\">New Zealand sends troops to help with Australian bushfires as Pacific nations offer support</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1285348f085eda5c112c0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-06T00:54:29.237Z\">12.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RAAF_ACAUST/status/1213982043945570306\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our people are highly trained &amp;

With extreme dryness, everything will burn. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t put the fires out. Firefighting aircraft are not a panacea. It needs to be new thinking on how we deal with this ongoing crisis into the future. There will be planning standards, building standards, how we use federal government agencies like the ADF which we called for \u2013 we were mocked by the prime minister for asking for that some months ago. But we do need to work out how we are going to deal with this. I\u2019ve recently been in California. The best resourced firefighting place in the world really. They can\u2019t cope with the fires driven by climate change. So they are having a huge rethink about how they do it.

So we\u2019ll meet and beat the Paris targets by using credits from the very weak Kyoto targets set for Australia and emissions under this government went up every year for five years, they\u2019ve gone down slightly this year because of the drought and less emissions in the agricultural sector, so not through government action. <br></p> <p>I worry for my grandchildren, their grandchildren. If this is how it is now, this is driven by climate change, imagine what future generations are up against and if Australia doesn\u2019t take moral leadership on this, like we did with apartheid, nuclear weapons, things that we didn\u2019t even have a 1.3% stake in, but we spoke loudly from a moral base. We can\u2019t talk to Brazil, India, China or America about their emissions, so it\u2019s about our grandkids and we need to take action and not pretend. <br></p> <p>... If you look around the world at countries taking action, it\u2019s around energy and climate change, there are strategies to reduce emissions in every sector, there are not in Australia. <strong>Mother nature doesn\u2019t understand dodgy spread sheets</strong> so if the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and other greenhouse gases go up, it gets warmer, mother nature gets more angry and we are on the front of that right now. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T23:57:29.403Z\">at 11.57pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1273868f085eda5c112b9e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T23:40:32.991Z\">11.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Management by news grab'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greg Mullins </strong>is also very critical of the government\u2019s response to requests for more resources, before the fire season began:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, firstly, we welcome the fact that the federal government is providing extra resources. <br></p> <p>The issue is, we were asking back in April. <br></p> <p> <strong>They sat on a business case from the current fire chiefs for nearly two years</strong>. <br></p> <p>They put in another 11m in December, late December or mid-December when there was a lot of media pressure and now there\u2019s extra money. <br></p> <p>Let\u2019s put all that aside.

And in this year\u2019s budget, that will be provided again on an ongoing basis. And so after becoming prime minister they were matters we put in train with that additional funding and resource and as was noted yesterday, at 8pm the previous evening we received the request for an additional water bombing asset and we moved to provide four with an additional $20m so when you look at that over the scheme over the last couple of years and the additional resource that has been provided on top of our standing commitment of $15m, it means that the resources were delivered and now we will ensure they are there on an ongoing basis.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T22:10:09.659Z\">at 10.10pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e125d088f087e8308e691bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-05T22:05:01.543Z\">10.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> has also deflected any questions on whether or not our agencies had everything they needed in advance of the fire season.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from our live bushfire blog for today. There\u2019ll be another tomorrow. Here\u2019s a quick summary of where things stand, and some of the big stories from the day. First, the fires. NSW police confirmed the 20th death in the state from the current fire season, after a search found a body on a property in the Eurobodalla shire at 4pm today. In NSW, all fires are at advice level with no immediate danger. In Victoria, 31 fires are burning, with 13 watch and act warnings in place. Authorities in Victoria are looking at Thursday and Friday this week as days with the potential for worse conditions. In South Australia, fire activity is increasing on Kangaroo Island and a total fire ban has been declared for Tuesday. Smoke haze continued to impact residents around fire areas, and in Melbourne and Canberra in particular. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a new $2bn National Bushfire Recovery Agency to \u201ccoordinate a national response to rebuild communities and livelihoods\u201d. Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, announced Bushfire Recovery Victoria to coordinate the government\u2019s recovery efforts. About 300 people stuck on a major highway in Western Australia since Christmas are being escorted out after a break in dangerous fire conditions. At the Golden Globes in Beverley Hills, California, Australian winner Russell Crowe and award presenter Cate Blanchett both took the chance to highlight climate change and the bushfire crisis. Please stay safe and if you\u2019re in fire-prone areas, keep a close eye and ear on local broadcasts and warnings from authorities. We\u2019re only just into January, so there are going to be many more weeks of this bushfire season still to go. And then there\u2019s the recovery. Keep being kind to one another. There have been many harrowing stories in recent weeks, and thousands of people have gone through severe and life-changing trauma. This will take a toll on our mental health. So if you feel you need to, remember to talk to someone \u2013 it could be your GP, a psychologist, a counsellor, or a friend. Or call Lifeline on 13 11 14. The smoke haze that\u2019s been a major issue across NSW and parts of Victoria for weeks is giving organisers of the Australian Open tennis some major concerns. Organisers are hopeful the tournament will be able to start on time. We\u2019ve just posted this report. This reminds me of the major issues they had back in 2014, when extreme temperatures caused the Canadian player Frank Dancevic to hallucinate a cartoon dog, shortly before collapsing on court. The same heat burned Serbian tennis player Jelena Jankovic\u2019s bum. Some relief appears to be on the way for more than 300 people who have been stuck at roadhouses along the Eyre Highway in south-east Western Australia since Christmas Day. Fires had blocked the highway leaving people stranded in a 710km stretch. Helicopters and planes had been dropping vital supplies \u2013 including toilet paper and fresh food \u2013 to roadhouses in Caiguna, Cocklebiddy and Madura. The ABC is reporting a break in the dangerous fire conditions has given authorities a chance to get people out, with a \u201clarge-scale evacuation\u201d now under way. The Department of Fire and Emergency Services superintendent Mark Bowen has told the ABC that firefighters had \u201cmade good progress\u201d on fire fronts, but conditions were predicted to worsen. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a window of opportunity come up with the weather that\u2019s allowed us to start moving some of those trapped people that have been stuck on the Eyre Highway.\u201d Bowen said the highway was still closed, but police would scan the highway using planes and helicopters to make sure there were no other people camping away from the roadhouses. NSW police confirmed an eighth person has died from the bushfires on the state\u2019s south coast, bringing the total number of deaths in the state from the fires to 20. Police say a body was found at 4pm during a search of a property in Nerrigundah in the Eurobodalla shire. In a statement, police said they were looking for a 71-year-old man who had been reported missing, last seen moving equipment on his property on 31 December 2019. Rescue units had been unable to access the property until today due to the risk of the fire at Badja Forest Road. Police said: \u201cAbout 4pm the body of a man was located between the property and a car, which had both been destroyed by fire. \u201cThe body, which is yet to be formally identified, is believed to be that of the missing 71-year-old man.\u201d Detectives from the south coast police district are on the scene with police rescue and the Volunteer Rescue Association. Inquiries are continuing, and a report will be prepared for the information of the coroner, the statement said. Police said 20 deaths had now been confirmed in the state in the current bushfire season. Australia\u2019s tax office is giving people in fire-impacted areas an automatic two months extra to complete their tax returns or pay their tax bills. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says \u201cthe last thing that you should be concerned about is your tax affairs\u201d if you\u2019re struggling in the fires. The ATO says: If you\u2019ve been impacted by these bushfires, we don\u2019t want you to be concerned about your tax affairs. Now is the time for you, your family and community. We\u2019ll help you sort out your tax affairs later. For identified impacted postcodes, we\u2019ll automatically grant deferrals for lodgments and payments due. You, or your agent, don\u2019t need to apply for these deferrals. There\u2019s more information on the ATO\u2019s website. Evening folks, Graham Readfearn here. Can we have a virtual round of thanks to Naaman Zhou for blogging through this afternoon, and for Amy Remeikis earlier today. If I\u2019m less busy than they were, then we\u2019ll all be happy. It\u2019s been a confusing day, weather-wise, for Melbourne. The heavy cloud cover and the smoke \u2013 and some light rain \u2013 has actually brought temperatures down a bit. The bureau has also issued a \u201croad weather alert\u201d in the past hour. The drizzle, plus the smoke, has created slippery road surfaces and poor visibility. So be careful if you\u2019re still travelling. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Graham Readfearn now. Thanks for reading. If you missed it earlier today, we updated our ongoing interactive map showing the scale of the bushfires. We\u2019re now at 8.4m hectares burnt, across NSW, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, SA and WA. We are still waiting on figures from the NT. In pictures, here\u2019s 8.4m hectares, laid over Sydney, Melbourne, London and Paris to show the scale. One of the Sydney festival\u2019s biggest events has been cancelled due to ongoing poor air quality from smoke haze. Opening Night, a play starring the Oscar-nominated French actor Isabelle Adjani, was set for a week-long run from 21 to 26 January at the Opera House. But it\u2019s just been announced that the entire run is cancelled \u201cdue to health concerns related to fire-affected air quality in Sydney\u201d. \u201cNaturally, on behalf of the people of Sydney, we are extremely disappointed,\u201d the festival director, Wesley Enoch, said. Meanwhile, the Sydney festival has announced a bushfire charity concert, with Regurgitator, Custard, Dan Sultan and more. It\u2019s on 11 January at the Metro Theatre. The army will deliver an emergency water purification system to Kangaroo Island in South Australia, AAP reports. Fires are still burning on the island today, and up to 100 army reservists arrived on the island to provide the community with immediate help. The ADF chief of joint operations, Lieutenant General Greg Bilton, said the army had also provided 64,000 litres of bottled water. In response to a freedom of information request from my colleague Josh Taylor, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has said providing information would \u201cdivert resources\u201d during the bushfire crisis. The request was about messages to Scott Morrison about the bushfires while he was on holiday in Hawaii. Visibility in Melbourne is down to less than 1km, due to smoke haze. Meanwhile, residents are trying to find the P2 masks that can help, but not completely protect you from inhaling PM2.5 particles. Meanwhile the Victorian CFA has just tweeted out that the Victorian government has its own direct donation site that goes to families. Hillsong founder Brian Houston, a friend and religious mentor of Scott Morrison, says that the church has raised half a million dollars for firefighters and those affected. Two news stories you may have missed from earlier today. An ad Scott Morrison made about his government\u2019s bushfire response has been labelled \u201cmisleading and deceptive\u201d by an integrity expert, reports Christopher Knaus. The ad was authorised by the Liberal party and Scott Morrison, rather than by the Australian government. Senior NSW Liberals have also lashed out at Morrison over comments his office made that the state \u201crefused\u201d the offer of assistance. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Sharri Markson reported the refusal, after a briefing by the prime minister\u2019s office. But the Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, today said: \u201cThe answer is simply \u2018no\u2019. \u201cThere has been no offer of assistance that I am aware of that hasn\u2019t been accepted.\u201d And in more sport news, the bidding for Shane Warne\u2019s baggy green \u2013 also auctioned off for bushfire relief \u2013 has already hit $100,500, in just 90 minutes. The former England captain Michael Vaughan earlier bid $25,000, but was soon overtaken. Hi all, Naaman Zhou here taking over. I think I speak for everyone when I say a huge thanks to Amy Remeikis for piloting the blog all day. In sport news, tickets are now on sale for the Rally for Relief \u2013 a charity match organised by the Australian Open, where all the proceeds go to the bushfire effort. The line-up is still secret (and will be announced slowly in coming days, it seems). But Tennis Australia promises \u201cthe world\u2019s top players\u201d with \u201cmany Grand Slam titles between them\u201d have said yes. This all started after Nick Kyrgios suggested the idea for the charity match to Tennis Australia \u2013 and the Australian had already promised to donate $200 for each ace he hit across the summer. Tickets for the charity match are as low as $54 for adults and $35 concession. The match is on 15 January. I am about to log off for the day, but Naaman Zhou is standing by to take my place. To recap the main points of the day: Two people remain missing in NSW. No emergency alert fires are burning, but there are still many watch and act warnings in place. Cooler conditions have given firefighters a chance for shift changeovers and a rest, as well as working on containment lines. Dangerous fire conditions are forecast for the end of the week, so the reprieve will not last long. The evacuation order has been lifted in Victoria, but the disaster order remains. The government has committed $2bn over two years to a disaster recovery management fund, to be administrated by the Andrew Colvin-led National Disaster Recovery Agency. Victoria has also established a standing disaster recovery agency, to be led by the former police commissioner Ken Lay. The surplus is basically kaput. I will leave you in the exceptionally capable hands of Naaman. Please \u2013 take care of you. The Insurance Council of Australia has confirmed those figures Josh Frydenberg gave during the press conference: Since September 5, insurers have handled more than 6,000 insurance claims from bushfire regions of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. Insurance losses are estimated at $431m this bushfire season. The Australia Institute has responded to the government\u2019s funding announcement. From its statement: The Australia Institute has welcomed the government\u2019s $2bn bushfire recovery fund announcement, but has questioned why regular Australian taxpayers are being asked to pay when a levy on fossil fuel producers would be a more appropriate way to raise the required funding. \u201cRegular Australians should not be forced to pay while fossil fuel producers are being let off scot-free,\u201d says Ebony Bennett, deputy director of The Australia Institute. \u201cA modest levy on fossil fuel producers would help to shift the economic burden of these disasters from regular Australians to the coal and gas companies that are fuelling the climate crisis. \u201cA surplus is just an economic tool, not a policy goal in itself, and while we welcome the government\u2019s change in rhetoric regarding the need for a budget surplus, it\u2019s disappointing that the Australian community will be left to pick up the tab for yet another climate-fuelled disaster. Russell Crowe has shown everyone his fire truck supplies (wait to the end): Having lived through this for the past week or so, I hope anyone impacted by the smoke at the moment is OK. As my colleague Bridie Jabour has pointed out already, there are going to be a lot of confused toddlers looking for Emma, but I can think of a lot of parents who will be excited by this. Shane Warne has put his baggy green cap up for auction for bushfire relief. This is ongoing. The CFMEU construction division has donated $100,000 to bushfire relief. It is calling on others within the construction industry to do what they can. You can read the whole announcement Scott Morrison just made, here: The local government areas affected are listed below: New South Wales \u00b7 Armidale \u00b7 Ballina \u00b7 Bega Valley \u00b7 Bellingen \u00b7 Blue Mountains \u00b7 Byron \u00b7 Central Coast \u00b7 Cessnock \u00b7 Clarence Valley \u00b7 Coffs Harbour \u00b7 Eurobodalla \u00b7 Glen Innes Severn \u00b7 Greater Hume \u00b7 Gwydir \u00b7 Hawkesbury \u00b7 Inverell \u00b7 Kempsey \u00b7 Ku-ring-gai \u00b7 Kyogle \u00b7 Lake Macquarie \u00b7 Lismore \u00b7 Lithgow \u00b7 Mid Coast \u00b7 Mid-Western \u00b7 Muswellbrook \u00b7 Nambucca \u00b7 Narrabri \u00b7 Oberon \u00b7 Penrith \u00b7 Port Macquarie-Hastings \u00b7 Queanbeyan-Palerang \u00b7 Richmond Valley \u00b7 Shoalhaven \u00b7 Singleton \u00b7 Snowy Monaro \u00b7 Snowy Valleys \u00b7 Sutherland \u00b7 Tamworth \u00b7 Tenterfield \u00b7 Tweed \u00b7 Upper Hunter \u00b7 Upper Lachlan \u00b7 Uralla \u00b7 Walcha \u00b7 Wingecarribee \u00b7 Wollondilly Victoria \u00b7 East Gippsland \u00b7 Towong The government has suspended Centrelink\u2019s welfare debt recovery operations and mutual obligation requirements for jobseekers living in bushfire-affected areas. It should allay fears that people receiving benefits, including potentially volunteer firefighters, could have their payments suspended during the crisis. Scott Morrison said the suspension will be in place for two months before it is reviewed. The same arrangements will be in place for the Australian Taxation Office. As Amy has noted, the government will also establish 20 Services Australia (Centrelink and Medicare) pop-up shopfronts, which will be welcome news for those in fire-affected communities that have had difficulties today. Stuart Cameron, who has been evacuated to Bega after fire threatened his family home near Bermagui, told the Guardian on Monday some stranded locals had gathered outside the Centrelink this morning frustrated that it was closed. \u201c... in just a couple of minutes there two women arrived saying that they had been seeking to apply for the crisis payment and had been directed to the office from the evacuation centre,\u201d he said. And on the immediate priorities of the new National Disaster Recovery Agency: Build on the effective working relationships with state, territory and local governments, including their recovery and reconstruction bodies, and to work with stakeholders in bushfire-affected communities and relevant commonwealth agencies to inform and integrate recovery and rebuild activities. Ensuring affected communities have ready access to meaningful support and all available services. Providing advice and recommendations to government on the economic and social impacts of bushfire on affected communities, in consultation with relevant agencies across all levels of government. Developing and coordinating the delivery of a long-term plan for the recovery, rebuild and resilience of bushfire-affected communities. Stuart Robert, the minister for government services, has provided an update on what Services Australia has been doing: Services Australia staff will join Australian Defence Force personnel heading into bushfire-affected areas as part of an all of federal government effort. At least 20 mobile service teams will deploy into affected regions in New South Wales\u2019 south coast and Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland to offer on-the-ground assistance. Two mobile service centres will also deploy to these regions. The fastest way to claim disaster payments is to call 180 22 66. Over $26m has already been provided in Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments (AGDRP) and Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA) in declared Local Government Areas. Nearly 22,000 claims have been processed since 16 September 2019. We are going to be hearing this line a lot from the government. Scott Morrison: I can tell you that because of the strong financial management of this government, it has put us in a position to do that [recovery fund] without having to strike a levy, without having to make offsets in other places that can put the bottom line to work that we have sought to build the financial resilience of this country. The first year we have returned the budget to the position of strength. That can be put straight into work to meet Australians\u2019 needs and that our of need. The government has made much of its surplus \u2013 last year there was the \u201cback in the black\u201d campaign that ran immediately after the budget was delivered in April, as well as the \u201cwe brought the budget back to surplus next year\u201d line Morrison deployed during the election debates. It has also consistently pointed to what it has said was Labor\u2019s mismanagement of the economy last time it was in government, while ignoring the impact of the global financial crisis, which happened during that time. Both Morrison and the treasurer have been particularly critical of Wayne Swan not delivering his promised surpluses and bring it up constantly in political attack. So this pivot is very interesting. As is this line from Josh Frydenberg: We have consistently been saying that a surplus is never an end in itself. So now that the budget is unlikely to be in surplus (it had already been downgraded by about $21bn over the forwards and cut about $2bn to just $5bn for this year) the line has switched to: we can respond to these disasters because of the budget position. Not that politics is important right now, but it should be noted. The prime minister deflects a question on why he signed off on the defence minister Linda Reynolds\u2019 leave, and why she said she wasn\u2019t on leave yesterday, when she was. Asked about Julie Bishop\u2019s comments about Australia needing to take a lead in climate policy, Scott Morrison again says his government won\u2019t be changing its emission reduction policy: Right now, I have to say, my absolute focus is on deploying the $2bn to communities around the country and addressing immediate needs and infrastructure to provide the platform for recovery for these communities. Personally, physically, their livelihoods, their communities and getting them back on track, and that will take considerable effort to get to that point, and that would be the absolute focus across every single minister, every single department brought together through a whole of government response. ... What I am saying is that is what the government focus is. I have said on numerous occasions the government will continue to work to meet and beat the commitments we have made for emission reductions, as we will this year, and as I believe with the policies we continued to put in place by 2030 to make that commitment that I was pleased to be part of a cabinet with Julie and put in place the mechanisms to achieve it. Of that additional $2bn in disaster recovery funding, Josh Frydenberg says that $500m will be in the 2020 calendar year. Scott Morrison has already ruled out a bushfire levy (he did that yesterday). Given the election rhetoric over the surplus (which is being walked back now), Morrison is asked whether he can guarantee there will not be cuts to other areas to pay for this. Morrison: What I envisage is guaranteeing to the Australian people at this time of crisis that we will meet every cost that needs to be met, make every investment to assist this crisis and the recovery needs that follow. That is clearly the priority now, and the point I would make ... is the reason we are in a position to do this is we have been so careful with our financial management. You strengthen your financial benefit to build the resilience to deal with these types of crisis that can often be unforeseen and that strength enable us to make the commitment we now making. Scott Morrison is lowering expectations here, in terms of Australia\u2019s budget position over the forwards: The fires are still burning and they will be burning for months to come. That is why I outlined today that this is an initial and additional investment of $2bn. If more is needed and the cost is higher that will be provided. But I give you that reference point, that over six years, and that was the category A, B and C payments, it was a cost of some of $5.6bn over six years to respond to the Brisbane floods. What we\u2019re seeing is the comparative figure to the $2bn here is during that emergency there was around about $365m, which was in the order of category D assistance, that was provided in response to that. Asked if the Morrison government will still be able to deliver a surplus, the prime minister says: The surplus is of no focus for me whatsoever. What matters to me is the human cost and meeting whatever cost we need to meet. I can tell you this: being in the position of strength we are in now enables us to give what is one of the most ... significant, if not the most significant response to a crisis of this kind the country has seen. If I go back over most recent times, we saw at Mallacoota one of the biggest evacuations using military resources that this country has ever seen. The only one that would have been bigger would have been Cyclone Tracy all those years ago. I should stress that these funds that we are putting as part of this effort are separate to the ongoing support of those defence operations and many other government activities that are funded through the budget. And I suspect they will also face higher costs and they will be reflected in the estimates variations that flow through the budget in May. It will be totalled up and reconciled than. The Australian Taxation Office will defer debt payments for at least two months. You can call 1800 806 218 if you need help with that. At least 6,000 insurance claims have been made so far, totalling nearly $400m. Insurance assessment and recovery specialists are being sent out, where it is safe. Josh Frydenberg will meet with the insurance council, regulators and banking CEOs to \u201csee what can be done to get that money back into people\u2019s pockets as quickly as possible\u201d. When it comes to the banks, they have also taken steps to assist those who are in the fire-affected areas \u2013 loan and interest payment deferrals, additional finance to help cover cashflow shortages, waiving fees and charges \u2013 so the banks will continue to take action to support those communities. 100 veterinarians are headed into the fire zone to help with wildlife and livestock. Sugar Pine Walk in Bago state forest is \u201calmost totally destroyed\u201d, says Michael McCormack. In terms of the additional defence deployment: 497 Australian army reservists have been called out so far. New Zealand is sending three helicopters and an engineering team. Singapore has sent two Chinooks, which are on their way to East Sale in Victoria. There was a lot in that announcement. A few quick takeaways: $2bn disaster recovery fund on top of current disaster payments. The states will not have to match the funding, but will complement it. 20 Service Australia pop-ups to help with accessing payments and resources. Debt recovery (what is left of robodebt) to be suspended for two months in fire zones. Producer grants for restocking and fences. Small business grants. Mental health support. Direct branch of government to aid with rebuilding works. Scott Morrison: Today\u2019s cabinet was one of great resolve. It was one where we stood together and said, whatever it takes, whatever it costs, we will ensure the resilience and future of this country and we will do it by investing in the work that needs to be done and we will do it by investing in the greatest asset it has ever had and it is its people, Australians. We will be investing in them and their future to give them the support they need as we all work together to rebuild after these terrible disasters. Scott Morrison: I have been in so many of these communities over many months now and it is not just the disastrous impact of the fire on the physical buildings and the physical communities and people\u2019s physical well-being but the mental impact, the mental health impact on what has occurred is going to take a big toll and we are prioritising the provisional mental health support. There will also be funding for infrastructure projects support economic community recovery and resilience, particularly essential infrastructure. Scott Morrison: The recovery agency and this funding is in addition to the category A, B and C assistance which is provided. To give you an idea of the scale of that, when it came to the Brisbane floods over a period of some six years, there was $5.6bn paid out in disaster recovery arrangements. The overwhelming majority was actually for A, B and C payments. $365m in the category of the assistance of things like the river wall that was reconstructed and the commitment made to that infrastructure. The $2bn commitment is in addition, an additional cost, and initial commitment, and if further funds are required, further funds will be provided. What we are focusing on here is the human cost and the rebuilding cost for people\u2019s lives. We\u2019re focused on the financial cost, where focus on the human costs and ensuring we can do everything we can, as quickly as we can, to support that recovery effort. Scott Morrison has made his first major announcement today: the Andrew Colvin-led National Bushfire Recovery Agency will oversee a $2bn fund (funding over the next two years). Michael McCormack looks like he is reading Scott Morrison\u2019s notes over his shoulder. Scott Morrison: Today in cabinet we have made a number of decisions to support that recovery effort, to do whatever it takes, to do whatever it costs to make those needs to build our resilience for the future and to enable Australians, wherever they are across the country, to be able to go forward in confidence for their futures. We have an Auslan translator as well. Finally. The prime minister is giving a national update on the situation. It\u2019s what we have heard so far, individually from the states \u2013 but this is what people have been wanting \u2013 a national response and overview of what is happening. It\u2019s taken way too many weeks, but looks like we have got there. It\u2019s Scott Morrison, Michael McCormack and Josh Frydenberg. Morrison begins with an update on the number of deaths. The death toll stands at 24. For all of those who have lost loved ones, for all of those who have lost everything, their homes, their livelihoods, once again as a government and as a nation we extend our deepest sympathies to you, and we make this commitment to all Australians, that that we will be there for you during this immediate response, and we will be there for the rebuilding and the recovery. The press conference Scott Morrison has called is about the National Disaster Recovery Agency \u2013 how much the initial funding will be, that sort of thing. It should be in the next few minutes. GoFundMe has provided a fundraising update: Since the New Year\u2019s Eve fires: $5m has been raised on GoFundMe to support communities, victims, wildlife and firefighters. Over 90,000 donations have been made. 1,600 GoFundMe pages have been launched. Australians from every state and territory have donated. The world is taking notice with donors from over 80 countries including the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, France, Italy, Netherlands, Japan, Spain and more. Nicola Britton, the regional manager for the site, says: Our team of Trust and Safety experts continue to work around the clock to implement GoFundMe crisis management protocols. This means they are monitoring the bushfires closely, vetting all funds and working alongside campaign organisers to ensure donations, small and large, reach the right place. We have updated the \u2018how big are these fires\u2019 interactive again: There are a lot of images going around. Kevin Rudd has written a piece on how he sees the government\u2019s response: So why does Abbott do it? The truth is he doesn\u2019t give a damn about policy. Abbott has always been 100% politics. He\u2019s always seen climate as the perfect political wedge against Labor among working families, deploying fear campaigns based on wildly exaggerated projections about jobs and the cost of living. He\u2019s done the same internally, using it to divide and conquer his moderate opponents in the Liberal party. Pretty tawdry when now we see half the country going up in smoke! But here\u2019s the rub. The Abbott denialist cult has taken over the entire Coalition. It continues under Morrison and, when they oust him soon, it will continue under Peter Dutton. It\u2019s become the battle cry of the far right which now runs the entire conservative show in Canberra. Of the 300 people who registered to leave Mallacoota yesterday, and have been delayed by the smoke, Lisa Neville says: The smoke has come in. We have established another set of community meetings. We need to consult with people if they want to go on the ship now or wait for the smoke to clear and that could take a couple of days. There could be others who put their hand up, given the smoke conditions, and want to go on the boat as well. So we\u2019ll be in a better position later today to know whether people use the ship to get out or are waiting. Overall we thought there would be 800 people who did not want to leave. This is changing the longer people are in that position. Daniel Andrews on what can be done to help, once this is over (which won\u2019t be for a while): The PM has talked about trying to supplement people\u2019s incomes, trying to support small businesses. Tourism is a large part of the economic activity across many of these regions. Agriculture, primary production. There are many different sectors that are the lifeblood of some of these fire-affected communities. I think we can get a pretty seamless approach to this. We\u2019ll do our part. The commonwealth have laid out a plan to do more themselves. Between our government and the commonwealth government and local councils, I think we can get economic stimulus and real drive into the local communities and do the physical rebuilding. That will be very, very important. Whilst it\u2019s not appropriate for tourists to go to the fire-affected communities now, there will be a time when we\u2019ll be urging people instead of taking a trip elsewhere to get into a fire-affected community and spend some of your hard-earned money there. That may be worth an enormous amount to those communities. That will be later on. We will hear from Scott Morrison at 2pm. Daniel Andrews again stresses that Victoria cannot take any goods or food for donations \u2013 and in fact this is now causing issues. We don\u2019t mean to cause offence but now is the time we don\u2019t need more food, we don\u2019t need more clothing, we have enough of that. We have so much of it, so generous of people, that it\u2019s causing a big logistics challenge, trucks on the road, staff being diverted from other important activities. The best thing to do, Google the Victorian Bushfire Appeal and give money, whether it be $1 or more, every donation helps. Every single cent gets on to families who need that sort of support. I don\u2019t want to appear blunt. We know where it comes from. These donations come from great kindnesses, but it\u2019s now causing issues, and money is the best thing from our point of view. Lisa Neville: As we see this rain today, that has good and bad, bad for firefighters and good for just a sense of relief. It is not a sign. It is not a time to now become complacent. It is only January 6. We have significant fires in the landscape. We\u2019ve got other parts of the state drying out as we speak. So this is an opportunity for people to remain focused, listen to messages, listen to warnings. Whether you\u2019re in those fire-affected areas or in other areas that could get impacted as the state continues to dry out, I know this is really hard and I know it\u2019s taking a massive toll on communities affected. People have been living with this for weeks now. Particularly the last week has been exceptionally difficult. Again, our role, my role, my prime role here is to keep you safe, to make sure we\u2019re taking the burden off you as much as we can. The Victorian police and emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, is also providing an update on the evacuations \u2013 and when people can get back to their communities to see what is left: This morning I have approved the removal of the evacuation order in order to get people home where that is possible. Again I would say to people in doing this, please be careful. But also please be aware, very aware, that it is likely, very likely, that later in this week that such an order will be issued again, depending on the forecast. At this stage the Thursday, Friday do look like fire spike days. If necessary, I will reissue that order. But I\u2019m very aware that there are some communities which weren\u2019t impacted over the weekend and where people want to get back to their own homes, their own beds. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve lifted this order. The disaster declaration remains in place until Thursday. It is only the evacuation order that has been lifted. Victorian emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp gives more of an update: We have 27 going fires and 16 watch and act warnings out there. The fact we\u2019ve been able to pull back from the emergency warnings to watch and acts reflects the suppressed fire behaviour we\u2019re seeing at the moment. I say suppressed because it\u2019s not gone away. It is there waiting for the next hot day, the next strong wind, whether that\u2019s the northerlies or the southerlies. We know these fires will become dynamic and dangerous again. The message is very much about people needing to stay aware of their local conditions. There are still four people missing in Victoria. Two hundred homes have been destroyed (a number expected to rise by at least 100). The agency will be permanent, Daniel Andrews says. Because the future means it will have to be. Because we\u2019re going to see longer fire seasons and we are going to see \u2013 we should just be honest about the fact we\u2019re going to see more and more fires, more and more damage as each fire season comes. To have that standing capacity, the important expertise and have that there at a moment\u2019s notice I think is a wise investment on our part. Daniel Andrews has announced a new agency, dedicated to the bushfire recovery, with a $50m initial allocation. Given we\u2019ve got so much damage so early on in the fire season, I don\u2019t want [emergency commissioner] Andrew Crisp and the work he\u2019s doing, the superb work he\u2019s doing and all of our fire agencies, they\u2019ve got a big job to keep us safe from active fires. I don\u2019t think they can turn their mind to recovery. They have to continue to do the work they\u2019ve been doing so well. It\u2019s my judgment and the judgment of Cabinet and decided to establish Bushfire Recovery Victoria. It will coordinate all government efforts to make sure that we [work] with local communities every step of the way. Not just for weeks and months, but it can be years before communities properly recover from such devastating bushfire. It will be headed by former Victorian police commissioner, Ken Lay. The Mallacoota evacuation has been delayed by the smoke haze, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says. There were 300 people who were due to be airlifted today, which has been pushed back. Andrews also says a fire truck overturned yesterday, but there were no injuries. While the smoke is good for fire in terms of keeping some of the temperatures down, it makes access by the air much more challenging. The rainfall is good in some parts but it can make things particularly dangerous. We had a forest fire management vehicle tip over yesterday. No one was injured I\u2019m pleased to say. It gives you a sense of how complex this task is. Ever-changing and lots of different challenges. I think we\u2019re equal to it and I\u2019ll take this opportunity again to thank everybody out there playing their part. Great team effort. Hazard reduction burning is still dominating the \u201cwhat happened\u201d and \u201cwhat can we do in the future\u201d conversations. This is despite countless experts and fire and emergency commissioners saying they did what they could, but the window to carry it out has been rapidly shrinking. The Victorian premier was asked about it this morning on Melbourne radio 3AW, AAP reports: You can only put fire into the landscape when it is safe to do so. You have to [burn] the hectares the climate allows you to do,\u201d Daniel Andrews said. Not just some broad hectare count to make you feel good, you have to be really careful.\u201d How long it takes the more than 7m hectares of land which has burned so far, to recover will depend on what happens next with the drought. CSIRO principal research scientist Andrew Sullivan spoke to AAP: \u201cWithin 12 months you will find most areas covered in a green sheen, in new spouts and coverage. \u201cIf you continue to go into drought, the response of the trees is going to be affected. If you get some good rain \u2026 the response from the native vegetation is that much better.\u201d Malcolm Turnbull has been retweeting stories featuring Julie Bishop\u2019s call for global climate change leadership, where she also says Australia has no real climate policy itself. And yes, both were in government and could have done something about it. I know. An agricultural market analyst is speaking to the ABC. He estimates about 9% of the national cattle market, or about 3 million head of cattle, were situated in the firezone. The sheep flock is also extensive - about 1% or more than 8 million. There is no estimation on what has been lost so far. But it is not just the immediate losses \u2013 it\u2019s keeping those who survived, alive, with no immediate access to fodder. Richard Di Natale has compared Scott Morrison to Neville Chamberlain in a statement (Chamberlain is best known for his policy of \u201cappeasement\u201d with Hitler\u2019s government). \u201cWarships steaming in to evacuate people from our own shores is not normal. Hundreds of millions of animals killed in infernos is not normal. These fires should be a wake-up call to every single member of the political establishment in Australia: we need urgent action to address the breakdown of our climate,\u201d he said. \u201cSome political leaders rise to a crisis, while others shrink away and show themselves to be unfit for the job. The prime minister is behaving like our generation\u2019s Neville Chamberlain instead of showing he understands the scale of the threat before us.\u201d \u201cScott Morrison needs to get his head out of the sand, accept the central role of the climate crisis in these fires and pledge that not one new coal mine will be built in this country \u2013 and that includes Adani.\u201d Russell Crowe wasn\u2019t at the Golden Globes \u2013 he is at home, in Australia, preparing for bushfires. Instead, he sent a prepared statement: \u201cMake no mistake, the tragedy in Australia is climate change-based\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way, we all have a future\u201d Ahead of the prime minister\u2019s press conference at 1 (ish) let\u2019s recap what we know: Two people are unaccounted for in NSW. No emergency level fires are burning, but several watch and act alerts remain in place for Victoria. The wet season has officially begun. Australian stars at the Golden Globes are using the opportunity to keep the world\u2019s focus on the bushfires. Looks like that cabinet meeting is getting close to breaking up, if it hasn\u2019t already. The press conference should be in about an hour. Victoria\u2019s State Control Centre says 1.25m hectares of land has been burned across the state, in its latest update. That is made up of 900,000 hectares burnt in Gippsland, 200,000 in the Hume region, and an additional 150,000 in other parts of the state. Mogo was shattered by the fires which swept through the south coast. But it hasn\u2019t lost its sense of humour. Mike Kelly, the Labor MP for Eden Monaro, spent the past few weeks helping with the evacuation of parts of his electorate. He has put together quite a comprehensive concept paper on his Facebook page. I\u2019d recommend reading it all: To deal with the climate change we cannot prevent and that is already here we must immediately begin work on the framework we need for effective mega-crisis management. It is well beyond time that some serious national strategic planning was initiated to address the extreme disaster amplification generated by climate change. The fire season has extended by 19% since the 1970s, and this in the first instance poses significant problems in accessing the air support that we often share with the northern hemisphere. This was illustrated in the current situation where early and out of season fires in California and NSW overlapped. As was set out in the policy Labor took to the 2019 election, we need to seriously expand our self-sufficiency in air firefighting capability. For the long term, this means that in acquiring future ADF air assets we need to ensure there is modularity factored in to their design to reconfigure for firebombing. Our correspondents Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin and Kate Lyons have an update on what our Pacific neighbours have offered: Australia\u2019s neighbouring countries, including New Zealand, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea, have offered support as the country continues to fight massive bushfires burning in New South Wales and Victoria. Members of the New Zealand military are en route to Australia to assist with the efforts, adding to the 157 New Zealand firefighters already deployed in Australia, some of whom have been assisting their Australian colleagues since October. New Zealand\u2019s minister of defence, Ron Mark, said more help was urgently needed because the fires showed no signs of abating and thousands of people and homes remained in harm\u2019s way. Australian and international authors have raised thousands for the fire effort today by auctioning off signed books and more under the hashtag #AuthorsForFireys. Trent Dalton, author of Boy Swallows Universe, will visit your book club and supply you with French champagne, while Hannah Kent, author of Burial Rites, will put your name into her third novel (or provide a mentoring session) to the highest charity bidder. American authors Min Jin Lee (Pachinko) and Rebecca Makkai (The Great Believers) have also pledged their support from overseas, alongside Maxine Beneba-Clarke, Tara Moss, Peter FitzSimmons and many more It\u2019s going to be months before we work out the full extent of what we have lost A few posts down, we were talking about the impact the fires have had on livestock and animals. AAP has an update from Bridget McKenzie on that: Army reservists will help bury more than one hundred thousand sheep and cattle killed in the bushfires. Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie confirmed defence personnel would dig the pits to dispose of dead livestock in over coming days and weeks. \u201cBearing in mind, though, it\u2019s about getting access to those still live fire grounds,\u201d she told the ABC on Monday. \u201cWhere it\u2019s safe to do so we need to be getting in within a week, ideally, to really be dealing with the carcasses in an appropriate way.\u201d The situation in Victoria is not as bad as it was in the past few days, but it is not great either The two men who died in the Kangaroo Island fire have been named. Dr Clayton Lang and his dad, Dick. There is a small bushfire in Canberra - on Hospital Hill, Boboyan Road, Booth. Authorities say it is controllable and no homes are under threat. We are waiting for the cabinet meeting to wrap up, after which, Scott Morrison will provide an update on the national disaster recovery agency. The mayor of the Inner West Council is calling together representatives of Sydney Councils to work on \u201ca coordinated response to help councils and shires in affected areas recover from the disaster\u201d for January 13. Mayor Darcy Byrne: \u201cAt this moment of national emergency all of us must contribute to the effort. In particular the city must offer a helping hand to the bush. \u201cMayors, councillors and local citizens in affected communities have been showing real leadership during this crisis. We are ready to support their work and to stand in solidarity with their communities.\u201d Good morning from Bega. I\u2019m out the front of the evacuation centre at the local Showgrounds. I was inside, but we were kicked out by a government official running the centre. I know she was in charge because she showed me her bib saying \u2018manager\u2019. Before that though there was a good many people who were very keen to chat. The Showgrounds are still packed despite the rain that\u2019s been falling here since this morning. At this point, a lot of them simply don\u2019t have anywhere else to go. Further south this morning the road into Eden opened, then closed, then opened again as residents rushed to get home and see what had happened. A navy ship sits docked off shore apparently filled with supplies, though no one I spoke to seemed to know when they might arrive. There were some navy personnel busily arranging for media to go on board the ship, though why remains a mystery to me. An #ozfireartauction has also been set up - with artists donating their pieces to the cause. #giveitupforthefiries is also taking hold - people making donations based on the cost of a luxury - coffee, chocolate, takeaway - they plan on giving up. There is also this fundraiser - if you follow the hashtag, you\u2019ll see what some of your favourite Australian authors are offering up. For example, Trent Dalton (who is one of the nicest people you\u2019ll ever meet) In South Australia, the Ravine fire on Kangaroo Island is still burning. People are not allowed back to check the damage as yet. Woolworths has updated its store closures for the south coast - almost all have been reopened and more supplies are coming. Just a reminder, if you want to help fire victims in Victoria, they can\u2019t handle goods at the moment - there is nowhere to store it. If you want to help in Victoria, they recommend the Bushfire appeal NSW authorities are working on \u201cturbo charging\u201d the recovery response today, with cooler conditions giving them a chance to get into areas they have been unable to reach and assess. Here is some of what they are dealing with. There are still more than 30,000 residents without power in the south coast region. That is going to remain that way for up to a week. And while we hear from our politicians that there has never been any debate about climate change\u2019s impact on worsening disasters, a reminder, or if you missed it, of Craig Kelly\u2019s contribution while speaking to the BBC on Saturday. Kelly: Well firstly there is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment and on this our climate scientists down here have been very clear and they have said that there is no link between drought and climate change. That is not what our climate scientists have been telling us. That\u2019s the opposite of what our climate scientists have been telling us. And the scientist he is particularly referring to, has publicly said he is being misrepresented - that they are basing their claims on a misspoken sentence. The impact the bushfire emergency is having on our First Nations people is required reading as well. From Lorena Allam: You can find more information on some of the drinking water issues in this Twitter thread. And yes, the water supply is being affected by the fires in some areas. Greg Mullins is also asked about hazard reduction burns. He says: The issue in extreme drought like this, underpinned by 20 years of reduced rainfall, so 15-25% reduction in winter rainfall which has meant our window for hazard reduction is very narrow now because it\u2019s either too wet or too dangerous to burn, reduction over decades in forestry and National Parks personnel who\u2019re out there doing the hazard reduction, so it\u2019s fallen to volunteers and we are mainly only available on weekends, so there are all these factors but it\u2019s what annoyed ex-fire chiefs, I suppose was that it was being used as an attack, the Greens are stopping burning, it\u2019s actually not true. ... With extreme dryness, everything will burn. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t put the fires out. Firefighting aircraft are not a panacea. It needs to be new thinking on how we deal with this ongoing crisis into the future. There will be planning standards, building standards, how we use federal government agencies like the ADF which we called for \u2013 we were mocked by the prime minister for asking for that some months ago. But we do need to work out how we are going to deal with this. I\u2019ve recently been in California. The best resourced firefighting place in the world really. They can\u2019t cope with the fires driven by climate change. So they are having a huge rethink about how they do it. So fuel reduction is part of the picture, but that\u2019s all. Asked about Scott Morrison\u2019s comments yesterday, claiming there has never been any dispute about the impact of climate change on natural disasters: I should stress there is no dispute in this country about the issue of climate change globally and its effect on global weather patterns and that includes how that impacts in Australia. I have to correct the record here. I\u2019ve seen a number of people suggest that somehow the government does not make this connection. The government\u2019s always made that connection. That has never been in dispute. Greg Mullins says: What a load of rubbish. So we\u2019ll meet and beat the Paris targets by using credits from the very weak Kyoto targets set for Australia and emissions under this government went up every year for five years, they\u2019ve gone down slightly this year because of the drought and less emissions in the agricultural sector, so not through government action. I worry for my grandchildren, their grandchildren. If this is how it is now, this is driven by climate change, imagine what future generations are up against and if Australia doesn\u2019t take moral leadership on this, like we did with apartheid, nuclear weapons, things that we didn\u2019t even have a 1.3% stake in, but we spoke loudly from a moral base. We can\u2019t talk to Brazil, India, China or America about their emissions, so it\u2019s about our grandkids and we need to take action and not pretend. ... If you look around the world at countries taking action, it\u2019s around energy and climate change, there are strategies to reduce emissions in every sector, there are not in Australia. Mother nature doesn\u2019t understand dodgy spread sheets so if the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and other greenhouse gases go up, it gets warmer, mother nature gets more angry and we are on the front of that right now. Greg Mullins is also very critical of the government\u2019s response to requests for more resources, before the fire season began: Look, firstly, we welcome the fact that the federal government is providing extra resources. The issue is, we were asking back in April. They sat on a business case from the current fire chiefs for nearly two years. They put in another 11m in December, late December or mid-December when there was a lot of media pressure and now there\u2019s extra money. Let\u2019s put all that aside. It\u2019s great to see the extra money, but there needs to be more consultation. What we have seen, my group and I, is that this seems to be a government that just does not like to consult. It seems to be management by news grab. The former fire chief Greg Mullins, who has been speaking out about Australia\u2019s fire preparedness since April, along with former fire and emergency commissioners from across the nation, says this is why they are concerned about what is coming: What worries former fire chiefs, current fire chiefs is that we are just coming into the time when the southern states start to burn, so they are already burning, you already have fires threatening property in Tasmania which is almost unheard of, you have got south, south-west Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales still ablaze. So, this is what we have been concerned about with climate change, simultaneous fire seasons. They used to be progressive, so we used to be able to share resources. That is why you see the US and Canadian New Zealand firefighters coming in, because it\u2019s really stretched the capabilities. The worst fires were always in February, so this might just be the beginning. Given this image is doing the rounds on social media, it is important to provide some context to it. It shows the areas which have been hit by bushfires from 5 December to 5 January - and has been compiled using data. It doesn\u2019t show all the fires burning now. Linda Reynolds denied she was on leave when asked about this yesterday. I have had a holiday with my family for a few days over Christmas, but again, I wasn\u2019t on leave. Which obviously was news to the executive, which appointed Christian Porter as acting defence minister, according to the New Daily. A watch and act alert has been issued for the Bemm River and Cann River in Victoria. NORTHERN TERRITORY * No current bushfires * Five homes confirmed destroyed ACT * No bushfires burning * Significant smoke haze from interstate blazes SOUTH AUSTRALIA * Three people dead * 25 bushfires burning * More than 200,000 hectares burned * 88 homes confirmed destroyed but number expected to rise significantly QUEENSLAND * 33 bushfires burning * 250,000 hectares burned * 45 homes confirmed destroyed WESTERN AUSTRALIA * 30 bushfires burning, one of significance * 1.5m hectares burned * One home confirmed destroyed TASMANIA * 23 bushfires burning, two of significance * 30,000 hectares burned * Two homes confirmed destroyed Here is where we are at (via AAP) across the states: NSW * 18 people dead, two missing * 136 bushfires burning, 69 uncontained * Almost 5m hectares burned * 1,482 homes confirmed destroyed but number expected to rise significantly VICTORIA * Two people dead, four missing * About 30 bushfires burning * More than 1m hectares burned * More than 110 homes or businesses confirmed destroyed but significantly more expected PNG is one of the countries which has offered defence force support. The man who wants to build the biggest coal mine in the southern hemisphere, and spent up to $80m to help the Morrison government get elected now has some thoughts on the fire crisis. In response to the radio host saying \u201cwhoever was advising the prime minister should be out of a job\u201d over the ad, and the original link to the Liberal party donations button (which was very, very quickly taken down) Anthony Albanese responds: Well, I was somewhat stunned by that, I have got to say. I asked twice for it to be checked if that was true because I just found that unfathomable on a day in which, of course, we had two deaths on Kangaroo Island. We had probably the worst day of this tragedy in terms of what was happening on KI, what was happening in East Gippsland, what was happening on the south coast, what was happening in the Monaro region around Tumbarumba, and around other areas in Snowy Mountains, and the alpine region of Victoria as well. For an ad to go up so quickly using defence force imagery with the music that was attached to it. This isn\u2019t a time for elevator music. Anyway, I\u2019m surprised that the ad is still up. I would have thought that it was appropriate it be withdrawn. But that is a decision for the prime minister, really. I have remained focused, in a positive way. Anthony Albanese has kept up his regular slot with Adelaide radio 5AA. He was asked why he has been \u201cmuted\u201d in his criticism of Scott Morrison and his handling of the fire crisis: Well, my focus has been on the victims of this unfolding tragedy and on the communities. And I have been constructive. I haven\u2019t seen it as a time for partisan politics. And I think people draw their own conclusions as well. Everyone can have a look at the footage of the prime minister with young Zoey, the 20-year-old pregnant mum in Cobargo. And they will draw their own conclusions. ... I wrote to the prime minister calling for COAG to be convened in mid-November, which is when I think it should have been. I do think from the beginning there should have been a national response that was agreed to by the prime minister on Saturday. I do think that\u2019s why people have responded very negatively to the Liberal Party ad that was authorised by the prime minister on Saturday which even had a button on it for donations, not to the bushfire recovery, but to the Liberal party. A few more watch and acts from VicEmergency. There is a push on from social media, to compile a national map of what is needed where, as well as what is available where - for those needing accommodation, help with pets/livestock, food, water, resources, communications, access to donations etc. You can find quite a bit of information here - and add to it, if you know where people can find help. It is raining in Melbourne and the smoke is still choking the city. Health authorities are warning vulnerable people to \u201cminimise\u201d their exposure to smoke - but they\u2019re telling everyone to stay inside if you can. And just a reminder a P2 mask isn\u2019t perfect protection. And if you have a beard, you need to shave it, for the mask to have any hope of working. VicEmergency has issued a couple more watch and act alerts. The air quality in Canberra has been so bad, the emergency management department is temporarily relocating. From AAP: The department responsible for coordinating Australia\u2019s response to disasters and emergency management has closed its doors due to poor air quality. The Department of Home Affairs has told staff to stay home as thick bushfire smoke blankets Canberra. Staff have been told to stay away from Canberra headquarters for 48 hours, but some essential employees will work from other locations. The capital\u2019s air quality is the worst of any major city in the world on Monday morning, as winds carry in smoke from bushfires in NSW. The Department of Health is relocating staff in Canberra to other offices in the city due to the smoke but is otherwise operating. This week is going to be spent preparing for what could come by Friday, when the heat and fire conditions return. The loss of animal life in these fires has been absolutely staggering. Researchers estimate wildlife deaths will reach 500m. The images of farmers having to shoot their livestock in places like Batlow should haunt us all. David Littleproud said a lot of today\u2019s efforts will be focused on what to do with the animals caught in the fire crisis. \u201cWe will be trying to take pre-emptive steps today with state agencies making sure the disposal of the livestock is done quickly \u2013 there is a biosecurity risk there,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cWe have to think about our native species that have been decimated by the fires, too, in terms of our recovery.\u201d We have broken heat records \u2013 and now we have some of the coldest January days on record for part of the country. Just your semi-regular reminder that weather and climate is not the same thing. You can\u2019t look at a frozen zooper dooper and claim warming doesn\u2019t exist. You may have missed this yesterday, but Scott Morrison was asked if the government would still be committed to delivering a surplus this year, given the cost of the fire season \u2013 which is still going. He did not answer the question. There are months to go. And particularly in the southern states and speaking to Premier Hodgman, I mean in Tasmania and in Victoria, their more difficult seasons usually come later in January and in February. So there is still a long way to go. And sadly there will still be more costs that will be incurred as a result of the devastating impacts. The recovery need is going to be great. Very great and that recovery, the rebuilding will be done. It\u2019ll be done, supported by the commonwealth government, by the state governments by the local government. The commonwealth will be acting across all those tiers, providing financial support, both directly whether its primary producers, to small businesses, to local councils and others to engage in that rebuilding effort. There will be no levy because we have been assuring that we have been in a position to deal with matters such as this. And so we will be committing everything that is needed and more as it is required. Scott Morrison is in Canberra again today. There is a cabinet meeting, where the government will sign off on the national recovery agency. David Littleproud, appearing on the ABC this morning, was asked whether the government under-estimated the impact of climate change on the bushfire season. No, we didn\u2019t. I think what the former fire chiefs can take great comfort in is that the current cohort of fire commissioners were very clear to me when I first became minister around the severity of this season because of a changing climate. They were very clear on that. That\u2019s why they prepared meticulously for the season. I think we should take great pride in what they achieved in keeping many of us safe. While there have been 24 tragic lives lost and over 1600 homes lost, it would have been a lot worse if we did haven\u2019t the professional men and women keeping us safe and prepared meticulously on their advice, not on political, but expert advice.\u201d And yet we had several members of the government, including the deputy prime minister, rubbish that link as the season took hold. Members of the government \u2013 like Craig Kelly \u2013 are still rubbishing that link. In Victoria, there are still two emergency warnings \u2013 for Wangarabell, Wingan River, Wroxham and Buldah, Chandlers Creek, Club Terrace, Combienbar, Hilo Crossing, Noorinbee, Noorinbee North, Weeragua. Here is David Crowe\u2019s exchange with Scott Morrison. Crowe: You\u2019ve announced more air tankers yesterday. You announced $11m in December, but there have been calls for a long time now for more capacity with aerial firefighting and more contributions from the federal government. Why wasn\u2019t more done by the federal government sooner to put in funding ahead of the bushfire season? Have you been putting in too little, too late? Morrison: Well David I addressed this yesterday at the press conference we had yesterday. The response that we made was to provide the additional funding last year of $11m and this year of $11m. Which brought it up to the level that was being sought in those years. And in this year\u2019s budget, that will be provided again on an ongoing basis. And so after becoming prime minister they were matters we put in train with that additional funding and resource and as was noted yesterday, at 8pm the previous evening we received the request for an additional water bombing asset and we moved to provide four with an additional $20m so when you look at that over the scheme over the last couple of years and the additional resource that has been provided on top of our standing commitment of $15m, it means that the resources were delivered and now we will ensure they are there on an ongoing basis. Scott Morrison has also deflected any questions on whether or not our agencies had everything they needed in advance of the fire season. Morrison has repeatedly said the government had warnings that last year was going to be the monster season, but those fears weren\u2019t realised. We have it now, obviously \u2013 but we knew it was coming. It is also worth noting that the government has shown no indication it is open to shifting its position on emission reduction policies. In fact \u2013 just the opposite. Scott Morrison has repeatedly said the government will not be changing its policy and continues to parrot the line we will \u201cmeet and beat\u201d the Paris target. If you haven\u2019t read this, I recommend it. Phil Coorey, the Australian Financial Review political editor, on what happened when the south coast was told to evacuate \u2013 and what became important. You may remember that Scott Morrison was asked yesterday if Australia would advocate for better global climate change action with allies like the US yesterday. Here was his response: I should stress that there is no dispute in this country about the issue of climate change globally, and its effect on global weather patterns, and that includes how that impacts in Australia. Because I have to correct the record here. I have seen a number of people suggest that somehow the government does not make this connection. The government I lead has always made that connection and that has never been in dispute. What we are focused on is what our response is and we set that out very clearly and that response, as it always has, will continue to be upgraded to ensure we meet and beat the commitments that we have made. Now, I participate in these discussions globally all the time and if you look actually at what is occurring in the United States and you look what their emissions trajectory is currently, you will note that it is not increasing, as I am advised, and whether that is done and it is achieved in isolation as an individual country or how they choose to engage in an international agreement is ultimately a matter for sovereign governments to determine. Julie Bishop saved her best line for last, with some advice for her former colleagues. Australia is a highly developed country. We should be showing leadership on the issue of climate change. I attended a number of international conferences and countries do look to Australia for direction for guidance and leadership. And I believe we should be showing leadership on the issue of climate change \u2026 At the international conferences, Australia should be putting forward a cogent, coherent case for energy policy. We don\u2019t have a national energy policy in this country and a national approach to climate change so we are part of a global effort. If a country like Australia fails to show leadership, we can hardly blame other nations for not likewise showing leadership in this area. Karl Stefanovic went on about hazard reduction burns and the \u201chuge issue there ... a massive issue that\u2019s bigger than anything Scott Morrison has done wrong\u201d \u2013 because he\u2019s an expert, obviously. I refer you, again, to this: A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, has written that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning. But as well as climate change narrowing the window to carry out prescribed burning, Mullins said some fires have become so intense they have burned through areas that had been subject to hazard reduction. Mullins has been fighting fires in NSW for months. Speaking to the ABC on Friday, he said he witnessed a fire in Grafton in an area that had burned only two weeks previously, but \u201cthe burnt leaves were burning again\u201d. He said: \u201cThere has been lots of hazard reductions done over the years \u2013 more by national parks than previous years \u2013 but the fires have burned through those hazard reduction areas.\u201d Julie Bishop popped up on the Nine Network\u2019s Today show. She was, of course, asked about Scott Morrison\u2019s leadership and response in the fire crisis. \u201cI think Scott Morrison is doing the best he can,\u201d she said, before going on to describe the \u201cnational crisis\u201d. Linda Reynolds was asked about her holiday in yesterday\u2019s press conference. Here is how that exchange, with Samantha Maiden, went down: Maiden: The prime minister has obviously copped a bit of belting for going to Hawaii during the bushfire crisis. Minister Reynolds, have you taken any leave during this period? Have you been out of the country at all? Reynolds: Like many of my colleagues, I have certainly spent time with my family over Christmas. But throughout that time I can assure you that I have been regularly on the phone with the CDF, with the prime minister, with Minister Littleproud, constantly. So ... Maiden: So you haven\u2019t been out of the country? Reynolds: I have had a holiday with my family for a few days over Christmas, but again, I wasn\u2019t on leave. Maiden: Was that in Bali? Reynolds: Yes I was. Maiden: Were you on holidays in Bali? Reynolds: I spent a few days with my family, yes. But again, I was in total contact with the prime minister and the secretary and the CDF. Samantha Maiden at the New Daily reports that the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, went on holiday in Bali with her family after Scott Morrison was forced to return from Hawaii. Maiden reports the prime minister approved Reynolds\u2019 leave from 28 December. She was away as the navy was called in to evacuate Mallacoota after residents were forced to shelter on the beach. From Maiden\u2019s report: Defence Minister Linda Reynolds has confirmed she holidayed in Bali while Australia burned for six nights, including during the Navy\u2019s dramatic evacuation of Mallacoota last week. The Prime Minister personally approved Senator Reynolds\u2019 Bali break, which was planned to run eight nights from December 28 to January 5 as bushfires raged across the country. There is good news for Canberra residents as well \u2013 you can actually see the sky today. The smoke pollution which has covered the city for the past few days (with a slight reprieve on Saturday) has cleared but it will be back when the bushfires flare up again. Given that this KEEPS coming up, Graham Readfearn has taken another look at it. The focus today, the NSW authorities said, will be on \u201cturbocharging\u201d the recovery effort. That includes getting fuel and food back to the NSW south coast and southern highlands communities which have been cut off. Power is likely to be out for a few more days but authorities are also working on getting communications up and running. There is no update on the number of homes which have been destroyed as yet. There are 54 uncontained fires burning in NSW, but the RFS has no emergency alert level fires as yet. There are still 2,500 firefighters on the ground, working on containment lines. Some 4.9m hectares have been burnt across NSW. Shane Fitzsimmons says that number will grow: Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it will be too long before we are up over 5m hectares of largely forestry country, burning along the Great Dividing Range from the Queensland border to the Victorian border. Gladys Berejiklian has begun her briefing. She says two people in a remote part of the fire zone are missing. There is no room for complacency, especially given we have over 130 fires burning across the state still. We can assume conditions will not worsen from what we have today until at least Friday or Saturday. Certainly, we don\u2019t intend for them to be as bad as what conditions were just prior to New Year\u2019s Eve. Unfortunately, overnight, it has become apparent we have two people unaccounted for in New South Wales. I hope that ends in good news but currently in remote parts of far New South Wales there are two people unaccounted for. We hope that ends in good news. At this stage, we can\u2019t account for their safety. Helen Davidson wrote about what she saw at the weekend on the NSW south coast: Strike teams rushed to Milton and St Georges Basin where there were a few nursing homes which they weren\u2019t sure had been evacuated. A short time later a fire and rescue strike team was told it was going to Kangaroo Valley. There were intakes of breath. Kangaroo Valley was later reported to be under serious threat. Not everyone in those communities had left. At Nowra one firefighter explained the strategy: we can\u2019t stop the fire, so we\u2019re just trying to direct it as best we can. Strike teams were sent across the state on Saturday, moved around like chess pieces against an opponent that ignores all the rules. Gladys Berejiklian and Shane Fitzsimmons are about to give their morning briefing. We\u2019ll bring you that in the next few minutes, hopefully. Australia has had another offer of help. Good morning. You have Amy Remeikis with you this morning as we enter another day in the bushfire emergency. But we have good news for you today \u2013 conditions in those bad bushfire zones have eased with some much needed and welcome rain, thanks to a couple of developing lows, including one off the Western Australian coast. It\u2019s not over, not by a long shot, but it takes some of the pressure off fire crews, who can use the reprieve to rest, change shifts and try to get a little ahead of the fire\u2019s path. Scott Morrison is still under pressure though. He has been on the back foot since coming back from Hawaii and is still trying to find his balance. We\u2019ll see what happens today.",

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He said Johnson must argue that Trump\u2019s policy on Iran needed to be \u201can awful lot clearer strategically in protecting people\u201d.</p> \n<p>His comments came as the wife of a British-Iranian engineer in prison in Tehran told how she feared for his safety in the wake of Suleimani\u2019s assasination and pleaded with Johnson to redouble his efforts to help negotiate the release of her husband.</p> \n<p>Sherry Izadi said her husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/shelly-izadi-wife-of-man-anousheh-ashoori-jailed-in-iran-calls-for-special-uk-envoy-for-hostages\">Anoosheh Ashoori</a>, who was jailed for 10 years in August on disputed espionage charges, and other dual nationals being held in prison had previously been threatened by guards who said they would machine-gun them.</p> \n<p>Izadi spoke to her 65-year-old husband, who is also held in Evin prison, on Sunday morning and said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d by reports of two British warships being sent to the region.</p> \n<p>Asked if she had a message for the prime minister, Izadi told Sky News: \u201cI would like to tell him to please do everything possible to get him out, especially in view of the recent situation because sometimes \u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel safe where they are.</p> \n<p>\u201cA couple of occasions, some guards had told, not just my husband, but a couple of other dual nationals, that \u2018we don\u2019t really see why they keep you alive here, you\u2019re all a bunch of spies, you\u2019re a bunch of traitors and if it were up to us, some of us, we would just take a machine gun and kill you all\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut, obviously you know, they\u2019re not allowed. But when something like this happens, when a major figure, heroic figure in Iran, like Suleimani, is killed, obviously the backlash is immediately on the people that they perceive to be sympathetic to his killers, which includes US, which includes the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I really would like the prime minister to double, to treble his efforts. Please do something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Izadi said there had yet to be any direct repercussions on her husband\u2019s treatment following Suleimani\u2019s death, but added: \u201cObviously everyone is really concerned, especially the dual nationals there because they\u2019re afraid of reprisals and we\u2019re just waiting to see how it will go.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ashoori, who had lived in the UK on and off since the age of 17, was arrested in 2017 while visiting his mother in Iran. He was convicted last year of being an Israeli spy, a claim his family have dismissed as \u201claughable\u201d.</p> \n<p>A petition set up by his wife to campaign for his release has attracted more than 50,000 signatures. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the former British foreign secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/04/jeremy-hunt-us-iran-qassem-suleimani\">Jeremy Hunt</a> said there was a risk of escalation through \u201cunintended consequences\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked on BBC One\u2019s Breakfast programme if the killing of Suleimani had been a good idea, Hunt said: \u201cOnly time will tell the answer to that question. But what we have at the moment is a very dangerous, tinderbox situation. Both sides are underestimating the strength and resolve on the other side.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThat is the real danger that we face at the moment \u2013 that risk of unintended consequences. Because neither side wants a war, I don\u2019t think there will be a war, but both sides will feel the need to retaliate when they are attacked.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was, Hunt said, \u201cvery regrettable\u201d that the UK and other European nations had not been consulted in advance about the plan. The US-Europe alliance had become \u201ca lot more tatty in recent years\u201d, in part due to disparities in defence spending, he said. </p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the American standpoint, they\u2019re asking themselves, just how relevant is Europe, because they don\u2019t think we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The husband of the jailed Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s killing of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, saying it is hard to demand Iran complies with the rule of law if its adversaries play fast and loose with the same law. Richard Ratcliffe again urged Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, to find time to meet him to discuss his wife\u2019s plight. He also said the near-collapse in relations between the west and Iran made it more difficult to convince his wife that her release from Evrin jail in Tehran may be imminent. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained since 2016 after she was arrested on espionage charges and jailed for five years. Ratcliffe, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, said his wife and other British and Americans citizens were being held as collateral and the last few day\u2019s events made it much harder to secure release any time soon. He said: \u201cWe are held by the [Revolutionary Guards] and obviously they have lost their leader. More broadly, part of our campaigning has been to call on Iran to uphold the international law and to respect UN rulings in Nazanin\u2019s case, and that gets a bit harder when international law is played fast and loose with by other parties.\u201d He said Johnson must argue that Trump\u2019s policy on Iran needed to be \u201can awful lot clearer strategically in protecting people\u201d. His comments came as the wife of a British-Iranian engineer in prison in Tehran told how she feared for his safety in the wake of Suleimani\u2019s assasination and pleaded with Johnson to redouble his efforts to help negotiate the release of her husband. Sherry Izadi said her husband, Anoosheh Ashoori, who was jailed for 10 years in August on disputed espionage charges, and other dual nationals being held in prison had previously been threatened by guards who said they would machine-gun them. Izadi spoke to her 65-year-old husband, who is also held in Evin prison, on Sunday morning and said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d by reports of two British warships being sent to the region. Asked if she had a message for the prime minister, Izadi told Sky News: \u201cI would like to tell him to please do everything possible to get him out, especially in view of the recent situation because sometimes \u2026 it doesn\u2019t feel safe where they are. \u201cA couple of occasions, some guards had told, not just my husband, but a couple of other dual nationals, that \u2018we don\u2019t really see why they keep you alive here, you\u2019re all a bunch of spies, you\u2019re a bunch of traitors and if it were up to us, some of us, we would just take a machine gun and kill you all\u2019. \u201cBut, obviously you know, they\u2019re not allowed. But when something like this happens, when a major figure, heroic figure in Iran, like Suleimani, is killed, obviously the backlash is immediately on the people that they perceive to be sympathetic to his killers, which includes US, which includes the UK. \u201cSo I really would like the prime minister to double, to treble his efforts. Please do something.\u201d Izadi said there had yet to be any direct repercussions on her husband\u2019s treatment following Suleimani\u2019s death, but added: \u201cObviously everyone is really concerned, especially the dual nationals there because they\u2019re afraid of reprisals and we\u2019re just waiting to see how it will go.\u201d Ashoori, who had lived in the UK on and off since the age of 17, was arrested in 2017 while visiting his mother in Iran. He was convicted last year of being an Israeli spy, a claim his family have dismissed as \u201claughable\u201d. A petition set up by his wife to campaign for his release has attracted more than 50,000 signatures. Meanwhile, the former British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a risk of escalation through \u201cunintended consequences\u201d. Asked on BBC One\u2019s Breakfast programme if the killing of Suleimani had been a good idea, Hunt said: \u201cOnly time will tell the answer to that question. But what we have at the moment is a very dangerous, tinderbox situation. Both sides are underestimating the strength and resolve on the other side.\u201d He added: \u201cThat is the real danger that we face at the moment \u2013 that risk of unintended consequences. Because neither side wants a war, I don\u2019t think there will be a war, but both sides will feel the need to retaliate when they are attacked.\u201d It was, Hunt said, \u201cvery regrettable\u201d that the UK and other European nations had not been consulted in advance about the plan. The US-Europe alliance had become \u201ca lot more tatty in recent years\u201d, in part due to disparities in defence spending, he said. \u201cFrom the American standpoint, they\u2019re asking themselves, just how relevant is Europe, because they don\u2019t think we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is.\u201d",

Von Der Leyen will be joined by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator for the meeting.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d was the centrepiece of his general election campaign, and his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has made clear that the government intends to use it as an opportunity for a radical shakeup of the state.</p> <p>Cummings wrote in a blog last week that he hopes to recruit a crack team of \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to No 10. He said Brexit would require \u201clarge changes in policy and in the structure of decision-making\u201d and the fact that the government had a comfortable majority meant there was \u201clittle need to worry about short-term unpopularity while trying to make rapid progress with long-term problems\u201d.</p> <p>A commission spokesman said: \u201cThis meeting is taking place at a very specific moment in the phase in which the withdrawal agreement is being ratified in the UK, it\u2019s not taking place at a point of time when the trade negotiations have started.</p> <p>\u201cThe meeting is to discuss holistically the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and to look forward to look forward to the year ahead in all of its dimensions.\u201d</p> <p>The government reconvened parliament after December\u2019s election so that the withdrawal agreement bill could pass its second reading before Christmas.</p> <p>Aside from the new Northern Ireland protocol that Johnson negotiated, the detail of the legislation was similar to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill, although a clause was added to prevent ministers extending the 31 December 2020 end date for the transition period.</p> <p>That means Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator in Brussels, David Frost, will face the challenge of securing a free trade agreement that could come into force at the end of the year, something senior Brussels figures have suggested is all but impossible.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told MEPs last month: \u201cIt is unrealistic that a global negotiation can be done in 11 months, so we can\u2019t do it all. We will do all we can to get what I call the \u2018vital minimum\u2019 to establish a relationship with the UK if that is the timescale.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson will also have to make a decision imminently about whether to open negotiations on a bilateral trade deal with the US this year, at the same time as rushing to complete an EU agreement.</p> <p>The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, is urging him to conduct the negotiations simultaneously, in the hope that this approach will give the UK greater leverage.</p> <p>The government hopes that the Brexit bill will clear its remaining Commons stages by the end of Thursday\u2019s sitting. It will then pass to the House of Lords.</p> <p>Peers inflicted a string of defeats on Theresa May\u2019s government over Brexit, but Johnson\u2019s 80-strong majority means he should be able to overturn any amendments he considers problematic when it returns to the House of Commons.</p> <p>Labour sources in the Lords are not optimistic of achieving anything but tweaks to the legislation. Nor do opposition amendments in the Commons have much hope of success. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/05/another-groundhog-year-brexit-decade-disruption-productivity\">Another groundhog year of Brexit will usher in a decade of disruption | Richard Partington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Northern Ireland parties, however, including the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and the Alliance, have made a rare agreement to table amendments jointly, calling for the government to ensure unfettered access to the British market.</p> <p>Johnson has promised that Northern Ireland businesses will face \u201cno barriers of any kind\u201d, even telling exporters during the election campaign that if they were asked to fill in any paperwork, they should contact him and he would tell them to throw them in the bin.</p> <p>A leaked government report revealed by Labour during the campaign suggests, however, that there are profound concerns about the potential economic impact of the effective border down the Irish Sea created by the new protocol.</p> <p>The Alliance MP Stephen Farry, the party\u2019s deputy leader, tweeted: \u201cWe all retain our different perspectives on the wisdom of Brexit and the Johnson deal.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will host the president of the European commission, Ursula Von Der Leyen, in Downing Street this week as he prepares to take Britain out of the EU at the end of this month, kicking off a race against time to secure a free trade deal. The prime minister will use the comfortable majority he won at last month\u2019s general election to press his Brexit bill through the House of Commons in three days when MPs return to Westminster on Tuesday. He is expected to use his meeting with Von Der Leyen to underscore the government\u2019s determination not to extend the transition period, which will mean the UK remains subject to many EU rules and structures until the end of December. Von Der Leyen will be joined by Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator for the meeting. Johnson\u2019s promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d was the centrepiece of his general election campaign, and his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has made clear that the government intends to use it as an opportunity for a radical shakeup of the state. Cummings wrote in a blog last week that he hopes to recruit a crack team of \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to No 10. He said Brexit would require \u201clarge changes in policy and in the structure of decision-making\u201d and the fact that the government had a comfortable majority meant there was \u201clittle need to worry about short-term unpopularity while trying to make rapid progress with long-term problems\u201d. A commission spokesman said: \u201cThis meeting is taking place at a very specific moment in the phase in which the withdrawal agreement is being ratified in the UK, it\u2019s not taking place at a point of time when the trade negotiations have started. \u201cThe meeting is to discuss holistically the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU and to look forward to look forward to the year ahead in all of its dimensions.\u201d The government reconvened parliament after December\u2019s election so that the withdrawal agreement bill could pass its second reading before Christmas. Aside from the new Northern Ireland protocol that Johnson negotiated, the detail of the legislation was similar to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill, although a clause was added to prevent ministers extending the 31 December 2020 end date for the transition period. That means Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator in Brussels, David Frost, will face the challenge of securing a free trade agreement that could come into force at the end of the year, something senior Brussels figures have suggested is all but impossible. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told MEPs last month: \u201cIt is unrealistic that a global negotiation can be done in 11 months, so we can\u2019t do it all. We will do all we can to get what I call the \u2018vital minimum\u2019 to establish a relationship with the UK if that is the timescale.\u201d Johnson will also have to make a decision imminently about whether to open negotiations on a bilateral trade deal with the US this year, at the same time as rushing to complete an EU agreement. The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, is urging him to conduct the negotiations simultaneously, in the hope that this approach will give the UK greater leverage. The government hopes that the Brexit bill will clear its remaining Commons stages by the end of Thursday\u2019s sitting. It will then pass to the House of Lords. Peers inflicted a string of defeats on Theresa May\u2019s government over Brexit, but Johnson\u2019s 80-strong majority means he should be able to overturn any amendments he considers problematic when it returns to the House of Commons. Labour sources in the Lords are not optimistic of achieving anything but tweaks to the legislation. Nor do opposition amendments in the Commons have much hope of success. Northern Ireland parties, however, including the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and the Alliance, have made a rare agreement to table amendments jointly, calling for the government to ensure unfettered access to the British market. Johnson has promised that Northern Ireland businesses will face \u201cno barriers of any kind\u201d, even telling exporters during the election campaign that if they were asked to fill in any paperwork, they should contact him and he would tell them to throw them in the bin. A leaked government report revealed by Labour during the campaign suggests, however, that there are profound concerns about the potential economic impact of the effective border down the Irish Sea created by the new protocol. The Alliance MP Stephen Farry, the party\u2019s deputy leader, tweeted: \u201cWe all retain our different perspectives on the wisdom of Brexit and the Johnson deal. But there is common ground on how to try to protect NI economy in the context we have been given.\u201d Johnson is unlikely to be defeated over any such amendments, but he may face political pressure to accept them given that they reflect pledges he has made publicly. Labour has warned about the threat of a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020, and is expected to table an amendment that would extend the transition period by two years if the government were to fail to reach a free trade agreement by June. Moderate Conservatives, including Philip Hammond and David Gauke, had expressed similar concerns, but they and many other dissenting voices on Brexit were swept away in the general election and replaced by Johnson loyalists.",

Wiener\u2019s piece went viral but the surge of attention came as a shock. \u201cI thought that no one in literary n+1 world would care about Silicon Valley startups, and that no one in Silicon Valley reads <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/\">n+1</a>.\u201d For years, she had documented the cultish work rituals and peculiar cultural norms of the industry, but it wasn\u2019t until Dayna Tortorici, editor of n+1, visited San Francisco that she considered synthesising those observations into a cohesive narrative. \u201cDayna has a theory that people in tech aren\u2019t used to being seen because everything is mediated,\u201d Wiener says. \u201cI wrote the piece to entertain her.\u201d</p> <p>As an editor, Tortorici had noticed an unnerving pattern: when writing about their workplaces, female contributors were often threatened for violating NDAs, whereas rarely, if ever were NDAs used against male writers.

Tortorici encouraged her to reveal more about her former bosses without worrying about reprisals. By 2018, Wiener had left her job at the software development platform GitHub after a seven-way auction to expand the original n+1 essay into a book. (And in January 2018, Universal Pictures optioned film rights; the screenplay is now in its initial development stages and Wiener is executive producer.) \u201cI very deliberately wrote this book as non-fiction and memoir,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause if I wrote it as fiction, it could be mistaken as satire.

Her mother is a writer and gun-control activist \u2013 co-founder of the nonprofit New Yorkers Against Gun Violence \u2013 and her father a former business journalist; she was exposed to feminist ideas and progressive politics at a young age. In person, Wiener is self-possessed. Apart from bitten fingernails and frank asides about therapy there are few signs of neuroses, although she says: \u201cI have very bad anxiety.\u201d Her worries around the book centre on her use of creative non-fiction techniques: the story is based on real events, but the specific timeline and characters are compressed for clarity and cohesion. She is concerned about whether people in the tech industry will understand the conventions of this approach \u2013<strong> </strong>and about possible backlash from tech executives whose public images can directly affect their companies\u2019 stock value. \u201cI sometimes have these daytime nightmares about testifying in court about creative non-fiction, where I\u2019m like, \u2018I would like to summon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/24/vivian-gornick-interview-memoirs-feminism-the-odd-woman-and-the-city\" title=\"\">Vivian Gornick</a> to the stand to explain compression,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019d like to bring in John D\u2019Agata to discuss composite characters.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cee7b231d676be7a4f345e9f45a598be666324aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cee7b231d676be7a4f345e9f45a598be666324aa/0_47_6720_4034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silicon Valley at dusk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silicon Valley \u2026 \u2018You can practically throw a spitball and hit a badly named company.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: yhelfman/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as New York City is a core character in Ben Lerner\u2019s auto-fictitious <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/04/10-04-review-ben-lerner-great-writer\" title=\"\">10:04</a></em> and various areas of California play leading roles in Joan Didion\u2019s seminal essay collection <em>The White Album</em>, both influential texts for Wiener, San Francisco and its immersive digital world are central characters in <em>Uncanny Valley</em>.

In the book, Wiener describes her workplace\u2019s blase, apolitical attitude to God mode: \u201cWe didn\u2019t think of ourselves as participating in the surveillance economy. We certainly weren\u2019t thinking about our role in facilitating and normalising the creation of unregulated, privately held databases on human behaviour.\u201d She continues: \u201cUsers might not know they were being tracked, but that was between them and our customer companies.\u201d</p> <p>While writing, Wiener studiously avoided reading books about the tech industry, and instead focused on office novels and compact memoirs, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/07/renata-adler-new-york-author-interview\" title=\"\">Renata Adler</a>\u2019s groundbreaking novel <em>Speedboat</em>, which centred on a New York journalist in the 70s; and Sarah Manguso\u2019s <em>The Guardians</em>, a memoir about mourning the death of a friend who escaped from a psychiatric hospital and jumped in front of a train. \u201cI tried to reread <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/18/ellen-ullman-computer-programmer-novelist\" title=\"\">Ellen Ullman</a>\u2019s <em>Close to the Machine</em> a little bit stoned in a hot bath \u2013 an ostensibly relaxing situation \u2013 and almost had a panic attack.

In a memorable scene, she goes out to a Japanese bar with her mostly male co-workers to celebrate their boss\u2019s birthday, conceiving of herself as the \u201cbabysitter, fifth wheel, chaperone, little sister, ball and chain, and concubine\u201d.

I don\u2019t remember if it was peanuts or candy, but I remember him very intensely crunching whatever it was. He looked up when I entered with a piercing glare as if he was cursing me under his breath. Then he said: \u201cI see Billy brought out the big guns tonight\u201d \u2013 referring to Billy Hunter, then-head of the players\u2019 union.</p> <p>Then he walked up to me, shook my hand firmly, looked me in the eyes and told me \u2013 and I <em>think</em> he was halfway joking \u2013 that I challenged him in ways that made him want to strangle me. He also said that I had been a royal pain in his \u2026 backside throughout these entire negotiations. But then he gave me a smirk and a knowing nod of respect, which was all I was going to get from him, and he walked out of the room. It was a begrudgingly given expression I\u2019d become familiar with over the years.</p> <p>See, these labor negotiations were <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/sports/blogs/ball-dont-lie/etan-thomas-considers-owners-point-view-caricature-213037888.html\">hardly the first time I challenged Stern</a> during my decade in the NBA \u2013 and anyone who knew the commissioner knew he did not particularly like to be challenged.</p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019d felt the <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/how-david-sterns-nba-dress-code-changed-mens-fashion-104719\">controversial dress code he enacted</a> following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacers%E2%80%93Pistons_brawl\">Malice in the Palace</a>, the 2005 fight between the mostly black players of the Indiana Pacers and white fans of the Detroit Pistons, was playing to an overarching societal fear of black men and I didn\u2019t shy away from discussing it. It bothered me that sports like baseball and hockey had bench-clearing brawls, but nobody was branded as a \u201cthug\u201d in response. I felt it was ridiculous to believe that by putting black athletes in suits instead of street clothes, that mainstream America\u2019s perception of us would magically change.</p> <p>\u2022 I felt the 19-year-old age limit for NBA draftees, introduced in 2005, <a href=\"https://www.slamonline.com/nba/old-enough/\">was unfairly punishing athletes in a league that\u2019s mostly black</a> as opposed to the the majority white hockey and baseball leagues where young prospects turn pro without anyone batting an eye. Let\u2019s be honest: what logical sense did it make to have no reservations in sending an 18-year-old to join the army and ship them overseas to fight in a war, but at the same time, tell them they are too young to play in the NBA?</p> <p>\u2022 I believe he never took responsibility for Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/20/craig-hodges-michael-jordan-nba-chicago-bulls\">both being whiteballed from the league</a> under his watch. I also feel he never took responsibility for allowing former LA Clippers head <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-donald-sterling-past-controversy-20140426-story.html\">Donald Sterling\u2019s well-documented racism</a> and discrimination cases during his slumlord days to go unchecked and unpunished.</p> <p>\u2022 I also <a href=\"https://www.slamonline.com/nba/etan-thomas-the-dawn-of-a-new-era/\">challenged him</a> on violating the collective bargaining rules by changing to a synthetic ball without consulting the union, and the NFL type hard cap he was inching us toward \u2013 where NBA players would become at-will employees like in the NFL.</p> <p>I could go on. And as I look back on our battles, maybe I <em>was</em> a pain in his \u2026 backside.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/23/i-was-called-the-n-word-during-my-playing-career-i-was-lucky-someone-else-heard-it\">I was called the N-word as a player. I was lucky someone heard it | Etan Thomas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I have to give credit where credit is due. Stern\u2019s legacy is that he put the right creative minds together to market the NBA and turn it into a worldwide leader in sports. An important fact to remember is that when Stern took over the reins of commissioner in 1984, the NBA finals were regularly shown on tape delay. That\u2019s only the start of what he changed.</p> <p>He instituted a plan to skyrocket the value of each NBA teams. And it worked. For example, Abe Pollin bought the Washington Wizards \u2013 then the Baltimore Bullets \u2013 for $1m. Today, the Wizards are valued at no less than $1.6bn <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/teams/washington-wizards/\">according to Forbes magazine</a>.</p> <p>Stern deftly marketed Magic Johnson and Larry Bird with brilliant narrative command \u2013 their friendship off the court, their vastly differing backgrounds \u2013 and promoted basketball as being the tie that binds. And it worked. Then he leveraged Michael Jordan and the Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics with designs on making the NBA an international phenomenon. And he did just that.</p> <p>The league as a whole became a worldwide juggernaut defined by megastars with international appeal. Today, more than a billion people across the globe tune into an NBA game every year. Much of this is again directly attributable to David Stern\u2019s vision.</p> <p>And as present-day NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who was mentored by Stern, said in a statement after his passing: \u201cBecause of David, the NBA is a truly global brand \u2013 making him not only one of the greatest sports commissioners of all time but also one of the most influential business leaders of his generation.\u201d</p> <p>All of this has resulted in players\u2019 salaries rising to staggering levels that see athletes in other sports envy-tweeting during every NBA free agency period. The NFL may have higher ratings across the United States, but the NBA is a far bigger deal abroad. This is all down to Stern. That\u2019s not an opinion, those are facts. And you can\u2019t debate facts (unless you\u2019re Fox News).</p> <p>The David Stern legacy should be examined, discussed, remembered, critiqued, and honored for years to come. But it\u2019s important to present the entire story. So to my Facebook commenters: Stern\u2019s legacy can\u2019t simply be cast aside like the objectionable odor of tyranny. Nor can he simply be seen through rose-colored glasses. But he must be remembered \u2013 and his impact will be felt for generations to come.</p>",

But then he gave me a smirk and a knowing nod of respect, which was all I was going to get from him, and he walked out of the room. It was a begrudgingly given expression I\u2019d become familiar with over the years. See, these labor negotiations were hardly the first time I challenged Stern during my decade in the NBA \u2013 and anyone who knew the commissioner knew he did not particularly like to be challenged. \u2022 I\u2019d felt the controversial dress code he enacted following the Malice in the Palace, the 2005 fight between the mostly black players of the Indiana Pacers and white fans of the Detroit Pistons, was playing to an overarching societal fear of black men and I didn\u2019t shy away from discussing it. It bothered me that sports like baseball and hockey had bench-clearing brawls, but nobody was branded as a \u201cthug\u201d in response. I felt it was ridiculous to believe that by putting black athletes in suits instead of street clothes, that mainstream America\u2019s perception of us would magically change. \u2022 I felt the 19-year-old age limit for NBA draftees, introduced in 2005, was unfairly punishing athletes in a league that\u2019s mostly black as opposed to the the majority white hockey and baseball leagues where young prospects turn pro without anyone batting an eye. Let\u2019s be honest: what logical sense did it make to have no reservations in sending an 18-year-old to join the army and ship them overseas to fight in a war, but at the same time, tell them they are too young to play in the NBA? \u2022 I believe he never took responsibility for Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges both being whiteballed from the league under his watch. I also feel he never took responsibility for allowing former LA Clippers head Donald Sterling\u2019s well-documented racism and discrimination cases during his slumlord days to go unchecked and unpunished. \u2022 I also challenged him on violating the collective bargaining rules by changing to a synthetic ball without consulting the union, and the NFL type hard cap he was inching us toward \u2013 where NBA players would become at-will employees like in the NFL. I could go on. And as I look back on our battles, maybe I was a pain in his \u2026 backside. But I have to give credit where credit is due. Stern\u2019s legacy is that he put the right creative minds together to market the NBA and turn it into a worldwide leader in sports. An important fact to remember is that when Stern took over the reins of commissioner in 1984, the NBA finals were regularly shown on tape delay. That\u2019s only the start of what he changed. He instituted a plan to skyrocket the value of each NBA teams. And it worked. For example, Abe Pollin bought the Washington Wizards \u2013 then the Baltimore Bullets \u2013 for $1m. Today, the Wizards are valued at no less than $1.6bn according to Forbes magazine. Stern deftly marketed Magic Johnson and Larry Bird with brilliant narrative command \u2013 their friendship off the court, their vastly differing backgrounds \u2013 and promoted basketball as being the tie that binds. And it worked. Then he leveraged Michael Jordan and the Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics with designs on making the NBA an international phenomenon. And he did just that. The league as a whole became a worldwide juggernaut defined by megastars with international appeal. Today, more than a billion people across the globe tune into an NBA game every year. Much of this is again directly attributable to David Stern\u2019s vision. And as present-day NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who was mentored by Stern, said in a statement after his passing: \u201cBecause of David, the NBA is a truly global brand \u2013 making him not only one of the greatest sports commissioners of all time but also one of the most influential business leaders of his generation.\u201d All of this has resulted in players\u2019 salaries rising to staggering levels that see athletes in other sports envy-tweeting during every NBA free agency period. The NFL may have higher ratings across the United States, but the NBA is a far bigger deal abroad. This is all down to Stern. That\u2019s not an opinion, those are facts. And you can\u2019t debate facts (unless you\u2019re Fox News). The David Stern legacy should be examined, discussed, remembered, critiqued, and honored for years to come. But it\u2019s important to present the entire story. So to my Facebook commenters: Stern\u2019s legacy can\u2019t simply be cast aside like the objectionable odor of tyranny. Nor can he simply be seen through rose-colored glasses. But he must be remembered \u2013 and his impact will be felt for generations to come.",

The manager boldly removed a terrorised Tyler Magloire on 30 minutes for Matheson before Wilbraham entered ahead of the second half and the striker subsequently fired in Matheson\u2019s 79th-minute cross to cancel out Miguel Almir\u00f3n\u2019s opener. Wilbraham is a 22-year, 10-club veteran who lost his mother to illness last month. Of the equaliser he said: \u201cIt meant a lot. My mum was my biggest fan. Obviously for the family and everyone at the moment it\u2019s been a hard time.

A team that had looked down and out and out of their depth gathered themselves and gave their all to get a result. But on the other side, Watford collapsed, with too many youngsters and no sense of collective responsibility. Perhaps, then, what these teams brought to the Cup was as important as what the Cup brought to them. Tranmere\u2019s Micky Mellon believed his team needed a performance to prove they were still on the up after promotion from League Two last year. For Nigel Pearson, however, there was a dispassionate analysis that said defeat was better than losing first-team players to injury. In a sense his point was proven as one rare regular, Nathaniel Chalobah, was forced off at half-time. But the jolt in Watford\u2019s momentum, not to mention a replay in Birkenhead, may come back to bother him yet. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d8ecd671468834f1861eb0bc3cd23211bf304140\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8ecd671468834f1861eb0bc3cd23211bf304140/0_0_3188_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Mullin celebrates scoring Tranmere\u2019s equaliser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Mullin celebrates scoring Tranmere\u2019s equaliser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Klein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Solskj\u00e6r shows teeth despite insipid showing</h2> <p>Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r revealed a different side of himself before and after his team\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/wolves-manchester-united-fa-cup-match-report\">trip to Molineux</a>. On Friday, he reacted to Robin van Persie\u2019s suggestion that he was too nice to manage Manchester United, wielding club legend status by reminding that he, scorer of that goal on that famous night in Barcelona and many others besides, and not the one-season wonder Dutchman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/03/solskjaer-robin-van-persie-shirt-number-smiling-manchester-united\" title=\"\">is a true keeper of the faith</a>. It was a baring of teeth that his former colleagues, including an approving Roy Keane, say he has always been capable of. And following a positive post-match verdict on another insipid performance, in which his team hung on for a replay, Solskj\u00e6r turned his attention back to Van Persie\u2019s criticisms. \u201cThere are different ways to motivate and inspire players, and I do not always believe in scaring them to play better,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, we are in 2020.\u201d<strong> John Brewin</strong></p> <h2>7) Derby too good to languish so low</h2> <p>Derby County\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/crystal-palace-derby-county-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">victory over Crystal Palace</a> was ultimately another game in which the use of VAR became the main topic of discussion. Rightly so given the potentially pivotal use of the pitchside monitor by the referee, Michael Oliver, but that should not completely take away from an assured display by Phillip Cocu\u2019s men against opponents who sit a division above them. Wayne Rooney was key to that but there were also impressive showings from others in white and black, in particular Curtis Davies and Tom Huddlestone, and watching on there came the strong sense that Derby have too much experience as well as quality to be 17th in the Championship for much longer. Derby may not reach the play-offs \u2013 they are currently eight points off Swansea in sixth \u2013 but a serious push up the table should be well within their reach. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06b0b284bf2fada712437834730d9fd997505542\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b0b284bf2fada712437834730d9fd997505542/0_120_3614_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The likes of Tom Huddleston (right) should help lift Derby up the table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The likes of Tom Huddleston (right) should help lift Derby up the table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Offside via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8) Abraham\u2019s absence exposes Chelsea\u2019s striking deficiencies</h2> <p>Chelsea\u2019s reliance on Tammy Abraham was underlined again during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/chelsea-nottingham-forest-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">their victory over Nottingham Fores</a>t. With Abraham given a welcome rest Michy Batshuayi was handed a rare start up front and Olivier Giroud was on the bench. Yet Batshuayi struggled to make an impact in general play and Giroud was an unused substitute once again. Lampard is not a fan of either forward and it would be a risk for him not to find cover for Abraham this month, especially as Giroud is desperate to leave. Aston Villa are the latest club to target the former Arsenal striker, with Internazionale, Lyon, Bordeaux and Crystal Palace also interested in striking a deal for the 33-year-old, whose lack of football this season has put his place in the France squad under threat before Euro 2020. Chelsea, who are interested in Red Bull Leipzig\u2019s Timo Werner and Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, need to find a solution quickly. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>9) Lallana has a Liverpool role to play yet</h2> <p>As Everton made desperately heavy weather of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/liverpool-everton-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">a Merseyside derby</a> that looked laid out for them to finally win at Anfield, Liverpool\u2019s oldest outfield head was a key influence in their deep disappointment. Once James Milner had departed prematurely \u2013 and worryingly for J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 Adam Lallana took Milner\u2019s armband and a leadership role he has rarely fulfilled since he gave up the captaincy of Southampton to head north. He nursed his stripling colleagues and debutant Takumi Minamino along as Everton were dominated. Injuries and the claims of other midfielders better suited to Klopp\u2019s style have restricted his impact but with injuries piling up, Lallana may yet play a role in Liverpool\u2019s path to the Premier League title. This is his sixth season at Anfield, more than likely the last, but he reminded he is someone who can be counted upon. <strong>JB</strong></p> <h2>10) Mourinho dissects video age</h2> <p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho enjoys semantics but, in distinguishing between VAR and what he calls \u201cVR\u201d, Tottenham\u2019s manager made a real, and important, distinction. After lamenting the absence of video technology at the Riverside as Middlesbrough earned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/middlesbrough-tottenham-fa-cup-third-round-match-report\">a deserved replay</a> (Mourinho believed Ashley Fletcher\u2019s goal should have been disallowed for offside) \u2013 he explained that he applauded the idea of a VAR being used to support referees\u2019 decisions. However the system he has seen in use in the Premier League this season is, in practice \u201cVR\u201d \u2013 or a dictatorial remote referee. \u201cI like VAR but I don\u2019t like VR and we have VR,\u201d said Mourinho. There was still a time for a detour into semantics, namely when he suggested Tottenham\u2019s squad was so thin and inflexible they were now condemned to \u201cplaying without a striker\u201d in Harry Kane\u2019s hamstrung absence. That may surprise both Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p>",

Rightly so given the potentially pivotal use of the pitchside monitor by the referee, Michael Oliver, but that should not completely take away from an assured display by Phillip Cocu\u2019s men against opponents who sit a division above them. Wayne Rooney was key to that but there were also impressive showings from others in white and black, in particular Curtis Davies and Tom Huddlestone, and watching on there came the strong sense that Derby have too much experience as well as quality to be 17th in the Championship for much longer. Derby may not reach the play-offs \u2013 they are currently eight points off Swansea in sixth \u2013 but a serious push up the table should be well within their reach. Sachin Nakrani 8) Abraham\u2019s absence exposes Chelsea\u2019s striking deficiencies Chelsea\u2019s reliance on Tammy Abraham was underlined again during their victory over Nottingham Forest. With Abraham given a welcome rest Michy Batshuayi was handed a rare start up front and Olivier Giroud was on the bench. Yet Batshuayi struggled to make an impact in general play and Giroud was an unused substitute once again. Lampard is not a fan of either forward and it would be a risk for him not to find cover for Abraham this month, especially as Giroud is desperate to leave. Aston Villa are the latest club to target the former Arsenal striker, with Internazionale, Lyon, Bordeaux and Crystal Palace also interested in striking a deal for the 33-year-old, whose lack of football this season has put his place in the France squad under threat before Euro 2020. Chelsea, who are interested in Red Bull Leipzig\u2019s Timo Werner and Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, need to find a solution quickly. Jacob Steinberg 9) Lallana has a Liverpool role to play yet As Everton made desperately heavy weather of a Merseyside derby that looked laid out for them to finally win at Anfield, Liverpool\u2019s oldest outfield head was a key influence in their deep disappointment. Once James Milner had departed prematurely \u2013 and worryingly for J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 Adam Lallana took Milner\u2019s armband and a leadership role he has rarely fulfilled since he gave up the captaincy of Southampton to head north. He nursed his stripling colleagues and debutant Takumi Minamino along as Everton were dominated. Injuries and the claims of other midfielders better suited to Klopp\u2019s style have restricted his impact but with injuries piling up, Lallana may yet play a role in Liverpool\u2019s path to the Premier League title. This is his sixth season at Anfield, more than likely the last, but he reminded he is someone who can be counted upon. JB 10) Mourinho dissects video age Jos\u00e9 Mourinho enjoys semantics but, in distinguishing between VAR and what he calls \u201cVR\u201d, Tottenham\u2019s manager made a real, and important, distinction. After lamenting the absence of video technology at the Riverside as Middlesbrough earned a deserved replay (Mourinho believed Ashley Fletcher\u2019s goal should have been disallowed for offside) \u2013 he explained that he applauded the idea of a VAR being used to support referees\u2019 decisions. However the system he has seen in use in the Premier League this season is, in practice \u201cVR\u201d \u2013 or a dictatorial remote referee. \u201cI like VAR but I don\u2019t like VR and we have VR,\u201d said Mourinho. There was still a time for a detour into semantics, namely when he suggested Tottenham\u2019s squad was so thin and inflexible they were now condemned to \u201cplaying without a striker\u201d in Harry Kane\u2019s hamstrung absence. That may surprise both Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min. Louise Taylor",

      "bodyText": "There has been a surge in impassioned political art since the 2016 election, from public art at the border wall with Mexico, to billboard art across all 50 states and public podiums where consumers have been invited to voice their opinions (rather than use art as a backdrop for Instagram selfies). With all eyes on this year\u2019s presidential election, it tracks that museums and galleries across America will be flooded with even more of it in the months prior. A great deal of the artwork going on view over the next 12 months will aim at raising awareness about the importance of voting. It might also sway voters towards a more sensible direction. While some exhibitions have yet to be announced, here are six that will surely make an impact, from paintings of white supremacists to resistance art, war murals and activism. Jacob Lawrence: The American Struggle The 20th-century African American artist Jacob Lawrence painted political turmoil, from the first world war to the American Revolution. He was known for depicting the lives of black Americans and his Migration Series was the first artwork by a black artist to be acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. Now, Lawrence\u2019s work is going on view at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem on 18 January (it travels next to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York). His paintings will be shown alongside young artists working today, from Derrick Adams to Hank Willis Thomas. The artist, who died in 2000, wanted to depict \u201cthe struggles of a people to create a nation and their attempt to build a democracy\u201d.

      "body": "<p><br>With the benefit of hindsight, the truly shocking thing about the end of the New England Patriots\u2019 season was when it happened. Had the Patriots lost to the Kansas City Chiefs or Baltimore Ravens later in this NFL postseason, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have felt as cataclysmic. Great teams lose to great teams. But when the Patriots fell to the relatively unheralded Tennessee Titans on Saturday, scoring a measly 13 points in the contest, it felt like football had shifted. There\u2019s a very real chance we just witnessed the end of the Patriots Dynasty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/04/tennessee-titans-new-england-patriots-playoff-score\">Tom Brady says retirement 'pretty unlikely' despite Pats' shock loss to Titans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was somewhat surreal that the Patriots were even playing on Saturday, as accustomed as they are to a first-round bye. Indeed, if there was a true turning point in the Patriots\u2019 season, a moment when it became clear that things weren\u2019t going to script for New England, it was when the lowly Miami Dolphins defeated them, at home, 27-24. That Week 17 loss knocked the Pats out of the second seed and forced them to play in the opening round of the NFL postseason for the first time since 2009.</p> <p>Still, heading into Saturday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1213680327148728320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1213680327148728320&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsnaut.com%2F2020%2F01%2Fnfl-world-reacts-to-titans-bouncing-patriots-from-playoffs-in-wild-card-round%2F\">the Patriots had gone 104 games</a> between consecutive home losses. Fans had every reason to expect that the Titans wouldn\u2019t threaten that record. Instead, the streak ended the second a desperate Tom Brady threw a game-sealing pick-six to the Titans\u2019 Logan Ryan. The Patriots defense had done its best by limiting Tennessee quarterback Ryan Tannehill to a mere 72 yards, but the offense practically vanished in the second half. Next Saturday, it will be the Titans facing the Ravens while the Patriots\u2019 look ahead to an uncertain future.</p> <p>And yes, for perhaps the first time since head coach Bill Belichick pinned his fortunes to Brady, the future does feel like a huge question mark. To start things off, there\u2019s a very real chance that Brady could leave. His contract with the Patriots is coming to an end and <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/report-tom-brady-wont-take-hometown-discount-stay-patriots\">early reports</a> suggest that the 42-year-old is less open to taking a discount to remain with the team, as he has done in the past. Combined with whispers of possible tensions between Brady and Belichick, it\u2019s entirely possible that the Patriots will be starting next year with somebody else in the sport\u2019s most important position.</p> <p>In the press conference immediately following Saturday\u2019s loss, Brady said he was not considering retirement, but he also refused to commit to anything so soon after his season came to an unexpectedly early conclusion. \u201cI love the Patriots,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2020/1/5/21050260/tom-brady-retirement-new-england-patriots-wild-card-loss\">Brady said</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest organization. Playing for Mr Kraft all these years and for Coach Belichick, there is nobody who has had a better career than me just being with them. I\u2019m very blessed and I don\u2019t know what the future looks like, and I\u2019m not going to predict it.\u201d</p> <p>Even if Brady does return to the Patriots, the team\u2019s championship window may already be firmly shut. After all, Brady is coming off a year where \u2013 maybe for the first time ever \u2013 he has <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2020/1/5/21050244/new-england-patriots-exit-interview-tom-brady\">looked old</a>. He had his lowest touchdown total since 2003 and the third-worst completion total of his career. Brady wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that, for once, the Patriots\u2019 moves to bring him talented receivers on the cheap <a href=\"https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/05/patriots-gm-bill-belichick-failed-tom-brady-offense/\">didn\u2019t pan out</a> (it turns out that Antonio Brown and Josh Gordon weren\u2019t destined to replace Rob Gronkowski).</p> <p>As a result, the Patriots were never quite as good as they appeared to be when they started out the season 8-0. For much of the season, the Patriots were able to lean on a talented defense, and exploit a relatively light schedule. Later losses to the Chiefs, Ravens and the Houston Texans revealed that they didn\u2019t quite stack up against well-constructed teams built around talented young quarterbacks. The Buffalo Bills\u2019 unexpected run to the playoffs suggested that the AFC East may soon evolve into something other than the cakewalk it has been in recent years.</p> <p>History, of course, has taught us not to completely count out the Pats, the \u201cDeath and Taxes\u201d of the NFL. It\u2019s not impossible that Brady returns to the Patriots in the offseason and has a bounce-back year. Maybe Belichick figures out a way to surround him with the right offensive weapons without weakening what should remain one of the league\u2019s best defenses. It\u2019s not out of the question for the Patriots to compete for at least one more Super Bowl. However, at the very least, the end has never looked closer.</p> <h2><strong>Quote of the week</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThere must be a winner to the game\u201d \u2013 the head referee going over<a href=\"https://twitter.com/billbarnwell/status/1213622663115096067\"> the playoff overtime rules</a> after the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Texans ended tied 19-19 at the end of regulation.</p> <p>The official was stating the obvious: there\u2019s no way for a playoff game to end in a tie.

On second and six, Houston quarterback DeShaun Watson somehow escaped a host of Bills defenders to find running back Taiwan Jones. Jones, who had a single reception on the year, picked up 34 yards and set up Houston\u2019s game-winning field goal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/04/houston-texans-buffalo-bills-playoff-score\">The Texans beat the Bills 22-19</a> and now face the Kansas City Chiefs.

It was a sign that things were not going to go as planned for New Orlean: Brees would later lose a fumble to end a promising drive in the fourth quarter. The Saints had led the NFL with the fewest turnovers allowed during the regular season but were burnt twice in crucial situations on Sunday. The Vikings ended up beating the Saints on Kirk Cousins\u2019s touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph in overtime. Brees never even got a chance to touch the ball.

      "bodyText": "With the benefit of hindsight, the truly shocking thing about the end of the New England Patriots\u2019 season was when it happened. Had the Patriots lost to the Kansas City Chiefs or Baltimore Ravens later in this NFL postseason, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have felt as cataclysmic. Great teams lose to great teams. But when the Patriots fell to the relatively unheralded Tennessee Titans on Saturday, scoring a measly 13 points in the contest, it felt like football had shifted. There\u2019s a very real chance we just witnessed the end of the Patriots Dynasty. It was somewhat surreal that the Patriots were even playing on Saturday, as accustomed as they are to a first-round bye. Indeed, if there was a true turning point in the Patriots\u2019 season, a moment when it became clear that things weren\u2019t going to script for New England, it was when the lowly Miami Dolphins defeated them, at home, 27-24. That Week 17 loss knocked the Pats out of the second seed and forced them to play in the opening round of the NFL postseason for the first time since 2009. Still, heading into Saturday, the Patriots had gone 104 games between consecutive home losses. Fans had every reason to expect that the Titans wouldn\u2019t threaten that record. Instead, the streak ended the second a desperate Tom Brady threw a game-sealing pick-six to the Titans\u2019 Logan Ryan. The Patriots defense had done its best by limiting Tennessee quarterback Ryan Tannehill to a mere 72 yards, but the offense practically vanished in the second half. Next Saturday, it will be the Titans facing the Ravens while the Patriots\u2019 look ahead to an uncertain future. And yes, for perhaps the first time since head coach Bill Belichick pinned his fortunes to Brady, the future does feel like a huge question mark. To start things off, there\u2019s a very real chance that Brady could leave. His contract with the Patriots is coming to an end and early reports suggest that the 42-year-old is less open to taking a discount to remain with the team, as he has done in the past. Combined with whispers of possible tensions between Brady and Belichick, it\u2019s entirely possible that the Patriots will be starting next year with somebody else in the sport\u2019s most important position. In the press conference immediately following Saturday\u2019s loss, Brady said he was not considering retirement, but he also refused to commit to anything so soon after his season came to an unexpectedly early conclusion. \u201cI love the Patriots,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest organization. Playing for Mr Kraft all these years and for Coach Belichick, there is nobody who has had a better career than me just being with them. I\u2019m very blessed and I don\u2019t know what the future looks like, and I\u2019m not going to predict it.\u201d Even if Brady does return to the Patriots, the team\u2019s championship window may already be firmly shut. After all, Brady is coming off a year where \u2013 maybe for the first time ever \u2013 he has looked old. He had his lowest touchdown total since 2003 and the third-worst completion total of his career. Brady wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that, for once, the Patriots\u2019 moves to bring him talented receivers on the cheap didn\u2019t pan out (it turns out that Antonio Brown and Josh Gordon weren\u2019t destined to replace Rob Gronkowski). As a result, the Patriots were never quite as good as they appeared to be when they started out the season 8-0. For much of the season, the Patriots were able to lean on a talented defense, and exploit a relatively light schedule. Later losses to the Chiefs, Ravens and the Houston Texans revealed that they didn\u2019t quite stack up against well-constructed teams built around talented young quarterbacks. The Buffalo Bills\u2019 unexpected run to the playoffs suggested that the AFC East may soon evolve into something other than the cakewalk it has been in recent years. History, of course, has taught us not to completely count out the Pats, the \u201cDeath and Taxes\u201d of the NFL. It\u2019s not impossible that Brady returns to the Patriots in the offseason and has a bounce-back year. Maybe Belichick figures out a way to surround him with the right offensive weapons without weakening what should remain one of the league\u2019s best defenses. It\u2019s not out of the question for the Patriots to compete for at least one more Super Bowl. However, at the very least, the end has never looked closer. Quote of the week \u201cThere must be a winner to the game\u201d \u2013 the head referee going over the playoff overtime rules after the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Texans ended tied 19-19 at the end of regulation. The official was stating the obvious: there\u2019s no way for a playoff game to end in a tie. But after each team\u2019s first overtime drive ended in a punt, it looked like we would be watching for a while. And then\u2026 Video of the week Given how overtime had played out to that point, maybe it was inevitable that the Texans\u2019 crucial play emerged out of what looked like a complete disaster. On second and six, Houston quarterback DeShaun Watson somehow escaped a host of Bills defenders to find running back Taiwan Jones. Jones, who had a single reception on the year, picked up 34 yards and set up Houston\u2019s game-winning field goal. The Texans beat the Bills 22-19 and now face the Kansas City Chiefs. The Bills, meanwhile, will have an entire offseason to try to figure out how they were unable to bring down Watson on that play. Stat of the week 191. That\u2019s the number of passes thrown by New Orleans Saints\u2019 quarterback Drew Brees without an interception before the one he threw to the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 Anthony Harris on Sunday. It was a sign that things were not going to go as planned for New Orlean: Brees would later lose a fumble to end a promising drive in the fourth quarter. The Saints had led the NFL with the fewest turnovers allowed during the regular season but were burnt twice in crucial situations on Sunday. The Vikings ended up beating the Saints on Kirk Cousins\u2019s touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph in overtime. Brees never even got a chance to touch the ball. The Vikings, having pulled off one upset, will have to attempt another one as they will face the well-rested San Francisco 49ers on Saturday. MVP of the week Russell Wilson, QB, Seattle Seahawks. Wilson was at his dual-threat best in the Seahawks\u2019 17-9 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, picking up 325 yards through the air and 45 yards on the ground. On top of that, Wilson threw for one of Seattle\u2019s two touchdowns, while the other was thanks to his old friend Marshawn Lynch.

The award for best drama actor to Joaquin Phoenix for his leading role in Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker, the origin-myth story of Batman\u2019s arch-villain, will be seen by many as the most deserving and even the only possible outcome. I have to reiterate my scepticism about this overblown movie and this performance, noting again that Phoenix has been more interesting elsewhere. Fan though I am of Phoenix, I think Antonio Banderas should have won for his performance in Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Pain and Glory. Taron Egerton got best musical or comedy actor for his portrayal of the young Elton John in Dexter Fletcher\u2019s Rocketman \u2013 and when the Academy Awards roll around he may well replicate the success enjoyed last year by Rami Malek for his impersonation of Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. This deja vu might make many groan, and I have to say I would have preferred to see DiCaprio get this, but Egerton\u2019s performance is game and heartfelt, and he did all his own singing. In a category that specifies \u201cmusical\u201d this is something to consider.",

As always in a third innings of this nature, the focus becomes an individual one, and today that will primarily be Joe Burns, who is on 16 not out overnight. </p> <p>When the opener posted 97 in his first innings this summer, recalled after Cam Bancroft and Marcus Harris failed to make it work during the away Ashes, there was a consensus that the game of musical chairs had finished. David Warner was effusive: he wanted Burns by his side for the long haul. But after that, his scores against Pakistan and New Zealand read 4, 9, 53, 35, 0 and 18. He got a good\u2019un in the first innings here, but that will be forgotten by the time the next Test squad is selected for Bangladesh midyear. Long story short: he really needs a score.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of goodwill towards the Queenslander, who has been treated poorly by selectors over his strange journey in and out of the national team. Remember, he made 180 in his previous Test before missing out entirely on a spot on the Ashes trip. Even if this is a relatively low-intensity hitout in pursuit of these declaration runs, everyone in and around this team want him to make it work.</p> <p>As for the Black Caps, their job is a familiar one: containment. They almost certainly won\u2019t be given a realistic chance to win this game unless they bowl Australia out in a session. And sure, they should try and do that. But if it doesn\u2019t happen - the more likely scenario - they need to suck as much time out of this game as possible then bat their way to some World Test Championship points by securing a draw. That\u2019s at least something to hold onto. Or so I\u2019ll tell myself! <br></p> <p>So, good morning to you all.

There\u2019s going to be plenty more cricket to cover over the coming weeks with ODIs, T20is and the BBL finals, so I hope you join us back here for those. And if your appetite for action today still hasn\u2019t been sated, England\u2019s push for victory over South Africa will get underway shortly. Australian captain Tim Paine was proud as punch. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky to be captain of this bunch,\u201d he says. What pleased him the most? Batting big in the first innings. \u201cWe haven\u2019t struggled to take 20 wickets in recent years but getting significant runs on the board hasn\u2019t always been possible.\u201d Paine was also pleased with the depth shown around the group, one no longer reliant on a single batsman or bowler to deliver a hot streak of form. Paine signs off by speaking thoughtfully about his team\u2019s role, and cricket in general, during the horrendous bushfire season and the difficult situation facing many Australians. Defeated Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson credits Australia for their performance throughout the series before saying it\u2019s time for his side to learn from their mistakes and regroup. \u201cWe did struggle to put them under pressure to take wickets... we weren\u2019t able to get any partnerships together to get any first-innings pressure. We got exposed in many respects against a very good side... We need to use this experience to become better individuals and a better team.\u201d Player of the match - and the series - Marnus Labuschagne \u201cIt\u2019s good to see everything come together,\u201d the run-machine says with his hands full of prizes. What made this summer so much better than previous seasons? \u201cMy level of concentration, not doing as many silly things, and you have to have a little luck too.\u201d Here\u2019s the first take on the match report... Speaking of the crowd, hundreds are now on the SCG turf, which is great to see, while the presentation dais is constructed. Australia\u2019s players are performing their media duties and wading into the crowd. Broad smiles on everyone\u2019s faces as you might expect, if not the hoopla you often find at the end of Tests. Another four day success, a clean sweep of the trans-Tasman series, Australia\u2019s superb Test summer ends on an emphatic high. This was not the prettiest victory but Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s 215 in the first-innings and Nathan Lyon\u2019s pair of five-fors were hard-earned and deserve to be cherished. Matt Henry\u2019s broken thumb is not being risked. New Zealand are all out. Impervious to the carnage unfolding around him, Watling continues his vigil, seeing off Lyon for four deliveries. Then as soon as he tries to engineer the strike for the start of the following over he sweeps straight into Pat Cummins\u2019 bread basket at square-leg. Somerville gets off the mark with an uppercut for four off Starc, then he calmly drives him square for three. Seven pretty runs but, in the circumstances, shots with a high degree of risk. You have to ask questions about what\u2019s going on in New Zealand\u2019s dressing room with the shot selection of some of their batsmen today. And then Starc executes a centimetre perfect yorker that uproots middle stump with the most satisfying sound in cricket. We\u2019ll be done tonight. 47th over: New Zealand 136-8 (Watling 19) 46th over: New Zealand 128-7 (Watling 18, Somerville 0) Nathan Lyon now has nine wickets for the match. New Zealand have another brain fade to add to their luggage on the flight home. Whaaaaaat a caaaaaaaatch from James Pattinson! Absolute shocking shot from Todd Astle, swiping Lyon across the line, sending a top edge spiralling towards midwicket. It looks to be dropping safe but Pattinson, running around from mid-on, refuses to give up the chase and makes ground, pumping his arms and legs as if his life depends on it before diving forward to hold onto a memorable catch. Very Glenn McGrath at Adelaide Oval areas. 45th over: New Zealand 127-6 (Watling 17, Astle 17) Enough of Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s legspin, time for Mitchell Starc to blow New Zealand\u2019s tail away. Not this over. After Watling rotates strike Astle is equal to the paceman\u2019s late reverse swing, drilling a couple of twos into the off-side for good measure. Both New Zealanders are now on the same score, Watling from 99 deliveries, Astle 15. Joe Harman has emailed a suggestion for what to do tomorrow. \u201cAssuming that NZ are still batting at the close of play (a big and not necessarily valid assumption) perhaps they should declare and concede the inevitable defeat AND use tomorrow (the ground\u2019s booked after all) for a bushfire fundraising one day game-grab something positive out of this debacle.\u201d 44th over: New Zealand 122-6 (Watling 16, Astle 13) Astle, apparently oblivious to de Grandhomme\u2019s dismissal, tries to loft Lyon over the infield and gets perilously close to gifting mid-on a catch. Astle, apparently oblivious to his near miss to ball three repeats the shot two deliveries later, this time skewing awkwardly towards midwicket. 43rd over: New Zealand 118-6 (Watling 16, Astle 9) Astle gets off the mark with a four swept out of the rough. Labuschagne almost exacts immediate revenge with a fizzing legspinner that whistles past the outside edge of the bat and the top of off stump. He follows that up with the full toss that Astle dispatches into the deep. The momentum is all with New Zealand at the moment. Australia are trying all sorts to force a breakthrough, Lyon bowling wide of off stump this over to induce a drive, but when he does CdG slaps him over extra cover for six! And then he\u2019s out. It\u2019s a fine line between counterattacking and reckless, and chipping Lyon to one of three men stationed around cow corner immediately after hitting a six is probably the latter. Maybe we\u2019ll be all over today after all? 42nd over: New Zealand 107-6 (Watling 14) 41st over: New Zealand 100-5 (Watling 13, de Grandhomme 46) Labuschagne is getting through the crease with plenty of energy and he\u2019s tempting New Zealand into a mishit drive, but both Watling and CdG are secure in their strokeplay. 40th over: New Zealand 97-5 (Watling 11, de Grandhomme 45) Lyon tempts CdG into a loose drive but any frustration the New Zealander may have felt following his streaky inside edge is released with a misfield allowing him to jog to the non-striker\u2019s end. Watling then drops anchor. 39th over: New Zealand 92-5 (Watling 10, de Grandhomme 44) The pattern is becoming predictable as we head towards the conclusion of play. CdG gets off strike early before Watling defends patiently. Labuschagne is unable to generate a false stroke from his latest over. 38th over: New Zealand 90-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 43) New Zealand deal comfortably with Lyon\u2019s latest over. CdG\u2019s scoring rate is now a brisk 75, Watling\u2019s a watchful 11. 37th over: New Zealand 89-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 42) It is spin from both ends, and the strategy almost works when Labuschagne rips one past CdG\u2019s wafty cover drive. Still no breakthrough though and this partnership passes 50. Just under an hour left in the day. 36th over: New Zealand 88-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 41) Labuschagne\u2019s spell lasts just one over as Lyon is recalled. CdG scuffs around for three deliveries before lofting a delivery that turns, on the up, over mid-on for four. You fancy appealing to de Grandhomme\u2019s ego might be Australia\u2019s best plan of attack right now, perhaps with spin from both ends? 35th over: New Zealand 83-5 (Watling 9, de Grandhomme 36) Cummins is doing his best to force a breakthrough but there\u2019s little happening for him out there now and he\u2019s preying on a mistake from one of these two set batsmen. None is forthcoming this over. 34th over: New Zealand 80-5 (Watling 7, de Grandhomme 35) Tim Paine does go to Marnus Labuschagne - a change I like - and it almost pays dividends when CdG tries to drive over the top but succeeds only in finding a leading edge that drops just short of the sweeper coming in from the point boundary. De Grandhomme is playing his shots now, whipping Labuschagne to the on-side despite the ball turning towards off and barely bouncing above ankle height. 33rd over: New Zealand 77-5 (Watling 6, de Grandhomme 33) CdG moves into the 30s with two swings of the bat in the general direction of the covers. The first almost results in a chance for a diving Matthew Wade, the second is a thumping boundary. He follows that by picking up Cummins\u2019 length out of the bowler\u2019s hand and whipping him dismissively to midwicket for two more. Zero footwork from de Grandhomme, but he has a great eye and fast powerful hands. 32nd over: New Zealand 68-5 (Watling 6, de Grandhomme 24) Now the ball has softened, the batsmen have their eyes in, and the pitch has settled down again following its early rollings, things have all become a touch attritional again. New Zealand keep Australia waiting through Pattinson\u2019s latest over. Perhaps time for Labuschagne to mix things up. 31st over: New Zealand 65-5 (Watling 4, de Grandhomme 23) Cummins isn\u2019t out of the attack for long and when he returns he almost has Watling playing on a short delivery outside his off stump. This partnership is starting to reach awkward territory for Australia now, it\u2019s lasted 12 overs, and with just 21 overs left in the afternoon a fifth day is looming large. Last orders for Russell\u2019s auction... 30th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Watling 3, de Grandhomme 22) Nathan Lyon\u2019s ten-over spell is ended by James Pattinson\u2019s recall into the attack. He backs up Starc\u2019s maiden with one of his own, and looks threatening with some late reverse swing tailing into the right-handed de Grandhomme. 29th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Watling 3, de Grandhomme 22) Watling keeps out a full, swinging, probing maiden from Starc. \u201cGood afternoon Jonathan,\u201d good afternoon Lee Henderson. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help but notice S.MacGill\u2019s name up there on the SCG Honours board in your Twitter link. We\u2019re sitting here wondering just what his eventual tally might have been if he hadn\u2019t clashed with the Warne era. He certainly didn\u2019t have the chutzpah of Warnie but by crikey the boy could spin a ball couldn\u2019t he.\u201d A remarkable stroke of misfortune that the second best Australian leg-spinner of the modern era would arrive during the career of the very best. 44 Tests, 208 wickets at 29. In any other era he would have ended with eye-watering numbers. 28th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Watling 3, de Grandhomme 22) Lyon\u2019s getting plenty of turn but there\u2019s less variation for him than earlier, allowing New Zealand to formulate plans. CdG\u2019s involves plodding his front leg down the pitch and hitting through the line over mid-off. He does so twice to good effect to leave Tim Paine scratching his chin. 27th over: New Zealand 54-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 14) CdG has shown more than once this series he\u2019s here for a good time, not a long time. He plays a few more loose strokes during the latest Starc over and it is a mystery how he is not dismissed. One in particular was too good, angling in from around the wicket then seaming away from the outside edge and the off stump. Mesmerising delivery. To compound Starc\u2019s frustration CdG jams his bat on a yorker from the final ball of the over and collects four runs down to third-man. There is no justice. 26th over: New Zealand 50-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 10) Ricky Ponting is ropable with CdG for playing a series of uppish strokes into the on-side. The batsman survives though, and advances his score with two twos and a single. There\u2019s the suggestion a few spots of rain could be falling in the vicinity of the SCG and those clouds are not just grey with bushfire smoke. Could day five be required after all? 25th over: New Zealand 45-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 5) Time for another burst from Mitchell Starc, and he almost immediately does for CdG who leaves a delivery that misses his off stump by the width of a huntsman spider\u2019s furry leg. He then induces an reflexive outside edge from Watling with a rare delivery that spat off this docile surface. It is a gloomy afternoon now in Sydney with ash-laden clouds turning the sky into a scene from a Harry Potter movie when the dementors begin to circle. The floodlights are now in full effect. 24th over: New Zealand 44-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 5) A rapid maiden from Lyon to the obdurate Watling. 23rd over: New Zealand 44-5 (Watling 2, de Grandhomme 5) Excellent straight drive from CdG for three before Watling doubles his score. Apropos of nothing, here\u2019s Bjork. 22nd over: New Zealand 40-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 2) CdG gets away from the danger end swiftly, inviting Watling to see off the bulk of another probing over from Nathan Lyon. Watling has been around for 34 balls for his one run. 21st over: New Zealand 39-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 1) Cummins is bowling beautifully right now, teasing the inside and outside edges of the bats of both Watling and CdG. It is a joy to watch a fast bowler with this level of control. Eloise Wright gives some context to charges consecutive one-sided series have led to a boring summer. \u201cYes, I\u2019m always kind of annoyed when every test (not to say series) in an Australian summer seems to be a foregone conclusion,\u201d she emails. \u201cYou would think I\u2019d be used to it, having grown up watching the late 90s-early 00s teams, but I still find it pretty boring. Having said that, I\u2019m finding myself less irritated this year than in summers past. For one thing, the northern summer was so crammed full of excitement there was bound to be a comedown. For another, with everything else going on at the moment, a little light boredom seems like just the ticket. I was at the SCG on Saturday and there seemed to be quite a few fire-impacted people around the ground. Personally, I was glad to get my parents out of the Blue Mountains on a danger day. I also overheard one firey telling a mate about their experience on NYE - after that, I imagine excitement at the cricket not required!\u201d 20th over: New Zealand 38-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 0) Watling repels an over of sharply spinning Lyon offies. 19th over: New Zealand 38-5 (Watling 1, de Grandhomme 0) Still time in the over for Cummins to whistle one beyond de Grandhomme\u2019s outside edge. This is an impressive, hungry, remorseless, relentless, highly skilled bowling unit. Ah yes, how could we forget! Maybe he was still digesting his national record? Maybe he was dewy-eyed like Bradman at the Oval? Either way, Ross Taylor has just been cleaned up by a Pat Cummins beauty. Angled in from over the wicket Taylor played inside the line leaving his off stump swaying like a drunk at closing time. 18th over: New Zealand 38-4 (Taylor 22, Watling 1) A nice round of applause from the SCG, and Australian players, in honour of Taylor\u2019s milestone. He and Watling both look to have their plans to Lyon, and they\u2019re taking the game to the spinner, not just allowing him to dominate. A milestone for New Zealand in a wretched tour with Ross Taylor lofting Nathan Lyon for three over mid-on to overtake Stephen Fleming as his country\u2019s most prolific batsman in Test cricket. 17th over: New Zealand 33-4 (Taylor 17, Watling 1) Cummins shares duties with Lyon after the resumption and he is predictably parsimonious. \u201cMy two young children are currently taking it in turns to be sick through the night thanks to the dreaded norovirus,\u201d emails Martyn Beeston. \u201cI\u2019ve currently got as much chance of seeing out the rest of the night in peace as New Zealand have of making it to 120. Only saving grace is that I thought the next Ashes series was due this year (which started making me feel queasy). What chance do you think we (Eng) have in 21/22?\u201d Slim to none Martyn, slim to none. Australia\u2019s young and complete bowling attack on home soil will simply be too good for England\u2019s fragile batting - as things stand. Then you have Warner, Smith and Labuschagne, the three batsmen in Australian conditions in a composite XI. A lot can change in a couple of years though. Root and Stokes could blossom with the bat, Archer could change the dynamic with the ball. But I\u2019d be expecting 5-0 or thereabouts. 16th over: New Zealand 33-4 (Taylor 17, Watling 1) Taylor and Watling both work singles from Nathan Lyon\u2019s first over after tea before the former accepts a long half-volley outside stump, thwacking four over mid-off. Taylor is now just three runs shy of becoming the all-time leading run-scorer for New Zealand in Tests. The players are back out after tea. Will this be the final session of the series? 37 overs on offer for Australia to get on the Sydney Monday night circuit. It\u2019ll get better Stephen, I promise. In response to the query about the most changes between Tests, England\u2019s atrocious 1989 Ashes has been recalled. It was where my mind first went also, but I can\u2019t grab exactly what the numerical differences between line-ups were per Test. 29 players over six Tests is extraordinary though. Jack Faine has emailed in a question for the OBO hive mind. \u201cI am just wondering if New Zealand\u2019s mid-series change of five players is unprecedented in Test cricket? I can recall a number of occasions where three changes have been made to sides, but I cannot recall any time that even four, let alone five (!) changes have been made to a side between Test matches in the same series. Would be interesting to know.\u201d Australia are steamrollering New Zealand now at the SCG. They could wrap up a series whitewash in the 37 overs remaining after tea. 15th over: New Zealand 27-4 (Taylor 12, Watling 0) Watling safely dead-bats a Pattinson maiden to see us through to the tea interval. 14th over: New Zealand 27-4 (Taylor 12, Watling 0) Taylor is a man with a plan, taking guard on off stump and sweeping as often as possible. It works well, earning a couple of twos, and also provides that heart-in-mouth appeal. Jake Santa Maria is happy with a summer free of jeopardy. \u201cAfter the Ashes, especially Headingley,\u201d he emails, \u201cI don\u2019t mind the chance to actually relax and watch the cricket rather than cowering in fear of it.\u201d Pssst, look over there, it\u2019s Ben Stokes! No, NZ are not five down (yet). Australia thought they had Taylor out sweeping onto his boot but the ball just hit the pitch before rolling up onto his boot. Are NZ five down? Ross Taylor may be out but we\u2019re going upstairs for a catch, soft signal not out. 13th over: New Zealand 23-4 (Taylor 8, Watling 0) Pattinson\u2019s seam movement and the low bounce of this surface causes Taylor all sorts before he finally rotates the strike. Watling is more assured seeing off the last couple of deliveries with forward defences. We\u2019ve gone from Headingley 19 to Cape Town 11. 12th over: New Zealand 22-4 (Taylor 7, Watling 0) The natural variation is doing the trick for Lyon. Phillips was undone by one that didn\u2019t turn as much as he expected, so he ended up inside the line with a straight bat. Lyon himself barely appealed, and it took the enthusiasm of Paine and the close fielders to convince the rest a dismissal had taken place. \u201cI was also confused by Ricky Ponting\u2019s commentary,\u201d emails Paul Morton. \u201cThe technology backs up the on-field umpire, but the umpire is still \u2018wrong\u2019.\u201d Yeah, I don\u2019t get it either. Luckily we\u2019ve got more of this to come with Brendon McCullum (New Zealand\u2019s Michael Vaughan?) lining up a dossier by the sounds of things for later in the broadcast. New Zealand use their two reviews on outside-edges in a matter of minutes. Sums up their miserable tour. Glenn Phillips is the latest culprit, going back to Lyon and feathering a catch behind the wicket. WICKET! Lyon has another, Phillips this time, but again it\u2019s going to DRS. Stand by... 11th over: New Zealand 22-3 (Taylor 7, Phillips 0) Pattinson bowls a maiden to Taylor. The Kiwi legend did his best to get the scoreboard moving but a lack of footwork and an absence of timing on this difficult surface meant all his strokes turned into ungainly swipes. 10th over: New Zealand 22-3 (Taylor 7, Phillips 0) Another example of a very tight decision going against New Zealand on-field that is subsequently confirmed by technology. This is not my take on the summer, but I\u2019m sympathetic to people who hold it. Are there many others of you out there lamenting the lack of close finishes? First look at Nathan Lyon for the day, and he takes just four balls to strike. Beautiful teasing off-spinner from around the wicket into the left-hander drawing the batsman forward then spinning and bouncing away from the stroke, grazing the finest outside edge on the way through to Tim Paine\u2019s gloves. The edge was so faint Raval did not feel it but snicko confirmed the deflection. New Zealand can start packing their suitcases. REVIEW! Raval does not think he\u2019s caught behind off Nathan Lyon... 9th over: New Zealand 22-2 (Raval 12, Taylor 7) Pattinson replaces Starc and he\u2019s quickly into a more imposing rhythm than we\u2019ve seen previously in this Test. Angling into Taylor he targets the stumps with pace and is unfortunate to concede four runs when a thick outside edge scoots through an unguarded portion of the cordon. The only shades of Headingley I can see are the slate grey ones overhead. If NZ are in this up to their necks it\u2019s because they have sunk so far they\u2019re drowning, not waving. 8th over: New Zealand 18-2 (Raval 12, Taylor 3) Raval has come out playing with freedom and he takes Cummins for runs all around the wicket with some lovely strokes, including a crisp straight drive and controlled pull. Ian Loiterton has logged on. \u201cAdam mentioned in the commentary that Warner has made 18 x 100\u2019s at home, 6 x 100\u2019s abroad. That\u2019s a ratio of 3:1,\u201d he emails. \u201cWondering if there\u2019s any stats about how this compares to other batsmen? High, middling or (as I suspect) low? I\u2019d be curious, as all is not well in the state of Denmark (read Australian batting line up) just yet, when Warner\u2019s inability to travel is viewed in conjunction with the Burns issue, Wade\u2019s questionable performance at No.5 and the need for more consistency from Travis Head. In summary, the Smith / Labuschagne double act, in conjunction with the potency of Australia\u2019s bowling attack, may be masking some deep seated issues when it comes to playing the likes of India in tests (forget the silly short version). Your thoughts on the current line up and whether there\u2019s any viable personnel changes in the making, based on recent domestic performances?\u201d. An astute email Ian. I think the first thing to say is that nobody is banging the door down to come into the side, so that aspect of the equation isn\u2019t around to overly complicate matters. As for the imbalance of the line-up, I agree, however, with the exception of India away, the individual brilliance of one one of those top three is probably sufficient right now to win a series. Semantically that could well be papering over cracks. Alternatively, it could just be a reflection of cricket being a team game made up of individuals, of which Australia are currently blessed with half-a-dozen or so of the very best right now. 7th over: New Zealand 10-2 (Raval 4, Taylor 3) Taylor misses a pull - a shot he might not go to very often on a pitch with such low bounce - before getting off strike with a single. Raval then works one off his hip to complete the over. 6th over: New Zealand 8-2 (Raval 3, Taylor 2) Cummins is the ideal partnership bowler in conditions like this, gives nothing away, always makes the batsmen play, and forces rash shots against the other bowlers. His latest over of relentless line and length goes for just one. 5th over: New Zealand 7-2 (Raval 3, Taylor 1) I do enjoy dismissals like that. Nobody seems happy with the outcome despite the on-field umpire being proven correct, doubly so, as his original judgement was confirmed as accurate by the best available technology. Yet, because of decades of confirmation bias (much of which must now be retrospectively considered inaccurate) we are up in arms. Did I think it was out in real time? No. Am I satisfied with the original decision and application of DRS? Absolutely. DRS gives the green light to Australia courtesy of an orange one on ball-tracker. Starc, from over the wicket, beat Latham\u2019s leg-glance for pace, and appealed for an LBW that looked optimistic at best, but umpire Erasmus raised his finger in a flash. Latham was nonplussed, reviewed, and the third umpire confirmed his downfall with the computer simulation indicating the ball was glancing the very outer coat of varnish on leg stump. WICKET! Latham LBW b Starc... but it\u2019s gone upstairs. That was a very very sharp call from umpire Erasmus. That looked a bit leg-side. 4th over: New Zealand 3-1 (Latham 1, Raval 0) The SCG is becalmed once more following the euphoria that greeted Lyon\u2019s superb catch. It was effectively a slips catch, but square of the wicket, giving it an added degree of difficulty because of the inability to gauge the trajectory of the ball out of the bowler\u2019s hand. Pretty ordinary shot, mind you, and a disappointing way for Blundell\u2019s otherwise promising series to end. Latham sees off a Cummins maiden from around the wicket. Australia are on their way. 3rd over: New Zealand 3-1 (Latham 1, Raval 0) Thank you very much Adam. You remain the hardest working man in cric-business. Good luck snatching a few hours kip before wading into South Africa v England. The rest of you; are you on email? You simply have to be these days. Send yours about this match, and anything else you want to discuss to this address: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. Anything pithier, maybe with a gif, or a link to a little-known highlight, can be sent on Twitter to @JPHowcroft. What a catch! Lyon had plenty to do with his dive low to the right and got both hands to the ball to complete a fantastic snaffle! Australia are up and about. An apt moment for me to pass the baton to JP Howcroft. Will he deliver an Australia victory inside four days for the fifth time this summer? I think he might. Bye! 2nd over: New Zealand 3-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 2) Target 416 Cummins get the new ball to Blundell, who, of course, made a ton in pursuit of a similar (notional) target this time last week. He takes a single behind square, leaving Latham a couple to get through. He ducks the bouncer and leaves outside the off stump. 1st over: New Zealand 2-0 (Latham 1, Blundell 1) Target 416 For those still playing along with this, the five penalty runs were added to New Zealand\u2019s first innings. So, the target is 416, not 421. It also means that the Black Caps retrospectively avoided the follow-on. Ah, cricket... if it didn\u2019t exist you couldn\u2019t make it up. Latham leaves and defends before pushing a single to cover to get the chase underway. The other way to look at this is that New Zealand have World Test Championship points to win if they draw this fixture. Yes, that will require batting for 141 overs but it gives them an incentive to dig in here. And not get run out! Dear me! That would have been the fate of Blundell had Head\u2019s throw been on target from cover when the opener took a quick single to finish the over to get off the mark. Ugh! Some crazy Andrew Samson numbers on SEN radio as the players walk back on. Labuschagne finishes with 896 runs, nine short of Hammond in 1928-29. He batted for 1768 minutes (29.5 hours) and 1457 balls. Warner made 786 runs, batting for 1731 minutes (just short of 29 hours), across 1219 deliveries. Blimey. Mitch Starc has the ball in his hand, Latham the man on strike to begin. PLAY! 421 to win, but 416 to make. That\u2019s the effect of the penalty runs that were added a couple of overs before the declaration. That\u2019ll throw up a fun statisical debate if they do get the runs. Will it be the record? That\u2019s currently 418 in the fourth innings. They would reach a higher target than that but with fewer runs. Fun! We had the forehand smash from Labuschangne but Henry claims his wicket with his next delivery, caught at long on. Paine calls them in! New Zealand are set 421 to win. Warner walks off unbeaten with 111 to his name, his 24th Test century. 51st over: Australia 211-1 (Warner 108, Labuschagne 56) Cricinfo have said that the five-run penalty has been applied but it will be given the New Zealand as penalty runs at the start of the new over. But, wasn\u2019t Warner meant to be on strike for this over? I think he\u2019s actually docked them a run and applied the penalty. Andrew Samson explains on SEN radio that this was the correct interpretation once assessing Warner as having ran on the pitch with the last shot of the previous over: withdraw the runs made from that ball then award five-runs to the opposition. 50th over: Australia 206-1 (Warner 106, Labuschagne 53) Warner checks an off-drive off Henry before clipping yet another single to midwicket. He\u2019s made so many runs out there today. Labuschagne has a gallop down the track but misses everything. So, they\u2019re not far away from declaring, we can safely assume based on the evidence of that shot. Has someone told Marnus about Hammond\u2019s 905, I wonder? Probably not. He\u2019s one closer to it with a quick single to backward point. He gets a bit of a telling off from Aleem Dar after the run, telling him not to run on the pitch. Warner slaps out to the sweeper at deep backward point for two more, then a single to finish to deep midwicket again to bring up the 100 partnership. It\u2019s not without controversy though... Aleem Dar has withdrawn the run because he says Warner has ran on the pitch. Or warned them? He hasn\u2019t docked them five runs, as he is entitled to do. The scoreboards all over the place. What doing? 49th over: Australia 202-1 (Warner 103, Labuschagne 52) With four through midwicket and a single to mid-off, Marnus Labuschagne gets to raise his bat yet again, a half-century to go with his 215 from the first innings. He\u2019s arrived at the mark in just 64 balls. By the end of the over, Australia are beyond 200 as well. Here\u2019s Warner\u2019s century. And Marnus. 48th over: Australia 194-1 (Warner 102, Labuschagne 45) Henry to Warner on 99, and he takes off after defending to him! The bowler pings at the stumps and isn\u2019t far off running him out. Forget what I said about his ease in the 90s in the previous over! Right, back to the task at hand... and there it is! The milestone is brought up with a whip through the legside, the prolific pair coming back for three. Off comes the helmet as Warner launches into his familiar celebration once again this summer. That\u2019s a third ton across those five Tests this and his 18th in Australia, fourth at the SCG and fifth against NZ. 147 balls to get there with nine boundaries. 47th over: Australia 190-1 (Warner 99, Labuschagne 44) Labuschagne takes a single from the first delivery of CdG\u2019s over, giving Warner a good look at the two runs he needs for a century. He knows this terrain well, carefully defending to both sides of the wicket as required, waiting for his ball, before taking the one on offer to midwicket off his hip. On to 99. The No3 steers a couple more to complete the over down to third man, closing in on another half-century himself. 46th over: Australia 186-1 (Warner 98, Labuschagne 41) Matt Henry is back for his first spell since the first few overs this morning, Labuschagne clipping three out to deepmidwicket, helped by a misfield. Warner gives the strike straight back and moves into the 90s with a single, pushing off the front foot behind point. Whoa! Warner gets a boundary from a ball that leapt off the track! He somehow managed to get some bat on ball, helping it over the cordon. He then makes it two fours in a row, moving to 98 with a compact tuck to fine leg - a poor finish from Henry. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hello, Liz Musgrove. \u201cI\u2019m a new convert to OBO, but loving it, thanks for the entertainment and insights. I grew up with cricket commentators burbling away as the background to summer and I\u2019m quite enjoying the Sky coverage via Kayo - Isa Guha is a standout for me - but get a much better sense of the state of the contest from the OBO. It\u2019s also a great way to catch up on events if I\u2019ve been doing other things. So thanks again for the work you and your colleagues have put in!\u201d Well, isn\u2019t that lovely? Thanks for dropping me a line. Yes, the OBO is a special community. I was a long-term reader before jumping on the tools four years ago and it remains one of the most enjoyable things I get to do as a cricket writer. 45th over: Australia 173-1 (Warner 89, Labuschagne 37) Labuschange gets Australia\u2019s first run of the session, a single to cover. CdG is back on his very consistent line and length, Warner happy enough playing himself back in. Yes, quick runs are the name of the game but not at the expense of a Test ton. \u201cIf you insist calling Wagner \u2018The Composer\u2019, I\u2019m wondering whether Marnus has ever been given the handle of \u2018The bus interchange\u2019?\u201d asks Ian Loiterton. That might require some googling from me. \u201cOne for the bilingual dyslexics out there.\u201d The players are back on the field. We know that because Sweet Disposition is playing over the PA as they walk out. It\u2019s a big improvement on Great Southern End, which prevailed for about 15 years. de Grandhomme to Labuschagne. PLAY. A big session for Australia. They piled on 136 runs at 4.9 runs an over, losing just the one wicket. Unfortunately for Australian fans, that was Burns - the man who needed runs the most - when he was trapped lbw by an excellent Astle wrong\u2019un. But that loss, and when Labuschagne dropped by the same spinner as soon as he came to the crease, were the only moments of hope for the Black Caps. With Australia 375 ahead, the only questions left are whether Warner can reach a 24th ton, if Labuschange can overtake Hammond and when Paine will declare. 44th over: Australia 172-1 (Warner 89, Labuschagne 36) A graphic flashes up on screen as Somerville begins the final over of the session: Labushagne has made 872 runs this home summer, only behind Wally Hammond\u2019s 905 from his famous 1928-29 Ashes campaign in Australia. I doubt that\u2019s on Tim Paine\u2019s radar but maybe someone should let him know at the break, in case it is just a matter of an over or two for him to get there as they approach a declaration target. LUNCH it is! 43rd over: Australia 171-1 (Warner 89, Labuschagne 35) Wagner with his final over before the break, doing well to nearly floor Warner with an inswinging yorker, the two sharing another laugh as they pass. Indeed, he accidentially hit him with the bat! Good colour, mucking around. Fewer smiles for the bowler when Warner picks up a full toss over midwicket for an easy four - a misdirected change of pace. 42nd over: Australia 164-1 (Warner 84, Labuschagne 33) They\u2019ve already put on 50, Labuschagne deflecing Somerville - back into the attack - for a couple to bring that up in 74 balls. He celebrates with a reverse sweep, something I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen from him this summer? Not that often, in any case. It works too, trickling away to the third man boundary. Isa Guha on telly is quick on the stat, noting that it was just the third time that Marnus has reversed in Tests. He tries another version of the sweep, a lap, but misses the ball... Watling does too, three more added, this time byes. Ten off it. The lead is 367 with six minutes until lunch. 41st over: Australia 154-1 (Warner 83, Labuschagne 27) The Composer returns for his second spell today, with time for a couple before lunch from Paddington End. Labuschagne takes one to cover to begin, Warner then grabbing a single behind square. The former finishes with a handy cut shot, chopped behind point for two. 40th over: Australia 150-1 (Warner 82, Labuschagne 24) Astle now around the wicket but through the umpire to Warner. As Bharat Sundaresan notes below, there\u2019s an old-school charm about that approach; yet another reason to be on the Team Todd bandwagon with me. It doesn\u2019t bother the opener, who gets down low for his smash-sweep behind square for four. It takes him into the 80s. 39th over: Australia 141-1 (Warner 75, Labuschagne 22) CdG finds Labuschagne\u2019s outside edge, swinging hard at a cut shot, but it runs away safely to the rope with no slips in place at this stage. Once again, he\u2019s into the 20s. 101 runs have now been scored today across 24 overs. The TV cuts to Smith on the balcony, who must secretly hate how much time he\u2019s spent waiting to bat this Test season. 38th over: Australia 136-1 (Warner 75, Labuschagne 17) When Warner gets his chance after a long time at the non-strikers\u2019 end he plays resourceful sweep in front of square, racing back for two. He\u2019s three-quarters of the way there. Check out this feature on one of the most talented people in and around the game, photographer Ryan Pierse. Also a fantastic human being. 37th over: Australia 133-1 (Warner 73, Labuschagne 16) Labuschagne is owning the strike, taking the entire CdG over, starting with a couple off his pads and finishing with one in the same direction down to fine leg. Warner is still in range of three figures before lunch but that\u2019s now more likely to come up after the break. 36th over: Australia 130-1 (Warner 73, Labuschagne 13) Labuschagne is confident enough to use his feet again at Astle now, as he should be considering he made 215 in the first dig. \u201cHe\u2019s looking to score off every ball,\u201d says Kerry O\u2019Keeffe on telly. 35th over: Australia 124-1 (Warner 72, Labuschagne 8) Speaking of white-ball cricket, it is a white-ball field for CdG with Watling still up to the stumps. There\u2019s not a lot to see here - one off; the lead 327. With probably nine overs until lunch, they should be able to move that number along to 360/370 by then. \u201cMy project is almost finished, Mr Collins!\u201d reports Abhijato Sensarma. Good work. \u201cBut Burns has departed before I could watch him on the telly. The approach they have taken to this innings is similar to that of an ODI, as the run-rate proves. This is a magnificent opportunity for Marnus to make a mark about his attacking skills. He\u2019s a part of the ODI squad for the India tour, so this scenario offers him the best chance to exercise his skills. With approximately the same number of overs being left as he will usually have batting at No4 against India in coloured clothing, he needs to construct his innings accordingly. If he gets the twin ton too, that will be the icing on the cake for his home summer!\u201d Good point. I\u2019d forgotten that Labuschagne is off to India next week for that three-game series. Yes, that\u2019s right, they are off to India for just three ODIs. Hmmm. 34th over: Australia 123-1 (Warner 71, Labuschagne 8) Five off Astle but at least he\u2019s giving it a chance to spin (both ways) with ample flight. Keep him on, skip. 33rd over: Australia 118-1 (Warner 67, Labuschagne 7) Another belt-and-braces CdG set. In fairness to the Black Caps, the last ten overs have gone for 41. That\u2019s an improvement from the first 40-minute window today when 57 runs were added. An overrated modern talking point, for mine? Honours boards. Alas, Lyon is now on there at the SCG following his excellent five-wicket bag on Saturday. 32nd over: Australia 116-1 (Warner 67, Labuschagne 6) Oh no! Astle drops Labuschagne! It\u2019s a sitter too: fingers up, in and out. Such a good bit of bowling to beat him in flight, the drive checked straight at him. What can you say? A tough moment for all the members of Team Todd. Ian Smith is a fan as well, saying he should be an \u201cautomatic selection\u201d for the next New Zealand Test team. 31st over: Australia 112-1 (Warner 65, Labuschagne 4) CdG isn\u2019t letting Labuschagne put the foot own from the get go here, at the stumps throughout. The good news for Burns is that Uncle Rod Marsh is no longer the selection boss so the below average won\u2019t be the only number looked at when deciding his fate. 30th over: Australia 110-1 (Warner 65, Labuschagne 2) Another wrong\u2019un straight away to Labuschagne, this one turning too much. As Kerry O\u2019Keeffe says on TV, Astle didn\u2019t bowl it anywhere near enough when the game was there to be really influenced on that opening day. Ooi, he bowls another at Warner to finish, which isn\u2019t far away from getting him in strife. That\u2019s a very handy over. Well done. They take drinks. Here\u2019s the projection. Very nicely bowled, HOT TODDY. I told you about the Astle googly! It\u2019s good enough to beat Burns, a lovely delivery beyond his inside edge and crashing into his front pad. It wasn\u2019t given out on the field but the DRS shows it was doing everything right, hitting leg stump. Another good start from Burns but he ends his summer without pressing to 50 or beyond. 29th over: Australia 107-0 (Warner 64, Burns 40) Colin de Grandhomme, who had the new ball on the first morning, is pacing around the wicket at Warner and giving it his best, stump to stump all the way. Four risk-free runs are added, the lead 310. 28th over: Australia 103-0 (Warner 61, Burns 39) I see a couple of tweets suggesting that Australia should open the door to New Zealand. They clearly haven\u2019t been watching closely enough - that is not happening, and nor should it with so much time left in this game. They might have a 400 lead by lunch the way this is going. To Astle\u2019s credit, after having 11 taken from his first over today, he backs up with tidy maiden at Burns. He has an very useful googly on him. 27th over: Australia 103-0 (Warner 61, Burns 39) Another milestone, the sixth time that Warner and Burns have passed 100 runs together at the top of the list, the two sharing a hug. Wagner is mixing it up every ball but we\u2019ve passed the point of the series where that is going to get into the heads of the home batsmen. Tom Latham is with his bowler, tweaking the field, refusing to completely give in - there are men spread all over the legside as he leaps in from around the wicket. But nothing comes of it, Burns retaining the strike with a quick single behind point. 26th over: Australia 99-0 (Warner 58, Burns 38) TODD! Be still my beating heart, Astle is into the attack for the first time this morning. There\u2019s one person who enjoys this development as much as me: Dave Warner. He takes one delivery to get down into his reverse sweep posture, executing the shot perfectly, whacking it away behind point for his fifth boundary. He\u2019s well on his way to a ton here. Not to miss out on the fun, Burns hits him back over his head for SIX to finish! Watson-esque from the Queenslander, holding his pose as the ball sails over long-on. The Australian lead is now 302 with 57 taken from the ten overs so far this morning. 25th over: Australia 88-0 (Warner 53, Burns 32) Burns moves into the 30s with his most commanding shot of the morning, getting on the front foot to drive Wagner through cover for four. There\u2019s the usual array of short and slower deliveries but the Australian pair have his measure at this early stage of his spell. There\u2019s a big ol\u2019 love-in about Mark Waugh on the telly, led by Shane Warne, who explains why his old teammate is his favourite player of all time. It\u2019s something we share in common, as it happens. That was the first piece that wrote for a cricket magazine and spent four weeks in the autum of 2015 researching it in the MCC Library. Not a very efficient start to my freelance life, it must be said. Gary Naylor agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t often agree with SK Warne, but...\u201d before dropping this at me. 24th over: Australia 81-0 (Warner 50, Burns 28) They\u2019re taking runs as the see fit off Somerville, ODI-style. With a clip off his pads, Warner moves to his half-century from his 82nd delivery. That\u2019s his 54th score above 50 in Tests, 23 of those converted into tons. He has every chance to make it 24 in an hour or so from now. 23rd over: Australia 76-0 (Warner 46, Burns 27) No matter what happens in this final bowling innings for New Zealand, Neil Wagner is leaving Australia with his reputation enhanced yet further. What\u2019s not to love about a cricketer who does it his own way, relentlessly, with a smile on his face throughout? Sure enough, he\u2019s throwing himself around here, leaping across the track to deny Warner a run when pushing back at him. It\u2019s the only delivery really in his half. He could have been called for a wide when misdirecting well down the legside but Umpire Erasmus lets him off with a warning. \u201cIf he bowls another one I\u2019ll call it,\u201d he explains to Warner when asked why it wasn\u2019t signalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bowl it that wide!\u201d Wagner responds. \u201cShane Warne used to bowl it out there into the rough!\u201d They all share a laugh when walking back to their respective positions. What a guy. 22nd over: Australia 73-0 (Warner 44, Burns 27) Warner gives Burns the strike back and it looks like he wants to whack Somerville over midwicket again using his feet by default, but he elects to play him carefully. There\u2019s nothing gained for him trying to do anything silly here; the run rate is going to take care of itself. 21st over: Australia 72-0 (Warner 43, Burns 27) Warner quickly into the 40s with back to back boundaries, cutting Henry with authority then deflecting just as expertly behind point. He\u2019d love a home ground ton to end the Test summer. 20th over: Australia 60-0 (Warner 34, Burns 25) There we go! Burns skips down the track at Somerville and lifts him over the rope at midwicket for SIX! He didn\u2019t overhit it or anything like that, backing his strength to go the full journey. Earlier in the over, Warner put him on strike with a deft little steer past slip for three. On telly, Warne is saying they will want 400 before declaring. The lead is now 263. 19th over: Australia 51-0 (Warner 31, Burns 19) Burns isn\u2019t quite fluent yet, his drive for two far from middled, but it is enough to bring up the half-century stand between these two. As I said off the top, don\u2019t underestimate the importance of these statistical columns when squads are being picked five months from now. \u201cWithout wishing ill on Warner or especially Burns in my heart I\u2019d love to see that man Marnus out there for one last hoik of the season,\u201d writes Cameron Bray \u201cBurns might NEED to make a score but who would begrudge some stat-buffing for our mighty first drop? Love your work.\u201d Well, if Labuschagne walked out right this moment he could have a pop at twin tons? He should have secured that milestone in Perth, getting out when well set in the second innings there. It\u2019s pretty much the only thing left for him now. 18th over: Australia 49-0 (Warner 31, Burns 17) Somerville starts with his off-spin from the Paddington End, Warner taking a quick single into the offside straight away. Burns takes a look at a couple before advancing down the strip, getting just to where he needed to be in order to flick the ball out square leg for his first run of the morning. Warner again, who strikes the first boundary of the day, crashing Somerville through cover standing tall in the crease. That\u2019s a pretty shot. 17th over: Australia 43-0 (Warner 26, Burns 16) Warner is away first ball, with a purposeful punch off the back foot through cover for a couple. \u201cWAIT ON!\u201d he roars next when driving to the man in there. As they note on telly, nobody calls quite like the opener. He\u2019s kept in defence until the final ball, clipping a further single to keep the strike when Henry gets his angle wrong from round the wicket. The players are walking out to the middle. Warner will be taking the first ball. We\u2019re told there was a bit of rain in the air before play, which is great news in terms of offering some fire relief, but are starting on time at the SCG. It will be Matt Henry starting off for the Black Caps from the Randwick End. PLAY! Here is the pitch. Of course, Steve Smith is shadow batting. On the telly, there are some pictures of James Pattinson carrying Justin Langer around by the arms in a pro-wrestler move. Patto is loving it. What a lad. I need a GIF of that right away. This is my fifth OBO of the weekend. You know who has been there with me for all of them? The most dedicated emailer there is: Abhijato Sensarma. He\u2019s dropped me a line. You can too. \u201cIt is half past four in the morning here in India, but I find myself up and running already for a while by now because today marks the deadline for the submission of a school project (frankly, which day doesn\u2019t?). The cricket will certainly help me power through the rest of the assignment. And one of my eyes will be on Joe Burns, who faces the challenge of needing more runs than goodwill at this point of time. International sports is an unforgiving field, as the recent batch of dropped Australian openers would know. The pitch is flat enough to get a good score, and tough enough to make the good score seem impressive - Burns needs to stick out there and confirm his ticket to Bangladesh.\u201d Using cricket to procrastinate from a school project? Ahhh, how comforting. This is something, I\u2019m sure, we can all identify with. It\u2019s fair to say I wasn\u2019t a very good student during the 2005 Ashes. I recall taking a unit that semester which was very Monash Arts: history of the city of Melbourne. Simpler times! If you\u2019re after a top read before we start, check out Emma John\u2019s beauty on four-day Tests. She\u2019s spot on: we get way too down on ourselves as a sport. Bushfire relief. As we have thorughout the Test, let\u2019s keep an eye on the Russell Jackson bat auction. If you haven\u2019t seen it as yet, as a kid he had a bat signed by ten Test captains. To raise crucial cash for those who have been battered by these awful fires, he\u2019s putting that to auction. Sure enough, it\u2019s getting some fantastic support from our cricket community and closes when the Test ends. Snap it up! For those of you who weren\u2019t with me during the Newlands OBO earlier, what an absorbing contest. It would be the most England thing imaginable if they end up pulling off a win after their previous week on tour. Here\u2019s Vic Marks\u2019 report. We are about two sessions behind where the first two Tests were at this stage as the hosts continue their push for relatively quick runs ahead of an almost certain declaration at some stage around the middle of today, their lead currently 243. As always in a third innings of this nature, the focus becomes an individual one, and today that will primarily be Joe Burns, who is on 16 not out overnight. When the opener posted 97 in his first innings this summer, recalled after Cam Bancroft and Marcus Harris failed to make it work during the away Ashes, there was a consensus that the game of musical chairs had finished. David Warner was effusive: he wanted Burns by his side for the long haul. But after that, his scores against Pakistan and New Zealand read 4, 9, 53, 35, 0 and 18. He got a good\u2019un in the first innings here, but that will be forgotten by the time the next Test squad is selected for Bangladesh midyear. Long story short: he really needs a score. There\u2019s a lot of goodwill towards the Queenslander, who has been treated poorly by selectors over his strange journey in and out of the national team. Remember, he made 180 in his previous Test before missing out entirely on a spot on the Ashes trip. Even if this is a relatively low-intensity hitout in pursuit of these declaration runs, everyone in and around this team want him to make it work. As for the Black Caps, their job is a familiar one: containment. They almost certainly won\u2019t be given a realistic chance to win this game unless they bowl Australia out in a session. And sure, they should try and do that. But if it doesn\u2019t happen - the more likely scenario - they need to suck as much time out of this game as possible then bat their way to some World Test Championship points by securing a draw. That\u2019s at least something to hold onto. Or so I\u2019ll tell myself! So, good morning to you all. I\u2019m looking forward to your company. Drop me a line.",

For of all the many threats to our continued being as the homo sapiens species, both manmade and natural, the good news is we don\u2019t have giant dragons to deal with. Read on for an assessment of the dodged bullets and grim prophecies that could still come to pass:</p> <h2><strong>Mission to Mars</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3321f9c08c8d460679e230f2593cbdde11a2150\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3321f9c08c8d460679e230f2593cbdde11a2150/62_749_1656_993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Inspired in part by a defunct ride at Disney\u2019s theme parks, Brian De Palma imagined what humankind\u2019s first manned journey to the red planet might play out. It is because the answer turns out to be \u201cdirely\u201d that the film focuses the majority of its run time on the <em>second </em>such trip, a last-ditch rescue to extract the cosmonaut left behind by an accident the first time around. Let Elon Musk consider this a warning, as he and his top people at SpaceX vow to launch some undoubtedly rich eccentric into the deepest reaches of space by 2024: real people\u2019s lives will be on the line, and even in the best-case scenario, we may still have to reckon with our genetic origins as bastardized Martian-DNA descendants.

The script, an ingenious concoction of familiar tropes and subversions thereof, gave humanity five years until an unfriendly alien species crash-landing in 2015 has laid claim to most of continental Europe. But when that day does come and invaders descend from the sky, we\u2019ll be ready \u2013 Doug Liman\u2019s film realizes the chaos of cosmic war with a specificity unseen since Starship Troopers, but he does us the service of including instructions for victory.

In this CGI-slathered version of a similar Twilight Zone episode, Hugh Jackman cashed a check as a one-time human fighter training an android for greatness, but all the against-the-odds drama wasn\u2019t half as fascinating as the positing of a post-human athletics. Imagine the ethical quandaries wiped away when the NFL is a fully cybernetic league, no longer a seeding ground for the brain-bruising effects of CTE. On the other automated hand, however, the robots will almost certainly demand rights at some point down the line.

It\u2019s then that heroes Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale launch a last-ditch counteroffensive against the fire-breathing reptilian menace, but based on all we have witnessed since the original release in 2002, director Rob Bowman\u2019s take on their plan is all but quaint. A band of rebels holds together and uses their wits to survive, while out in the real world, if gargantuan airborne beasts really did slither out of London, there\u2019s now little doubt that America would not think twice before bombing Blighty flat. Would a nuclear warhead be effective against a dragon? Only time will tell.

His timeline starts in 2013, when an inter-dimensional rift allows the passage of terrible oceanic behemoths to Earth, and then jumps ahead to join protagonist Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) seven years later, as he and his brother give hell to a humongous monster termed Knifehead and stymie its efforts to eat Anchorage. (Only one of them comes home from the battle.) The script then advances five more years, but not before leaving us all with the precious lesson that in the inevitable interspecies conflict that will define the next century, even in triumph will we suffer great and personal losses. One can only hope that when that comes to pass, it will be at the hands of an opponent with a slightly better name than Knifehead.</p> <h2><strong>A Quiet Place</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cdd8282e43fa989cfef09281fa6e9c259a8a022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cdd8282e43fa989cfef09281fa6e9c259a8a022/0_359_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Another 2020, another arrival from extraterrestrial hostiles, this time with the ability to hunt with surgical precision based on nothing but sound.

As in Blunt\u2019s previous future-nightmare, the film comes packaged with the key to defeating our new foes, and this one\u2019s even easier than the bit with the alien blood. Simply tune a cochlear implant to the right frequency and the creatures go kablooey. One almost wonders how it took the Abbott clan so long to try this dogwhistle-type method, but thank our lucky stars that we\u2019ll be ready with the weaponized hearing aids when they come.</p> <h2><strong>Terminator: Dark Fate</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf85f77420504820bc52619f41a5ca2a542342da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf85f77420504820bc52619f41a5ca2a542342da/0_0_4706_2824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Those pesky killer automatons, always time-traveling to grandfather paradox the savior of we flesh-and-blood organisms out of existence.

      "bodyText": "2019 and 2020 may only be separated by a year, but linguistically, they\u2019re much farther apart. The words \u201ctwo thousand and nineteen\u201d just don\u2019t have the futuristic ring of \u201ctwenty-twenty\u201d, which at times looks like computer output and sounds like robot-speak. The movies have seized on this much, with a solid handful of sci-fi and other genre titles making use of 2020 as a pinpoint from the abstract beyond of tomorrow that felt a little farther from the 80s and 90s than the old standby of the year 2000. In what certainly feels like a time of great crisis and on multiple fronts, perhaps we may find pointers on how best to live effectively during this new now in the films that have previously imagined how things might play out. For of all the many threats to our continued being as the homo sapiens species, both manmade and natural, the good news is we don\u2019t have giant dragons to deal with. Read on for an assessment of the dodged bullets and grim prophecies that could still come to pass: Mission to Mars Inspired in part by a defunct ride at Disney\u2019s theme parks, Brian De Palma imagined what humankind\u2019s first manned journey to the red planet might play out. It is because the answer turns out to be \u201cdirely\u201d that the film focuses the majority of its run time on the second such trip, a last-ditch rescue to extract the cosmonaut left behind by an accident the first time around. Let Elon Musk consider this a warning, as he and his top people at SpaceX vow to launch some undoubtedly rich eccentric into the deepest reaches of space by 2024: real people\u2019s lives will be on the line, and even in the best-case scenario, we may still have to reckon with our genetic origins as bastardized Martian-DNA descendants. Which would, at the very least, level the market value of 23andMe. Edge of Tomorrow This criminally slept-upon highlight of the past decade\u2019s blockbuster canon stuck Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt in the middle of a war-as-puzzle game, with Cruise getting infinite do-overs as a soldier inexplicably regenerating every time he dies. The script, an ingenious concoction of familiar tropes and subversions thereof, gave humanity five years until an unfriendly alien species crash-landing in 2015 has laid claim to most of continental Europe. But when that day does come and invaders descend from the sky, we\u2019ll be ready \u2013 Doug Liman\u2019s film realizes the chaos of cosmic war with a specificity unseen since Starship Troopers, but he does us the service of including instructions for victory. When the little green men (or, uh, giant ash-colored space wraiths) come for us, we\u2019ll know to douse ourselves in the blood of their armies\u2019 lieutenants and claim their power. And even if that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s still a pretty fearsome shock-and-awe military tactic. Real Steel The future has brought us so many wondrous advances, and yet it all still feels like a rip-off because we haven\u2019t perfected drag-down, no-holds-barred robo-boxing. In this CGI-slathered version of a similar Twilight Zone episode, Hugh Jackman cashed a check as a one-time human fighter training an android for greatness, but all the against-the-odds drama wasn\u2019t half as fascinating as the positing of a post-human athletics. Imagine the ethical quandaries wiped away when the NFL is a fully cybernetic league, no longer a seeding ground for the brain-bruising effects of CTE. On the other automated hand, however, the robots will almost certainly demand rights at some point down the line. And when they do, we will consider ourselves lucky if all they do in protest is kneel during the national anthem. Reign of Fire Though this film\u2019s trailer mistakenly announces it as taking place in \u201c2084 AD,\u201d in actuality the script envisioning a race of dragons awakened from their eternal slumber to besiege humanity plays out in 2020. It\u2019s then that heroes Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale launch a last-ditch counteroffensive against the fire-breathing reptilian menace, but based on all we have witnessed since the original release in 2002, director Rob Bowman\u2019s take on their plan is all but quaint. A band of rebels holds together and uses their wits to survive, while out in the real world, if gargantuan airborne beasts really did slither out of London, there\u2019s now little doubt that America would not think twice before bombing Blighty flat. Would a nuclear warhead be effective against a dragon? Only time will tell. Time will also only tell if dragons exist in the first place. Pacific Rim Guillermo del Toro situated a key piece of exposition in 2020 for his epic of kaiju-and-mech mayhem. His timeline starts in 2013, when an inter-dimensional rift allows the passage of terrible oceanic behemoths to Earth, and then jumps ahead to join protagonist Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) seven years later, as he and his brother give hell to a humongous monster termed Knifehead and stymie its efforts to eat Anchorage. (Only one of them comes home from the battle.) The script then advances five more years, but not before leaving us all with the precious lesson that in the inevitable interspecies conflict that will define the next century, even in triumph will we suffer great and personal losses. One can only hope that when that comes to pass, it will be at the hands of an opponent with a slightly better name than Knifehead. A Quiet Place Another 2020, another arrival from extraterrestrial hostiles, this time with the ability to hunt with surgical precision based on nothing but sound. John Krasinski and, once again, Emily Blunt (when they come for us, we shall turn to the experienced Cmdr Blunt to lead us) guide their nuclear family unit through a silent world where the slightest sneeze means instant death, and try to formulate a plan of attack to take their home back. As in Blunt\u2019s previous future-nightmare, the film comes packaged with the key to defeating our new foes, and this one\u2019s even easier than the bit with the alien blood. Simply tune a cochlear implant to the right frequency and the creatures go kablooey. One almost wonders how it took the Abbott clan so long to try this dogwhistle-type method, but thank our lucky stars that we\u2019ll be ready with the weaponized hearing aids when they come. Terminator: Dark Fate Those pesky killer automatons, always time-traveling to grandfather paradox the savior of we flesh-and-blood organisms out of existence. The latest installment in the long-running action franchise delivered a new menace (the Rev-9, capable of splitting into a liquid-metal form and endoskeleton form for twice the danger) and a new defender (Mackenzie Davis\u2019 Grace, a human-cyborg hybrid), but the moral of the story remained unchanged.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said it was \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d what the full economic cost of the bushfires would be, but emphasised the government had never seen the surplus as an \u201cend in itself\u201d, despite it being a prominent feature of this year\u2019s budget.</p> \n<p>Frydenberg said he would be meeting with the Australian Insurance Council, regulators and company chiefs on Tuesday to ensure insurance payments flowed to affected individuals as quickly as possible, with 6,000 payments totalling almost $400m already paid out.</p> \n<p>The treasurer also said the Australian Taxation Office had agreed to a two-month deferral for the tax obligations of people living in fire-affected areas, and banks were also assisting.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople should not be concerned about their tax affairs at this time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Greg Mullins, who chairs the Emergency Leaders for Climate Change group, welcomed extra resources from the federal government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/09/former-fire-chiefs-warn-australia-unprepared-for-escalating-climate-threat\">but said they had been snubbed when a request was first made in April.</a></p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see things finally moving but I hope in the future this government will learn to listen to people on the front line,\u201d Mullins said.</p> \n<p>He also criticised the government\u2019s inaction on climate change, saying it was a \u201cload of rubbish\u201d that the Coalition was taking strong action, with its ability to meet the Paris emission reduction targets based on its earlier \u201cweak\u201d Kyoto targets.</p> \n<p>\u201cI worry for my grandchildren, their grandchildren.

Warning that the fires would keep burning over the coming months, Morrison said further government funds may yet be forthcoming as the economic toll from the horror fire season continued to rise. \u201cThe fires are still burning, and they will be burning for months to come,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIf further funds are required, further funds will be provided.\u201d He said that across government \u201csignificant and massive\u201d financial commitments were being made, with the final cost likely to rival the $5.6bn paid out in disaster recovery assistance over six years following cyclone Yasi and the Brisbane floods. After meeting on Monday morning, cabinet signed off on an initial $2bn for a national bushfire recovery fund to be used to support the rebuilding of community infrastructure and to help affected farmers and businesses. The fund will be overseen by the newly established National Bushfire Recovery Agency, led by the former Australian Federal Police commissioner Andrew Colvin. This would include funding for roads and telecommunications, the restocking and replenishing of livestock for primary producers, mental health support, funding to attract tourists back to the regions and environmental restoration. The $2bn is in addition to disaster recovery payments and allowances for those affected, which have so far totalled more than $100m. The government also announced 20 Service Australia pop-ups would be set up to help people access government disaster payments, while mutual obligation and debt recovery for welfare payments in nominated areas would also be suspended. \u201cToday\u2019s cabinet was one of great resolve; it was one where we stood together and said, \u2018whatever it takes, whatever it costs, we will ensure the resilience and future of this country\u2019, and we will do it by investing in the work that needs to be done,\u201d Morrison said. When asked if the economic impact of the fires could jeopardise the $5bn surplus forecast for the 2019-20 year \u2013 the first in 12 years and a key election promise \u2013 Morrison said the government was not focused on the financial cost. \u201cThe surplus is of no focus for me, what matters to me is the human cost and meeting whatever costs we need to meet,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you this: being in the position of strength we are in now enables us to give what is one of the most significant, if not most significant, response to a crisis of this kind the country has seen.\u201d Morrison argued that the government was putting the surplus \u201cstraight to work\u201d to meet the needs of Australians, without having to put in place extra levies or make cuts. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said it was \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d what the full economic cost of the bushfires would be, but emphasised the government had never seen the surplus as an \u201cend in itself\u201d, despite it being a prominent feature of this year\u2019s budget. Frydenberg said he would be meeting with the Australian Insurance Council, regulators and company chiefs on Tuesday to ensure insurance payments flowed to affected individuals as quickly as possible, with 6,000 payments totalling almost $400m already paid out. The treasurer also said the Australian Taxation Office had agreed to a two-month deferral for the tax obligations of people living in fire-affected areas, and banks were also assisting. \u201cPeople should not be concerned about their tax affairs at this time,\u201d he said. Earlier, Greg Mullins, who chairs the Emergency Leaders for Climate Change group, welcomed extra resources from the federal government, but said they had been snubbed when a request was first made in April. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see things finally moving but I hope in the future this government will learn to listen to people on the front line,\u201d Mullins said. He also criticised the government\u2019s inaction on climate change, saying it was a \u201cload of rubbish\u201d that the Coalition was taking strong action, with its ability to meet the Paris emission reduction targets based on its earlier \u201cweak\u201d Kyoto targets. \u201cI worry for my grandchildren, their grandchildren. If this is how it is now, this is driven by climate change, imagine what future generations are up against.\u201d Morrison was again asked on Monday about the Coalition\u2019s climate change policies, which the former Liberal deputy leader Julie Bishop had criticised for lacking in global leadership. \u201cWe should be showing leadership on the issue of climate change. I attended a number of international conferences and countries do look to Australia for direction, for guidance and leadership. And I believe we should be showing leadership on the issue of climate change,\u201d Bishop told Nine\u2019s Today show. Morrison said his focus was on the $2bn package. \u201cThe government will continue to work to meet and beat the commitments we have made for emission reductions,\u201d Morrison said, emphasising that Bishop was part of the cabinet that signed off on the Coalition\u2019s policy. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, supported the funding for the recovery agency, saying Labor had been calling for greater federal assistance. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the government is now making a number of announcements that we have argued for, including the need for a national response, including the economic compensation for volunteer firefighters, including the upgrade of our aerial firefighting capacity, and the increased use of the defence force,\u201d Albanese said.",

Young women in particular are vulnerable to traffickers who befriend them with promises of romance. \u201cMost of the times they are afraid of the cities, they don\u2019t know the language, they live in the rented apartment where they are doing the sex work and they don\u2019t know anything better.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so frightening for someone coming from a village. It is shocking. That\u2019s why they stay, because they are so afraid. It makes them even more vulnerable, more attached to the pimp.\u201d</p> <p> Baptist Aid can get about 40 or 50 a year into shelters and help maybe another 100 more, but thousands of Hungarians are in similar positions around Europe. Jobs are advertised on Facebook, she says. One girl answered an advert for a babysitter. At the interview she was taken in a car to Slovakia and kept for two weeks until other girls arrived and then they were taken to the UK.</p> <p>They were told they could choose to be a prostitute or the wife of someone from a developing country. That girl escaped, she says, but blackmail is a problem. \u201cThere is usually a money-lender in the villages where the Roma live on the edges of towns and villages and they are always blackmailing the families every day, asking for more and more.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes they make the family work without pay to work off their debt and after a while they figure that if there is a young daughter in the family they can get rid of the debt. They threaten them with all kinds of things.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel Harper, helpline manager for the UK anti-trafficking charity <a href=\"https://www.unseenuk.org/\">Unseen</a>, says it has picked up dozens of cases of exploitation. \u201cTraffickers know where to find vulnerable individuals and how to target them, including online,\u201d she says. \u201cCases of modern slavery, across various types of exploitation, have been reported to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/25/uk-modern-slavery-helpline-receives-over-7000-calls-in-a-year\">Modern Slavery Helpline</a> where the potential exploiter initially contacted the potential victim, recruited them or exerted control via social media.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3daa68e0782b555186628f32af66e876f5a4a28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3daa68e0782b555186628f32af66e876f5a4a28/0_0_4928_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria was a UK sex worker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria was a UK sex worker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ion answered an advert on Facebook promising work and housing, but he reached the UK to be told he owed his trafficker money.

Szuda had worked as a prostitute herself, the judge said, before marrying Ring - a former client.</p> <p><br>Ivett Szuda may not have been an innocent abroad, despite her mother\u2019s protestations to the contrary, but researchers investigating trafficking from Hungary to the UK say many are and that social media has a key role in recruitment. The UN and European commission both list the UK as a major destination for Hungarians trafficked into labour exploitation. Other countries, notably Germany, the Netherlands and France, have higher rates of sexual exploitation but the UK is becoming an increasingly important destination.</p> <p>The European commission\u2019s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/member-states-0/Hungary_en\">Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings</a> document describes Hungary as \u201cprimarily a source and transit country for women and girls subjected to trafficking for sexual exploitation and for men and women for trafficking for labour exploitation\u201d.

They suspected that the platform was being used by people involved in trafficking to groom vulnerable young women who did not have a strong family network.</p> <p>The character they created was described as living in care and new to Facebook.

I just want to understand you.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers replied politely, making clear that the \u201cgirl\u201d was under the age of 18 and asking if that was OK. Of course, they told her. Don\u2019t worry.</p> <p>Then they asked more questions, probing for weaknesses. \u201cDo you have a good relationship with your parents? Do you have a lot of girlfriends? How close are you?\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take long \u2013 sometimes just a couple of chats \u2013 for the subject to turn to sex. Some men talked about sex after only two brief chats. There were naked pictures and questions about her own sex life. In the closed groups, there were leading questions.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you get that look, did your parents buy it? No? Oh, your parents are dead, oh that\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p> <p>It was clear, says Sebhelyi, that these were the same methods used in trafficking: the identification of a vulnerable target and then the grooming.</p> <p>Twitter\u2019s own rules prohibit the promotion of adult sexual content globally, including pornography, escort services and prostitution, though the existence of the #escort hashtag seems to fly in the face of this policy. Facebook forbids the publication of content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities.</p> <p>The challenge for anyone trying to prevent recruitment through Facebook or Twitter posts is the speed at which they appear and disappear and, as Sebhelyi notes, the ease with which victims can be drawn into private groups away from public scrutiny.

      "bodyText": "In the village of Bag, north-east of Budapest, the houses along the main street are smart and well-kept. Tucked behind, up a slight hill, where the buildings become bare brick and the tarmac road turns into a dust track, people sit on the ground in the afternoon sun, talking and playing cards. These are the Roma, or the Roma who remain in Hungary, where they live on society\u2019s edge, clinging on in the outskirts of towns and villages, shunned and stigmatised as potential criminals. Many have left, seeking a better life elsewhere in Europe, often in the UK. Poor and marginalised, they are easy pickings for traffickers who post adverts on Facebook promising a bright future for those prepared to travel. Many have succumbed to the temptation. A lot of young people have gone to the UK to work, say the people playing cards. One man who gives his name as Kalman says his 27-year-old sister has gone to Britain, to marry a Turkish man she had never met. An older man says many of his relatives have gone too. For a better life, he says. A woman holding a baby comes to the gate of her house. Sabrina says her sister is living in the UK after answering an advert on Facebook for an arranged marriage to an Iraqi man who wanted EU paperwork. The sister thought she\u2019d simply have a better life. Sabrina\u2019s husband emerges and shouts to her to come away from the gate. London, Manchester, Sheffield, Bolton, Leeds, Bristol \u2013 these are some of the cities where people have heard they can make money. The line between economic migration and exploitation is ill-defined: some who travel are aware of the risks but prepared to take a chance, others think they are off to start a better life only to end up in modern slavery. \u201cIt usually starts with some kind of promise that it is going to a better life,\u201d says Agnes De Coll, head of anti-trafficking for Hungarian Baptist Aid, an NGO working with the country\u2019s police. Young women in particular are vulnerable to traffickers who befriend them with promises of romance. \u201cMost of the times they are afraid of the cities, they don\u2019t know the language, they live in the rented apartment where they are doing the sex work and they don\u2019t know anything better. \u201cIt is so frightening for someone coming from a village. It is shocking. That\u2019s why they stay, because they are so afraid. It makes them even more vulnerable, more attached to the pimp.\u201d Baptist Aid can get about 40 or 50 a year into shelters and help maybe another 100 more, but thousands of Hungarians are in similar positions around Europe. Jobs are advertised on Facebook, she says. One girl answered an advert for a babysitter. At the interview she was taken in a car to Slovakia and kept for two weeks until other girls arrived and then they were taken to the UK. They were told they could choose to be a prostitute or the wife of someone from a developing country. That girl escaped, she says, but blackmail is a problem. \u201cThere is usually a money-lender in the villages where the Roma live on the edges of towns and villages and they are always blackmailing the families every day, asking for more and more. \u201cSometimes they make the family work without pay to work off their debt and after a while they figure that if there is a young daughter in the family they can get rid of the debt. They threaten them with all kinds of things.\u201d Rachel Harper, helpline manager for the UK anti-trafficking charity Unseen, says it has picked up dozens of cases of exploitation. \u201cTraffickers know where to find vulnerable individuals and how to target them, including online,\u201d she says. \u201cCases of modern slavery, across various types of exploitation, have been reported to the Modern Slavery Helpline where the potential exploiter initially contacted the potential victim, recruited them or exerted control via social media.\u201d Ion answered an advert on Facebook promising work and housing, but he reached the UK to be told he owed his trafficker money. He was threatened with violence, the wages he earned from a factory job taken from him. Mihai thought the advert he saw on Facebook would lead to a proper factory job, but he ended up picking vegetables for less than minimum wage, threatened with violence, even murder, kept in cramped accommodation and allowed no freedom. Maria Szuda stands in the darkness outside her apartment in the town of Orosh\u00e1za, 200km south-east of Budapest, drawing heavily on a cigarette, her face lit by the glow of her phone as she scrolls and then points at the screen \u2013 a Facebook page, post after post of adverts for work in or travel to the UK. Facebook was where her 32-year-old daughter Ivett was recruited. She has been in jail since January when a British jury convicted her and her husband Karl Ring, 34, of controlling the prostitution of women trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. \u201cTen floors of whores\u201d, a tabloid headlined the case: a London apartment block in Chelsea where Hungarians were brought in to work as prostitutes. The court heard they used low-cost airline Wizz Air to fly the women in before forcing them into sex work. Szuda had worked as a prostitute herself, the judge said, before marrying Ring - a former client. Ivett Szuda may not have been an innocent abroad, despite her mother\u2019s protestations to the contrary, but researchers investigating trafficking from Hungary to the UK say many are and that social media has a key role in recruitment. The UN and European commission both list the UK as a major destination for Hungarians trafficked into labour exploitation. Other countries, notably Germany, the Netherlands and France, have higher rates of sexual exploitation but the UK is becoming an increasingly important destination. The European commission\u2019s Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings document describes Hungary as \u201cprimarily a source and transit country for women and girls subjected to trafficking for sexual exploitation and for men and women for trafficking for labour exploitation\u201d. It is not an ethnic problem \u2013 there are both Roma and non-Roma \u2013 more one of poverty, poor education and high unemployment, says Hungarian trafficking expert Viktoria Sebhelyi. Curious about the role of social media in recruitment, Sebhelyi teamed up with child psychologist Dora Varga-Sabj\u00e1n to create a Facebook profile purporting to be that of a 16-year-old Hungarian girl. They suspected that the platform was being used by people involved in trafficking to groom vulnerable young women who did not have a strong family network. The character they created was described as living in care and new to Facebook. They had her join some popular groups and sat back to watch what happened next. Within two weeks the profile was contacted by 116 people \u2013 108 men and eight women, aged from 19 to 65. People added her to other closed groups. She was put in secret makeup and haircare groups where recruitment was going on. The men tended to open with a compliment \u2013 \u201cHi, I like your eyes\u201d \u2013 even though the researchers had only posted an avatar. \u201cI just want to make new friends. Is it okay? I don\u2019t want anything more. I just want to understand you.\u201d The researchers replied politely, making clear that the \u201cgirl\u201d was under the age of 18 and asking if that was OK. Of course, they told her. Don\u2019t worry. Then they asked more questions, probing for weaknesses. \u201cDo you have a good relationship with your parents? Do you have a lot of girlfriends? How close are you?\u201d It didn\u2019t take long \u2013 sometimes just a couple of chats \u2013 for the subject to turn to sex. Some men talked about sex after only two brief chats.

Oh, your parents are dead, oh that\u2019s interesting.\u201d It was clear, says Sebhelyi, that these were the same methods used in trafficking: the identification of a vulnerable target and then the grooming. Twitter\u2019s own rules prohibit the promotion of adult sexual content globally, including pornography, escort services and prostitution, though the existence of the #escort hashtag seems to fly in the face of this policy. Facebook forbids the publication of content that attempts to coordinate or recruit for adult sexual activities. The challenge for anyone trying to prevent recruitment through Facebook or Twitter posts is the speed at which they appear and disappear and, as Sebhelyi notes, the ease with which victims can be drawn into private groups away from public scrutiny. The Facebook page Maria Szuda was looking for was one of the largest UK forums for Hungarians - Legnagyobb Info Oldal Nagy-Britanni\u00e1ban. An array of messages advertise jobs and services, including people arranging travel to the UK. Most will be honest: spotting rogue ads is virtually impossible.

      "bodyText": "An 81-year-old retired academic is seeking to overturn a criminal conviction he received after taking part in an anti-apartheid protest that had been infiltrated by an undercover police officer. Jonathan Rosenhead is challenging his conviction for a public order offence during a demonstration in 1972. He recently discovered that one of the men who was convicted alongside him was an undercover police officer who was pretending to be a leftwing campaigner. The spy called himself Michael Scott and adopted a fake identity to infiltrate three leftwing groups, including the Anti-Apartheid Movement, for five years. Scott\u2019s superiors authorised him to use his fake identity in the criminal trial and to be convicted under his alias. Rosenhead\u2019s lawyers have written to the Crown Prosecution Service asking for copies of official documents relating to his conviction, which he plans to lodge an appeal against. The CPS said it believed that there was no reason to overturn his conviction. His case highlights how a significant number of protesters since 1968 could potentially have been unjustly convicted as key evidence gathered by undercover police officers was withheld from their trials. So far, 57 campaigners have established in recent years that they were wrongly convicted or prosecuted after discovering their protests had been infiltrated by undercover officers. An official report commissioned by the government has identified another 83 political campaigners whose convictions could also be in doubt because undercover operations were hidden from their trials. The 2015 report, by Mark Ellison QC, found that a Scotland Yard undercover unit that infiltrated political groups between 1968 and 2008 routinely ignored legal rules about disclosing the involvement of police spies to criminal trials. He reported that the unit at times failed to correct evidence given in court which it knew was wrong. Rosenhead, who studied operational research for 50 years at the London School of Economics, was involved in the campaign against apartheid for many years. In May 1972 he took part in a demonstration against the English rugby team which was about to go on tour in South Africa, at a time when campaigners were pressing for a sports boycott of the apartheid state. He and the other protesters blocked a coach carrying the team as it left a Surrey hotel for the airport. They left two locked vans and a car at the entrance of the hotel. Police arrested Rosenhead and 13 others. What he and the protesters did not know at the time was that Scott, one of those arrested, was an undercover police officer. Scott used his fake identity to infiltrate the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the Young Liberals and the Workers Revolutionary Party between 1971 and 1976. He was a member of the undercover unit, known as the Special Demonstration Squad, whose members spied on more than 1,000 political groups over 40 years. They developed elaborate fake identities and pretended to be political activists in deployments that usually lasted around five years. Scott is one of three undercover officers in the unit who are known to have spied on the Anti-Apartheid Movement in the 1960s and 1970s. A press report from the time recorded that he had told the court that his name was Scott and that he lived in Earls Court, west London. He also said he worked compiling estimates in the construction industry. Scott was convicted of obstructing the highway and a police officer, fined and given a conditional discharge. Rosenhead was fined the equivalent of \u00a3130 in today\u2019s money and ordered to pay another \u00a3130 in legal costs for obstructing the highway. Last year, a judge-led public inquiry that is examining the undercover infiltration of political movements notified Rosenhead of Scott\u2019s true identity. Rosenhead said: \u201cI think that this unit was out of control. It was violating our human and legal rights.\u201d A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cWe received a request from the defendant\u2019s legal team to review the circumstances of his arrest and conviction after the anti-apartheid protest in Richmond, Surrey, in 1972.

Using estimates given in the help-to-buy guidance of the retail prices index, which determines the interest rate charged, this would mean an extra \u00a3350 a month to pay, with none of that going towards reducing the size of the loan.

      "body": "<p>I don\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t feel fat. While I started piling on the pounds in my late teens, I was teased as young as eight for being chubby. The idea stuck. I remember overhearing my mum saying that she was worried I would get anorexia: I didn\u2019t even know what that was. Suffice to say, I never did. I felt fat long before I truly had a fat body, but eventually the latter caught up with the former. I tried to diet on and off from my late teens to my late 30s, but nothing stuck. I was deeply, painfully unhappy.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend throughout my 20s. Then, aged 30, I met my now ex-husband online, but that relationship was not without its complexities and I continued to gain weight. We got married in 2008. When we split up in 2013, I lost control and lived on junk food for a summer. I have always been an emotional eater and it was a vicious cycle.

I remember overhearing my mum saying that she was worried I would get anorexia: I didn\u2019t even know what that was. Suffice to say, I never did. I felt fat long before I truly had a fat body, but eventually the latter caught up with the former. I tried to diet on and off from my late teens to my late 30s, but nothing stuck. I was deeply, painfully unhappy. I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend throughout my 20s. Then, aged 30, I met my now ex-husband online, but that relationship was not without its complexities and I continued to gain weight. We got married in 2008. When we split up in 2013, I lost control and lived on junk food for a summer. I have always been an emotional eater and it was a vicious cycle. I was unhappy because I was fat, I ate because I was unhappy, then I gained weight because I ate. Then I made a decision to save my own life. I went to my GP and, as always, they asked about my weight \u2013 at 162kg (25 and a half stone), I was morbidly obese. This time, the doctor suggested weight-loss surgery. At first, I balked.

      "bodyText": "The number of publicly listed companies opting to leave the stock exchange and become private firms soared 40% last year, figures show. According to public data analysed by the law firm Pinsent Masons, 28 businesses listed in London were snapped up by private equity firms in \u201cpublic to private\u201d deals (P2Ps) in the UK last year, up from 20 in 2018. The value of deals more than doubled last year, to \u00a321.1bn in 2019, up 113% from \u00a39.9bn in 2018. The \u00a34bn buyout of defence group Cobham by US private equity group Advent International was the most high profile deal in a trend that goes back more than a decade for businesses to reject the stock market in favour of private ownership. A P2P occurs when a private equity (PE) fund, or a consortium of private equity funds, acquires the shares of a listed company. Private firms have also baulked at joining the stock market, which is considered a route to broader investments from pension funds, international investors and individual savers. According to data firm Dealogic, just 34 companies applied to be listed in the UK over the last year, the lowest number since 2009. The amount of money raised from new UK listings nearly halved compared with the year before to \u00a33.7bn. The decline in new listings and rise in the number of existing stock market listed firms quitting to go private is expected to accelerate a decline in the proportion of publicly listed companies, not just in London, but in most major stock markets. Pinsent Masons blamed Brexit uncertainties for depressing the value of UK-listed firms compared to their European counterparts and making them more attractive to foreign buyers. The rise in deals may also reflect management teams being more receptive to partnering with PE funds to take a company private, said the law firm. Managers may believe that public markets undervalue their companies and are therefore open to offers from PE funds, though a majority of shareholders must agree to any takeover bid. Julian Stanier, a partner at the law firm said: \u201cThe speed at which companies are going private principally boils down to depressed share prices, low interest rates and the massive firepower of Private Equity. \u201cAttractive valuations have enabled PE funds to acquire companies with strong fundamentals at prices below recent norms. We expect to see this activity continue into 2020. A new government with a strong majority has further added to the attractiveness of UK companies,\u201d he said.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to get you back into the news groove.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson has broken his silence on the killing of Qassem Suleimani by saying that the Iranian general was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/05/boris-johnson-qassem-suleimani-was-threat-to-all-our-interests-lament-death\">\u201cthreat to all our interests\u201d</a>, while Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/06/suleimani-killing-donald-trump-defends-threat-to-hit-cultural-sites-in-iran\">doubled down on his threat to strike at cultural sites</a> if Tehran retaliates. The prime minister, who returned from his holiday in the Caribbean on Sunday, called for all sides to de-escalate tensions and is expected to discuss the Iran crisis with ministers today. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab will brief parliament on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/05/britain-sympathetic-to-us-over-killing-of-qassem-suleimani\">before he meets US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in Washington</a> later in the week. In his latest comments, the US president defended the threat he made on Sunday to attack Iranian cultural sites if Tehran struck at American targets amid growing calls for him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/mike-pompeo-qassem-suleimani-killing-trump\">to give more justification for the drone strike</a>. Democratic presidential hopeful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/05/impeachment-warren-trump-wag-the-dog-qassem-suleimani-iran\">Elizabeth Warren accused the president </a>of trying to divert attention from his upcoming impeachment trial.</p> \n<p>In the Middle East, Suleimani\u2019s daughter told a ceremony in Tehran this morning that the families of American troops were \u201cwaiting for the death of their children\u201d. The huge gathering in the capital comes as the regime said it would no longer abide by any of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/iran-ends-nuclear-deal-commitments-suleimani-killing-iraqi-parliament-us-troops\">its commitments to the unravelling 2015 nuclear deal</a> despite the pleas of European powers.

      "bodyText": "Top story: PM breaks his silence as president defends tough talk Good morning, Happy New Year and welcome to the first briefing of 2020. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to get you back into the news groove. Boris Johnson has broken his silence on the killing of Qassem Suleimani by saying that the Iranian general was a \u201cthreat to all our interests\u201d, while Donald Trump has doubled down on his threat to strike at cultural sites if Tehran retaliates. The prime minister, who returned from his holiday in the Caribbean on Sunday, called for all sides to de-escalate tensions and is expected to discuss the Iran crisis with ministers today. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab will brief parliament on Tuesday before he meets US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in Washington later in the week. In his latest comments, the US president defended the threat he made on Sunday to attack Iranian cultural sites if Tehran struck at American targets amid growing calls for him to give more justification for the drone strike. Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren accused the president of trying to divert attention from his upcoming impeachment trial. In the Middle East, Suleimani\u2019s daughter told a ceremony in Tehran this morning that the families of American troops were \u201cwaiting for the death of their children\u201d. The huge gathering in the capital comes as the regime said it would no longer abide by any of its commitments to the unravelling 2015 nuclear deal despite the pleas of European powers. Across the border, the Iraqi parliament called for the expulsion of all foreign troops based in the country as part of the anti-Islamic State international coalition. Britain has 400 military personnel in Iraq. In Kenya, three Americans have been killed after Al-Shabaab insurgents attacked a military compound. * * * Golden night \u2013 British stars have had a night to remember at the Golden Globe awards in Hollywood. Olivia Colman won best drama actress for her portrayal of the Queen in The Crown, Brian Cox won for Succession and Phoebe Waller-Bridge won best TV comedy series and actress for Fleabag. Sam Mendes picked up from the screen talent when his first world war drama 1917 won best director and best drama film. The list of winners also included Chernobyl in the best limited TV series segment and it was a great night for Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood for which he claimed best comedy screenplay and Brad Pitt won best supporting comedy actor. Earlier, host Ricky Gervais ruffled feathers with his opening monologue and Billy Porter, Jennifer Lopez and Cynthia Erivo starred on the red carpet. On a more political note, Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett used their speeches to link the Australian bushfires to the climate crisis. * * * High pay \u2018shame\u2019 \u2013 The typical FTSE100 boss took just 33 hours to earn more than the typical worker\u2019s annual salary, according to figures compiled by the High Pay Centre. The average boss is paid 117 times more than the median worker, the data shows, at \u00a3901.30 an hour or \u00a33.46m a year. It means that by 5pm today the chief executives of Britain\u2019s largest listed businesses will have made more than the national median full-time annual pay of \u00a329,559, or about \u00a314.37 an hour. Unions said the statistics should be a \u201csource of national shame\u201d. * * * Weinstein in the dock \u2013 The long-awaited trial of film producer Harvey Weinstein is due to begin in New York today with testimony expected from two alleged victims of sexual assault. The 67-year-old denies five charges of sexual assault, including the rape of a longtime lover in 2013, in the case that helped to spark the #MeToo movement.

Plans for development include a new tasting room and visitor centre overlooking the vineyards, new tours and increased wine storage capacity in a new underground cellar. Hambledon is the only gravity-fed winery in the UK, allowing wines to be created with minimal intervention and more energy efficient production. \u2022 hambledonvineyard.co.uk Derby Silk Mill: Museum of Making \u2013 autumn Aiming to inspire a new generation of makers and innovators, a former silk mill at Unesco world heritage site Derwent Valley Mills is the new home of 50,000 objects from the area\u2019s 300-year-long industrial history. Lombe\u2019s Mill is thought to be one of the first fully mechanised factories in the world, and will be the home of the new Museum of Making. The Rolls-Royce Eagle Engine, which helped power the first transatlantic flight in 1919, will be among the exhibits, alongside significant items from railway and (more recent) gaming history, and more.

He even filmed his own family in a 2007 documentary, L\u2019Aim\u00e9e. \u201cYou work on a production, you want it to be the best it can be. The rest doesn\u2019t concern me.\u201d Not even, I ask, when he was sued, unsuccessfully, by his former partner Marianne Denicourt, who claimed in her 2005 book Evil Genius that Desplechin had lifted painful episodes from her personal life without permission to write Kings and Queen? Desplechin appears unconcerned: \u201cOf my films, it\u2019s the one that performed best at the box office, what can I tell you?\u201d The rest of his family, he adds, has learned to live with it. \u201cYou know what they say: there is no worse curse than to have a child who is a writer. If you\u2019re Kafka\u2019s father, you\u2019re not going to be very pleased.\u201d Does Desplechin hope his own son won\u2019t turn to writing? He laughs. \u201cLook how much of a masochist I am. Of course I hope he\u2019ll be Kafka! As long as I\u2019m good material for him.\u201d Desplechin seems genuinely happy to take a back seat for his Angels in America \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m here to serve Kushner, that\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 and to see A Christmas Tale reinvented for the stage. Don\u2019t expect him to write a play any time soon, however. \u201cI feel like you need a lifetime of theatre experience to do that.

I\u2019ve been propagating trees here [in the UK] and taking them to France to plant out.

Completely unaffordable at my scale of operation. So I\u2019ll take as many trees as I can, and from next year on I\u2019ll have to change the way I work, to try to propagate my trees in France, which will be tricky, as I\u2019m not there all the time.</p> <p>I might have to dig a large pond and grow my tree seedlings on rafts, hydroponically, so they\u2019ll be protected from slugs, mice, deer, boar and rabbits.

      "bodyText": "British citizens will no longer be EU citizens from 31 January if the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson sealed in October is ratified. But Brexit day will not be the full stop on almost three decades in which British people, like their counterparts across the EU, had the freedom to travel, work and retire in any other member states visa-free. Those rights are scheduled to end on 31 December, when the transition period expires, freedom of movement ends and Britain leaves the single market. We asked readers what they would like to do in the last 11 months in which these benefits of EU membership apply. John Pedersen, 63, Totnes Plan: Take as many trees as I can to the Dordogne I have 25 acres of land by the Dordogne. No house there, just the land. I built a tiny cabin on it. I\u2019m there spring and autumn planting a forest garden. I\u2019ve been propagating trees here [in the UK] and taking them to France to plant out. All sorts of things: pomegranates, peaches, nectarines, walnuts and lots of rootstocks I can graft apples and pears and so on on to. This will be the last year I\u2019ll be able to so freely take my trees over the border. After Brexit, I\u2019ll almost certainly need a phytosanitary certificate for each species of tree. Completely unaffordable at my scale of operation. So I\u2019ll take as many trees as I can, and from next year on I\u2019ll have to change the way I work, to try to propagate my trees in France, which will be tricky, as I\u2019m not there all the time. I might have to dig a large pond and grow my tree seedlings on rafts, hydroponically, so they\u2019ll be protected from slugs, mice, deer, boar and rabbits. For some of the people I\u2019ve got to know in the business, Brexit will be a disaster, as some of them sell the great majority of their plants to the EU. Emma (name changed) Unemployed and disabled Plan: Get an electric wheelchair in the EU I will continue my discrimination claim against the government body that I worked for, using the fair laws from the EU that cover workers\u2019 rights before they are rewritten and possibly withdrawn by the Tories to exclude holiday pay or disability support. I\u2019d love to visit some more EU countries, but as my NHS wheelchair provider has been privatised, I need to fund \u00a36,000 for the electric wheelchair suggested by said provider before I can leave the house independently or at least with minimal support. Please note that research has shown there to be other options at much lower price points, but they have not been considered by the provider. I think I will also invest some of my time investigating the possibility of remaining an EU dual national by descent as my mum\u2019s family are Irish immigrants, but it\u2019s OK because she voted Tory as she says, \u201cWe have too many immigrants in this country.\u201d I might also look for a new, less xenophobic family. Fergal (name changed), 63, Dumfries Consultant surgeon I am living and still working with metastatic lung cancer. I cannot get affordable travel insurance. After we leave the UK I will be unable to visit Europe again, which is especially bad because I plan to retire next year. James Tasker, 23, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Accountancy student Plan: Interrail across Europe I am devastated that within a year\u2019s time I\u2019ll cease to be an EU citizen, but I intend to make the most of it. Once I graduate I plan to embark on a few weeks interrailing through most of northern and central Europe; I\u2019m going to visit cities across Germany, Austria, Hungary and Switzerland and develop my German language skills. Other than that, I\u2019ll try to visit as many of my EU friends whom are dotted across Europe whilst it is still practical to do so. CJ Brown, 50s, London IT finance and risk Plan: Move to an EU state with accelerated route to citizenship for skilled workers I am going to move to one of the smaller EU27 countries that has an accelerated route to citizenship for highly qualified or skilled workers. Several of the eastern EU countries have this \u2013 Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, for example. I have enough in the bank to afford to support myself in such a move, to set up a start-up or work for a firm over there. Whichever country I settle in, I intend to have a sideline recruiting highly skilled finance &amp; IT workers who are also looking for a quick route to EU citizenship. I expect this brain drain to really accelerate in 2020 during the transition period. The UK will become a goldmine for talent for smaller EU countries. Evan Alston, 55, Edinburgh Delivery driver Plan: Get an Irish passport Make sure I obtain Irish citizenship and then a passport ASAP. I had an Irish grandmother who left the Republic because she didn\u2019t fancy a life of drudgery on the family farm. She watched part of the 1916 Rising across the street from the GPO (General Post Office, centre of the battle) and got shot at. Most importantly, I\u2019m going to spend the year telling my European friends and colleagues that I love them and that Scotland needs them to stay. I\u2019ve always wanted the UK to stay together but that is over so I\u2019ll be campaigning for Indyref2 and a Yes vote. Finally, I\u2019ll be making a special effort to be kind to folks. This is so important at this time. P.s. I\u2019d also like to take a train journey on to the continent in late May/early June. No more flying.

I\u2019ve never looked back and will continue to visit Europe as long as my health allows it. I love this country but now it feels mean and I feel like I\u2019m wandering in a wasteland. My partner and I are going off in our camper van in January, we aren\u2019t sure where we are going but we are getting out of here for a while, probably down to Spain and Portugal. Later in the year I hope to visit my cousin in Italy \u2013 she is English but has been married to an Italian doctor and has lived in Italy for 35 years and she is very sad to see us leaving and I am heart-broken too.

This whole circus pantomime played out right in front of our eyes and showed failings on all sides but was so intense it opened people\u2019s eyes and I wasn\u2019t surprised at the result of OUR general election. Macy, 32, Manchester Student nurse Plan: might move to Netherlands I would like to move to the Netherlands permanently so I can be with my fianc\u00e9 and work as a nurse after I graduate. I was hoping to work for the NHS for a while before moving but with the GE [General Election] result I will have to move sooner. I can\u2019t stand to see the NHS fall apart under another Tory government, the stress of the job is too much even as a student and seeing my nursing colleagues struggle day after day unsafe staffing levels is too much. With leaving to Europe I need to get my skates on as my nursing degree may not be recognised and I will have to apply as a third country which involves a more complex, lengthy and expensive application process. Fingers crossed I can pass the Dutch language test and get on their nursing register before the Dec 2020 deadline.",

She signed off on the repossession of her home in Surrey and moved to London, close to friends, into a \u201cgorgeous, French-style apartment, with flowers and plants everywhere and so much light,\u201d she says, eyes widening. She had 12 months of trauma therapy, which she describes as \u201cthe best gift I ever gave myself\u201d. And she won one of the leading roles in the West End production of the musical <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2019/nicola-roberts-cit-of-angels/\" title=\"\">City of Angels</a>, which opens in March.</p> <p>We meet at a canalside bar in London just before Christmas. \u201cPrior to this year, I\u2019d say I had five of the unhappiest years of my life. Just really tough emotionally,\u201d she says. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/22/cps-apologises-to-girls-aloud-star-for-not-prosecuting-stalker\" title=\"\">There was a long period in which an ex-boyfriend harassed and stalked her</a>, which led to his prosecution in 2017, all of which \u201ctook a massive toll on my life\u201d, she says. \u201cI had a few heartbreaks along the way. I was kind of ground down.\u201d Roberts says that just two years ago she would not merely have lacked the confidence to audition for her new role \u2013 \u201cI actually would have been terrified for it to be in the public domain that I was going to be in the same space every night, because I was fearful for my safety\u201d.</p> <p>In Josie Rourke\u2019s award-winning production of City of Angels, Roberts plays Avril, an actor, and Mallory, the character Avril is playing. Her acting coach has had to remind her to exaggerate: to make her gestures big enough, declarative enough, to reach the back of the house. Roberts, 34, tiny in a black satin tracksuit, shrinks at the thought. \u201cIt goes against everything in me. I like everything to be natural \u2026 believable.\u201d</p> <p>This instinct for subtlety is not synonymous with most pop stars \u2013 particularly pop stars who started out on TV talent shows. But Roberts has always been different. She entered the limelight in 2002, aged 16, by auditioning for the singing competition Popstars: The Rivals while on a family holiday after her GCSEs. She became the youngest member of the band Girls Aloud, who won the show. They went on to have 21 Top 10 singles, including four No 1s; two of their five albums topped the charts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7062f6b438eac7591e8a6b43528fb51f003da455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7062f6b438eac7591e8a6b43528fb51f003da455/0_0_1644_2368/694.jpg\" alt=\"Girls Aloud in 2002\" width=\"694\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>(Left to right) </em>Sarah Harding, Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Cheryl and Kimberley Walsh of Girls Aloud in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: balkanpix.com/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roberts was one of the group\u2019s most recognisable faces, known as the alternative one, set apart from the other four not only by her red hair and pale skin, but by her measuredness and taste. She was often described by interviewers as \u201csulky\u201d or \u201creserved\u201d.</p> <p>There were health difficulties \u2013 hypoglycaemia and anaemia \u2013 exacerbated by the gruelling performance schedule. And there was grotesque bullying over her appearance. When Matt Willis from the band Busted called her a \u201crude ginger bitch\u201d in 2003, she made a stand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/04/nicola-roberts-cinderellas-eyes\" title=\"\">painting his words on a skirt</a>, then performing in it. In 2007, Lily Allen called her \u201cthe ugly one\u201d from Girls Aloud, while Chris Moyles, who was then a BBC Radio 1 DJ, insulted Roberts for years, calling her the \u201cropey-looking ginger one\u201d, \u201chorsey chops\u201d and a \u201csour-faced old cow\u201d. (Moyles made a non-apology in 2012.)</p> <p>Today, Roberts downplays the impact on her self-esteem, but she marvels at how beauty standards have changed. In 2008, she launched a makeup line, Dainty Doll, to cater for those with a pale complexion. \u201cI struggled all the time to find makeup that was light enough,\u201d she says. The palest available shade would be \u201cfive shades too dark \u2013 but, again, that was because of beauty trends at the time. People weren\u2019t pale. Everyone was on the sunbed and using fake tan ... It\u2019s just crazy now, isn\u2019t it, to think that?\u201d</p> <p>Early in her career, Roberts had tried sunbeds. But after presenting a BBC Three documentary about the health risks in 2010, she joined the then Labour MP Julie Morgan\u2019s campaign to ban under-18s from using them; the law was introduced the following year.</p> <p>For Roberts, the legacy of Girls Aloud is her friendships with her bandmates Kimberley Walsh and Cheryl (with whom she continues to collaborate; she co-wrote Cheryl\u2019s recent singles). \u201cKimberley and Cheryl are really like my roots \u2013 there\u2019s such a deep thread there. We\u2019ve gone through everything together. Everything.\u201d</p> <p>The group went on hiatus in 2009 to allow each member to pursue solo projects. Roberts changed management, ended a six-year relationship and experienced a sort of delayed adolescence. She also released her debut solo album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/25/nicola-roberts-cinderellas-eyes\" title=\"\">Cinderella\u2019s Eyes</a>, in 2011, informed by her struggles to fit in. It was widely acclaimed by critics for its musical idiosyncrasies and lyrical insight \u2013 in the ballad Sticks + Stones, Roberts sang of \u201cbeing told I\u2019m ugly, over and over\u201d and pleading with her driver to buy her vodka to help her cope.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kimberley and Cheryl are really like my roots \u2013 we\u2019ve gone through everything together</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The band split for good in 2013, after their 10th-anniversary tour, and Roberts was finally outside the long-standing group dynamic. Roberts has always been \u201cemotionally independent\u201d, something she credits to being the eldest sibling of four. \u201cI just handle everything myself,\u201d she says. But she was forced to accept the limits of that approach when she was stalked by a former partner. From 2012 to 2017, Carl Davies \u2013 an ex-soldier Roberts dated seriously before an acrimonious split in 2008 \u2013 sent Roberts thousands of messages over Twitter and Instagram, including some that were described in court as \u201cviolent and threatening\u201d. Davies also sent proclamations of love and had flowers delivered to Roberts\u2019 manager\u2019s office.</p> <p>Roberts never replied, but she documented 3,000 messages over five years, only going to the police in 2017 when Davies started contacting her friend, the R&amp;B singer Joel Compass. For a long time, Roberts says, her approach to the harassment had been to \u201cprocess it and process it and process it myself \u2026 until it just became explosive\u201d. She wrote in her victim impact statement that the messages had been a reminder of \u201call the terrible things\u201d in her relationship with Davies: \u201cIt was like walking on eggshells.\u201d</p> <p>In May 2017, Davies admitted one count of stalking and another of persistent use of public communication networks to cause annoyance or inconvenience, for which he was handed a 15-month suspended prison sentence (meaning he served no time). He was also given a lifetime restraining order, prohibiting him from contacting or approaching Roberts or any member of her family. His defence said Davies had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Afghanistan and noted that Roberts had not told him to stop sending the messages.</p> <p>Just a few months after his sentencing, Davies was accused of breaching the restraining order by following Roberts on Instagram \u2013 but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges on the advice that there was little chance of a conviction. In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/22/cps-apologises-to-girls-aloud-star-for-not-prosecuting-stalker\" title=\"\">the CPS </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/22/cps-apologises-to-girls-aloud-star-for-not-prosecuting-stalker\" title=\"\">apologised for that decision</a>, which Roberts\u2019 lawyer said reflected a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about social media.</p> <p>Roberts says of the apology now: \u201cIt was too late. That\u2019s the first time in my whole life, I am extremely fortunate to say, that I ever felt [I\u2019d been done] an injustice because I was a woman ... I felt genuinely begrudged, like something extremely unfair was placed upon me, because I was a woman. And it was a horrible feeling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d454c1425b9d31091de075cba57334a388913642\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d454c1425b9d31091de075cba57334a388913642/0_0_3000_1990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Roberts (centre) on stage with Girls Aloud in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberts <em>(centre)</em> on stage with Girls Aloud in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Etheridge-Barnes/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think sometimes certain behaviour of men is seen as normal or usual \u2013 but it\u2019s never normal or usual to the victim, ever. It\u2019s horrific.\u201d</p> <p>Does she have any closure now? \u201cIt\u2019s behind me in my everyday life, and that has been a blessing. It\u2019s behind me in that I don\u2019t have, like, a paranoia that I had before. I don\u2019t feel scared.\u201d</p> <p>When the messages started, anticipation was high for a follow-up to Cinderella\u2019s Eyes, but years of fearing for her safety took a \u201cmassive toll\u201d on Roberts\u2019 confidence. \u201cTo have these bloody messages, life-threatening messages, every day \u2013 it just ground me down. I\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m being creative, with a project to work on \u2013 but I just couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d sit with the pen and go to write and I\u2019d be like: \u2018This. Is. Shiiit.\u2019 Like: \u2018I can\u2019t get out of me what I want to get out.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two changes enabled her to move on. The first was \u201cgetting out of that house\u201d in Surrey, where she had felt so afraid. In October, she signed off on the repossession of the \u00a31.25m home; she had been trying to sell it since 2017, slashing the price to \u00a3825,000.</p> <p>Roberts says now that she was \u201cscared to be there\u201d. \u201cIt was a prison \u2013 a horrible, horrible prison \u2026 I\u2019d just had enough.\u201d Moving to London, closer to her friends, has made a \u201cmassive contribution\u201d to her happiness.</p> <p>But most transformative was her year of trauma therapy. Before this, Roberts says, she had a tendency to put her feelings in a box, then set them to one side. \u201cIt got to a point where I was compartmentalising everything \u2026 the box just got full.\u201d She laughs, before continuing. \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want this to affect me any more \u2013 it is my responsibility to make me happy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In therapy, there was no way of separating out the different parts of her life and herself. She draws a parallel with getting a neck massage: \u201cThey start doing your back and you\u2019re like: \u2018I don\u2019t want my back done,\u2019 and they\u2019re like: \u2018Well, you gotta do your neck to do your back, y\u2019know?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWe opened all the boxes. I feel like it\u2019s just changed me in the most amazing way, for ever.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXbmBr5QXVc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uXbmBr5QXVc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Roberts\u2019 song Sticks + Stones.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the past, Roberts was \u201ca fixer\u201d in relationships \u2013 not any more, she says. She has developed her boundaries. \u201cIt means that you take all the red flags that pop up extremely seriously and you turn around and walk the other way, straight away. Things that maybe you would tolerate before, or things that you would [explain away and] be like: \u2018Oh, you know, it\u2019s because they\u2019re ...\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI have been too unhappy and I am now so happy \u2013 I will never let anything disrupt that. So unless you are continuing with me in this happy, peaceful state, you\u2019re not getting near me.\u201d</p> <p>Roberts is single now, but open to a relationship with the right person. The bar is set high. \u201cI don\u2019t like the feeling of being unhappy. I don\u2019t like the feeling of being unsure about myself, or uncertain with where something\u2019s going \u2013 I would rather turn away. I just can\u2019t feel like that ever again. It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d</p> <p>For now, she is focusing on her career. Roberts decided 18 months ago that she wanted to act, but she waited long after signing with an agent for the right debut project \u2013 \u201cright\u201d meaning \u201cnothing too happy or too obvious\u201d. She says she is \u201cnot really a girl that you can just throw into anything \u2013 it has to really resonate with me in order for it to work\u201d.</p> <p>New music may be on the way, too: Roberts makes passing reference to having been in the studio with Fred Ball, a producer for Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z. She won\u2019t be drawn on specifics, but she says she and Ball have known each other for years and that he had commented on how \u201ccalm and different\u201d she seemed. \u201cAnd I could honestly say: \u2018Yeah \u2013 I just feel happy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Roberts says that, perhaps for the first time, she is gaining weight. \u201cI have boobs, I have a bum,\u201d she says delightedly. \u201cI threw out 17 pairs of jeans \u2013 can\u2019t get them past my thighs. But I welcome it. I always just had a sort of nervous energy running through me, no matter how much I ate \u2026 When I eat spaghetti every day, it makes a difference now, whereas it didn\u2019t before \u2013 but I love it.\u201d She catches herself, rolls her eyes. \u201cLike, if I see a picture, I\u2019m like: \u2018OK, mate \u2013 don\u2019t get too excited.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Roberts does not feel angry about the past five years. \u201cI feel sad that it happened to me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel like it led me to do therapy and the therapy has been the best thing I could ever have done for myself. It\u2019s honestly just changed me so much, and I\u2019m so thankful for that.</p> <p>\u201cEqually, you know, I don\u2019t want this to read that I\u2019m thankful for that period of time, because I\u2019m definitely not.\u201d But without therapy, she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have got to this place, who I am now. I\u2019m calm. I\u2019m confident again. I\u2019m excited.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of relationships in my life that weren\u2019t quite on the same frequency as me. Romantic, career-wise, friendships \u2013 I needed to just leave some behind to then make room for people who really got on my wavelength.\u201d</p> <p>She has learned something important about herself. \u201cThe therapist did say to me I was one of the most resilient people she\u2019d ever met. I was like: OK.\u201d She looks, fleetingly, happy and proud \u2013 then returns to her resting temperature, characteristically cool. \u201cI mean, it might be something she says about everyone.\u201d</p> <p><em>City of Angels is at the <a href=\"https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/city-of-angels/\" title=\"\">Garrick theatre, London</a>, from 5 March to 5 September</em></p>",

But after presenting a BBC Three documentary about the health risks in 2010, she joined the then Labour MP Julie Morgan\u2019s campaign to ban under-18s from using them; the law was introduced the following year. For Roberts, the legacy of Girls Aloud is her friendships with her bandmates Kimberley Walsh and Cheryl (with whom she continues to collaborate; she co-wrote Cheryl\u2019s recent singles). \u201cKimberley and Cheryl are really like my roots \u2013 there\u2019s such a deep thread there. We\u2019ve gone through everything together. Everything.\u201d The group went on hiatus in 2009 to allow each member to pursue solo projects. Roberts changed management, ended a six-year relationship and experienced a sort of delayed adolescence. She also released her debut solo album, Cinderella\u2019s Eyes, in 2011, informed by her struggles to fit in. It was widely acclaimed by critics for its musical idiosyncrasies and lyrical insight \u2013 in the ballad Sticks + Stones, Roberts sang of \u201cbeing told I\u2019m ugly, over and over\u201d and pleading with her driver to buy her vodka to help her cope. The band split for good in 2013, after their 10th-anniversary tour, and Roberts was finally outside the long-standing group dynamic. Roberts has always been \u201cemotionally independent\u201d, something she credits to being the eldest sibling of four. \u201cI just handle everything myself,\u201d she says. But she was forced to accept the limits of that approach when she was stalked by a former partner. From 2012 to 2017, Carl Davies \u2013 an ex-soldier Roberts dated seriously before an acrimonious split in 2008 \u2013 sent Roberts thousands of messages over Twitter and Instagram, including some that were described in court as \u201cviolent and threatening\u201d. Davies also sent proclamations of love and had flowers delivered to Roberts\u2019 manager\u2019s office. Roberts never replied, but she documented 3,000 messages over five years, only going to the police in 2017 when Davies started contacting her friend, the R&amp;B singer Joel Compass. For a long time, Roberts says, her approach to the harassment had been to \u201cprocess it and process it and process it myself \u2026 until it just became explosive\u201d. She wrote in her victim impact statement that the messages had been a reminder of \u201call the terrible things\u201d in her relationship with Davies: \u201cIt was like walking on eggshells.\u201d In May 2017, Davies admitted one count of stalking and another of persistent use of public communication networks to cause annoyance or inconvenience, for which he was handed a 15-month suspended prison sentence (meaning he served no time). He was also given a lifetime restraining order, prohibiting him from contacting or approaching Roberts or any member of her family. His defence said Davies had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Afghanistan and noted that Roberts had not told him to stop sending the messages. Just a few months after his sentencing, Davies was accused of breaching the restraining order by following Roberts on Instagram \u2013 but the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges on the advice that there was little chance of a conviction. In 2018, the CPS apologised for that decision, which Roberts\u2019 lawyer said reflected a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about social media. Roberts says of the apology now: \u201cIt was too late. That\u2019s the first time in my whole life, I am extremely fortunate to say, that I ever felt [I\u2019d been done] an injustice because I was a woman ... I felt genuinely begrudged, like something extremely unfair was placed upon me, because I was a woman. And it was a horrible feeling. \u201cI think sometimes certain behaviour of men is seen as normal or usual \u2013 but it\u2019s never normal or usual to the victim, ever. It\u2019s horrific.\u201d Does she have any closure now? \u201cIt\u2019s behind me in my everyday life, and that has been a blessing. It\u2019s behind me in that I don\u2019t have, like, a paranoia that I had before. I don\u2019t feel scared.\u201d When the messages started, anticipation was high for a follow-up to Cinderella\u2019s Eyes, but years of fearing for her safety took a \u201cmassive toll\u201d on Roberts\u2019 confidence. \u201cTo have these bloody messages, life-threatening messages, every day \u2013 it just ground me down. I\u2019m happiest when I\u2019m being creative, with a project to work on \u2013 but I just couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d sit with the pen and go to write and I\u2019d be like: \u2018This. Is. Shiiit.\u2019 Like: \u2018I can\u2019t get out of me what I want to get out.\u2019\u201d Two changes enabled her to move on. The first was \u201cgetting out of that house\u201d in Surrey, where she had felt so afraid. In October, she signed off on the repossession of the \u00a31.25m home; she had been trying to sell it since 2017, slashing the price to \u00a3825,000. Roberts says now that she was \u201cscared to be there\u201d. \u201cIt was a prison \u2013 a horrible, horrible prison \u2026 I\u2019d just had enough.\u201d Moving to London, closer to her friends, has made a \u201cmassive contribution\u201d to her happiness. But most transformative was her year of trauma therapy. Before this, Roberts says, she had a tendency to put her feelings in a box, then set them to one side. \u201cIt got to a point where I was compartmentalising everything \u2026 the box just got full.\u201d She laughs, before continuing. \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want this to affect me any more \u2013 it is my responsibility to make me happy.\u2019\u201d In therapy, there was no way of separating out the different parts of her life and herself. She draws a parallel with getting a neck massage: \u201cThey start doing your back and you\u2019re like: \u2018I don\u2019t want my back done,\u2019 and they\u2019re like: \u2018Well, you gotta do your neck to do your back, y\u2019know?\u2019 \u201cWe opened all the boxes. I feel like it\u2019s just changed me in the most amazing way, for ever.\u201d In the past, Roberts was \u201ca fixer\u201d in relationships \u2013 not any more, she says. She has developed her boundaries. \u201cIt means that you take all the red flags that pop up extremely seriously and you turn around and walk the other way, straight away. Things that maybe you would tolerate before, or things that you would [explain away and] be like: \u2018Oh, you know, it\u2019s because they\u2019re ...\u2019 \u201cI have been too unhappy and I am now so happy \u2013 I will never let anything disrupt that. So unless you are continuing with me in this happy, peaceful state, you\u2019re not getting near me.\u201d Roberts is single now, but open to a relationship with the right person. The bar is set high. \u201cI don\u2019t like the feeling of being unhappy. I don\u2019t like the feeling of being unsure about myself, or uncertain with where something\u2019s going \u2013 I would rather turn away. I just can\u2019t feel like that ever again. It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d For now, she is focusing on her career. Roberts decided 18 months ago that she wanted to act, but she waited long after signing with an agent for the right debut project \u2013 \u201cright\u201d meaning \u201cnothing too happy or too obvious\u201d. She says she is \u201cnot really a girl that you can just throw into anything \u2013 it has to really resonate with me in order for it to work\u201d. New music may be on the way, too: Roberts makes passing reference to having been in the studio with Fred Ball, a producer for Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z. She won\u2019t be drawn on specifics, but she says she and Ball have known each other for years and that he had commented on how \u201ccalm and different\u201d she seemed. \u201cAnd I could honestly say: \u2018Yeah \u2013 I just feel happy.\u2019\u201d Roberts says that, perhaps for the first time, she is gaining weight. \u201cI have boobs, I have a bum,\u201d she says delightedly. \u201cI threw out 17 pairs of jeans \u2013 can\u2019t get them past my thighs. But I welcome it. I always just had a sort of nervous energy running through me, no matter how much I ate \u2026 When I eat spaghetti every day, it makes a difference now, whereas it didn\u2019t before \u2013 but I love it.\u201d She catches herself, rolls her eyes. \u201cLike, if I see a picture, I\u2019m like: \u2018OK, mate \u2013 don\u2019t get too excited.\u2019\u201d Roberts does not feel angry about the past five years. \u201cI feel sad that it happened to me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel like it led me to do therapy and the therapy has been the best thing I could ever have done for myself. It\u2019s honestly just changed me so much, and I\u2019m so thankful for that. \u201cEqually, you know, I don\u2019t want this to read that I\u2019m thankful for that period of time, because I\u2019m definitely not.\u201d But without therapy, she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have got to this place, who I am now. I\u2019m calm. I\u2019m confident again. I\u2019m excited. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of relationships in my life that weren\u2019t quite on the same frequency as me. Romantic, career-wise, friendships \u2013 I needed to just leave some behind to then make room for people who really got on my wavelength.\u201d She has learned something important about herself. \u201cThe therapist did say to me I was one of the most resilient people she\u2019d ever met. I was like: OK.\u201d She looks, fleetingly, happy and proud \u2013 then returns to her resting temperature, characteristically cool. \u201cI mean, it might be something she says about everyone.\u201d City of Angels is at the Garrick theatre, London, from 5 March to 5 September",

Maybe that\u2019s all the show can be right now, for better and worse. Or that\u2019s just complacency talking and the real solution\u2014to the Golden Globes, not the world\u2019s troubles\u2014is to do some kind of radical shakeup next year. To introduce some actually edgy host, to honor a bold and forward-thinking array of nominees, to conjure up a sense that all the glitz has a real cultural sum to it.

It\u2019s voted on by a mysterious, and mysteriously small, group of less than 100 journalists and the choices they make are often downright bizarre (two-time Golden Globe winner Mozart in the Jungle) but it\u2019s reliably star-packed and its nifty slot at the very start of the new year does make it a vital conversation-continuer.</p> <p>It\u2019s a strange old awards season thus far without a clear front-runner and instead, a group of films that could all conceivably make their way to the biggest prize. On the film end, tonight should give us a bit more clarity in a number of key categories, especially in best drama which will give us a better idea of whether The Irishman or Marriage Story will be the Netflix success story at next month\u2019s Oscars. Comedy-wise, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is likely to make a strong showing.</p> <p>But arguably the person who most in the industry and at home will be looking out for is host Ricky Gervais, returning for a record fifth time, already promising to deliver the catty quips we expect. But how will they go down in 2020 after a year of mostly host-free awards ceremonies? Or even when hosts have commandeered events, they\u2019ve played it nice rather than nasty. Gervais, who once described a Golden Globe win as \u201cworthless\u201d, has a tough job on his hands.</p> <p>We\u2019ll be here all night to comment on the wins, the loses and the jabs in-between.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "It was a rather lacklustre night at the Globes, a shame for a star-packed ceremony that can often be rather loose and fun, despite some wacky choices. There were less alcohol-fuelled antics and although host Ricky Gervais kept promising to set fire to the rich and famous, all he did was throw a wet sparkler. The awards themselves were a mixed bag but one with more treats than tricks with some deserved small screen prizes for Fleabag, Succession and Chernobyl and some pleasing wins for Sam Mendes, Renee Zellweger and Awkwafina on the big screen. Interestingly, one of the biggest contenders of the night, The Irishman, went home empty-handed and its backer Netflix almost did the same, scooping up just two awards from its 34 nominations. By the end the night told or reinforced to us a number of things: being an awards show host remains a thankless task, 1917 is a genuine best picture contender at the Oscars and Michelle Williams gives a more convincing speech than most politicians. For now, it\u2019s over but awards season has just begun. Aaaaand here\u2019s the full news wrap: Here\u2019s another one of the night\u2019s most emotive speeches in case you haven\u2019t yet seen: It\u2019s not just Gervais who critics are faulting but the event itself. Here\u2019s Vanity Fair\u2019s Richard Lawson: \u201cWhat are the Golden Globes for in 2020? Mostly just a few hours of celebrity gazing, at this point. A stretch of time that, yes, can occasionally swell to something grander, something dimly approaching important, but is otherwise only a starry and distant evening to enjoy\u2014or not\u2014in January, just as the page has turned on another year. Maybe that\u2019s all the show can be right now, for better and worse. Or that\u2019s just complacency talking and the real solution\u2014to the Golden Globes, not the world\u2019s troubles\u2014is to do some kind of radical shakeup next year. To introduce some actually edgy host, to honor a bold and forward-thinking array of nominees, to conjure up a sense that all the glitz has a real cultural sum to it. I\u2019ll toast to that possibility, even if it means I\u2019m lame for caring.\u201d Here\u2019s a look back at some of the most notable outfits on the red carpet: Here\u2019s that Michelle Williams speech that you\u2019ll all be reading about tomorrow: While Netflix went into the night with the most nominations, on the small screen side it was HBO who came out on top with four wins and, importantly for the network long-term, none of them were for Game of Thrones. For the New York Times, James Poniewozik had the following to say about Gervais: \u201cGervais himself doesn\u2019t care about the Globes so much that he was hosting them for the fifth time. He and everyone knew why he was there: to administer Hollywood a mostly consensual lashing, to be the Nihilist-in-Chief, the guy who doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks. He had a joke about Felicity Huffman\u2019s jail sentence in a college-admissions scandal, and a heavily censored one imagining Judi Dench, of \u201cCats,\u201d grooming herself in, er, a feline manner. It was sometimes uncomfortable, but not especially daring.\u201d Incredibly important information: A cursory look of Film Twitter and some early reviews might suggest that Ricky Gervais was a flop host tonight but not if you look much further to the right. Controversial former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch tweeted that he was \u201cthe ballsiest host ever\u201d. Breitbart reporter Alana Mastrangelo tweeted that he\u2019s \u201cthe only one who deserves an award tonight\u201d. Ben Shapiro called it \u201cthe BEST THING EVER\u201d. Candace Owens praised him as \u201ca celebrity with the balls to clue Hollywood in on the painstakingly obvious truth that we DO NOT CARE WHAT THEY THINK\u201d. So congrats to Ricky. Yeah about those Joaquin F-bombs that were removed from the almost live broadcast earlier. Here they are! \u201cTo my fellow nominees, we all know there\u2019s no fucking competition between us\u201d \u201cThere is no fucking best actor\u201d \u201cContrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t want to rock the boat. But the boat is fucking rocked\u201d Full video on its way And here\u2019s how it all began with what\u2019s allegedly, hopefully the last ever Ricky Gervais Globes opening monologue: This is an important and deeply embarrassing question: It\u2019s been a night as long as an Irishman so in case you need to go back and check who won what then here\u2019s a handy list: Another first of the night: Awkwafina has become the first Asian-American woman to win the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy film Sad but true but also amazing Woah a big shock here with the technically audacious Sam Mendes war movie beating out The Irishman, Marriage Story, Joker and The Two Popes. He\u2019s honest about the importance of the award for a film like this just before it\u2019s released wide in the US. It\u2019s a film with a big budget yet without big stars and the win should help it reach a wider audience. The Globes are by no means a safe predictor of Academy success but this does make the Oscar race that much more interesting. Most predicted this would happen but it\u2019s a deserved win for Renee Zellweger with her comeback role as Judy Garland. It\u2019s a return to normality after Phoenix\u2019s speech, a list of names and gratitude but with time running out, she\u2019s another big name being played off by music. It\u2019s horribly awkward to watch at the end, volume increasing. Joaquin\u2019s speech is causing some confused reactions: Not a total surprise this one, even if the film has fallen down considerably from its Golden Lion-winning pedestal in Venice last year. He starts his speech by talking about the powerful message sent by the HFPA by having a plant-based menu. There\u2019s a great deal of silence after as some cursing is a major component of his time on stage. He appears to be criticising the nature of awards, there just to sell advertisements. More on the specific curses later. His nervy, uncomfortable speech ends with a callout for people making more changes in their own lives rather than just voting. He\u2019s the first person tonight to be played off by music. It was easily the night\u2019s most awkward moment. Footage on the way but for now, here\u2019s how that powerful Michelle Williams speech has been going down: No surprise here, given the awards that came before and given how this category can often have a low bar for entrance (hello The Tourist). But a vital reminder that, despite a summer release date, Tarantino\u2019s 60s-set caper remains a major best picture contender. Quick, impressive fact here. Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir is the first woman to ever win the Golden Globe for best score on her own. In 2000, Lisa Gerrard won for Gladiator alongside Hans Zimmer. Brad Pitt\u2019s done a joke: \u201cIf anything, if I fall upon hard times, I can sell this,\u201d says a surprised Awkwafina winning for her role in breakout comedy drama The Farewell, one of last year\u2019s most loved films after it premiered at Sundance. This is a big win for the comedian and should help push her into the best actress category at next month\u2019s Oscars. This wasn\u2019t a category with a clear frontrunner yet still this feels like a surprise victory for Taron Egerton playing Elton John in Rocketman, beating out Daniel Craig, Eddie Murphy and Leonardo DiCaprio. It\u2019s less of a surprise given that the HFPA did give Bohemian Rhapsody best picture last year. Aaaand here\u2019s a lovely interview with Globe-winning composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir from last month: Another one of the night\u2019s most easily predictable categories but still quite the win for Brad Pitt given that it also includes Pacino, Hanks, Hopkins and Pesci. He takes time to thank LDC (Leonardo DiCaprio) which is his nickname then for his famous pals? He said he wanted to bring his mum but whenever he is pictured next to a woman he\u2019s rumoured to be dating her. Cut to Jennifer Aniston. Which is mean but also so Globes. Even those who understandably loathed Joker would find it hard to fault many of its technical achievements, including a moody, atmospheric score from breakout composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir who won out in a typically male-dominated category. And much to the displeasure of Amazon, backstage, Phoebe Waller-Bridge has stayed firm on there being no more Fleabag in the foreseeable future \u201cI haven\u2019t changed my mind about season three. It feels more and more about being the right decision. (These awards shows) are just beautiful goodbyes. But there\u2019s been so many goodbyes every time.\u201d Another win that matches up to critical acclaim after Fleabag and Succession also winning out in their respective categories. Chernobyl was easily the most loved choice here and the HFPA is unusually on point with their small screen picks tonight. This one makes sense given that she was the starriest star in the category although it would have been nice to see one of the actors from Unbelievable up there. As always, Williams is an eloquent and intelligent speech-giver and she uses this time to talk about the importance of choice, especially for women. \u201cWomen when it is time to vote please do so in your self-interest,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s what men have been doing for years which is why the world looks so much like them but don\u2019t forget we are the largest voting body in this country.\u201d Oof - one of the night\u2019s best speeches. In case you want to read more about the arduous process behind best director-winning 1917, then here ya go: Jason Momoa is wearing a vest at the Golden Globes and is drunk already? Ooh, as Mendes himself says, this is \u201ca big surprise\u201d, beating out Scorsese and Tarantino for his first world war drama 1917 which has gathered steam, fast, since its late premiere near the end of last year. It\u2019s a technically astonishing film but one that most didn\u2019t see coming and certainly makes this a more interesting race to keep an eye on over the next month. Setting the bar: Charlize Theron has arrived on stage to reminisce about her childhood and her three most prized possessions back then: \u201cmy ballet shoes, my pet goat and my VHS copy of Splash\u201d. She\u2019s here to present the Cecil B DeMille award for lifetime achievement in film to Tom Hanks, who has \u201cmade easy work of breaking our hearts and stealing our tears\u201d (which sounds a tad sinister). Then follows one of the most impressive montages I\u2019ve seen for a long while, reminding us just how many memorable roles Hanks has taken on throughout his career (as well as Larry Crowne). Hanks, who has a cold and has been drinking a lot of \u201csavagely orange drinks\u201d so is jittery, chokes up when talking about his family sitting before him. It\u2019s a generous speech, paying tribute to the many big names he\u2019s worked with both in front of and behind the camera, offering advice to young actors who should be making copious notes on a napkin. Yup: \u201cI genuinely got a little bit boozy because I thought this wasn\u2019t going to happen,\u201d says a slightly tipsy Olivia Colman who seems genuinely surprised to be on stage. Even though she\u2019s now a best actress Oscar winner, this is somewhat of a surprise given that the category was also populated by Reese Witherspon, Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman. A big night for the Brits! It takes a lot to beat Meryl Streep at the Globes but winning for the second time in two years running in this category is Patricia Arquette for her role in Hulu\u2019s grim, fact-based drama The Act. Known for her political speeches, she uses her time to talk about being in a country on the verge of war and the fears that come with that. She begs the audience to vote later this year in the night\u2019s first genuinely rousing speech of the night thus far. One of the funniest moments of the night, courtesy of Sacha Baron Cohen: And here\u2019s a longer look at who Gervais went after in his opening monologue: Taylor Swift was up on her feet for Elton John and Bernie Taupin after losing out the award for best song (another blow for Cats, easily the night\u2019s most skewered film). John says it\u2019s the first time the pair have ever won an award together! When you\u2019ve misplaced Annette Bening: Well it was never not going to be Fleabag in this category and it\u2019s a return to the stage for best actress winner Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She thanks Obama for putting Fleabag on his best shows of the year list while also reminding us all of the scene in season one when she uses him as inspiration to masturbate. Side note: Taylor Swift was laughing at serious moments during the speech, footage of which should be coming soon for those wanting to guess why. A tough category and one that many predicted would see a triumph for Jennifer Lopez, given that it\u2019s the Globes, but Laura Dern has continued her haul of awards for her role in Noah Baumbach\u2019s Netflix drama. It\u2019s her fifth Globe and could lead to her first Oscar. She\u2019s fantastic in the film but Lopez was robbed, in case anyone\u2019s asking. And here\u2019s that nice Kate McKinnon bit in case ya wanna: A nice surprise here in a category many had predicted to be a Disney victory. The Laika film, which was a critical hit but a commercial flop, beat out Toy Story 4 for the prize and might hopefully be an indicator of Oscars success which might also hopefully lead to more studios financing Laika movies, despite the box office. \u201cWell I can\u2019t believe I won over Steve Zaillian,\u201d Tarantino says while accepting the award from Margot Robbie, one of the stars of his winning film. He\u2019s as enthused as one would expect and not that surprised, given his history of winning this award at both the Globes and the Oscars. He thanks his cast for adding more to his script while also paying tribute to his wife who is pregnant with his \u201cvery first child\u201d. Expect Once Upon A Time in Hollywood to pick up more later on. The HFPA done good again by giving another award to last year\u2019s best show, Succession (we can just about forgive them for not giving Kieran Culkin best supporting actor). \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this kind of event does your head in,\u201d Cox says before apologising to the other nominees for winning the award. He\u2019s taken aback by the victory and, given that Billy Porter was predicted by many to win, so are we but, again, one of the most deserved nominees has won in what\u2019s turning into a rare Globes night of deserved victories. The pull of this year\u2019s ceremony is such that even Taylor Swift and Beyonce, stars who keep their public appearances to a carefully managed minimum, are in attendance. See: The first special award of the night is going to Ellen Degeneres, winning the Carol Burnett prize for lifetime achievement in television. Kate McKinnon is awarding it and she\u2019s doing a rather fine job, talking about her own sexuality and the importance of seeing Ellen come out when she was at a young age. It\u2019s an emotional, funny and crowd-pleasing speech about LGBT representation and brings what might be some of most enthusiastic cheers of the night. Degeneres, who has come under fire for befriending George Bush and taking the side of Kevin Hart when he was accused of homophobia, comes on stage to pay tribute back to McKinnon before making a crack about awards ceremonies and how lucky she is to have gone into it knowing she was a winner, unlike most of the attendees. It\u2019s a speech but also a standup routine as she jokes about the intolerable length of awards show speeches while indulging in a long speech herself. Here\u2019s a scrap of the opening monologue but the whole thing will be up soon: Surely one of the most easy-to-predict categories of the night but one that feels like the best choice regardless. Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s lacerating class satire/Hitchcockian thriller has been picking up awards and acclaim ever since it premiered last year at Cannes and this is just the latest in his road to the Oscars. Might it be the first foreign language film to win best picture next month? Aaaand no surprises here, continuing her haul of awards for the acclaimed second season of Fleabag. Although given the nature of the show and the fact that they snubbed the first season, this might well be some HFPA voters following in the footsteps of the Emmys. But it\u2019s deserved nonetheless and Waller-Bridge\u2019s speech is as charming as usual, thanking Andrew Scott and claiming he could have chemistry with a pebble. Probably true. I\u2019m guessing Amazon execs will be further pestering her for season three starting tomorrow. I really want to see what happens when these two bump into each other at the afterparty. Oh yeah, and here\u2019s how much Jonathan Pryce enjoyed that Two Popes joke: This is a well-deserved victory for the breakout second season of the devilishly entertaining, darkly comic HBO drama. It wasn\u2019t a sure thing given stiff competition and how abrasive the show can seem to some but it\u2019s easily the best show in the category. In a night that\u2019s set to be dominated by Netflix this is also a key win for HBO who have been trailing behind them of late and a reminder that post-Game of Thrones, things might not be quite as troublesome as some had predicted. \u201cI was so sure that I wouldn\u2019t win that I already thanked everyone,\u201d says Skarsg\u00e5rd, winning out against Kieran Culkin and Henry Winkler for his role in the acclaimed fact-based drama. More for Chernobyl to come, I\u2019m guessing ... Just in case you needed a brief recap, here\u2019s who and what Gervais ridiculed in his opening speech: Apple, Jeffrey Epstein, Joe Pesci, Leonardo DiCaprio, Disney, Amazon, Martin Scorsese, the HFPA, diversity and The Two Popes Tom Hanks reacting to Ricky Gervais is all of us reacting to Ricky Gervais? And we\u2019re off. Two major awards in a row. The second has gone to a more established Globes favourite for his role as Roger Ailes in a show that no one really liked. He\u2019s not there as he\u2019s protecting his house and family from the Australian wildfires but in a shared statement he said: \u201cMake no mistake, the tragedy in Australia is climate change-based\u201d before suggesting ways that the emergency can be combatted. Ooh, a nice surprise to start the evening for comedian Ramy Youssef for his underappreciated show Ramy on Hulu, beating out Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd. \u201cI know you guys haven\u2019t seen my show,\u201d he joked before saying that the audience probably thinks he\u2019s an editor. The Globes does have a pretty strong track record of awarding newcomers in the television category and this is a promising sign of things to come later on. If the red carpet has taught us one thing, other than how crushingly bleak red carpet interviews continue to be, it\u2019s that the star quota this year is more impressive than usual which should make Gervais\u2019 job that much easier, so many highly paid targets to ridicule. \u201cYou\u2019ll be pleased to know this is the last time I\u2019m hosting these awards\u201d he begins before saying everyone will be pleased by this fact. Felicity Huffman is the first celebrity to be skewered in a not totally awful joke about her making the license plate for his limo. He then compares Joe Pesci to Baby Yoda. Okay. Oof his joke about The Two Popes being a paedophile movie did not go down well with Jonathan Pryce in a reaction that needs to be giffed as soon as humanly possible. But then the jokes about how awful the HFPA and the Globes come, from someone getting paid large amounts to be there, something he\u2019s been doing in all his pre-publicity. Poor guy. Martin Scorsese deserves an award for pretending to laugh at Gervais joking that he\u2019s too short to get on rollercoaster rides. A joke about Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s obsession with dating women in their early twenties is fair. A joke about Judi Dench licking her own asshole is, well, huh not funny but Gwyneth loved it. He\u2019s begging celebrities not to make political speeches because they don\u2019t know anything about anything. Says a celebrity. And that\u2019s it. Awkwafina, who is nominated for Best actress in a film \u2013 musical or comedy for her role in The Farewell, is continuing what\u2019s been a trend for black and white this year in ruffles and a blazer, which, we\u2019re hearing rumblings, are the work of Chanel. She is joined by the likes of Greta Gerwig and Zoe Kravitz who, wearing a black-and-white polka dot number, is channelling dalmation-chic at its finest. The Little Women look \u2013 long, ruffled, prairie dresses and waistcoats \u2013 is huge right now, so of course Little Women star Saoirse Ronan has gone for the very opposite: a shimmering and strappy floor-length gown. Jo March it ain\u2019t but a thigh-high dress slit is certainly red-carpet worthy. In his four outings as Golden Globes host, Ricky Gervais has roasted everyone from Mel Gibson to Caitlyn Jenner but it was a joke about Tim Allen that\u2019s stuck with him the most. In a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, the comic admitted that he regrets a jab aimed at the Toy Story star: \u201cI think he took it wrong. The joke was him and Tom Hanks. So I came out and said, \u2018 Our next two presenters, the first has won five Oscars, combined box office of five billion dollars. And the other, Tim Allen.\u2019 Right? It\u2019s a fine joke. I\u2019m teasing Tim Allen. But anyone standing next to Tom Hanks, unless it\u2019s Dustin Hoffman or Robert Redford or Robert De Niro, that could be me. But it happened to be Tim Allen. And I have nothing against Tim Allen. He\u2019s a good actor. He\u2019s probably a nice bloke. So even though there\u2019s no malice and I can justify it comedically and everyone laughed, I didn\u2019t want Tim Allen to think, \u2018Oh, that was written for me. Why me?\u2019 Well, because you were standing next to Tom Hanks.\u201d The aforementioned looseness that can often make the Globes a more enjoyable watch is best exemplified by the choice of presenters throughout the night and the more freewheeling skits they\u2019re allowed to indulge in. This year the long list of big names appearing onstage includes Brad Pitt, Charlize Theron, Reese Witherspoon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Elton John, Rachel Weisz, Cate Blanchett and Helen Mirren. While those most likely to create a viral moment include Will Ferrell, Amy Poehler, Tiffany Haddish and Kate McKinnon. Last year\u2019s funniest bit was watching Maya Rudolph propose to Amy Poehler and this year\u2019s cruelest bit is not having them host the entire damn thing: In case you need a reminder of what to expect from Ricky Gervais tonight, here\u2019s a montage of his best, or to some \u201cbest\u201d, bits from previous ceremonies: A black dress at the Golden Globes red carpet is a Jennifer Aniston trademark move \u2013 and we can see why. The actor was spotted \u201cstargazing\u201d at Kerry Washington \u2013 also in black \u2013 on the red carpet where the pair sent the internet into overdrive with a hug earlier this evening. She\u2019s nominated for best actress in a TV series for her role in The Morning Show \u2013 alongside her co-star Reese Witherspoon. Jennifer Lopez won fashion this year when she made a surprise appearance on the Versace SS20 catwalk wearing a palm print frock she\u2019d last worn 20 years ago, sending the internet into a tailspin then as now. For the Golden Globes, at which she is nominated for best supporting actress for her role in Hustlers, she\u2019s come as the gift that keeps on giving in a dress embellished with a giant gold and green bow. It is reported a Valentino couture creation. The up-do, as one eagle-eyed person tweeted, is reminiscent of her Maid in Manhattan days. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has arrived suited and stilettoed. The star, who is nominated for Best actress in a TV series \u2013 musical or comedy, is no stranger to red carpet tailoring. This intricately embellished suit with silky lapels looks the ideal outfit for an after-show martini, which, if the Emmys is anything to go by, is Waller-Bridge\u2019s wont. It\u2019s another year without a clear big screen frontrunner with arguments easily made for Marriage Story, Parasite, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and The Irishman. With Netflix behind two of those, and with 17 nominations across the board, the only sure thing is that it\u2019ll be a grand old night for streaming. But which films and actors, according to Peter Bradshaw, will come out on top? Colman, nominated for Best actress in a TV series for her role as HRH The Queen in The Crown looks regal in red on the red carpet. The puffed sleeves have an air of majesty about them, as seen in Holbein portraits of Henry VIII, but they are also very spring/summer 2020 in their sheer volume. The look is rounded off with a square train. All hail! High-neck, floor-length pastel pink? It isn\u2019t a look that works for everyone, but it\u2019s one Kirsten Dunst wears well. Nominated for her role in On Becoming a God in Central Florida the actor has opted to wear Rodarte to the Globes \u2013 and it\u2019s certainly nice to have a break from all the red carpet monochrome. In the words of Catatonia, this could be a case for Mulder and Scully: Gillian Anderson has arrived in a beautiful all-white frock with one shoulder shrouded in an elegant sleeve-cape and the other side \u2026 missing. The truth is out there but the Sex Education star looks regal, back jewellery and all. Looking forward to seeing Ricky Gervais try to offend the Hollywood elite? Well, Stuart Heritage sure isn\u2019t ... The Pose star has done it again, serving white feather realness on tonight\u2019s red carpet and stealing the show in this peacock-train jacket by Alex Vinash. Rumour has it the feathers zip off \u2013 although we\u2019re not convinced they\u2019ll fit in Porter\u2019s (very on trend) itty bitty bag. The star of Harriet and best actress in a film nominee, Cynthia Erivo, recently told Vogue that her Hollywood icon is Eartha Kitt. And this is a look we think Kitt would have approved of. By Thom Browne, the New York designer known for whacky silhouettes and shoes in the shape of dolphins, the black-and-white gown reportedly took 800hrs to make. It has peonies, the actor\u2019s favourite flower, sewn on the hem. As her stylist Jason Bolden said on Instagram earlier this evening: \u201cThe New Hollywood!! Brave, Black &amp; Beautiful.\u201d Oh, and the Bulgari necklace cost more than a mansion in Malibu. This week it was announced that the Globes would be entirely meat-free with a late-in-the-day decision to go for a fully vegan menu for the very first time. It\u2019s all about sending \u201ca good message\u201d and it\u2019s a move that\u2019s already been praised by stars including Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio. In case you\u2019re interested/hungry, attendees will be scarfing down an appetizer of chilled golden beet soup with locally grown chervil and amaranth followed by a king oyster mushrooms entree, cooked and presented to call to mind scallops, with wild mushroom risotto, roasted baby purple and green Brussels sprouts, globe carrots and pea tendrils. Rita Wilson is not having a golden Golden Globes night. More on this as soon as we have it... Hot priest klaxon! Andrew Scott, nominated for best supporting actor in a TV series for his role in Fleabag, has arrived wearing a white tuxedo jacket with golden bow tie. Disappointingly, he doesn\u2019t appear to be carrying a gin in a tin, but Twitter is still going wild for this look. The Brosnan clan have arrived on the red carpet, with dad Pierce joined by sons Dylan and Paris, as well as his wife Keely Shaye Smith. Pierce, who is presenting an award at this year\u2019s ceremony, joined his sons in rolling out the red carpet alongside host Ricky Gervais on Friday, but has swapped the relaxed open neck shirt he wore to the preview event for an all-black tux this evening. Snazzy. Hi from team Fashion. Kicking us off tonight in the sartorial stakes is Greta Gerwig. She might have been snubbed in the best director category, leaving it an all-male affair (again), but the Little Women director has arrived early to the red carpet. She is wearing what is reportedly a custom Proenza Schouler gown. The monochrome palette might say old Hollywood glamour but the sharp bob and steely choker add a 2020 twist. It\u2019s a tough year to predict who will triumph in the small screen categories with the HFPA opting for a mixture of hit shows that impressed critics (Fleabag, Succession) and shows that didn\u2019t leave much of an impression at all (The Politician, The Loudest Voice). Their TV picks can often be full-on gonzo but Adrian Horton has bravely placed a number of bets on who and what she thinks will win tonight: Easy to ridicule yet hard to ignore, the Golden Globes has long been seen as the drunker, sillier cousin to the Oscars, focused more on celebrity than genuine achievement. It\u2019s voted on by a mysterious, and mysteriously small, group of less than 100 journalists and the choices they make are often downright bizarre (two-time Golden Globe winner Mozart in the Jungle) but it\u2019s reliably star-packed and its nifty slot at the very start of the new year does make it a vital conversation-continuer. It\u2019s a strange old awards season thus far without a clear front-runner and instead, a group of films that could all conceivably make their way to the biggest prize. On the film end, tonight should give us a bit more clarity in a number of key categories, especially in best drama which will give us a better idea of whether The Irishman or Marriage Story will be the Netflix success story at next month\u2019s Oscars. Comedy-wise, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood is likely to make a strong showing. But arguably the person who most in the industry and at home will be looking out for is host Ricky Gervais, returning for a record fifth time, already promising to deliver the catty quips we expect. But how will they go down in 2020 after a year of mostly host-free awards ceremonies? Or even when hosts have commandeered events, they\u2019ve played it nice rather than nasty. Gervais, who once described a Golden Globe win as \u201cworthless\u201d, has a tough job on his hands. We\u2019ll be here all night to comment on the wins, the loses and the jabs in-between.",

      "bodyText": "Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett have used their Golden Globes speeches to highlight Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis, and the link between climate change and worsening bushfires. The unprecedented fire season has so far burned through 8.4 million hectares across Australia, destroyed thousands of homes and killed 23 people. On Sunday night, Australian actors thanked volunteer firefighters and drew attention to the \u201cclimate disaster\u201d that has made the country\u2019s fire season longer and more intense. Crowe won best actor in a limited series or motion picture made for TV for his performance as Roger Ailes in The Loudest Voice. But the Australian actor, whose home in Nana Glen in New South Wales was hit by fires in November, did not attend the ceremony because he was with his family preparing for the latest bushfires. Actor Jennifer Aniston, who was presenting the award, read out Crowe\u2019s statement on his behalf. \u201cMake no mistake the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate-change based,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cWe need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is.\u201d Blanchett, who was presenting an award, used her speech to give thanks to volunteer firefighters, and draw attention to the global \u201cclimate disaster\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of Australians in the room tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we are all very grateful for the call-outs to our fellow compatriots who are suffering under the bushfires, so thank you. \u201cI wanted to do a special call-out to the volunteer firefighters who have been at the centre of battling the climate disaster that is facing Australia. \u201cAnd of course, when one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster, so we\u2019re in it together, so thank you very much.\u201d Other actors and presenters, including Patricia Arquette, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Ellen DeGeneres, also spoke about the Australian bushfires, and urged viewers to donate. Arquette won best supporting actress in a series, limited series or TV movie for her role in Hulu series The Act. \u201cI am so happy to be here and celebrate this, but also I know that \u2026 we see a country on the brink of war, the United States of America \u2026 and the continent of Australia on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world. For our kids and their kids, we have to vote in 2020 and beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.\u201d Before the ceremony, fellow Australians Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman also used social media to encourage people to donate to Australian firefighters.",

He is like the director of his own awful play.\u201d He included two sketches in a show he curated at <a href=\"http://www.thelightbox.org.uk\">the Lightbox</a> in Woking, <a href=\"https://outsidein.org.uk/exhibition/the-outside-and-the-inside/\">The Outside and the Inside</a>.

It is only due to strict German bureaucracy that the scantest of details about his life are known.</p> <p>Born on 18 September 1898, he was without a profession, unmarried, Catholic and diagnosed with idiocy. Analysis of his drawings suggest he was probably left-handed. But there is no birth certificate, no photograph and his medical file has been lost, probably destroyed. There is only the registration number HHSTAW Abt.631a, Nr 1645, assigned to him at the age of 42, when he was in a group of 143 people \u2013 mainly women \u2013 who were transported to Pirna Sonnenstein asylum near Dresden on 6 October, 1940 and murdered in its gas chambers as part of the Nazis\u2019 \u201cAction T4\u201d extermination programme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5513e8a337085e53452612dcd50273be0112f191\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5513e8a337085e53452612dcd50273be0112f191/230_640_1617_2021/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pencil drawing by Werner.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pencil drawing by Werner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Prinzhorn gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>R\u00f6ske\u2019s attempts to discover more about Werner took him back to the town of Nordheim am Main, where he had lived with his mother in the poorhouse.

Round clowns depict the patients as they undergo surgery or juggle testicles. The nurses smoke, with swastika bands around their arms as they handle the patients\u2019 testicles. Twice, Werner refers to a Dr Weinzierl. Hans Weinzierl was head surgeon in a hospital in Schweinfurt where compulsory sterilisations were carried out, even though there is no evidence that he was involved. Although the artist\u2019s sympathy is clearly with the patients, the pictures are often ambiguous, R\u00f6ske says, with \u201cthe authority figures exuding an air of matter-of-fact authority\u201d.</p> <p>Werner also depicts sterilisation as a literal castration, R\u00f6ske says, whereas the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring only stipulated that patients should be made infertile. \u201cBut he seems to have understandably viewed the surgery as a brutal emasculation,\u201d R\u00f6ske says, \u201chence his frequent use of the motif of removed testicles and drawings of the sterilisation instruments, as he imagined them.\u201d</p> <p>In arguably his most striking drawing, entitled The Triumph of Sterelation (as he referred to sterilisation), R\u00f6ske says it is still not clear to him if Werner was \u201cmaybe being sarcastic or trying to develop a humouristic fantasy about suffering for a \u2018good cause\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The drawing shows inmates of the clinic being transported on a bus decorated with swastika flags while on its roof a nurse displays two testicles on a plate. \u201cHe might well have been aware of the propaganda vehicles that drove through Nazi Germany advertising the party\u2019s slogans and could well have been referencing them,\u201d R\u00f6ske says.</p> <p>On the inside of the book cover, Werner refers to himself as an \u201corator of the people\u201d and a \u201ctheatre director\u201d.</p> <p>Steene says: \u201cIt\u2019s rather wonderful.

      "bodyText": "Forty-four pencil drawings on the backsides of a shop order book are all that remain of the life of Wilhelm Werner. But his artistic response to the forced sterilisation programme he underwent in Nazi Germany, a bundle of leaves flimsily held together in a worn leather cover, is receiving growing recognition in the art world almost eight decades after his death. The detailed sketches, like scenes from a puppet show, are believed to be the only works of art by one of the 400,000 people who suffered forced sterilisation under the Nazis\u2019 programme to eliminate \u201cundesirables\u201d. The sketch book is to be the focal point of a major permanent collection of so-called outsider art \u2013 at the Prinzhorn gallery in Heidelberg, southern Germany from May. \u201cThese drawings are immensely precious both historically and artistically,\u201d says Thomas R\u00f6ske, art historian and director of the Prinzhorn, which owns Werner\u2019s drawings in its collection of 6,000 works by patients of psychiatric institutions, dating back to 1840 and the largest of its kind in the world. \u201cMost work produced by patients was destroyed during the Nazi period,\u201d he says. That Werner\u2019s works survived, he believes, is nothing short of a miracle. \u201cThere are some writings and poems of patients from this era but as far as we know no drawings.\u201d An administrator at the Werneck asylum in southern Germany where Werner spent most of his life saved the book, regularly showing it to friends, and when he died several years ago his family sold it to the Prinzhorn. Marc Steene, director of Outside In, a UK-based charity that aims to provide a platform for artists largely excluded from the art world because of health, disability or social reasons, encountered Werner\u2019s works for the first time three years ago during a research residency at the Prinzhorn. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful normality to Werner\u2019s drawings,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are a potent mix of what was happening to him and what he created out of that. He is like the director of his own awful play.\u201d He included two sketches in a show he curated at the Lightbox in Woking, The Outside and the Inside. The works of Werner have a particular poignancy, he says, viewed in the context of the many pieces of art by institutionalised artists that are often destroyed. \u201cI worked at a care centre in Brighton 30 years ago where I was struck by the artistic intuition and talent of those who came there. When I went back to get some of the works framed, I was told they had been pulped,\u201d Steene says. \u201cThe reality is that most works produced by people in similar situations ends up in landfill sites, deemed worthless.\u201d R\u00f6ske says that many medical files from before and during the Nazi era document the fact that patients often worked artistically. \u201cTypical are comments by doctors in their notes, that say: \u2018he or she makes nice drawings\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the thought of keeping them was rarely considered worthwhile.\u201d Werner\u2019s drawings are all that remain of his existence. It is only due to strict German bureaucracy that the scantest of details about his life are known. Born on 18 September 1898, he was without a profession, unmarried, Catholic and diagnosed with idiocy. Analysis of his drawings suggest he was probably left-handed. But there is no birth certificate, no photograph and his medical file has been lost, probably destroyed. There is only the registration number HHSTAW Abt.631a, Nr 1645, assigned to him at the age of 42, when he was in a group of 143 people \u2013 mainly women \u2013 who were transported to Pirna Sonnenstein asylum near Dresden on 6 October, 1940 and murdered in its gas chambers as part of the Nazis\u2019 \u201cAction T4\u201d extermination programme. R\u00f6ske\u2019s attempts to discover more about Werner took him back to the town of Nordheim am Main, where he had lived with his mother in the poorhouse. Residents there still remembered talk of the boy who was \u201cnot right in the head\u201d, and who was forbidden to play with younger children, he says. \u201cBut we have found nothing to back up the diagnosis of idiocy,\u201d R\u00f6ske added. \u201cThat would mean a mental age of two to four, whereas we have here someone who was able to write (some of the drawings are annotated), who had an imagination and developed an individual way of telling his story. It\u2019s clear that drawing was his world and he had developed a style and had inhabited that world for a long time.\u201d The drawings show scenes from the clinic, including meetings between doctors and nurses. Round clowns depict the patients as they undergo surgery or juggle testicles. The nurses smoke, with swastika bands around their arms as they handle the patients\u2019 testicles. Twice, Werner refers to a Dr Weinzierl. Hans Weinzierl was head surgeon in a hospital in Schweinfurt where compulsory sterilisations were carried out, even though there is no evidence that he was involved. Although the artist\u2019s sympathy is clearly with the patients, the pictures are often ambiguous, R\u00f6ske says, with \u201cthe authority figures exuding an air of matter-of-fact authority\u201d. Werner also depicts sterilisation as a literal castration, R\u00f6ske says, whereas the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring only stipulated that patients should be made infertile. \u201cBut he seems to have understandably viewed the surgery as a brutal emasculation,\u201d R\u00f6ske says, \u201chence his frequent use of the motif of removed testicles and drawings of the sterilisation instruments, as he imagined them.\u201d In arguably his most striking drawing, entitled The Triumph of Sterelation (as he referred to sterilisation), R\u00f6ske says it is still not clear to him if Werner was \u201cmaybe being sarcastic or trying to develop a humouristic fantasy about suffering for a \u2018good cause\u2019\u201d. The drawing shows inmates of the clinic being transported on a bus decorated with swastika flags while on its roof a nurse displays two testicles on a plate. \u201cHe might well have been aware of the propaganda vehicles that drove through Nazi Germany advertising the party\u2019s slogans and could well have been referencing them,\u201d R\u00f6ske says. On the inside of the book cover, Werner refers to himself as an \u201corator of the people\u201d and a \u201ctheatre director\u201d. Steene says: \u201cIt\u2019s rather wonderful. He knew that he was speaking up for so many back then. He\u2019s still doing so now.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal Labor MP Mike Kelly has called for a war-like national mobilisation effort to deal with the existential threat of climate change, warning that a failure to act would be the \u201cmost serious dereliction of duty in our history\u201d. The member for the New South Wales electorate of Eden-Monaro, which includes huge areas of the NSW south coast and the Snowy Mountains where destructive bushfires continue to burn, has called for the federal government to establish a civil defence corps (CDC) that would operate as a national disaster response reserve, and said compulsory national service might be necessary. Arguing the capacity of volunteer personnel was already stretched, Kelly pointed to estimates from the Climate Council suggesting that by 2030 Australia will need double the current number of firefighters. \u201cThe current model of response will not be adequate or sustainable to deal with this,\u201d Kelly wrote in a lengthy Facebook post. \u201cThe reality is that we are facing the kind of existential threat through climate change that demands the same sort of national mobilisation of will as we required in World War II.\u201d Stressing that his \u201cconcept paper\u201d was a personal view and not Labor party policy, Kelly argued the new corps could follow the model of the Australian defence force reserves, and could be funded from a national disaster levy. \u201cThis CDC should encompass all existing volunteer organisations and would be a national resource that could be mobilised for any disaster,\u201d he said. Under his proposal, members of the new force would be offered incentives after a set period of service, with Kelly suggesting a card be granted that provided similar perks to a seniors card. \u201cBenefits could include concessional travel, reduced vehicle registrations and personal fire insurance charges, together with limited private medical and life insurance for injuries received during frontline firefighting,\u201d Incentives could also be offered to employers of CDC members, including potential payroll tax relief and payments made when the reserves were called to service. The commonwealth would pay tax-exempt remuneration to mobilised members. Kelly said that in his recent visits to Rural Fire Service centres in his electorate, he had been struck by the age of the volunteer fire service, saying there was a need to attract young people into service. He said if the CDC was unable to attract sufficient personnel, the government could also consider putting in place a \u201cgap year\u201d scheme or even consider establishing a compulsory non-military national service scheme. \u201cThis would require all high school graduates to be absorbed into the CDC on leaving school for perhaps a one-year period, after which they would be required to render service as required and attend refresher training annually up until the age of 40, after which continuing service would be voluntary,\u201d he said. He said some would find the proposal \u201ccontroversial\u201d, but he wanted to trigger a national discussion that generated new ideas to deal with the climate change threat. \u201cIn any event the climate change projections we are looking at may leave no other choice, and we must talk about this now,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the concepts I am presenting could be a valuable and rewarding experience for the young Australians involved and serve many other outcomes that would be of benefit to our nation.\u201d Until the creation of the proposed corp, Kelly warned, the Australian defence force would still be required at the current scale, but \u201cmuch more efficiently and quickly than has happened\u201d. He said while ADF personnel were not trained in firefighting, they could play a greater role, with the \u201cfundamental skills of planning, management, deploying organised bodies of personnel \u2026 ingrained in the ADF.\u201d \u201cThere are many relevant skills and capabilities they can deploy under direction from the expert civilian authorities,\u201d he said, citing assistance with evacuations, logistics support, earthmoving, bulk water carrying, transport and refuelling. Defence\u2019s Landing Helicopter Dock vessels could also provide support where there were no ports, or where they were damaged, including modular hospital units and accommodation, vehicles, high-grade communications and air traffic control and large quantities of stores and vehicles. \u201cThe ADF has been providing air, naval and other support but much more was needed and possible,\u201d he said. On Saturday, Scott Morrison announced a plan to deploy 3,000 army reservists to assist in the bushfire crisis, but came under fire for failing to communicate with the NSW Rural Fire Service about the plan and for launching a party-political ad promoting the effort.",

Morrison has faced a barrage of criticism since releasing a promotional video spruiking his government\u2019s response to the bushfires at the height of the crisis on Saturday. The video was party political, authorised only by the Liberal party and Scott Morrison personally, rather than the Australian government. The Griffith University integrity expert Professor AJ Brown, also a board member of Transparency International, said this made the ad both misleading and divisive, making it an \u201cown goal\u201d for a prime minister trying belatedly to restore public trust. \u201cI interpreted it, and I think thousands of people interpreted it, as a piece of government advertising, attempting to communicate the Australian government response,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is later how the prime minister tried to explain it. \u201cBut clearly it was not that.

Advertising campaigns by the Australian government generally must comply with a framework of rules and guidelines, which, among other things, prevent the use of public funds for party political advertising.

      "body": "<p>\u200bIt\u2019s hard to know what to write in the midst of a national apocalypse.\u200b\u200b</p> <p>I\u2019m like most Australians, feeling every shade of human emotion each day as we see this living tragedy unfold before us. Each morning comes with a dull thud as we wake to the awful realisation that the new day could still be worse than the last.</p> <p>The fear on people\u2019s faces is palpable. It reminds me of Black Saturday. There the horror was quick, although the scars, still deep, remain. Remember those survivors today as the fires of recent weeks reignite the living hell of trauma a decade ago. \u200b\u200b</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the helplessness we feel as we sit, watch and wait. Often the best we can do is stay glued to the ABC, ring people we know in harm\u2019s way, and then give to charity. \u200b\u200b</p> <p>Then there\u2019s pride in our firefighters, the unsung men and women who, without fanfare train week in week out, for years on end. Although no training can prepare you for war like this. They\u2019re our new Anzacs. In the line of fire, literally, before the nation\u2019s eyes. \u200b\u200b</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/for-first-nations-people-the-bushfires-bring-a-particular-grief-burning-what-makes-us-who-we-are\">For First Nations people the bushfires bring a particular grief, burning what makes us who we are | Lorena Allam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course there\u2019s anger and rage as well. Much of it justified. Some of it not. Our national government will have much to account for once the current crisis has passed.</p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is the government\u2019s response just doesn\u2019t pass the pub test.</p> <p>It\u2019s been evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and, above all, too late.</p> <p>It\u2019s been conducted as an exercise in \u201cissue management\u201d, rather than a substantive response to one of the worst natural disasters in our history, with every shoulder to the wheel. And the Australian public can spot a fraud at a thousand paces.</p> <p>So in the midst of all this, what can be said that\u2019s in any way productive for the future?</p> <p>\u200b\u200bFirst, the feds should be taking their marching orders from the state fire chiefs each day.</p> <p>It\u2019s just not good enough when the New South Wales Rural Fire Service chief says he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/05/australia-fires-rfs-commissioner-not-told-of-scott-morrisons-call-up-of-adf-reserve\">first heard of the call-out of the army reserve through the media</a>.</p> <p>Canberra\u2019s job is to help provide whatever financial and physical resources firefighters and other emergency services need there and then.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s hard to know what to write in the midst of a national apocalypse. I\u2019m like most Australians, feeling every shade of human emotion each day as we see this living tragedy unfold before us. Each morning comes with a dull thud as we wake to the awful realisation that the new day could still be worse than the last. The fear on people\u2019s faces is palpable. It reminds me of Black Saturday. There the horror was quick, although the scars, still deep, remain. Remember those survivors today as the fires of recent weeks reignite the living hell of trauma a decade ago. Then there\u2019s the helplessness we feel as we sit, watch and wait. Often the best we can do is stay glued to the ABC, ring people we know in harm\u2019s way, and then give to charity. Then there\u2019s pride in our firefighters, the unsung men and women who, without fanfare train week in week out, for years on end. Although no training can prepare you for war like this. They\u2019re our new Anzacs. In the line of fire, literally, before the nation\u2019s eyes. Of course there\u2019s anger and rage as well. Much of it justified. Some of it not. Our national government will have much to account for once the current crisis has passed. The uncomfortable truth is the government\u2019s response just doesn\u2019t pass the pub test. It\u2019s been evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and, above all, too late. It\u2019s been conducted as an exercise in \u201cissue management\u201d, rather than a substantive response to one of the worst natural disasters in our history, with every shoulder to the wheel. And the Australian public can spot a fraud at a thousand paces. So in the midst of all this, what can be said that\u2019s in any way productive for the future? First, the feds should be taking their marching orders from the state fire chiefs each day. It\u2019s just not good enough when the New South Wales Rural Fire Service chief says he first heard of the call-out of the army reserve through the media. Canberra\u2019s job is to help provide whatever financial and physical resources firefighters and other emergency services need there and then. And on the question of \u201cwho\u2019s going to pay\u201d? I remember it well during the Victorian fires. The answer should simply be: \u201cWhatever it takes. Just get it done.\u201d Second, the National Bushfire Recovery Agency announced on Sunday should be underpinned by national legislation, jointly with the states, and empowered to slice through red tape. There should be a national bushfire appeal \u2013 the Black Saturday appeal raised more than $400m \u2013 and its disbursement should be coordinated by new agency to avoid waste and duplication. The taxable 13-week disaster recovery allowance should immediately be extended to 26 weeks and be exempted from tax, as it was in Victoria. The disaster relief payment of $1,000 has also lagged inflation, meaning its real value has fallen substantially since 2009. Third, provide proper permanent funding for the nation\u2019s bushfire services. The public will not tolerate any longer a discretionary \u201ctop-up\u201d by the feds, or the usual buck passing between the various levels of government. Each brigade needs to be confident of their long-term funding. The formula should be hammered out and rigorously implemented. Fourth, the nation needs the biggest, best national aerial fire-bombing fleet in the world. We are the driest inhabited continent on Earth. It will get worse. Therefore we need a standing capability the likes of which the world hasn\u2019t seen before. Whenever and wherever a fire breaks out, we then have a fighting chance of containing it at its earliest stages. Bill Shorten was right to take this to the last election. It will cost. There will be accusations of waste if it remains idle for a while. Just like we were accused of waste when we co-funded Adelaide\u2019s desalination plant \u2013 until everybody realised we needed it. Fifth, what more warning does Australia need on the absolute imperative of accelerated action on climate change? Not enough it seems for Scott Morrison, who says there will be no change in policy whatsoever. Nor for the high priest of climate change denial himself, Tony Abbott. Indeed, in the midst of the fires, there was Abbott on Israeli radio telling a global audience the real problem for Australia was that we had been taken over by a \u201cclimate change cult\u201d! Abbott! He who famously proclaimed climate change was \u201cabsolute crap\u201d.

Members of the New Zealand military are en route to Australia to assist with the efforts, adding to the 157 New Zealand firefighters already deployed in Australia, some of whom have been assisting their Australian colleagues since October. New Zealand\u2019s minister of defence, Ron Mark, said more help was urgently needed because the fires showed no signs of abating and thousands of people and homes remained in harm\u2019s way. Three Royal New Zealand Air Force NH90 helicopters and crew, two army combat engineer sections and command elements have been sent to support the Australian Defence Force.

      "bodyText": "Venezuela\u2019s opposition has accused president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of masterminding an illegal parliamentary \u201ccoup\u201d after an apparent bid to decapitate the challenge from his presidential rival Juan Guaid\u00f3 by replacing him as head of the country\u2019s opposition-controlled parliament. Guaid\u00f3 shot to international prominence last January after he was elected president of Venezuela\u2019s national assembly and used that position to declare himself the country\u2019s legitimate interim leader. On Sunday Guaid\u00f3 had hoped to extend his leadership of the anti-Maduro movement by being re-elected as the assembly\u2019s president for another year. But there were scenes of chaos and confusion as security forces and riot troops blocked opposition lawmakers and journalists from entering the parliament building in Venezuela\u2019s capital, Caracas. Dramatic video footage showed Guaid\u00f3 attempting to climb over a fence into the assembly\u2019s grounds but being repelled by members of Maduro\u2019s Bolivarian National Guard. After a lengthy stand-off, Luis Parra \u2013 nominally an opposition politician who many suspect has been co-opted by Maduro \u2013 declared himself the assembly\u2019s new president with support from pro-Maduro members, while many Guaid\u00f3 backers remained outside. The move sparked outrage among Guaid\u00f3 supporters in and outside Venezuela. At an improvised session in the headquarters of a local newspaper, pro-Guaid\u00f3 lawmakers re-elected him as national assembly president, meaning that it \u2013 like Venezuela \u2013 now had two rival leaders. \u201cToday, once again, we have defeated the dictatorship,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 told supporters. \u201cWe have resoundingly defeated the dictatorship\u2019s intentions.\u201d The United States criticised the Maduro regime\u2019s move, saying it would not recognize what it called a desperate and phoney \u201cfarce\u201d that went \u201ccompletely against the will of the people\u201d, adding: \u201cDemocracy cannot be intimidated.\u201d A European Union spokesperson said the day\u2019s events were unacceptable and represented \u201ca new step in the deterioration of the Venezuelan crisis\u201d. \u201cAs a consequence, the EU continues to recognise Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate president of the national assembly,\u201d the EU added. The foreign minister of Brazil\u2019s far-right government, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, accused Maduro of attempting to forcefully prevent Guaid\u00f3\u2019s re-election, tweeting: \u201cBrazil will not recognize any outcome of this violence and this affront to democracy.\u201d But there was also criticism from Argentina\u2019s new left-wing government. \u201cForcibly preventing the functioning of the national assembly means condemning oneself to international isolation,\u201d tweeted its new foreign minister, Felipe Sol\u00e1. The move appeared designed to further weaken Guaid\u00f3, who recently vowed 2020 would be Venezuela\u2019s \u201cyear of freedom\u201d despite the growing impression that his campaign against Maduro is faltering. More than 50 governments including the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil recognized Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s president, based on his leadership of the assembly and suspicions Maduro had stolen the 2018 presidential election. Despite that backing, mass street protests, and at least two attempts to spark military uprisings against Maduro, Guaid\u00f3 has failed to topple Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s authoritarian heir, who still enjoys support from China and Russia. In a recent interview with El Pa\u00eds, Guaid\u00f3 denied his movement had failed and compared himself to a jogger entering \u201cthe final lap\u201d of the quest for political change. In a televised speech on Sunday afternoon, Maduro recognized Parra\u2019s leadership and attacked Guaid\u00f3 as a \u201cpuppet of North American imperialism\u201d. But Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House thinktank, said Maduro\u2019s \u201cbrutal and ham-fisted\u201d move could backfire by \u201cre-legitimizing\u201d Guaid\u00f3 as a \u201cdemocratic martyr\u201d. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s international supporters would remain loyal, even if he did not retain his position at the head of the national assembly. \u201cThey won\u2019t abandon him,\u201d Sabatini predicted.",

Around 2.5m were considered professional or senior jobs, and were mostly taken by older, more experienced workers, while about 500,000 were classified as low-skilled.</p> <p>The Institute of Student Employers said employers were planning to increase graduate recruitment by just 3%, compared with the 18% rise in graduate vacancies predicted this time last year.</p> <p>Managers also failed to meet student recruitment targets last year by around 3%, it added. If that pattern persists, the graduate market will be stagnant in 2020, marking the worst graduate jobs growth rate since 2016.</p> <p>While it is not as bleak as the 25% drop in the graduate jobs market seen in 2008/2009, the ISE said it was a sign that employers are hesitant to increase investment in new staff. Stephen Isherwood, the ISE\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe graduate jobs market is an early indicator of the health of the economy as employers tend to plan further ahead when deciding their graduate recruitment needs.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is particularly concerning as employers are normally over optimistic at this time of the year. As we move through the recruitment season they typically recruit less than they had anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>The ISE said that a 14% rise in vacancies in the charity and private sectors was the only saving grace for the graduate labour market overall, which would otherwise be at risk of shrinking this year. This is partly due to the government\u2019s plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/boris-johnson-pledges-to-prioritise-nhs-after-election-victory\">increase spending on policing and the NHS</a>.</p> <p>Growth in the number of apprenticeship and school leaver programme vacancies also slowed to 2% from 7% last year, suggesting that a spike in openings sparked by the apprenticeship levy may be peaking.</p> <p>Isherwood said: \u201cOutside the public sector the market is not looking particularly healthy. Government needs to get the economy moving otherwise this year we\u2019ll be in for a stagnant graduate labour market at best. If the government want to see further growth in the apprentice market, they need to address employer concerns about how the apprentice levy works.\u201d</p>",

The Institute of Student Employers\u2019 (ISE) Pulse Survey for 2020 showed that employers were planning to recruit just 2.7% more new school-leavers and graduates this year. However, even this figure could prove optimistic after its research found that student recruiters are failing to hit their targets, pointing to a potential stagnation across the jobs market. A slowdown in graduate recruitment accounts for the bulk of the decline, though the survey also pointed to a slowdown in hiring of school leavers and apprentices in the months ahead. The research paints a worrying picture for young adults hoping to secure white-collar jobs across the country and appears to be part of a trend. Many of the jobs created in the UK over the past decade are too senior for students fresh out of school or university or are low-skilled, requiring little to no training. Figures collected by the Institute of Employment Studies show that of the 3.4m jobs created over the last 10 years, just 400,000 were classified as skilled and semi-skilled. Around 2.5m were considered professional or senior jobs, and were mostly taken by older, more experienced workers, while about 500,000 were classified as low-skilled. The Institute of Student Employers said employers were planning to increase graduate recruitment by just 3%, compared with the 18% rise in graduate vacancies predicted this time last year. Managers also failed to meet student recruitment targets last year by around 3%, it added. If that pattern persists, the graduate market will be stagnant in 2020, marking the worst graduate jobs growth rate since 2016. While it is not as bleak as the 25% drop in the graduate jobs market seen in 2008/2009, the ISE said it was a sign that employers are hesitant to increase investment in new staff. Stephen Isherwood, the ISE\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe graduate jobs market is an early indicator of the health of the economy as employers tend to plan further ahead when deciding their graduate recruitment needs. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is particularly concerning as employers are normally over optimistic at this time of the year. As we move through the recruitment season they typically recruit less than they had anticipated.\u201d The ISE said that a 14% rise in vacancies in the charity and private sectors was the only saving grace for the graduate labour market overall, which would otherwise be at risk of shrinking this year. This is partly due to the government\u2019s plans to increase spending on policing and the NHS. Growth in the number of apprenticeship and school leaver programme vacancies also slowed to 2% from 7% last year, suggesting that a spike in openings sparked by the apprenticeship levy may be peaking. Isherwood said: \u201cOutside the public sector the market is not looking particularly healthy. Government needs to get the economy moving otherwise this year we\u2019ll be in for a stagnant graduate labour market at best. If the government want to see further growth in the apprentice market, they need to address employer concerns about how the apprentice levy works.\u201d",
