He is a confident and tenacious midfielder.\u201d On Williams: \u201cHe is never fazed, he can go forward, he can defend. You will never be afraid to put someone like Brandon in.\u201d Classic Mourinho ... Goals. Maguire describes it as a \u201cgood win\u201d. He goes on to discuss how inconsistent United have been this season. Rashford says United could have been more clinical and the team really had to grind it out. He adds the result will do a lot for the team. Daniel James was my Man of the Match. Williams, Rashford and Fred also had good games. Nice to see United grind out a result, to be honest. United were certainly the better team and deserved the win against a Burnley team who offered very little. James is the man breaking once again, he slips in Rashford, who rounds the goalkeeper, then falls over and just about slips the ball into the net to seal the win. 90+4 mins: A corner to Burnley. Pope is up. It is sent deep and cleared, then pumped back in to the back post, resulting in cries for a penalty after an alleged handball. Nothing is given. 90+2 mins: Fred drives United forward, spreading the play to Shaw on the left-hand side of the area, only to see the sub pass a dreadful cross which is blocked and cleared. Williams is booked for diving after being taken out by Bardsley. A woeful decision by Dean. 90 mins: Five minutes added on. 89 mins: Burnley are keen to whack the ball into the box now but United are happy to take it. The attack breaks down when McNeil clips Williams. Shaw is on for Martial as United look to shut up the shop until New Year. 87 mins: Rashford is down clutching his face after being caught by Tarkowski\u2019s hand. It certainly isn\u2019t a foul, though, and the forward will be fine. Brady is Burnley\u2019s final change, replacing Cork. Will this make the difference? 85 mins: Taylor pleads for a corner and his cross is blocked by Young, claiming it hit the United man last but it actually clipped the Burnley full-back but going out. 83 mins: Pope whacks a free-kick long for the Burnley forwards to battle for but it comes straight back at the Clarets, with James breaking down the pitch and the ball ending up with Martial one-on-one with Pope, who comes out quickly to narrow the angle and is sends the Frenchman backwards. Burnley regroup and crowd out United in the end, but the visitors should now be out of sight. 81 mins: Taylor cleans out Young when challenging for a header after the United man beats him to it - the Burnley man avoids a second booking. 79 mins: Williams breaks out of defence and dribbles up field, passing the baton onto Rashford who runs into Tarkowski in the box and the Burnley defender clears. A little treat about Pellegrini being sacked. 76 mins: Cork is caught by Maguire on the edge of the area after some rare neat work from the Burnley attackers. Gudmundsson lines up the free-kick from 20 yards but he sends it marginally over. 75 mins: The BT Sport \u2018All Dayer\u2019 on January 1st makes it sound like a pub crawl, is that what they are going for? 73 mins: James needs lengthy treatment and in the end hobbles off to the side. Meanwhile, Lingard has replaced Pereira. 71 mins: Burnley are now playing at a respectable tempo and look dangerous on the ball. Taylor is the latest man to go in the book for fouling James, who is once again too quick for a defender and is caught on the ankle and is left on the deck. 69 mins: Wood wins a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left wing after being bundled over by Lindelof. McNeill swings it but the defence head it clear, conveniently to the least threatening player on the pitch, Phil Bardsley, who inexplicably hits a lovely drive which De Gea has to push wide. Gudmundsson has replaced Barnes as the dice are rolled. 67 mins: Rashford looks to send a pass through to Martial in the area but he collides on the edge of the box with Bardsley. It looks innocuous to me but I am sure VAR will look at it. Bardsley just does not see him coming. Nothing is given. 65 mins: Barnes chests down a long pass from Bardsley but the assistant inexplicably rules him to be offside and that is the end of that chapter. Down the other end, Rashford drives into the box but Rodriguez helps out Bardsley and they force the ball behind for a corner, which culminates with Matic dragging a shot wide. 63 mins: Dyche is speaking to his backroom staff about more changes. It must be Gudmundsson next ... 61 mins: With the world reeling from the news Pellegrini is out of work, Pereira takes centre stage once more by barging Taylor over. Mee goes into the book for a reckless challenge on James. Mee catches him around the knee as James does him for pace. Not a great effort from the Burnley skipper. 59 mins: McNeil gets the fans going with some dynamic wing play but his cross is blocked behind by Young. Westwood swings it in but Lindelof heads it out. It comes back to McNeil who drags his shot wide from inside the area. Rodriguez on for Hendrick. Ps West Ham have sacked Pellegrini. 57 mins: Taylor bends in a dangerous cross but Maguire reads it and heads clear, landing at Hendrick\u2019s feet but he can only lift it well over the bar. Looks like Rodriguez is coming on. 55 mins: Pereira drives towards the box, flicks it through to Martial who hits a clean shot from 18 yards out only to see Pope use his feet to repel the effort, proving his ankle is fine in the process. 53 mins: Burnley might need to do some business in the window, as this lot look devoid of ideas. Maybe a right winger would be a good idea if Lennon isn\u2019t firing. Speaking of which, McNeil seems to have moved to the right. 51 mins: NO GOAL! A cross is fired into the box, Martial controls it but is then adjudged to have fouled Tarkowski, so the Frenchman smashing the ball in from six yards proves fruitless. 49 mins: Rashford tries to get the better of Tarkowski in the area but the defender does well and diverts the ball out for a corner. Hendrick receives the ball 25 yards from goal and instead of slipping in Bardsley in on the overlap, he whacks a shot high and wide, much to the home fans\u2019 chagrin. Joe Harvey offers: \u201cIt seems like the threat of Joe Hart is better than any magic spray. You think Dyche would have Pope out there short of a gaping leg wound, and even then.\u201d 47 mins: Burnley are showing some early promise that they will up the tempo in this half after a pretty sedate opening 45 minutes. Here we go again! Pope is back out for the second half. His ankle must be fine. I genuinely can\u2019t imagine how bad Philip Schofield is at football in real life. The night gets worse for Justin Kavanagh: \u201cFor one moment there, I thought it was divine intervention that Pope was about to be subbed off and Saint Joseph would get a run-out with a big point to prove. But it\u2019s a Hartless game.\u201d How can Burnley change things? Gudmundsson would be good to add a bit more pace down the flank, as it things are a touch pedestrian with Hendrick there. Half-time reading: It has not been a Christmas cracker. Both teams have played at a pretty lethargic pace but United have certainly been the better side and merit their lead. Burnley have barely threatened the centre-backs despite their hustling strikers and really need to come up with something else after the break. 45 mins: Three minutes to be added on. A shambles from Taylor on the touchline as he is dispossessed by Pereira, who quickly sends in a cross to Martial. The Frenchman gets the ball out of his feet and slots home from close range. Burnley only have themselves to blame. 42 mins: Hart has gone to sit back down. In other goalkeeping news: De Gea whacks the ball straight out of play. The resulting long throw ends up with Barnes in the area but he smashes his shot high and wide. 40 mins: Hart is readying himself to come on. Pope is up once more and looks like he will try to carry on. Poor Joe Hart. 38 mins: Fred is dictating things in the middle of the park, his latest work puts in Williams on the left, his cross flashes along the six-yard line but Mee does well to put Martial off and it goes away. Pope rolls his ankle repositioning himself for the cross and his game could be over. Hart on? 36 mins: Sean King is thinking of January: \u201cLots of talk of talk of Maddison, Sancho and Haland to Utd, but stick Grealish and Adama Traore in this side and United would be immense going forward.\u201d Who will United get? 34 mins: HOW HAS THAT NOT GONE IN?! Williams arrives on the overlap and lifts a cross over everyone to James at the back post, his original shot bounces out to Martial six yards from goal and he smashes it at goal, only to have it cleared off the line from Bardsley. Incredible stuff from the Burnley full-back. 32 mins: Burnley finally create an attack which looks like it is going somewhere until Bardsley completely fails to find Westwood five yards away from him. United then break and it ends up with Rashford on the right who drives a cross from the byline straight at Mee who finds himself in the perfect position to stop the cross. 30 mins: Rashford thwacks another free-kick form 35 yards, which clips off the top of the wall and heads over the bar. The corner is headed clear by Bardsley, who then checks to make sure his hair is still in place. 28 mins: Mee catches Martial on the heel, probably just remind him that he\u2019s there. Maguire and Mee have a long argument about it, which results in a smirk from the Burnley skipper and telling the United man to get back in his box. 26 mins: Wood kicks Maguire in the face, as you do. There is no malice from Wood, just an honest attempt to get the ball. Burnley are keeping it tight here and just waiting for a set-piece to put United under pressure. 24 mins: Williams is fouled once more, this time by former United full-back Bardsley who catches him quite late while trying to get into the box. Pereira whips the free-kick in from the left but it is headed clear with minimal fuss. Justin Kavanagh says: \u201cAs it\u2019s Christmas, I\u2019ve a fiver bet on Burnley keeping this game scoreless, based on the faithful\u2019s belief (though not mine) that the Pope is infallible. Judging by his first few touches, I haven\u2019t a prayer!\u201d We want goals! 22 mins: Burnley earn a corner off Fred which never was and the Brazilian gets very angry with the referee. United will not want face many corners tonight, especially ones that are not merited. Luckily for all involved it comes to nothing. 20 mins: United break on Burnley at pace, culminating in Rashford getting the ball on the edge of the box and whacking a shot against the foot of the post and wide. 18 mins: Needless to say, United look more creative as Burnley just aim it up to the two big men. Williams does well to get away from Wood, who earns his revenge by somehow removing the defender\u2019s boot. Burnley hit a long free-kick into the box which Tarkowski knocks down for someone to attack but it ends up with De Gea. 16 mins: A one-two between James and Rashford releases the former to get away from Taylor, who brings him down just before he reaches the area. It is a cynical challenge but he does not get a booking. Fred whacks the free-kick well over. 14 mins: Tarkowski pulls down Fred around 35 yards from goal. Rashford lines it up and hits it wonderfully with power and precision, forcing Pope to dive to his left to palm away the swerving ball at around hip height. 12 mins: Barnes has spent half the game in the air trying to flick the ball on to someone or other and the rest moaning to the referee about getting pushed in the back while jumping. Mike Dean, naturally, is having none of it. Probably because both sides played two days ago, the pace of the match can only be described as slow. 10 mins: Rashford shouts in pain after being caught by Westwood. It does not look too bad but Rashford does take a kick on the top of his foot. The forward has looked United\u2019s main threat thus far, so they will want him at 100 per cent. 8 mins: Great work by Taylor on the left wing sees the full-back beat two men and chip a cross to the back post but his opposite number, Williams, is there to flick it clear before a claret shirt can get their head on it. 6 mins: Pope runs 20 yards out of his goal, takes a poor touch and is almost closed down by Martial but just about gets his clearance away. Young is on the deck after getting a little push in the back from Barnes. The United full-back hits the ground hard and looks in pain. After treatment he seems fine to continue. 4 mins: Rashford lifts a ball over the top for Pereira to chase but he is beaten to it by Pope, who decides to push it onto the midfielder, who knocks it out for a goal kick, rather than catch it. Whatever his intention, it worked. 2 mins: Burnley are looking to put the balls into the channels and Barnes has already earned a free-kick from Maguire. A positive start from the hosts. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The players are out on the pitch and Turf Moor is looking packed. Hopefully the teams will put on a show. I have a feeling it is not warm in Burnley. But the Burnley team are all in short sleeves apart from Hendrick. No shortage of things going on here ... Matic, Pereira and Fred is possibly the least terrifying midfield three United have put out in the Premier League. On BT Sport Marcus Rashford is taking Robin van Persie around Manchester and has been explaining the homeless issue there. As someone from the city, he is absolutely right to raise awareness of how bad the situation has become. He\u2019s a good egg. I always get a little tinge of sadness when I see Joe Hart on a bench; he was so good for Man City for so long and since then has, metaphorically, fallen off a cliff. Stats ... A busy time for the Pope. Have United recovered? Anyway ... when will we stop talking about the actual football and turn our thoughts to VAR? I will go for the 17th minute No surprises in the Burnley team. They will be even more excited looking at the United side. I suspect McNeil will be happier to face Young than Wan Bissaka. January transfer plans ... No Pogba, so they have dusted off Matic for the game. His last league appearance came in September. Burnley: Pope, Bardsley, Taylor, Tarkowski, Mee, Cork, Hendrick, Westwood, McNeil, Barnes, Wood Subs: Hart, Lowton, Gudmundsson, Drinkwater, Brady, Rodriguez, Long Manchester United: De Gea, Young, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams, Fred, Matic, Pereira, James, Martial, Rashford Subs: Romero, Jones, Mata, Lingard, Shaw, Greenwood, Wan-Bissaka. Good evening! Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley sit happily in mid-table and are not even looking over their shoulder, so will be very content with life. The squad and style are pretty much set and they will certainly make life difficult for a Manchester United team on a high after thrashing Newcastle. Scott McTominay will be missing for United having knacked his knee on Boxing Day and it will be interesting to see how much the team misses him, especially up against a side as well-drilled as Burnley. The Clarets will be ready to rough up United\u2019s back four, even resting Ashley Barnes for the Everton defeat in order to ensure he would be raring to go against Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof. The lack of McTominay should have meant a Premier League start for Paul Pogba after a couple of promising cameos in the last two games and he is someone United need if they are to challenge for the top four but he is absent again, it would seem. Burnley\u2019s back four impressed against Everton until the killer blow from Dominic Calvert-Lewin so will be looking to go one better against Rashford and Martial. Anyway, it should be a cracker at Turf Moor. Kick-off: 7.45pm (GMT)",

      "bodyText": "Accusations of cronyism at the top of the Labour party and a \u201crepeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of antisemitism\u201d must be confronted if it is to learn from its \u201ccatastrophic\u201d election loss, a group of defeated MPs and candidates have warned. The group says that Labour needs to go \u201cway beyond a simple review\u201d of its election performance if it is to understand why it fell to such a heavy defeat, which left it with its lowest number of seats since 1935. In a letter to the Observer, they say the issue of antisemitism was \u201cconstantly relayed back to us on the doorstep\u201d. The intervention will be seen as an attempt by figures on the centre and right of the party not to allow Labour\u2019s poor performance to be underplayed. It comes amid concerns about a party review of its performance that includes the former Labour leader Ed Miliband. Some in the party fear the review, led by the independent Labour Together group, will struggle to give a frank assessment of what went wrong. Among the signatories to the letter are Mary Creagh, who lost her Wakefield seat, Emma Reynolds, who lost her Wolverhampton North East seat, Anna Turley, who was unseated in Redcar, and Phil Wilson, who lost his Sedgefield seat. \u201cThe scale of this defeat means we have to look unflinchingly at what went wrong, way beyond a simple review, welcome as that might be,\u201d they write. \u201cWe need to be honest about why our outgoing leadership\u2019s reflexive anti-western world view was so unpopular, and address the reasons for that unpopularity. We were rejected on doorsteps not just because of our woolly, changing position on Brexit, or in Scotland, because of our weak commitment to the union, but because the very people we were supposed to be fighting for did not think the policies in our manifesto related to their lives.\u201d They add: \u201cThe focus on nationalisation and uncontrolled spending commitments meant people simply didn\u2019t believe us. Sadly, this was particularly true with those most affected by the poverty and injustice that 10 years of Tory government has created. \u201cLastly, the cronyism at the top of our party and repeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of antisemitism was constantly relayed back to us on the doorstep, shaming the traditional values of our once great anti-racist party. \u201cIt is our duty to speak up now, so that our party leadership candidates keep these people at the heart of their campaigns to lead our party. The challenge for the eventual winner is immense. We need to win 150 seats in every corner of the country, gaining votes from a coalition of communities. Labour needs to be in government \u2013 and for that, fundamental change at the top of our party is required. Only this will help us recover from the catastrophic loss.\u201d The letter comes with the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn still unclear, with only the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and the frontbencher Clive Lewis declaring their intention to run. The date of the election has not yet been set. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, who had been widely seen as the favoured candidate of the party\u2019s powerful left, is still regarded as a likely candidate, but has not yet set out her position since Labour\u2019s election loss. Party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery is also keeping his options open, suggesting that the party\u2019s left has not yet settled on a single candidate. Other likely candidates include Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, and backbenchers Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson is fond of metaphors such as an \u201coven-ready\u201d Brexit. He recently compared the struggle between Leave and Remain to the feuding of Montagues and Capulets. So the prime minister will readily understand, though probably not applaud, our likening of Britain in 2020 to a leaky tramp steamer heading into uncharted waters with a captain of doubtful character at the helm. Is Johnson a new Lord Jim? Time will find him out.</p> \n<p>To say the coming year is full of challenges is a comforting way of saying Britain will be tested, perhaps to breaking point, in ways not often experienced. A critical hurdle, following Britain\u2019s 31 January departure from the EU, is Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/michael-gove-promises-brexit-trade-deal-with-eu-by-end-of-2020\" title=\"\">rash pledge</a> to finalise a new European trading relationship by year\u2019s end.

Any deal that fails to meet the expectations of Brexit supporters, for example, Britain\u2019s fishermen, or does not secure the promised zero tariffs and quotas, for example, for Britain\u2019s car industry, will be seen as proof that Johnson\u2019s Brexit is fatally holed below the waterline. Failure to reach any agreement at all, resulting in a disastrous \u201cno-deal\u201d exit, would be an even bigger betrayal, especially of the working-class voters who put their faith in the Tories.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/27/eu-chief-questions-feasibility-of-boris-johnson-brexit-talks-time-limit\">Brexit talks: EU chief questions feasibility of Johnson's time limit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The government will simultaneously face serious constitutional challenges, chiefly the pro-Remain Scottish National party\u2019s demand for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-demand-powers-for-scottish-independence-referendum\" title=\"\">a second independence referendum</a>. It\u2019s plain a new vote could lead directly to the break-up of the UK. That\u2019s why Johnson opposes it. But Nicola Sturgeon is the smarter politician and the idea that a referendum can be blocked indefinitely seems implausible. It\u2019s likely, too, that continuing uncertainty over border arrangements with the Republic of Ireland will bring increased tensions, and possibly rising violence, in Northern Ireland. And while all this is going on, the government will embark on what is certain to be a controversial and unequal negotiation with the Trump administration about post-EU transatlantic trade. There can be little doubt the US will exploit British neediness to the full.</p> \n<h2>Superpowers and sycophants</h2> \n<p>Brexiters\u2019 hopes of carving out a new place in the world for \u201cglobal Britain\u201d will depend to a large extent on recalibrating existing relationships with the two dominant superpowers \u2013 the US and China. Securing fair deals will be hard enough. But some prospective trade-offs, entailing a diminution of the sovereign control Brexit was supposed to restore, are potentially humbling. The indirect price of an agreement with Donald Trump may include taking a more dangerously aggressive stance on Iran, against the Foreign Office\u2019s better instincts, or further weakening Britain\u2019s commitment to a two-state solution in Israel-Palestine. There is a real risk that Britain\u2019s independence of thought and action will be sacrificed to a closer US alliance \u2013 at the very moment America\u2019s global outlook is diverging radically from Britain\u2019s. November\u2019s US presidential election presents an additional hazard. Trump will demand Johnson\u2019s fealty, possibly even his endorsement. Yet to appear to take sides is to court disaster, as John Major, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/28/john-major-apologised-bill-clinton-vietnam-war-draft-dodging-suspicions-national-archives\" title=\"\">discovered</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5bceb519-424a-4c3b-b218-b9599ac6bb16\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-oysu0HC9ys?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Likewise, post-EU Britain\u2019s hopes of a more profitable business and investment partnership with China must not mean kowtowing on issues such as Hong Kong, where the violent repression of the pro-democracy movement looks set to continue. The government cannot honourably allow such considerations to temper opposition to Beijing\u2019s military expansionism and neighbourhood bullying, exemplified by its escalating threats to Taiwan, which holds free elections next month. Under its hardline president, Xi Jinping, China is rapidly emerging as the leader of global anti-democratic forces using modern tools such as debt diplomacy, mass surveillance and online and academic censorship, plus old-fashioned repression.</p> \n<h2>Democracy and authoritarianism</h2> \n<p>The damage that Britain\u2019s departure will do to the already enfeebled EU project is often overlooked in London. Rising instability across the continent, seen in the increased influence of far-right populists and nationalists, is not in Britain\u2019s interest. Yet by their woeful example, Johnson and his Brexit wrecking crew encourage it. The weakening of the Anglo-German alliance is one of the most worrying consequences. Quiet co-ordination between London and Berlin has traditionally provided a steadying counterweight to the EU\u2019s southern states. By jointly furnishing economic and financial leverage, military strength and diplomatic clout, it has given teeth to Europe\u2019s democratic values and its influence in the world.</p> \n<p>Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia works tirelessly to undermine its western neighbours through cyber hacks, online disinformation and other forms of \u201chybrid\u201d warfare. In Turkey, the quasi-dictatorship of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan grows more anti-European and anti-Nato. In the Gulf, the Saudis <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/turkey-rights-groups-decry-saudi-verdict-khashoggi-murder-191223171239748.html\" title=\"\">remain unpunished</a> for the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. From Thailand and Pakistan, to Brazil and Venezuela, 2020 may prove a dangerous year for democrats. Yet this is the hostile, storm-tossed world in which Britain, buoyed by Borisonian bombast and an ocean of waffle, now blindly bobs.</p> \n<h2>Islamophobia and Muslims</h2> \n<p>Islamophobia received relatively less attention in Britain in 2019 than the related scourge of antisemitism. Yet despite the dismissive views of some rightwing commentators, it is a real and growing problem. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/22/anti-muslim-hate-crimes-soar-in-uk-after-christchurch-shootings\" title=\"\">rise in Islamophobic attacks</a> in Britain has intensified fears of increased division, alienation and radicalisation. Worldwide, the effects of discrimination and prejudice against Muslims are ever more widely felt.</p> \n<p>China has rightly come under increased international censure over its persecution and detention of up to one million Muslim Uighurs in western Xinjiang province. Beijing says it is fighting terrorism. To most people, it\u2019s more akin to ethnic cleansing. Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government in India seems to be pursuing a political-religious vendetta against the 200m-strong Muslim minority. Along Myanmar\u2019s borders, there is no respite for Rohingya Muslim refugees victimised by a <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/myanmar-suu-kyi-stand-genocide-case-hague-191211054254397.html\" title=\"\">genocidal military campaign</a>.</p> \n<p>Muslims are the <a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/most-terrorist-victims-are-muslim\" title=\"\">main victims</a>, in terms of numbers, of entrenched conflicts such as Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia. This is also true of attacks by Islamic State (Isis) and other jihadist groups. Britain is directly in the terrorist line of fire, as shown by the recent London Bridge attack. Yet its ability to mount an effective defence through close co-operation and timely intelligence-sharing with other European democracies may soon be fatally compromised.</p> \n<p>Instability across the Muslim world is growing: the Iran-Saudi confrontation in the Gulf; ongoing political turmoil in Israel, Lebanon and Gaza; Turkey\u2019s assault on the Kurds of north-east Syria; brutal dictatorship in Egypt; popular insurrection in Iraq; revolution in Sudan; violent chaos in Libya and Yemen; and the seemingly inexorable spread of radical ideology and jihadism across north Africa and the Sahel to west Africa.</p> \n<p>If the torrid years following the 2001 al-Qaida attacks on the US have proved anything, it is that Middle East problems are global problems from which no country, most especially Britain, with its contentious regional legacy, is immune. It is equally obvious that Britain cannot defuse or resolve these linked crises on its own. From a purely pragmatic viewpoint, this is a foolhardy moment to be trying to go it alone.</p> \n<h2>Climate and security</h2> \n<p>The links between the climate emergency and security \u2013 personal, physical and economic \u2013 are ever clearer. Australia\u2019s unprecedented heat, bushfires and toxic smog are but the latest warning about the dangers of failing to take the threat seriously. Recent flooding affecting much of southern England is another amber alert. Yet Britain is still not doing nearly enough to defend its people, flora and fauna against such calamities and to reduce and reverse the effects of polar ice warming, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme weather events and mass extinctions. The coming Glasgow i<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-49650909\" title=\"\">nternational climate summit</a> is an opportunity to give real meaning to the phrase \u201cglobal Britain\u201d \u2013 by setting an urgent global example.</p> \n<p>Each generation believes its problems are uniquely threatening. Yet the climate crisis seems to be truly of a different order. It affects everyone and everything. And climate scientists say the coming decade is all the time that remains to avoid an irreversible tipping point.</p> \n<p>More than anything else on Earth, the climate emergency is a clear and present danger, which we must do all we can to address in 2020. Happy New Year!</p>",

There were 10,424 assaults on staff in the 12 months to June, an increase of 10% on the previous year. Recent cases include a new officer requiring stitches in the neck after being attacked with a razor blade, another being doused with sugared boiling water, and an officer\u2019s car being torched in a prison car park. Staff have been attacked with weapons fashioned from food trays, toilet brushes and wood screws.</p> <p>Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, said: \u201cThe prison system is in crisis.

However, the service did reveal the overall amount it had paid out in litigation claims. The bill came to just over \u00a326m in 2016-17, rose to \u00a329.3m in 2017-18 and increased again to \u00a329.7m in 2018-19.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to lock the prisoners up for longer.

The most recent annual review of prisons found that violence against both staff and prisoners had increased at more than half the jails inspected over the previous year, while in some prisons the figures had doubled.</p> <p>The prison service said that litigation costs covered a range of areas outside of violence, including lost property and personal injuries as a result of accidents. It added that the government had committed to spend \u00a32.75bn to help improve safety and create 10,000 extra prison places. The figures included data relating to claims brought over a number of years, which were settled in the past three years.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taking action to reduce the cost of compensation to the taxpayer by addressing issues in prisons that can lead to claims and improving our case handling,\u201d a spokesman for the prison service said.</p> <p>A huge reduction in prison staff ordered by the coalition government of 2010 to 2015 has been blamed for the deterioration in the conditions inside prisons. While officer numbers are increasing, Nick Davies, from the Institute for Government, said that the inexperienced workforce was a \u201clikely cause\u201d of the rising legal bill.</p> <p>Mick Pimblett, from the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, said there was now a \u201cvicious circle\u201d within prisons and called for more protection for staff. \u201cThey can\u2019t recruit staff or retain staff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you have to lock the prisoners up for longer without purposeful activity.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is under renewed pressure to deal with the prisons crisis after it emerged that the chaotic conditions are behind a \u00a330m-a-year bill for legal claims. Figures obtained by the Observer reveal that the prison and probation service in England and Wales has paid out more than \u00a385m over three years for issues such as attacks on staff and prisoners, lost and damaged property, accidental personal injury and delays to inmates being released. Lawyers and prison experts blamed fewer and inexperienced officers struggling to cope with overcrowded and often violent jails. They also warned that the government\u2019s plans for more police and harsher sentences risked making the prisons crisis even worse. Some 14 officers had to be treated after an outbreak of violence at Feltham young offender institute in west London on Friday. The Ministry of Justice said the disturbance lasted about 25 minutes. A report on the centre published in the summer identified high levels of violence and self-harm. There have been repeated warnings about conditions inside many prisons, with violence against prison officers at a record high. There were 10,424 assaults on staff in the 12 months to June, an increase of 10% on the previous year. Recent cases include a new officer requiring stitches in the neck after being attacked with a razor blade, another being doused with sugared boiling water, and an officer\u2019s car being torched in a prison car park. Staff have been attacked with weapons fashioned from food trays, toilet brushes and wood screws. Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, said: \u201cThe prison system is in crisis. The awful level of violence and self-harm, and the extraordinary compensation figures, are signs that significant parts of the prison system are out of control. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s promises of longer sentences for serious offences and more police will lead to a new surge in the prison population and pile more pressure on an already struggling system. \u201cThey will not be able to get new prisons built or suitably experienced staff in place in time to cope with these additional pressures. I know that senior staff in the prison system are extremely concerned. They are right to be.\u201d Her Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation Service resisted a lengthy campaign that tried to force it to reveal the cost of legal action taken by officers and inmates as a result of prison violence. However, the service did reveal the overall amount it had paid out in litigation claims. The bill came to just over \u00a326m in 2016-17, rose to \u00a329.3m in 2017-18 and increased again to \u00a329.7m in 2018-19. Prison officers and reform campaigners suggested this was further evidence of a service under intense strain. The most recent annual review of prisons found that violence against both staff and prisoners had increased at more than half the jails inspected over the previous year, while in some prisons the figures had doubled. The prison service said that litigation costs covered a range of areas outside of violence, including lost property and personal injuries as a result of accidents. It added that the government had committed to spend \u00a32.75bn to help improve safety and create 10,000 extra prison places. The figures included data relating to claims brought over a number of years, which were settled in the past three years. \u201cWe are taking action to reduce the cost of compensation to the taxpayer by addressing issues in prisons that can lead to claims and improving our case handling,\u201d a spokesman for the prison service said. A huge reduction in prison staff ordered by the coalition government of 2010 to 2015 has been blamed for the deterioration in the conditions inside prisons. While officer numbers are increasing, Nick Davies, from the Institute for Government, said that the inexperienced workforce was a \u201clikely cause\u201d of the rising legal bill. Mick Pimblett, from the Prison Officers\u2019 Association, said there was now a \u201cvicious circle\u201d within prisons and called for more protection for staff. \u201cThey can\u2019t recruit staff or retain staff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you have to lock the prisoners up for longer without purposeful activity. They then become frustrated. When they become frustrated, they become violent.\u201d Hardwick said: \u201cThe main cause of the crisis has been the loss of experienced staff. Prison security depends much more on relationships between staff and prisoners than it does on locks and bars, and effective relationships require experienced staff. Staff numbers were cut by 25% after 2012. The cuts are now being reversed but new staff are leaving almost as fast as they are being recruited.\u201d The prison service spokesman said: \u201cWe successfully defend two-thirds of claims, and when prisoners are awarded compensation we make sure they pay their victims back first. We are spending an extra \u00a32.75bn to improve safety in our jails \u2013 creating 10,000 additional prison places and introducing tough airport-style security to clamp down on the illicit items which fuel violence.\u201d",

Is there, then, anything that could stop them winning the title for the first time since 1990? The performance at Leicester and the way they controlled the second half against Salzburg in the Champions League answered a lot of questions, showing a capacity to manage games that had not always been in evidence this season, but through the late autumn there was a clear sense that Liverpool were not playing quite as well as results suggest. Opta\u2019s charts show that by the start of the Boxing Day programme they had scored 10.03 goals more than their xG (expected goals), a greater positive disparity than for any other side in the league \u2013 although, of course, that may mean nothing more than they have the most clinical forwards.

That propensity to keep going, to keep believing and find late goals when required remains beyond the scope of algorithms but Liverpool have it in abundance. Such patterns have a tendency to become self-fulfilling, as they did for Manchester United\u2019s peak Fergie Time season of 1998-99, or Sunderland when they were promoted under Roy Keane in 2006\u201107: not only do the team seeking a goal come to believe it will come and so attack with more conviction and less sense of desperation, but the other side can come to believe that it will inevitably concede and so drop deeper and deeper.

      "bodyText": "Paul MacInnes was at Carrow Road for the Guardian and this is how he saw events unfold. Teemu Pukki speaks: \u201cWe are in a moment where we need to win games, so obviously we can\u2019t be totally happy with this,\u201d he tells Sky Sports. \u201cBut against a top team we took a point ... but because we were leading it feels like a bad result. We\u2019ve been playing quite well lately and we haven\u2019t been getting the results. To get a point is a good start.\u201d Speaking alongside Pukki, Mario Vrancic says he doesn\u2019t think his team-mates second \u201cgoal\u201d, which he created, was offside. He does, however, concede that he hasn\u2019t seen a replay. He\u2019s going to be properly hacked off when he does. A brief recap: Mario Vrancic opened the scoring for Norwich in the 18th minute with his first Premier League goal and Norwich fans thought Teemu Pukki had doubled their lead shortly after the half hour, only for the Finn to have his effort ruled out by the spods in the VAR bunker who got out their rulers and revealed he\u2019d been a millimetre offside in the build-up. Tottenham equalised 10 minutes into the second half, thanks to a splendid free-kick from Christian Eriksen that took a deflection on its way past Tim Krul. Against the run of play, Norwich restored their lead courtesy of a comedy own goal from Serge Aurier, prompting a late siege on Norwich\u2019s goal that ended when Harry Kane won and scored a penalty on an otherwise quiet evening for him. Peep! Peep! Peep! It\u2019s all over at Carrow Road, where the sides have shared the points. One suspects both will feel aggrieved at not having won a game that was often entertaining and sometimes controversial, but a draw was probably a fair result overall. 90+7 min: Christian Eriksen\u2019s delivery is poor and Norwich clear. 90+7 min: Serge Aurier wins a corner for Tottenham. 90+5 min: Christian Eriksen is booked for a foul on a Kenny McLean that looked more accidental than malicious. 90+3 min: Toby Alderweireld is booked for a foul on Todd Cantwell, who had turned him and was about to leave the Tottenham defender in his dust. 90+1 min: the ball runs out for a Tottenham Hotspur goal kick despite the best attempts of Todd Cantwell to keep Max Aarons\u2019s through ball. 89 min: Onel Hernandez and Erik Lamela become entangled over by the far touchline near the technical areas as they tussle for the ball. We\u2019ll have seven minutes of added time, to account for six substitutions and that lengthy period of treatment for Mario Vrancic. 87 min: Tanguy Ndombele picks out Lamela on the edge of the penalty area and his dipping drive gives Tim Krul plenty to think about. He saves a mite unconvincingly and puts the ball out for a corner. Nothing comes from the set piece as we enter the game\u2019s knockings with both sides looking for a winner. 86 min: A brave call from Daniel Farke, who takes off holding midfielder Alex Tettey and replaces him with the more attack minded Todd Cantwell. 84 min: Dele Alli tries to pick out Kane with a deft chip from just inside the Norwich penalty area. Goal kick. Harry Kane equalises for Spurs, with only his second opportunity of the game. Krul dives to his right and Kane puts the ball to his left. It\u2019s all square at Carrow Road after a five-minute period in which Norwich\u2019s defence was seriously under siege. 80 min: Harry Kane wins a penalty, cleverly going down under a challenge from Christoph Zimmermann. It wasn\u2019t a dive, but he knew it was coming and went down accordingly. 79 min: Dele Alli stretches to prod home a ball across the face of the goal from Harry Kane. He can\u2019t reach. 78 min: Tottenham win a corner, which they take with some urgency. Nothing comes of it. 78 min: Jamal Lewis does well to dispossess Erik Lamela with the Tottenham substitute on the ball in a dangerous area just outside the Norwich penalty area. 76 min: Tottenham win a free-kick just inside their own half, which they take quickly. Moura takes the ball forward and passes to Eriksen on the edge of the area, only for the Dane to lose it. Tottenham substitution: Erik Lamela replaces Giovani Lo Celso. Norwich substitution: Mario Vrancic is replaced by Tom Trybull. 74 min: Davinson Sanchez rolls the ball straight out of play for a Norwich City throw-in. 73 min: Tim Krul comfortably deals with a long range effort from Christian Eriksen. 70 min: Norwich substitution: Marco Stiepermann makes way for Kenny McLean. 69 min: Lucas Moura is given a booking for shoving Max Aarons off the pitch and perilously close to the advertising hoardings as the full-back sprinted up the right flank with the ball at his feet. 67 min: Far be it from me to tempt fate and incur the wrath of Norwich City fans, but Harry Kane has had a very quiet game for Spurs tonight. So far. 65 min: Tim Krul is untroubled by a Giovani Lo Celso shot from distance, gathering it comfortably. 62 min: Tottenham\u2019s defending has been little short of atrocious at times today and once again they are punished. With his team having been opened up on the counter by a fine Norwich move, Toby Alderweireld attempts to intercept a poor effort on goal from Teemu Pukki, only to see his interception cannon off the shins of Aurier and into the back of the net past the hopelessly wrong-footed Gazzaniga. Norwich go back in front with a slapstick own goal from Serge Aurier! 60 min: Norwich break forward with Jamal Lewis on the ball and he picks out Onel Hernandez in the penalty area. With Sege Aurier all over the place in defence, Hernandez pulls the ball back to Pukki, who gets it caught under his feet. 58 min: Dele Alli lifts the ball over Krul and into the Norwich goal to round off a fine passing move from Tottenham, but is correctly flagged for offside as he darted to latch on to Giovani Lo Celso\u2019s lofted pass to the edge of the six-yard box. 57 min: Scandalously, by the way, Mario Vrancic has been allowed to play on despite shipping that blow to the head that left him looking very groggy indeed just a few minutes ago, The sides are level! Straight in front of goal just outside the Norwich City penalty area, Christian Eriksen sends his free-kick over the wall and into the top right-hand corner. It was a sublime free-kick, which I think took a deflection off Alex Tettey in the defensive wall on its way past Tim Krul. 53 min: Jamal Lewis uses an arm to deflect the ball away from Harry Kane as he tried to control a pass from Moura on the edge of the Norwich penalty area. Tottenham\u2019s players appeal for a red card, claiming he\u2019s denied their skipper a clear goalscoring opportunity. They have to settle for a free-kick, from which Christian Eriksen scores. 52 min: Vrancic walks to the side of the pitch in the company of two medical staff and takes a swig from a water-bottle. He can\u2019t conceivably be going to continue? This being football, of course he can. Here\u2019s hoping the Norwich backroom staff see sense. 51 min: Looking very dazed, Vrancic gets to his feet as the Norwich medical staff continue to assess him. 50 min: Norwich goalscorer Mario Vrancic seems to have taken a bad blow to the head in that collision with Lo Celso and continues to receive treatment. 49 min: A collision between Lo Celso and Vrancic leaves both men flat on their backs on the ground and in need of treatment. Tottenham have gone to a back four in this second half , having switched from the back three that served them so poorly in the first. 48 min: Zimmermann receives treatment after that goal-saving tackle, having hurt his neck in its execution. He leaves the field and then comes back on after the medics have assessed his injury. 47 min: A brilliant covering tackle from Christoph Zimmermann puts a stop to Dele Alli\u2019s gallop as the Spurs midfielder was about to pull the trigger after being put through on goal by Christian Eriksen. 46 min: Play resumes and Jose Mourinho has made two changes at half-time. Lucas Moura and Davinson Sanchez come on for the hapless first half duo that were Juan Foyth and Jan Vertonghen. Peep! Norwich City go in for their half-time rest a goal to the good, thanks to Mario Vrancic\u2019s first Premier League strike. They\u2019ll feel aggrieved that Teemu Pukki had one chalked off, the Finnish striker joining Crystal Palace\u2019s Max Meyer and Brighton\u2019s Dan Burn in having goals ruled out today by VAR due to ridiculously tight offside calls. 45+1 min: Tim Krul sends a clearance long and Tottenham win a throw-in as the clock ticks down towards half-time. 45 min: Ryan Sessegnon pings the ball into the Norwich City box, where Tim Krul gathers. 44 min: Norwich win a throw0in deep in their opponents\u2019 half after a period of sustained Spurs pressure. However, a foul on Dele Alli allows Tottenham to clear their lines. 42 min: \u201cThe message from the VAR hub is that Pukki was offside in the build-up and that\u2019s why it was ruled out,\u201d says the Sky commentary team. They\u2019re really just making this up as they go along, aren\u2019t they? 38 min: Pukki came back from an offside position into an onside position before picking up a pass from Vrancic and taking advantage from some atrocious defending by Alderweireld to control the ball and slot coolly past Gazzaniga. Does that still count as offside? Like many others, including Daniel Farke who is seeking clarification from the fourth official, I no longer have the foggiest idea. Teemu Pukki\u2019s goal is ruled out as he becomes the third Premier League player today to have a goal ruled out for one of those ridiculous offsides that involves the Fun Police in VAR HQ getting out their magnifying glasses, set squares and rulers to establish that he was fractionally offside when making his run to latch on to a cross from Vrancic. What a farce! Teemu Pukki doubles Norwich\u2019s lead. Comedy defending from Alderweireld allows Norwich\u2019s star striker to extend their lead. 32 min: The ball\u2019s swung into the mixer from the set piece and Grant Hanley leaps to head it goalwards. His effort goes out off the shoulder of Alderweireld, who had jumped with him, but Kevin Friend awards a goal kick. 31 min: Juan Foyth puts a Stiepermann cross out for a corner, despite the best attempts of Alderweireld to prevent it from going out of play. 30 min: Alex Tettey spots a run into the Tottenham penalty area from Emi Buendia and tries to ping the ball into his path from deep. His pass is slightly wayward, making it easy for Gazzaniga to claim. 28 min: Onel Hernandez picks the ball up on the left flank, cuts inside, beats Juan Foyth and tries to curl the ball inside the far post from the edge of the penalty area. His intentions were good, but his execution left a lot to be desired. Wide as a ditch. 27 min: The ball remains in play for about three minutes without either goal coming under threat. 24 min: Norwich City\u2019s energetic pressing has been very impressive thus far, forcing Tottenham\u2019s players into mistakes on the ball. Will they be able to keep it up for 90 minutes? Only time will tell, but their doggedness has earned them a one-goal lead so far. 22 min: With players up in support as he charged goalwards with the ball at his feet, Vrancic was allowed to advance on the Spurs goal before opening the scoring for his team. Methinks Tottenham\u2019s players were distracted by having to keep tabs on his Pukki and Buendia who were up in support on Vrancic\u2019s left 21 min: Vrancic is booked for a scything tackle on Ndombele. 20 min: Foyth stepped out with the ball and was caught in possession halfway inside his own half. Vrancic galloped goalwards and elected to shoot rather than lay the ball off to Teemu Pukki, who was up in support. The finish was measured and cool, aimed towards the bottom corner from about 15 yards. Norwich lead! A mistake by Juan Foyth allows Mario Vrancic to score his first Premier League goal on only his second Premier League start. 17 min: Grant Hanley gives the ball away, allowing Christian Eriksen to square the ball across the face of the Tottenham penalty area. Dele Alli\u2019s shot is blocked. 16 min: A long ball from Alderweireld is pounced on by Harry Kane, who had sprinted between Grant Hanley and Zimmermann. He shoots goalwards, but is foiled by a good save from Tim Krul. 15 min: Buendia swings the ball into the mixer and Ryan Sessegnon puts it out for a corner. Eriksen sends the ensuing inswinger out for another corner, which is sent straight into the arms of Gazzaniga. 14 min: Juan Foyth gives way a free-kick out by the left touchline, in line with the edge of the Tottenham penalty area. 13 min: With almost a quarter of an hour on the clock, both teams have missed gilt-edged opportunities to take the lead. It\u2019s an error-strewn but entertaining game. 11 min: Harry Kane tees up Dele Alli with a pass across the edge of the Norwich penalty area following a mistake from Christoph Zimmermann. The in-form Alli squanders a golden opportunity, sending his effort high over the bar. 10 min: A mix-up between Ndombele and Christian Eriksen gifts possession to Marco Stiepermann about 30 yards from the Tottenham goal. He runs at Alderweireld and unleashes a drive that Gazzaniga does very well to put around his post for a corner. With a low more composure, Stiepermann should have scored. 9 min: Grant Hanley hacks clear for a Tottenham throw-in, after intercepting a Dele Alli pass that looked to be on its way to Harry Kane. 7 min: Jamal Lewis fins himself a few yards outside the Tottenham penalty area about 30 yards from goal. He takes aim and unleashes a low left-footed drive, but his dipping effort fizzes well wide of the right upright. 6 min: Hernandez and Jamal Lewis combine down the left, but Giovani Lo Celso wins the ball from the latter and larrups it forward. 4 min: Onel Hernandez sprints between two Tottenham defenders trying to get on the end of a Mariuo Vrancic pass from deep. There\u2019s too much welly on the pass and Gazzaniga is quick off his line to come and claim the ball at the edge of his penalty area. 3 min: Tim Krul rolls the ball out to Max Aarons, who plays it forward to Christoph Zimmermann. He loses possession in midfield. Scrappy stuff in these very early stages. 2 min: There\u2019s a couple of early throw-ins around the halfway line as both sides feel each other out. 1 min: Paulo Gazzaniga gets an early touch as Toby Alderweireld plays the ball back to him. He plays the ball forward and Norwich take possession. 1 min: Tottenham get the ball rolling on Kevin Friend\u2019s signal and we\u2019re off and running at Carrow Road. A minute\u2019s applause There\u2019s a moment to remember World Cup winner Martin Peters, who played for both these sides and died on the 21 December. May he rest in peace. Not long now: The teams are out on the pitch and kick-off is just a couple of minutes away. Norwich City\u2019s players wear their usual home kit of canary yellow and green shirts, green shorts and yellow socks. The visiting side wear navy shirts, shorts and socks. Correction: Tim Krul has not been injured in the warm-up. It was Ralf Fahrmann who hurt his knee and he is replaced on the bench by Michael McGovern. Tim Krul starts. There\u2019s also been a pitchside proposal: With the Sky cameras looking on, a Norwich fan proposes to his girlfriend, who says ... yes. He puts a ring on her finger, gives her a kiss and a hug. How jolly. Tim Krul has been injured in the warm-up: Norwich City\u2019s goalkeeper has done himself a mischief and will be replaced by his German understudy Ralph Fahrmann. Michael McGovern, a 35-year-old Northern Ireland international will take Fahrmann\u2019s place on the bench. Daniel Farke speaks: \u201cWe have to beat the top of our game without any doubt,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to stop the quality in their side and need a very good all around performance today.\u201d Jose Mourinho speaks: \u201cWe are grateful that he wanted to play and he is ready to help the team,\u201d he says of Tanguy Ndombele, in a pre-match interview with Sky Sports. \u201cMaybe not for 90 minutes, but he is ready to play.\u201d Fun festive fact: In Giovani Lo Celso, Ryan Sessegnon, Dele Alli, Juan Foyth, Paulo Gazzaniga, Christian Eriksen and Serge Aurier, Tottenham line up with players wearing the shirt numbers 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24. Both managers make four changes: Jamal Lewis, Mario Vrancic, Onel Hernandez and Marco Stiepermann come in for Norwich, while Juan Foyth, Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen start for Tottenham. Norwich: Krul, Aarons, Zimmermann, Hanley, Lewis, Tettey, Vrancic, Emi, Stiepermann, Hernandez, Pukki. Subs: Byram, Cantwell, Trybull, Fahrmann, McLean, Amadou, Srbeny. Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Foyth, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Eriksen, Alli, Sessegnon, Kane. Subs: Sanchez, Lamela, Vorm, Dier, Lucas Moura, Skipp, Tanganga. Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire) Tottenham team news: Tanguy Ndombele, Juan Foyth, Giovani Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen all start. We\u2019ll have full line-ups very shortly. Early team news For Norwich, Timm Klose, Josip Drmic and Ben Godfrey are injured, while Daniel Farke is likely to rotate his squad following his team\u2019s Boxing Day exertions. Onel Hernandez may start for the Canaries. Hugo Lloris and Ben Davies remain sidelined for Tottenham, who will also be without Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko, who will sit this game out on the naughty step alongside Son Heung-min. Having reported that Tanguy Ndombele opted not to make himself available for selection against Brighton despite being fit, it will be intriguing to see if Jose Mourinho includes the \u00a355m midfielder in his squad today. Having come on as substitutes against Brighton, Christian Eriksen and Giovani Lo Selso could start today. Following an unconvincing Boxing Day victory over Brighton, Tottenham Hotspur travel to Carrow Road to take on a Norwich City side who lost against Aston Villa two days ago despite being the better team. Bottom of the table and seven points from safety, Norwich are in dire need of points, while a win for Tottenham would send them fourth ahead of Chelsea, who play Arsenal tomorrow, on goal difference. Kick-off is at 5.30pm, but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

After an embarrassing defeat to a below-strength Leicester side \u2013 West Ham\u2019s fourth loss in a row at home \u2013 thanks to a brilliant winning goal from Demarai Gray, there was an air of inevitability that the veteran manager would be shown the door a little more than 18 months after taking over from David Moyes. Not since Blackpool\u2019s Ian Holloway in November 2010 had a Premier League manager made as many changes to his starting lineup this early in the season as Brendan Rodgers opted for here but even his second-string proved far too strong for a dispirited home team. Despite seeing the returning Lukasz Fabianski save a penalty from Gray in the first half and Pablo Fornals cancel out Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s opener, Pellegrini\u2019s lacklustre side never looked capable of claiming victory and left the pitch to a chorus of boos from the few supporters who stayed until the bitter end. Perhaps the only surprise is that the 66-year-old was not given the opportunity to stay on for Bournemouth\u2019s visit to the London Stadium on New Year\u2019s Day, although the co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold surely felt there was no alternative after such an insipid display. It is now likely to fall on Moyes to try and perform a second rescue act within three seasons, with the former Everton manager having been lined up for several weeks. On this evidence, he faces a sizeable task given that Rodgers had made nine changes to the side hammered 4-0 by Liverpool on Boxing Day. The absence of their talisman, Jamie Vardy, was explained by the news that his wife had given birth to a daughter in the hours before kick-off as Leicester became only the sixth team in Premier League history to make nine or more alterations to their starting lineup in match before the turn of the year. Aside from the reception for Sir Geoff Hurst as he led the minute\u2019s applause to his 1966 World Cup-winning teammate Martin Peters, the news that Fabianski had returned from the hip injury that has kept him sidelined for the last 11 Premier League matches received the biggest cheers from the home supporters before kick-off.

Israel swiftly bombed Hamas targets.</p> <p>Yet most Palestinians in Gaza are more preoccupied by the day-to-day struggles imposed by the blockade and de-development than fears of another military escalation. When the UN published its 2012 report, unemployment was already 29%. Now the World Bank puts it at 53% (and 67% for young Gazans). Almost half the population subsists on less than $5.50 per day, compared with just 9% in the West Bank.</p> <p>Nasser is not the only one to seek a better life elsewhere. The UN report estimated that more than 1,000 extra doctors would be needed for Gaza\u2019s fast growing population by 2020.

We cut some flowers to decorate our festive table for a dinner party later on.</p> <p>The flowers are stunning, like a May Gibbs illustration. They are endemic to the subtropical rainforests of northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland. I can\u2019t seem to recall if she ever drew lemon myrtle, but you can imagine it would have fit in well among the gumnut babies with its glowing, creamy white-gold blossoms against striking, evergreen, apple-tinted leaves. The flowers always have a concentration of pollinator activity around, humming with life in the dry landscape.</p> <p>They\u2019re a hardy, drought-tolerant specimen, cultivated in home gardens and grown commercially for multiple uses. Even in our current conditions they\u2019re thriving without irrigation, growing organically unaided.</p> <p>The plant lives up to its name, with a pure lemony fragrance that comes from the compound citral, which is also found in lemongrass, lemon verbena and lemon and lime \u2013 lemon myrtle oil has the highest citral purity of any known plant. It can be used both fresh and dry in cooking and as an essential oil for medicine and personal care, thanks to its high anti-fungal and anti-microbial properties. It is also becoming popular in natural home cleaning products.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s its decorative potential: I have seen an urban Sydney street lined with them, and in the middle of the summer when everything seemed to be drooping from the heat, they called to me. Their bright, perky blossoms look like the fringed eyelashes of Lucille Ball, batting her eyes with such hopefulness. They remind me of how magnificent our native species are.</p> <p>This time of year the culture becomes weirdly nostalgic for mistletoe, reindeers, panettone and other stereotypical Christmassy symbols. But we are a nation of mixed tribes and ethnicities, and we mustn\u2019t forget to celebrate the things that thrive here.</p> <p>This year, we are going full Australiana in our end of year decorations around the house. There is no tinsel, no Christmas lights, no blow-up Santas nor chemically produced snow machines.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBack-whose-it-what\u2019s-it?\u201d my daughter exclaims, pointing to the glorious flowering bushes under our covered netting. \u201cBackhousia citriodora,\u201d I explain \u201cis the Latin name given to this native bush food and medicine that Indigenous Australians have been using for thousands of years.\u201d It is a cheerful sight among the dryness of our current landscape. We cut some flowers to decorate our festive table for a dinner party later on. The flowers are stunning, like a May Gibbs illustration. They are endemic to the subtropical rainforests of northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland. I can\u2019t seem to recall if she ever drew lemon myrtle, but you can imagine it would have fit in well among the gumnut babies with its glowing, creamy white-gold blossoms against striking, evergreen, apple-tinted leaves. The flowers always have a concentration of pollinator activity around, humming with life in the dry landscape. They\u2019re a hardy, drought-tolerant specimen, cultivated in home gardens and grown commercially for multiple uses. Even in our current conditions they\u2019re thriving without irrigation, growing organically unaided. The plant lives up to its name, with a pure lemony fragrance that comes from the compound citral, which is also found in lemongrass, lemon verbena and lemon and lime \u2013 lemon myrtle oil has the highest citral purity of any known plant. It can be used both fresh and dry in cooking and as an essential oil for medicine and personal care, thanks to its high anti-fungal and anti-microbial properties. It is also becoming popular in natural home cleaning products. Then there\u2019s its decorative potential: I have seen an urban Sydney street lined with them, and in the middle of the summer when everything seemed to be drooping from the heat, they called to me. Their bright, perky blossoms look like the fringed eyelashes of Lucille Ball, batting her eyes with such hopefulness. They remind me of how magnificent our native species are. This time of year the culture becomes weirdly nostalgic for mistletoe, reindeers, panettone and other stereotypical Christmassy symbols. But we are a nation of mixed tribes and ethnicities, and we mustn\u2019t forget to celebrate the things that thrive here. This year, we are going full Australiana in our end of year decorations around the house. There is no tinsel, no Christmas lights, no blow-up Santas nor chemically produced snow machines. Instead we have wreaths of fresh and dried natives, boughs of lemon myrtle flowers, and on our table marshmallows made by our extraordinary Kiwi by birth pastry chef at Boon Caf\u00e9, Brent Templeton.

How sublime to see two Australian actors at the top of their game, as Irving circled PM Rachel Anderson (Rachel Griffiths) in a realpolitik bargaining drama about land rights, Indigenous deaths in custody and US strategic influence, under Rachel Perkins\u2019s precise direction. In the last 10 minutes of episode six, the Senate bell rang, the sand raced through the hourglass and phone texts were hurriedly exchanged. \u201cNow or never,\u201d pinged Irving\u2019s adviser, as Irving got to her feet and declared: \u201cIt has come to my attention the prime minister is covering up a very serious crime.\u201d Is it too much to hope that in season two, Irving will swap to the lower house, run for the top job, and give us a leader of integrity and reason, like Jed Bartlet in The West Wing? \u2013 Steve Dow 2.

If he refused, he would be punished \u2013 barred from reducing his prison sentence, making phone calls home, or worse. This Christmas, a cry for help from Leo and other foreign inmates of Qingpu was smuggled out, hidden in a Tesco greetings card. China has called the card and allegations of forced labour by foreign prisoners a \u201cfarce\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Mohammad Roshid is hardly alone among refugees sent to Nauru and Manus Island by Australia when he says he feels \u201chopeless and broken\u201d and that he is \u201cstuck in limbo without a future in sight\u201d. But Roshid\u2019s despair is unique, thanks to his decision in 2015 to take up the offer of a transfer to Cambodia, one of only 10 asylum seekers held offshore to do so. The other nine have since managed to leave the country. Only Roshid remains, trapped in a poor country with no possibility of becoming a citizen and no support from the country that promoted his move \u2013 Australia. \u201cAll I am asking for is a permanent solution so I don\u2019t have to live this stateless life,\u201d the 29-year-old Rohingya says. \u201cIf I was given an opportunity to be resettled in a third country, I would be able to work and make a future without struggling on a daily basis. I can\u2019t see this is a possibility if I remain in Cambodia.\u201d A \u2018solution\u2019 with few takers Before the US deal and the New Zealand offer and the Canadian sponsorships, there was the Cambodian solution. It launched in 2014 when Scott Morrison, then immigration minister, clinked champagne glasses with Cambodia\u2019s interior minister and signed a deal to send Australia\u2019s offshore refugees to the south-east Asian country. The deal was widely criticised over its lack of transparency and the implications of Australia paying to ship its refugees to a country with a track record of human rights abuses and corruption, and which struggles to support its own people. It ended up costing Australia more than $50m to send 10 people, nine of whom eventually left the country. Cambodia, having received its $40m in aid, said it didn\u2019t want any more. Roshid, who fled danger in his homeland and sought safety in Australia, only to be dumped on Nauru, now feels abandoned in Cambodia. For most of his life, he has sought to be a citizen of whatever country would have him. He took a chance on Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia, based on promises he would no longer be stateless. But now he says he has heard nothing from the organisations that were tasked by the Australian government to support him, and watches from afar as his former fellow detainees finally get their second chance in North America. \u201cI felt hopeless and broken when I saw that refugees from Manus and Nauru were being resettled in the US and Canada because I couldn\u2019t see a future for me in Cambodia,\u201d Roshid says. Despite assurances he says he received, neither the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) nor its successor, the Australian firm Connect Settlement Services, helped him get citizenship or a passport in his new home. Without it, he says, he cannot find work, buy a SIM card or rent an apartment. \u201cI have been trying so hard to get a job but I haven\u2019t had any luck yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw an advertisement on Facebook in October this year about a clothing factory. I called them and set up an appointment to see if I could work there. They asked me to bring my passport or citizenship card, which I was unable to do.\u201d When he arrived in November 2015, Roshid was supported by the IOM for five months, receiving food, pocket money and rent. He says he then got some assistance from the Australian government for another 20 months, but it has been almost two years since he got any help. The IOM confirms it was contracted to provide services for six months, but says it can not provide further details about individuals for privacy reasons. The IOM has previously told Al Jazeera its staff thought \u201clong and hard\u201d about getting involved with the Cambodia deal. \u201c[We] came down to the difficult \u2026 decision that this was the best that we could do for these vulnerable migrants,\u201d spokesman Joe Lowry says. \u201cWe pushed very hard for the highest possible levels of services to these people to try to be as pro-migrant as we can be, as we need to be to retain our credibility.\u201d \u2018On many occasions I was beaten\u2019 The most recent organisation to offer Roshid help, Connect Settlement Services, gave him a small cart so he could start a small business as a street vendor and support himself and his wife, a fellow Rohingya whom Roshid met in Cambodia. \u201cI have been trying so hard to sell roti but it is so difficult for me to get a spot to sell my roti because all the main spots are taken by the Cambodians,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI often try to go early to obtain a good spot but I am always kicked out by locals. They say you are not from here. On many occasions I was beaten and my money was taken away from me because I didn\u2019t leave. I reported these events to the Australian immigration but no action was taken. So I realised that justice would not be served for me. \u201cI have no choice except to leave and find another spot where I can barely sell a few roti.\u201d Connect Settlement Services was paid $1.32m to care for the handful of refugees in Cambodia, for 14 months until late 2016. It was also paid $77.7m for two years\u2019 work providing services to the detainees on Nauru, but declined to renew its contracts in September 2016, saying the work required was beyond them. The next day it also ended its Cambodian contract. Graham Thom, a spokesman for Amnesty International Australia, says the organisation was always concerned about the long-term status of refugees who went to Cambodia. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for people of any description, let alone refugees, to get citizenship in Cambodia,\u201d Thom says. \u201cWithout it, you are extremely vulnerable. That\u2019s why we generally see people resettled from those countries, not to those countries.\u201d Shortly after Cambodia and Australia signed its deal, Cambodian officials visited the detention centre on Nauru. Roshid told the Khmer Times last year he was asked three times to go to Cambodia by immigration detention centre staff, who told him his asylum claim had \u201cno hope\u201d. Having been in detention for two years, he said yes. \u201cI finally felt my chances would be better in Cambodia than Australia.\u201d There was little information about what was ahead of those who chose to move to Cambodia. There were no apparent guarantees from Australia of access to health or education. The Kaldor Centre reported that no volunteers came forward, and rumours spread that vulnerable asylum seekers were under pressure to step up and prevent the embarrassment to Australia of a failed deal. Freedom is elsewhere In November 2016, Australia struck a deal with the US government for it to resettle up to 1,250 people held on Nauru or Manus. About 900 have already gone or are preparing to go. New Zealand has also maintained its offer to resettle 150 people from the Manus and Nauru cohorts every year, and while the Australian Coalition government has consistently rejected it, there are signs it may be wavering. A growing number are now finding their own paths to freedom, through private sponsorship in other countries such as Switzerland and Canada. But for Roshid, freedom in Cambodia is fraught with obstacles and he is desperate for another country to offer him a chance to make a decent life for himself. \u201cThere were many times when people took my money and I couldn\u2019t report it anywhere. No one recognises my paper. I will always be considered an outsider, and I can\u2019t see a clear path to citizenship in this country. So I will always struggle with my life here. I am just stuck in limbo without a future in sight.\u201d The Department of Home Affairs tells Guardian Australia the government has fulfilled its agreements with those settled in Cambodia.

These documents allowed individuals to obtain a driver\u2019s license, travel documents and confirmed work rights,\u201d he says. Refugees living in Cambodia were eligible to apply for Khmer nationality through naturalisation after seven years, he says. Guardian Australia has contacted the Cambodian government for confirmation. Amnesty\u2019s Thom says Australia has to take responsibility for Roshid. \u201cIt was a deal they signed with Cambodia and it was never going to be a long-term solution, they have to realise that,\u201d he says. \u201cAustralia has invested at least $55m into their solution but it hasn\u2019t worked. They have to accept that and ensure that at a minimum he can be eligible for the US deal.\u201d The US state department has indicated there is no avenue for Roshid to pursue resettlement through the Australian program.

      "body": "<p>The anger is extraordinary for its depth and ferocity. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/22/narendra-modi-defends-contentious-citizenship-law-as-clashes-continue-india\" title=\"\">protests</a> that have spread across the world\u2019s largest democracy, Indians of all stripes have taken to the streets. Two weeks ago, the government amended the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far\" title=\"\">citizenship law </a>to speed up applications for refugees from surrounding countries who are Hindu, Christian, Parsi, Jain or Buddhist \u2013 but not Muslim. The law coincides with an attempt to create a new list of India\u2019s citizens, a task whose precise mechanism has evolved in recent days. Regardless of the details, it will be a Kafkaesque exercise during which poor people with few official documents will have to prove their citizenship. If they happen to be Muslim, the citizenship law means the consequences they face will be different. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-45192701\" title=\"\">Detention centres</a> mushrooming across India reveal what those might be.</p> <p>The pan-Indian nature of the outcry is striking. India has long been home to disobedience, but the scale and reach of the present discontent is rare. Though the protests have been painted as a conspiracy limited to Muslim and elite forces, elements that have come together to suppress the real India, there seems to be genuine and diverse opposition to the plainly exclusionary citizenship law. As the drama and horror have unfolded, both the protesters and the state have acted in familiar ways. We have seen student agitations, silent marches, legal orders, police brutality and recriminations. Yet there is something special about this episode, something new on each side.</p> <p>Unlike many an agitation in Indian history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/what-are-indian-citizenship-protests-about-and-how-significant-are-they\" title=\"\">these protests </a>have not centred on specific goals and policies. While the context is the citizenship law, the message has been that India\u2019s essence hangs in the balance. For its independent history, the nation has mostly been liberal and democratic, in stark contrast to much of the post-colonial world. Now, with the country\u2019s identity being framed in terms of its majority Hindu population, its status is changing. Importantly, the communalisation is taking place with state absolutism. In Kashmir, for example, where the region\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\" title=\"\">constitutional autonomy was annulled</a> in August, there has been a lockdown spanning travel, communications and ordinary life.

      "bodyText": "The anger is extraordinary for its depth and ferocity. In protests that have spread across the world\u2019s largest democracy, Indians of all stripes have taken to the streets. Two weeks ago, the government amended the citizenship law to speed up applications for refugees from surrounding countries who are Hindu, Christian, Parsi, Jain or Buddhist \u2013 but not Muslim. The law coincides with an attempt to create a new list of India\u2019s citizens, a task whose precise mechanism has evolved in recent days. Regardless of the details, it will be a Kafkaesque exercise during which poor people with few official documents will have to prove their citizenship. If they happen to be Muslim, the citizenship law means the consequences they face will be different. Detention centres mushrooming across India reveal what those might be. The pan-Indian nature of the outcry is striking. India has long been home to disobedience, but the scale and reach of the present discontent is rare. Though the protests have been painted as a conspiracy limited to Muslim and elite forces, elements that have come together to suppress the real India, there seems to be genuine and diverse opposition to the plainly exclusionary citizenship law. As the drama and horror have unfolded, both the protesters and the state have acted in familiar ways. We have seen student agitations, silent marches, legal orders, police brutality and recriminations. Yet there is something special about this episode, something new on each side. Unlike many an agitation in Indian history, these protests have not centred on specific goals and policies. While the context is the citizenship law, the message has been that India\u2019s essence hangs in the balance. For its independent history, the nation has mostly been liberal and democratic, in stark contrast to much of the post-colonial world. Now, with the country\u2019s identity being framed in terms of its majority Hindu population, its status is changing. Importantly, the communalisation is taking place with state absolutism. In Kashmir, for example, where the region\u2019s constitutional autonomy was annulled in August, there has been a lockdown spanning travel, communications and ordinary life. With institutions such as the judiciary hardly visible, state authority has faced few obstacles. The protests have expressed concern at both the redefinition of Indianness and the decline in democratic freedoms. A noticeable feature in the outrage has been an emphasis on the constitution. The document expresses a strong commitment to individual autonomy.

      "body": "<h2>Arsenal</h2> <p>Forgive the cynicism, but it\u2019s hard not to think Arsenal\u2019s suits went for Mikel Arteta because, unlike some of the more experienced options, he was happy to take the job without demanding a massive war chest up front. So, while the squad is gossamer thin and injury-struck, it won\u2019t be a surprise if not much is spent next month. Especially since Emery seemingly wasted \u00a372m on P\u00e9p\u00e9 \u2013 that experience suggests the board are unlikely to risk \u00a380m on another show pony in Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha. Mikel might well be forced to rely on kids instead, hoping Saka, Maitland-Niles, Smith-Rowe, Nelson and Willock will flourish.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Azulay </strong><a href=\"http://www.goonersdiary.co.uk/\" title=\"\">GoonersDiary.co.uk</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goonern5\" title=\"\">@GoonerN5</a></p> <h2>Aston Villa</h2> <p>I\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t spend heavily: these owners aren\u2019t the types to die wondering. Despite my faith in Wesley we clearly need alternatives up front: he can\u2019t play every second, and an ageing sniffer would be good off the bench. And while we have lots of defensive midfield options, nobody has really convinced. Sadly we\u2019ll also need an answer to the McGinn problem: he\u2019s out for three months.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Pritchard</strong></p> <h2>Bournemouth</h2> <p>A strong centre-half to work closely with Nathan Ak\u00e9 would be great \u2013 someone like Ben White from Leeds. A striker would also be welcome \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s Michy Batshuayi, for example \u2013 but the noises coming from the club suggest there won\u2019t be big moves made in January. Instead it sounds like it\u2019ll be more a case of trying to hold on to Ak\u00e9 and Callum Wilson. We\u2019re resigned to losing Ryan Fraser sooner or later.</p> <p><strong>Peter Bell </strong><a href=\"https://afcbchimes.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">AFCBchimes.blogspot.co.uk</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cherrychimes?lang=en\" title=\"\">@cherrychimes</a></p> <h2>Brighton</h2> <p>Above all else we would love Aaron Mooy to stay \u2013 he\u2019s still on a season\u2011long loan from Huddersfield as it stands. Another striker would be good, and we\u2019ve also been linked with Emil Bohinen, a 20-year-old Norwegian winger from Stab\u00e6k, who sounds like a real prospect.</p> <p><strong>Steph Fincham</strong></p> <h2>Burnley</h2> <p>The rule at our club is to not expect too much from transfer windows, then you won\u2019t be disappointed. There are areas where we need work: a good right-back to start competing with Phil Bardsley and Matt Lowton, plus a strong and powerful midfielder. But whether we can find either with the money we\u2019re able to pay remains the big question. We\u2019ve learned not to get too excited about transfers, especially in the January window when there\u2019s not a great deal of business done more widely. All that said, if Santa could leave us a couple of late presents, they\u2019d be gratefully accepted.</p> <p><strong>Tony Scholes </strong><a href=\"https://www.uptheclarets.com/\" title=\"\">UpTheClarets.com</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/utcdotcom\" title=\"\">@UTCdotcom</a></p> <h2>Chelsea</h2> <p>Frank Lampard dropped hints last week about squad-building: it has to happen. We need a left-back \u2013 I\u2019d be happy with Ak\u00e9 returning from Bournemouth \u2013 and another striker so Tammy Abraham doesn\u2019t burn out. Olivier Giroud has been written off and Michy Batshuayi isn\u2019t good enough, bar a solid five\u2011minute cameo every now and then. Another goalscoring midfielder/winger would help, too. It\u2019s great to have so many kids pushing for places, but you still need quality and experience to challenge for trophies. Roman, get your chequebook out.</p> <p><strong>Paul Baker</strong></p> <h2>Crystal Palace</h2> <p>After being injury-free for most of the season, we\u2019ve been struck down by a huge number of long-term knocks that have thrown into sharp focus the immediate needs for a left-back and a right-back. Nathan Ferguson from West Brom has been mentioned, but I\u2019d expect us to try to pick up an overseas bargain. We lack options on the flanks, too, so another winger may be targeted. And we still, of course, need to add a striker who can score goals \u2013 relying on Jordan Ayew for the rest of the season would be another giant gamble. Whether we take a chance and spend big on someone like Fyodor Chalov or look to get Rhian Brewster or Michy Batshuayi on loan remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>Chris Waters </strong><a href=\"http://palacetrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">PalaceTrust.org.uk</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Clapham_Grand\" title=\"\">@Clapham_Grand</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d14b0952e5fe96131fd5f51aac652557f4d56ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d14b0952e5fe96131fd5f51aac652557f4d56ee/736_384_4428_2657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michy Batshuayi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michy Batshuayi: back to Selhurst Park?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Offside via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Everton</h2> <p>Ancelotti\u2019s big overhaul will surely wait until the summer, but it\u2019s still the case that we need a proven scorer, another central midfielder and a central defender \u2013 the spine of the team has been lacking and the problems weren\u2019t addressed during the close season. Maybe we\u2019ll just see a loan or two in January: Marcel Brands is a reluctant spender.</p> <p><strong>The esk </strong><a href=\"https://theesk.org/\" title=\"\">TheEsk.org</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theesk\" title=\"\">@theesk</a></p> <h2>Leicester</h2> <p>The first XI is performing like a dream \u2013 so it\u2019s about adding depth and options for us. Another winger would be nice: Harvey Barnes and Demarai Gray don\u2019t have enough to carry the workload on their own. And a reliable scorer would be appreciated too \u2013 just in case Vardy gets injured.</p> <p><strong>Chris Whiting </strong><a href=\"https://www.clippings.me/chriswhiting\" title=\"\">clippings.me/chriswhiting</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisRWhiting\" title=\"\">@ChrisRWhiting</a></p> <h2>Liverpool</h2> <p>We\u2019ve already signed Japan midfielder Takumi Minamino from Salzburg, who looked great against us in the Champions League \u2013 and scored at Anfield. It\u2019s no secret we\u2019ve been looking for a left-back, brought into focus recently when Robertson picked up an injury. There\u2019s paper talk we\u2019re interested in Mathieu Gon\u00e7alves from Toulouse, but he\u2019s young and inexperienced. We might be better off with 19-year-old Sam McCallum, who is at Coventry and also being touted.</p> <p><strong>Steph Jones</strong></p> <h2>Manchester City</h2> <p>We need a centre-half, but I really don\u2019t see it happening. It\u2019d most likely have to be a deal that\u2019s already been earmarked for the summer, but is capable of being moved forward, just as Aymeric Laporte\u2019s was thanks to his release clause. On Laporte, thankfully it sounds as if he\u2019ll be back fit by the end of January, just in time for the Champions League knockouts. But either way, we\u2019re still short after Kompany\u2019s departure.</p> <p><strong>Lloyd Scragg </strong><a href=\"https://ninetythreetwenty.com/\" title=\"\">NinetyThreeTwenty.com</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lloyd_scragg\" title=\"\">@lloyd_scragg</a></p> <h2>Manchester United</h2> <p>A good window would involve James Maddison, a player who\u2019d really add the guile and inventiveness we\u2019re lacking. We should have signed him in the summer \u2013 he\u2019d cost double now what we would have paid then. Erling Braut Haaland sounds like he\u2019s on his way from Red Bull Salzburg \u2013 he should bring variety to our attack as a big, robust and remarkably mobile target man. [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/borussia-dortmund-manchester-united-signing-erling-braut-haaland\">Haaland in fact joined Borussia Dortmund on Sunday</a>] And swapping Paul Pogba for PSG\u2019s Marco Verratti would be a real lift: he\u2019s the all-round midfielder that we have been after for so long.</p> <p><strong>Shaun O\u2019Donnell</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd973f731f0395b9762a28d725171a67de2cc6c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd973f731f0395b9762a28d725171a67de2cc6c2/0_139_3192_1915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Maddison\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Maddison: made for Old Trafford?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Newcastle</h2> <p>What do we need? Just a striker who can score goals \u2013 maybe someone like Joselu, who we sold in July and is now a star in La Liga \u2026 Our forward line has been under\u2011strength for years and this hasn\u2019t remotely been addressed in the last two windows, despite us making two record signings. It\u2019s telling that we\u2019re relying on our defenders to carry our goal threat.</p> <p><strong>David and Richard Holmes</strong></p> <h2>Norwich</h2> <p>We won\u2019t be spending big. That much we do know, but given that we\u2019ve operated for much of the season with one fit, bona fide centre-back, Ben Godfrey, who spent the festive buildup with his knee in a brace, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a central defender on Daniel Farke/Stuart Webber\u2019s list. Hopefully they will also look to address the physicality, or lack of it, in the centre of the pitch. We ask a lot of our centre-mid pairing but too often they\u2019ve been bullied, so a technician who can also mix it would be my wish. And, of course, everyone needs another scorer \u2026.</p> <p><strong>Gary Gowers </strong><a href=\"http://norwichcity.myfootballwriter.com/\" title=\"\">norwichcity.myfootballwriter.com</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gary_Gowers\" title=\"\">@gary_gowers</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/norwichcitymfw?lang=en\" title=\"\">@NorwichCityMFW</a></p> <h2>Sheffield United</h2> <p>We\u2019re in such a strong position for this season that we can afford to try to sign players for the future rather than ones that need to make an instant impact. Backup for George Baldock and Oli Norwood, along with the next Chris Basham, are probably our top priorities.</p> <p><strong>Ben Meakin </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bladespod?lang=en\" title=\"\">@bladespod</a></p> <h2>Southampton</h2> <p>A centre-back who can actually win a header would be nice \u2013 is that too much to ask? Also a right-back \u2013 C\u00e9dric is going through the motions ahead of his contract expiring and Yan Valery\u2019s career has gone into reverse gear. If there was time and space I\u2019d also add a central midfielder with a bit of actual bite, rather than just \u201cget booked because you were the wrong side AGAIN\u201d cynicism.</p> <p><strong>Steve Grant </strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-624988137\" title=\"\">Total Saints Podcast</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveGrant1983\" title=\"\">@SteveGrant1983</a></p> <h2>Tottenham</h2> <p>It\u2019ll be interesting to see what type of player-pressies are on Mourinho\u2019s post-Xmas list and how he responds when Daniel Levy refuses to grant his wishes. A recent poll revealed the player Spurs fans most want is Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala, who almost signed in the summer. No denying his qualities but he says he\u2019s content at Juventus and the image-rights issues remain. Adama Traor\u00e9 of Wolves might be a more realistic and cheaper attacking option and is clearly somebody the manager respects judging from the choreographed rotational fouling he was subjected to at Molineux earlier in the month. Another rumoured Serie A aspiration is centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly of Napoli but he doesn\u2019t match the club\u2019s signings profile (too old and too expensive) \u2013 and it\u2019s full-backs we really need. Ricardo Pereira would fit the bill. As for Gareth Bale ... think more Marouane Fellaini unless Levy pulls off some crazy swap-plus-cash deal with Eriksen.</p> <p><strong>Richard Barnes </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/barnesrichard?lang=en\" title=\"\">@barnesrichard</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18cd6e1b76b19ceb77d5ec3a0815dcc09fe875a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18cd6e1b76b19ceb77d5ec3a0815dcc09fe875a3/81_93_1861_1117/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paulo Dybala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paulo Dybala: coveted by Spurs fans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Lingria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Watford</h2> <p>The near legendary Brazilian teenage striker Jo\u00e3o Pedro will arrive with all sorts of lunatic expectations, but another attacking weapon in the continuing absence of Danny Welbeck would be a plus.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal Forgive the cynicism, but it\u2019s hard not to think Arsenal\u2019s suits went for Mikel Arteta because, unlike some of the more experienced options, he was happy to take the job without demanding a massive war chest up front. So, while the squad is gossamer thin and injury-struck, it won\u2019t be a surprise if not much is spent next month. Especially since Emery seemingly wasted \u00a372m on P\u00e9p\u00e9 \u2013 that experience suggests the board are unlikely to risk \u00a380m on another show pony in Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha. Mikel might well be forced to rely on kids instead, hoping Saka, Maitland-Niles, Smith-Rowe, Nelson and Willock will flourish. Bernard Azulay GoonersDiary.co.uk @GoonerN5 Aston Villa I\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t spend heavily: these owners aren\u2019t the types to die wondering. Despite my faith in Wesley we clearly need alternatives up front: he can\u2019t play every second, and an ageing sniffer would be good off the bench. And while we have lots of defensive midfield options, nobody has really convinced. Sadly we\u2019ll also need an answer to the McGinn problem: he\u2019s out for three months. Jonathan Pritchard Bournemouth A strong centre-half to work closely with Nathan Ak\u00e9 would be great \u2013 someone like Ben White from Leeds. A striker would also be welcome \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s Michy Batshuayi, for example \u2013 but the noises coming from the club suggest there won\u2019t be big moves made in January. Instead it sounds like it\u2019ll be more a case of trying to hold on to Ak\u00e9 and Callum Wilson. We\u2019re resigned to losing Ryan Fraser sooner or later. Peter Bell AFCBchimes.blogspot.co.uk @cherrychimes Brighton Above all else we would love Aaron Mooy to stay \u2013 he\u2019s still on a season\u2011long loan from Huddersfield as it stands. Another striker would be good, and we\u2019ve also been linked with Emil Bohinen, a 20-year-old Norwegian winger from Stab\u00e6k, who sounds like a real prospect. Steph Fincham Burnley The rule at our club is to not expect too much from transfer windows, then you won\u2019t be disappointed. There are areas where we need work: a good right-back to start competing with Phil Bardsley and Matt Lowton, plus a strong and powerful midfielder. But whether we can find either with the money we\u2019re able to pay remains the big question. We\u2019ve learned not to get too excited about transfers, especially in the January window when there\u2019s not a great deal of business done more widely. All that said, if Santa could leave us a couple of late presents, they\u2019d be gratefully accepted. Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com @UTCdotcom Chelsea Frank Lampard dropped hints last week about squad-building: it has to happen. We need a left-back \u2013 I\u2019d be happy with Ak\u00e9 returning from Bournemouth \u2013 and another striker so Tammy Abraham doesn\u2019t burn out. Olivier Giroud has been written off and Michy Batshuayi isn\u2019t good enough, bar a solid five\u2011minute cameo every now and then. Another goalscoring midfielder/winger would help, too. It\u2019s great to have so many kids pushing for places, but you still need quality and experience to challenge for trophies. Roman, get your chequebook out. Paul Baker Crystal Palace After being injury-free for most of the season, we\u2019ve been struck down by a huge number of long-term knocks that have thrown into sharp focus the immediate needs for a left-back and a right-back. Nathan Ferguson from West Brom has been mentioned, but I\u2019d expect us to try to pick up an overseas bargain. We lack options on the flanks, too, so another winger may be targeted. And we still, of course, need to add a striker who can score goals \u2013 relying on Jordan Ayew for the rest of the season would be another giant gamble. Whether we take a chance and spend big on someone like Fyodor Chalov or look to get Rhian Brewster or Michy Batshuayi on loan remains to be seen. Chris Waters PalaceTrust.org.uk @Clapham_Grand Everton Ancelotti\u2019s big overhaul will surely wait until the summer, but it\u2019s still the case that we need a proven scorer, another central midfielder and a central defender \u2013 the spine of the team has been lacking and the problems weren\u2019t addressed during the close season. Maybe we\u2019ll just see a loan or two in January: Marcel Brands is a reluctant spender. The esk TheEsk.org @theesk Leicester The first XI is performing like a dream \u2013 so it\u2019s about adding depth and options for us. Another winger would be nice: Harvey Barnes and Demarai Gray don\u2019t have enough to carry the workload on their own. And a reliable scorer would be appreciated too \u2013 just in case Vardy gets injured. Chris Whiting clippings.me/chriswhiting @ChrisRWhiting Liverpool We\u2019ve already signed Japan midfielder Takumi Minamino from Salzburg, who looked great against us in the Champions League \u2013 and scored at Anfield. It\u2019s no secret we\u2019ve been looking for a left-back, brought into focus recently when Robertson picked up an injury. There\u2019s paper talk we\u2019re interested in Mathieu Gon\u00e7alves from Toulouse, but he\u2019s young and inexperienced. We might be better off with 19-year-old Sam McCallum, who is at Coventry and also being touted. Steph Jones Manchester City We need a centre-half, but I really don\u2019t see it happening. It\u2019d most likely have to be a deal that\u2019s already been earmarked for the summer, but is capable of being moved forward, just as Aymeric Laporte\u2019s was thanks to his release clause. On Laporte, thankfully it sounds as if he\u2019ll be back fit by the end of January, just in time for the Champions League knockouts. But either way, we\u2019re still short after Kompany\u2019s departure. Lloyd Scragg NinetyThreeTwenty.com @lloyd_scragg Manchester United A good window would involve James Maddison, a player who\u2019d really add the guile and inventiveness we\u2019re lacking. We should have signed him in the summer \u2013 he\u2019d cost double now what we would have paid then. Erling Braut Haaland sounds like he\u2019s on his way from Red Bull Salzburg \u2013 he should bring variety to our attack as a big, robust and remarkably mobile target man. [Haaland in fact joined Borussia Dortmund on Sunday] And swapping Paul Pogba for PSG\u2019s Marco Verratti would be a real lift: he\u2019s the all-round midfielder that we have been after for so long. Shaun O\u2019Donnell Newcastle What do we need? Just a striker who can score goals \u2013 maybe someone like Joselu, who we sold in July and is now a star in La Liga \u2026 Our forward line has been under\u2011strength for years and this hasn\u2019t remotely been addressed in the last two windows, despite us making two record signings. It\u2019s telling that we\u2019re relying on our defenders to carry our goal threat. David and Richard Holmes Norwich We won\u2019t be spending big. That much we do know, but given that we\u2019ve operated for much of the season with one fit, bona fide centre-back, Ben Godfrey, who spent the festive buildup with his knee in a brace, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a central defender on Daniel Farke/Stuart Webber\u2019s list. Hopefully they will also look to address the physicality, or lack of it, in the centre of the pitch. We ask a lot of our centre-mid pairing but too often they\u2019ve been bullied, so a technician who can also mix it would be my wish. And, of course, everyone needs another scorer \u2026. Gary Gowers norwichcity.myfootballwriter.com @gary_gowers @NorwichCityMFW Sheffield United We\u2019re in such a strong position for this season that we can afford to try to sign players for the future rather than ones that need to make an instant impact. Backup for George Baldock and Oli Norwood, along with the next Chris Basham, are probably our top priorities. Ben Meakin @bladespod Southampton A centre-back who can actually win a header would be nice \u2013 is that too much to ask? Also a right-back \u2013 C\u00e9dric is going through the motions ahead of his contract expiring and Yan Valery\u2019s career has gone into reverse gear. If there was time and space I\u2019d also add a central midfielder with a bit of actual bite, rather than just \u201cget booked because you were the wrong side AGAIN\u201d cynicism. Steve Grant Total Saints Podcast @SteveGrant1983 Tottenham It\u2019ll be interesting to see what type of player-pressies are on Mourinho\u2019s post-Xmas list and how he responds when Daniel Levy refuses to grant his wishes. A recent poll revealed the player Spurs fans most want is Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala, who almost signed in the summer. No denying his qualities but he says he\u2019s content at Juventus and the image-rights issues remain. Adama Traor\u00e9 of Wolves might be a more realistic and cheaper attacking option and is clearly somebody the manager respects judging from the choreographed rotational fouling he was subjected to at Molineux earlier in the month. Another rumoured Serie A aspiration is centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly of Napoli but he doesn\u2019t match the club\u2019s signings profile (too old and too expensive) \u2013 and it\u2019s full-backs we really need. Ricardo Pereira would fit the bill. As for Gareth Bale ... think more Marouane Fellaini unless Levy pulls off some crazy swap-plus-cash deal with Eriksen. Richard Barnes @barnesrichard Watford The near legendary Brazilian teenage striker Jo\u00e3o Pedro will arrive with all sorts of lunatic expectations, but another attacking weapon in the continuing absence of Danny Welbeck would be a plus. A big ugly centre-back wouldn\u2019t hurt either. Matt Rowson BHappy.wordpress.com @mattrowson West Ham We need a box-to-box midfielder who might eventually replace Mark Noble. A new reserve keeper, too, for obvious reasons, along with a striker to back up Haller and Antonio. On top of all that, we need a full-back and centre-back to provide competition in defence, and an Adama Traor\u00e9-style winger. Oh, and we could do with Diangana returning from his West Brom loan, too. Pete May Author of Goodbye to Boleyn; hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Wolves Nuno likes to have a tight-knit squad but has admitted we need new signings. This is a season when we could establish ourselves, both domestically and in Europe, so, while it\u2019s a notoriously difficult time to sign players, a central defender \u2013 Kristoffer Ajer? \u2013 a central midfielder \u2013 Franck Kessi\u00e9? \u2013 and a winger \u2013 Hwang Hee-chan? \u2013 are areas that would add depth and quality to our ever-improving squad.

Flamur \u201cAlex\u201d Beqiri, 36, was shot outside his home in Battersea, south-west London, at about 9pm on 24 December as he returned with his wife and young child. The attacker fled on foot, police said. Beqiri, a Swedish national born in Albania, had been living in London for four or five years, according to Scotland Yard. As speculation mounted surrounding a possible revenge motive for the gangland-style killing, Sweden\u2019s prosecution service confirmed that Beqiri was friends with the boyfriend of Karolin Hakim, who was gunned down in Malm\u00f6 in August when the pair were walking with their baby in broad daylight. When two gunmen approached, the boyfriend fled, but Hakim was shot in the head and died at the scene. Reports say the killers had targeted her boyfriend. The murder of Hakim, who had recently qualified as a doctor, shocked Sweden and led to a renewed focus on violent gang feuds in the country. \u201cWhat is very striking is that [Beqiri] was shot dead when he was with his wife and child in the same way that Hakim was shot dead while holding her child,\u201d prosecutor P\u00e4r Andersson, who is leading the investigation into Hakim\u2019s death, told Swedish media on Friday evening. \u201cIt is so ruthless to murder people in front of their family and children.\u201d The link with Hakim\u2019s boyfriend is one of several that Scotland Yard is now investigating with the cooperation of Malm\u00f6 police. \u201cWe believe Flamur may possibly have been involved in some criminality in Sweden, and are in liaison with our Swedish counterparts to try to understand what, if any, incidents there may have been that might have led to someone seeking retribution against Flamur in the UK,\u201d Det Insp Jamie Stevenson said in London on Friday.

Workers and activists on the front lines of the crisis have repeatedly said that Trump\u2019s \u201ctough talk\u201d on homelessness is concerning, and that some of his proposed policies will only make the situation worse. As the number of homeless people has increased sharply in cities across California, some local politicians have already tried to penalize people for being homeless, rather than addressing root causes of the crisis, including unaffordable rents and evictions pushing people on to the streets.

Violent attacks directly targeting homeless people have risen in California in the past year: in Los Angeles alone, there have been at least eight incidents in which people threw makeshift explosives or flammable liquids on homeless people or their tents, according to officials and the Los Angeles Times. Trump\u2019s repeated tweets about homelessness have been labeled \u201cvile and reprehensible\u201d by activists. Diane Yentel, the president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), noted on Thursday that Trump had proposed drastically shrinking or eliminating federal programs that keep the lowest-income people affordably housed, an important prevention measure that keeps people from becoming homeless. \u201cIn California, over 37,000 of the lowest-income people are at risk of eviction from this Trump proposal alone,\u201d Yentel said. She also noted that Trump\u2019s Department of Housing and Urban Development had \u201cproposed allowing homeless shelters to discriminate and refuse shelter to transgender and other LGBTQ people, subjecting them to high risk of violence\u201d. Homelessness is continuing to rise across California: a year-end Guardian investigation found that homelessness had increased 16% in Los Angeles, 17% in San Francisco, 42% in San Jose, 47% in Oakland, and 52% in Sacramento county, home to the state\u2019s capital. Many people were experiencing homelessness for the first time, and both families and seniors are increasingly struggling with homelessness. Trump\u2019s focus on homelessness in California and elsewhere is not the first time he has suggested that he could \u201ceasily\u201d solve complex social problems in cities where Democrats hold political power. During his presidential campaign, Trump claimed that an unnamed Chicago police official had told him that violence in Chicago could be stopped \u201cin one week\u201d if officers were allowed to be \u201cvery much tougher than they are right now\u201d. Chicago typically has the highest total number of murders of any American city, though other smaller cities, including St Louis, have higher per capita murder rates.",

      "bodyText": "The former Tory leader Michael Howard has criticised the supreme court for ruling that Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament was \u201cunlawful\u201d and called for a reform of the judiciary. Judges in England and Wales have long been permitted to interpret law on a case-by-case basis, although they are bound by precedent, but Howard claimed that they sometimes \u201cdistort\u201d law to \u201creach the result they want to achieve\u201d. In comments which will be seen as part of growing calls for judicial reform within the Conservative party, Lord Howard of Lympne \u2013 a former barrister \u2013 alleged that judges have \u201cincreasingly substituted their own view of what is right for the view of parliament and of ministers\u201d. \u201cThe question is who should make the law by which we are ruled. Should it be made by elected accountable politicians answerable to their constituents and vulnerable to summary dismissal at elections,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in recent years is a very considerable increase in the power of the judiciary, partly as a result of the expansion of judicial review.\u201d He said judges were invited by parliament under the Human Rights Act to \u201center the political arena\u201d, including by considering whether \u201cmeasures that parliament had taken to deal with a particular problem were proportionate to the objectives they wanted to achieve\u201d. Howard added: \u201cSo, those two things have led to a significant increase in the power of the judges at the expense of parliament and indeed government \u2026 Sometimes in order to reach the result they want to achieve, they \u2026 distort the meaning of the act of parliament of which they are interpreting.\u201d He went on to question whether it should be elected politicians or unelected judges who make the law, saying the law states that parliamentary proceedings should not be impeached in any court. But he noted that the outgoing supreme court president Lady Hale had said that because prorogation was not a decision of parliament, it did not amount to a proceeding. \u201cProrogation was clearly, of any ordinary view of the language, a proceeding in parliament,\u201d he said. Asked if the supreme court\u2019s ruling was a political act, he replied: \u201cI think that judges have increasingly substituted their own view of what is right for the view of parliament and of ministers. \u201cThe excellent Policy Exchange paper to which I have written the foreword makes some sensible suggestions for redressing the balance.\u201d The paper by the thinktank which has long protected the identities of its donors was published on Saturday. It is entitled \u201cProtecting the Constitution\u201d, and calls for the reinstatement of limits on judicial power and the restoration of the political constitution. The Today programme show, guest edited by Charles Moore, the former Daily Telegraph editor, had asked whether judges were too powerful and sought \u201cto do things that should be left to politicians acting on behalf of the public\u201d. The government has refused to rule out changes to the way judges in the court are appointed after it announced plans in the Queen\u2019s Speech for a \u201cconstitution, democracy and rights commission\u201d. The move was seen by some at Westminster as an attempt by the prime minister to exact revenge after the court\u2019s ruling on prorogation. Johnson has previously hinted at US-style confirmation hearings for supreme court justices, suggesting they should be subject to \u201csome form of accountability\u201d. On Friday, Hale warned against any attempt by minsters to \u201cpoliticise\u201d the judiciary following a series of controversial rulings by the supreme court. \u201cWe have an independent, merit-based appointments system which most of us are extremely comfortable with,\u201d she told the Today programme. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be politicised, we don\u2019t decide political questions, we decide legal questions.

It won\u2019t work to set some alternative measurement with fake precision, we\u2019ll just end up arguing about that instead.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0784a98f08c39722641869\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-28T16:37:08.776Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lovely stuff from James Boyle: </strong>\u201cMaybe its been said before but just think where Liverpool would be if they had Danny Ings in their line up!\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0784068f08c39722641866\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-28T16:35:29.752Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Fabianski starts for West Ham!</strong> Lots of changes from Pellegrini.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WestHam/status/1210961103238250496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"pl\" dir=\"ltr\">Lukasz Fabianski returns to our starting line-up \ud83d\udc4a <a href=\"https://t.co/J876JnfOPA\">pic.twitter.com/J876JnfOPA</a></p>&mdash; West Ham United (@WestHam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WestHam/status/1210961103238250496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Nine changes for Leicester! </strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-28T16:36:35.145Z\">at 4.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e0783b78f085eda5c10ed5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-28T16:34:05.052Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Palace are looking tired at Southampton and have very little on the bench to bring on. </strong>Luckily, Guaita is still awake and he does superbly well to stop a fine shot from Djenepo.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0783288f08c39722641861\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-28T16:31:58.600Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GOAL!

Situations in football are also a lot more complex and difficult to decide; it\u2019s not the clear binary in or out. That said, a limit of two challenges is a good idea. (US football has something like it.) VAR as it is now is any case preposterous.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tom Quick on VAR: \u201c</strong>Salami-slicing the offside rule won\u2019t do anything to increase trust. The only thing to do is to have live mic justification to the whole stadium (like in cricket and rugby league).\u201d</p> <p><strong>Matt Dony on VAR: </strong>\u201cThe problem with Ian Croasedale\u2019s idea (or any other alternative way of measuring), is there will still be a point where a player is \u2018offside\u2019 by a millimetre or so. All you\u2019re doing is moving the point at which the pedantic controversy occurs. The law was written to prevent goal hanging, but it\u2019s essentially written in terms of absolutes. If it can be measured with the kind of accuracy VAR can achieve, then I guess it should be measured. It might not be perfect, but it\u2019s more consistent than leaving it up to a referee\u2019s assistant trying to look 30 yards along the line (trying to adjust mentally for foreshortening and perspective), while also judging the exact point a pass is played, and dealing with elite athletes sprinting at full pace.

As a through and through pedant I love it, and especially on offsides it is absolutely brilliant. Yes, the process needs to be faster, but if you\u2019re off, you\u2019re off. The main problem is that footballers have learned offside in the context of human perception. We\u2019re now in a position to say with 100% (or at least 99.9%) certainty if someone was off or not, and footballers - and I guess fans - will need to evolve to be mindful to truly be onside. <br></p> <p>\u201cSame for encroachment, although the rule itself needs to be changed to tackle situations like last night. It was not only wolves players encroaching and therefore I believe an attacking player who encroaches should supersede any encroachment of defenders and lead to an indirect free kick to the team defending the penalty. <br>It does need to be handled faster, but it\u2019s going to be learning curve for many people - players and fans alike - and take a year or two for people to adjust.

      "bodyText": "Anyway ... thanks for all the top notch VAR. Why not join Barry Glendenning for Norwich v Spurs! Louise Taylor was at St James\u2019 Park ... Here is the report from Vicarage Road. Dean Smith: \u201cI was angry at my my players. We didn\u2019t play well enough in the first half and we lost it in the first half.\u201d On the penalty: \u201cIt\u2019s shoulder to shoulder, Troy has gone down very easily. If that goes to VAR, it mistake. If the referee goes over to see a screen at the side of the pitch, he can go up and say \u2018sorry, I did a boo boo\u2019. \u201cThey looked more committed. We allowed them to switch the ball too quickly and never dealt with the one-v-one situation.\u201d Nigel Pearson is a managerial genius. He has really got Watford looking like a competent unit in a short space of time. I am sure even if he keeps them up, the board will still sack him. Ben Fisher was our man at St Mary\u2019s ... And we had a long old chat about VAR, which was lovely. I think the best idea is to put a time limit on decisions - say 30 seconds - and if you can\u2019t work it out, then it is not clear and obvious. What did we learn from today? Mainly that Aston Villa are ruddy awful. They look set for relegation the way it is going unless they make huge changes. Ten men are better than 11. Two wins in two for Carlo Ancelotti thanks to more Dominic Calvert-Lewin strikes. All even at St Mary\u2019s. Stephen Bazen joins the debate: \u201cI have not been following the whole debate, but on offsides VAR should function automatically in the same way as goal line judgements which are sent directly to the referee\u2019s watch. \u201cThis could be achieved by having a six-inch interval behind the last defender which would serve as reference. If the forward is beyond that point it is offside and it would be detected by machine not by a referee. \u201cThe game need only stop for a period when VAR investigates penalty appeals.\u201d McCarthy saves a Tomkins effort for a corner to kill the pressure on Southampton. It would have be quite a robbery if Palace managed to win this. VAR VAR VAR. How do you like it? Ward-Prowse whips in a free-kick from the left. The set-piece specialist hits it superbly and it is heading for the back of the net until Guaita sticks out an arm to stop it. A cracking save from a man having a great game. Aston Villa have been quite poor today. How will they change things in January? They need to spend, especially on a striker. I think it is constantly under review: Richard McGahey offers his solution: \u201cSet a time limit for VAR review, something like 30 seconds, for offside. If skilled referees can\u2019t spot it in that time it by definition is not clear and obvious. To make this work, have the AR flag when they think they see it. Refs used to be instructed that close calls on offside should be decided in favour of the attacker, and a 30 second rule would preserve that useful instruction. It won\u2019t work to set some alternative measurement with fake precision, we\u2019ll just end up arguing about that instead.\u201d Lovely stuff from James Boyle: \u201cMaybe its been said before but just think where Liverpool would be if they had Danny Ings in their line up!\u201d Fabianski starts for West Ham! Lots of changes from Pellegrini. Nine changes for Leicester! Palace are looking tired at Southampton and have very little on the bench to bring on. Luckily, Guaita is still awake and he does superbly well to stop a fine shot from Djenepo. Dreadful stuff from Palace defender Kelly who sends a woeful pass into the path of Ings, allowing the striker to run through on goal and slip the ball beyond Guaita. The Hornets break on Villa, Deeney slips it to Capoue whose cross finds Sarr to calmly convert. GAME OVER! Sorloth completes the scoring. He and Sturridge both bagged two in a 6-2 win. Good news for West Ham! Lukasz Fabianski has turned up for their game against Leicester. He could start. Anders Stephanson on VAR: \u201cThe tennis model is not bad, though don\u2019t forget that a valid claim in tennis (\u2018it was out\u2019 and indeed it was out) counts as no challenge. Situations in football are also a lot more complex and difficult to decide; it\u2019s not the clear binary in or out. That said, a limit of two challenges is a good idea. (US football has something like it.) VAR as it is now is any case preposterous.\u201d Tom Quick on VAR: \u201cSalami-slicing the offside rule won\u2019t do anything to increase trust. The only thing to do is to have live mic justification to the whole stadium (like in cricket and rugby league).\u201d Matt Dony on VAR: \u201cThe problem with Ian Croasedale\u2019s idea (or any other alternative way of measuring), is there will still be a point where a player is \u2018offside\u2019 by a millimetre or so. All you\u2019re doing is moving the point at which the pedantic controversy occurs. The law was written to prevent goal hanging, but it\u2019s essentially written in terms of absolutes. If it can be measured with the kind of accuracy VAR can achieve, then I guess it should be measured. It might not be perfect, but it\u2019s more consistent than leaving it up to a referee\u2019s assistant trying to look 30 yards along the line (trying to adjust mentally for foreshortening and perspective), while also judging the exact point a pass is played, and dealing with elite athletes sprinting at full pace. If there\u2019s a problem, then maybe law needs to be changed to better reflect the original spirit. Not the application of the law.\u201d Lots of controversy at Vicarage Road as Deeney goes down in the box under pressure from Douglas Luiz, while Watford play on despite Villa\u2019s Targett being down injured. Not that they needed to stop. The visitors are not happy but the decision is correct. Deeney smashes it down the middle. David Bertram emailed this a few minutes ago: \u201cPile money on 2-0 Watford.\u201d It\u2019s that man again! Great work down the right by Keane ends with Calvert-Lewin getting on the end of a cross and diverts the ball into the back of the net. Nigel Pearson has withdrawn sub Chalobah after just 15 minutes on the pitch as he needs to rejig following the sending off. Craig Dawson has come on and Pearson took the time to explain the decision to Chalobah. Eamonn Harrigan\u2019s VAR view: \u201cI\u2019m anti-VAR (as is) but not anti-tech. Goal-line technology is universally accepted. Other tech could also help, eg sensors in players boots to detect offside, goal-line-like tech to tell when the ball is out of play, stop-the-clock for subs. VAR may have a role in reviewing dangerous play but the current approach is soul-destroying in the grounds.\u201d And some more light-hearted VAR chat. Carroll the assister. Despite already being on a booking, Mariappa commits a cynical foul on Lansbury and is shown a second yellow and is dismissed. We\u2019re all level at St James\u2019 Park! Carroll gets on the end of a Willems cross, heading it down to Schar, who forces it home. Ricardo Quaresma has pulled one back for Kasimpasa at Istanbul Basaksehir to make the score 5-1 to the hosts. I didn\u2019t even know he was still playing. Crispin Leyser has a plan for less VAR: \u201cIt\u2019s used way too often. The simple solution is to make it like tennis. Managers get one (maybe two) challenges a game. That\u2019s it And video replays must be shown to crowd (also as in tennis).\u201d Carroll has been penalised for an outstretched arm. The defender did not suffer like Ben Mee but the striker really needs to be careful when challenging for the ball in the air. Tomkins has been superb at the back today but has made a real difference at the other end now. A clever free-kick ends up with Tomkins who diverts it into the net. Here we go again! Ian Croasdale is another man with an idea: \u201cJust make the lines drawn wider say 6 inches and if those lines overlap then the player is \u2018level\u2019 and onside.\u201d Simon Williams has acknowledged I have open the weekly can of worms: \u201cI like the points made here back in September. \u201cVAR is being used to over-rule marginal decisions, when in theory it should only lead to a decision being changed if a clear and obvious error has occurred. There\u2019s no margin in those freeze-frame offsides. In cricket, there\u2019s the Umpire\u2019s Call, when if it\u2019s less than 50% of the ball, so about 10cm wiggle room, then you go with the original decision. \u201cAt some point I guess that players &amp; coaches will adapt and make more conservative runs. And that means fewer goals, I can\u2019t see the EPL, Fifa etc being in favour of that in the long run.\u201d More VAR views: A second goal for Sturridge! David Bertram has accepted Villa\u2019s fate: \u201cI liked the Championship anyway... \u201cAny chance we can get Big Sam in as a defensive coordinator NFL style? And when the inevitable happens where does Grealish land?\u201d I feel he would go to Manchester United ... This is what happened in the early game ... It\u2019s just, ultimately, quite annoying. It\u2019s like an actor in a play stopping to make sure the stage direction was correct before delivering the crucial line. Simon Tregidgo is on the other side of the VAR fence: \u201cWant to even up the debate with a pro VAR voice. As a through and through pedant I love it, and especially on offsides it is absolutely brilliant. Yes, the process needs to be faster, but if you\u2019re off, you\u2019re off. The main problem is that footballers have learned offside in the context of human perception. We\u2019re now in a position to say with 100% (or at least 99.9%) certainty if someone was off or not, and footballers - and I guess fans - will need to evolve to be mindful to truly be onside. \u201cSame for encroachment, although the rule itself needs to be changed to tackle situations like last night. It was not only wolves players encroaching and therefore I believe an attacking player who encroaches should supersede any encroachment of defenders and lead to an indirect free kick to the team defending the penalty. It does need to be handled faster, but it\u2019s going to be learning curve for many people - players and fans alike - and take a year or two for people to adjust. But to us pedants, VAR is great.\u201d Premier League scores Newcastle 0-1 Everton Southampton 0-0 Crystal Palace Watford 1-0 Aston Villa Michael Borg joins in the VAR chat: \u201cThere is a very simple solution to the current VAR ridiculousness\u2026 the whole profile of the attacker\u2019s body must be beyond the defender for offside to be given; not just a millimeter of a toe or shoulder. This would be consistent with giving the attacker the advantage but still retain the utility of the system.\u201d Deeney makes up for missing an incredible chance moments before after he reacts first to a Heaton save from a Doucoure shot. The striker barely made contact with his effort but it still dribbles beyond the goalkeeper. Sturridge scores for Trabzonspor to make it 3-1! According to the stats, there has already been 15 attempts on goal. A pretty lively half. Newcastle just need someone to finish now. Our voluntary Scottish correspondent, Simon McMahon has been in touch again: \u201cDefenders still on holidays judging by the goals flying in around Scotland, Will. After half an hour it\u2019s Dunfermline 1-2 Alloa, Ayr 0-1 Queen of the South, Morton 1-1 Partick, East Fife 1-2 Raith, Airdrie 0-1 Falkirk, Cove Rangers 1-0 Elgin, Arbroath 36-0 Aberdeen Bon Accord. Ok, the last one was from a while ago, but still.\u201d David Singerman sends in what sounds like a maddening distraction: \u201cIn 2008 two sociologists of technology wrote a very funny article on Hawk-Eye in tennis and the misbegotten quest for perfection and precision in sports. \u201cTheir best example was a case at Wimbledon where Hawk Eye ruled a ball out by one millimeter. But the actual courts at actual Wimbledon are made of paint on blades of grass...so the lines themselves don\u2019t have a resolution of one millimeter. Anyway if anybody wants to look it up the article is (obviously) called \u201cYou cannot be serious!\u201d CHANCE! Bednarek is the man at the back post to gratefully receive a fine cross from Ward-Prowse but the centre-back gets a nose bleed and fluffs his lines with the goal gaping. Milivojevic is booked by the referee for a foul on Boufal. The Palace midfielder then has a strong word with the referee and is quite lucky to not get a second yellow for his protestations. Calm down everyone. I feel this blog could end up quite VARy. Justin Kavanagh emails in: \u201cI was all in favour of its introduction to give refs the same views that tv audiences worldwide had, but I think it\u2019s time to review the uses of VAR. The offside margins (and last night\u2019s encroachment) are just getting silly now. What happened to giving the attacking team the benefit of the doubt? Refs have stopped using their common sense to keep the game flowing and VAR is beginning to mean Very Annoying Redundancies in the minds of most football fans.\u201d STRIKER! NO GOAL! Willems gets down the left, dribbling with skill before cutting it back for Almiron who smashes a shot against the post and then Carroll taps in the rebound but the big striker is a mile off and the flag goes up. Wesley goes down in the box after a collision with Kabasele. The big striker goes down and VAR checks whether it is enough to give a penalty but there is a shake of the head from the video referee. Norrie Herron on VAR: \u201cI think the problem with VAR is that it was envisaged as helping with the more egregious stuff like diving and simulation, but has essentially become a technical measure for offside. \u201cFine for Roundheads who like the reassuring comfort of binaries, but less so for us Cavaliers who see the game through an artistic rather than scientific lens.\u201d SAVE! Foster is the hero for Watford, not for the first time this season, as he reacts to Wesley who was left unmarked in the box but his header is not good enough to get beyond the dependable goalkeeper. Sakho gets caught in his own penalty box while trying to do tricks but centre-back partner Tomkins gets him out of trouble. Dunfermline open the scoring in the 20th minute but then Adam Brown equalises for Alloa 60 seconds later. One to keep an eye on. David Bertram needs details: \u201cHow are villa looking? I\u2019m stuck at the airport on my way home so anxiously refreshing. Have Watford sussed out the kick/mark grealish out the game tactic and wait for someone in the back for to implode yet?\u201d Watford are on top and Grealish is not having the required impact required for Villa to have a good game. Deulofeu looks lively, as usual. VAR is just loads of fun! Trabzonspor have a 2-1 lead at half-time. I just own the mug to be honest. I do not support them. Carroll flicks the ball onto Joelinton, the Brazilian hits a tame shot towards Pickford. A least it\u2019s a sign of intent. Carroll is certainly looking dangerous in the air. NO GOAL! Meyer receives the ball from a cracking Zaha cross after cracking work by the winger and dispatches the ball into the back of the net. The German runs off to the celebrate but VAR rules Zaha\u2019s toe was offside. Sigurdsson hits a free-kick against the wall but ball eventually falls at the feet of Calvert-Lewin who is in the right place at the right time to calmly slot the ball beyond Dubravka. WHAT A SAVE! Everton get their opening chance of the match as Richarlison lays the ball back to Holgate whose shot is saved by Dubravka, who has plenty to make up for after his poor performance at Old Trafford. Everton are very much on top. Grealish is the key to Villa\u2019s survival and he will need to make the difference today. Additionally, Wesley has another chance to prove he is the man to score the goals to ensure safety, otherwise Villa might need to dip into the market next month. JJ has been in touch re 14:33 post: \u201cJust wondering, as a City fan did you look forward to the second half of the \u201817/18 season when your plucky team pipped man united to the title by a sneaky 19 points?Would also like to point of the only first team squad member we added this year was a substitute GK.\u201d It was not a criticism of Liverpool in any way, shape or form. Rather from the view of a neutral. Winning the league by such a massive margin was utterly tedious, I can confirm. Watford are also quick starters, as Deeney lays it back to Hughes whose strike is blocked. Deeney then heads a corner down to Kabasele but his effort is superbly saved by Heaton who sticks out a reactionary arm. Exciting starts for all. A big early chance for Newcastle. Joelinton sends Almiron through but the Paraguayan falls over at the crucial moment and pokes his shot wide. Istanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir are 4-0 up against Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa after just 28 minutes. Demba Ba has two of them! Simon McMahon rightly points out where the big football is today: \u201cAfternoon Will. It\u2019s all about the lower leagues in Scotland today, which is where, as we all know, the REAL football gets played. Runaway Scottish Championship leaders Dundee United played out a one all draw with struggling neighbours Dundee at Tannadice last night, which puts them fourteen points clear of second placed Inverness, who welcome Arbroath today. Todays other fixtures are Ayr v Queen of the South, Dunfermline v Alloa and Morton v Partick. In Scottish League One the top two meet as East Fife host Raith, and it\u2019s also third v fourth as Airdrie play Falkirk, with just one point between the four teams. In Scottish League Two the games to watch are Cove Rangers v Elgin and Edinburgh City v Cowdenbeath.\u201d Plenty happening in Scotland! Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The players are wandering out onto pitches across the country. Hopefully they and the fans are not suffering from fatigue. Hence the hi-viz. Good form. JR responds to me (14:27): \u201cHmmm, I am guessing you are sitting down then as you\u2019ve made it pretty clear that you do not love the darts. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing! Huybrechts just passed up a chance to try to close a leg with a bullseye and Humphries punished him by closing 146 with two 57s and a double 16. Wowsers.\u201d No beef with darts, just the idea of following two sports at once is too much for me. Christian Schmidt emails to say: \u201cIs this a wild attacking Everton line up or what? I don\u2019t see Davies as a 6, and the rest of the midfield are a 19, a winger and a forward...\u201d Ancelotti is looking to rip Newcastle apart with that lineup, that\u2019s for sure. Alexander Sorloth has scored for Trabzonspor against Kayserispor to put them in charge and remind Crystal Palace they have a striker who can regularly find the back of the net. Enzo Crivelli has made it 2-0 to Istanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir after six minutes, so that game is over. We will have to focus on Trabzonspor now. Demba Ba has scored for Istanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir v Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa. This afternoon is coming alive already. With the title race being completely and utterly over, what do we have to look forward to in the Premier League? The relegation battle and the fight for fourth? What a cracking second half of the campaign it will be. I am currently drinking coffee out of my Besiktas mug, you\u2019ll be pleased to know. JR offers some advice for me to ignore: \u201cTo pad out the blog what you should be doing is covering the darts as well. Absolute scenes at the Ally Pally where they\u2019ve just had to change the board in the Huybrechts v Humphries match because some of the threads of sisal were coming out.\u201d Let\u2019s not be silly, JR. Brighton have completed their win over Bournemouth, which is pretty ruddy exciting. Mooy superb throughout and rightly confirmed the result. Top, top footballers. To pad out this blog, I will offer updates from Trabzonspor v Kayserispor. The home team have Daniel Sturridge starting up top. Due to it being the Christmas period, I struggle to remember what day it is. It\u2019s actually quite reassuring that these games are taking place at 3pm on a Saturday. Southampton bring back Ings after resting him for the Chelsea match. Palace, on the other hand, are forced to start Riedewald again after his dreadful 45 minutes against Brighton. Palace also include Woods, Pierrick and Daly on the bench to make up numbers. Mooy, supposedly, makes it 2-0 to Brighton with another fine finish. He chests the ball down, moves it to the side and slots it home. The interesting team news from Newcastle is that both Longstaffs are dropped and Andy Carroll is starting up top. Ancelotti puts his faith in Moise Kean, too, which is an interesting one for all involved. Watford: Foster, Mariappa, Cathcart, Kabasele, Femenia, Doucoure, Capoue, Hughes, Sarr, Deeney, Deulofeu. Subs: Gomes, Dawson, Masina, Chalobah, Quina, Success, Gray. Aston Villa: Heaton, Elmohamady, Hause, Konsa, Targett, Lansbury, Hourihane, Luiz, Jota, Wesley, Grealish. Subs: Nyland, Chester, Guilbert, Nakamba, El Ghazi, Kodjia, Trezeguet. Newcastle: Dubravka, Yedlin, Willems, Schar, Lejeune, Fernandez, Hayden, Shelvey, Almiron, Joelinton, Carroll. Subs: Darlow, Gayle, Krafth, Manquillo, Atsu, S. Longstaff, M. Longstaff. Everton: Pickford, Baines, Sidibe, Keane, Holgate, Davies, Sigurdsson, Walcott, Richarlison, Kean, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Stekelenburg, Delph, Digne, Mina, Tosun, Bernard, Coleman. Southampton: McCarthy, Soares, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Boufal, Ward-Prowse, Hojbjerg, Redmond, Ings, Adams. Subs: Gunn, Yoshida, Vestergaard, Djenepo, Romeu, Armstrong, Smallbone. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Kelly, Tomkins, Sakho, Riedewald, McCarthy, Milivojevic, McArthur, Meyer, Ayew, Zaha. Subs: Hennessey, Kouyate, Wickham, Camarasa, Woods, Pierrick, Daly. Mikel Arteta is trying to make Arsenal less bad. Oh wait ... VAR rules it out due to the most marginal of offsides. What a complete waste of space this is. Dan Burn with a cracking finish to make it 2-0 to Brighton against Bournemouth, in case you were wondering. He controls it superbly after a touch of pinball in the box and then turned to whack it home. Look away now, Chesterfield fans. Playing every two days is really silly isn\u2019t it? These games are relatively underwhelming each year due to fatigue. I understand it\u2019s tradition and all that but surely there is a more logical way of doing it than having this hilariously short turnaround. To get you in the mood, here is Jonathan Liew on some incredible football last night. Good afternoon! The football never ever stops! Last night had something for everyone seeking festive entertainment; there was comedy in abundance, mild farce, drama and a bit of a love story chucked in too. Today, however, we might get something less exciting as everyone will be exhausted. We can expect a lot of changes to the sides who played on Boxing Day. There are only three matches at 3pm and the Football League have taken the frightfully logically decision to play their matches on Sunday. Newcastle will be looking to bounce back from a desperate day at Old Trafford when Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s Everton come to town, with the Italian aiming to find out even more about his new charges. Southampton host Crystal Palace who are both coming off very impressive results on Boxing Day. Saints downed Chelsea away and the Eagles came back to beat West Ham, including a fine goal from Jordan Ayew. Watford and Aston Villa are also in more acceptable form. Nigel Pearson has made a massive difference at Vicarage Road, while Villa downed Norwich in another relegation six-pointer on Thursday. It should be more relaxing than Boxing Day, at least!",

The attack ended when police shot and killed the assailant.</p> <p>In many cases, what triggered the perpetrator remains a mystery, the database shows.

On Saturday, the 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden renewed his calls for curbs on the military-style weapons, telling supporters in a funding email: \u201cThe American people may be running out of tears, but we cannot run out of strength and resolve to get something done.\u201d But Biden remains an exception to the leading Democratic candidates in refusing to support some form of federal gun licensing. With some variations in detail, all, including Biden, have called for imposing stricter background checks and a federal ban on assault-style weapons. But only the former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has made gun control central to his policy platform, calling for a national gun licensing system, stricter background checks, as well as federal laws allowing courts to confiscate firearms from people considered dangerous. Those efforts come after a troubled year for the country\u2019s most vociferous and powerful gun advocate, the National Rifle Association. Beset by executive infighting, the lobbying group faces a New York state investigation into claims that thousands of dollars were diverted to its board members. In terms of the number of fatalities, the 211 people killed in this year is still eclipsed by the 224 victims in 2017, when the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history took place at a concert in Las Vegas. California, with some of the strictest gun laws in the country, registered eight mass killings, the most in the country. Nearly half of US states experienced a mass killing. According to the database, most mass killings fail to make national news unless they spill into public spaces. The majority involve people who knew each other, family disputes, drug or gang violence or people with beefs that directed their anger at co-workers or relatives. According to the database, the first mass killing of the year occurred 19 days into the new year when a 42-year-old man took an ax and stabbed to death his mother, stepfather, girlfriend and 9-month-old daughter in Clackamas county, Oregon. The attack ended when police shot and killed the assailant. In many cases, what triggered the perpetrator remains a mystery, the database shows. The incident in Oregon was one of 18 mass killings where family members were killed, and one of six that didn\u2019t involve a gun. Other weapons included knives, axes and arson. Nine mass shootings occurred in public spaces; others were in homes, workplaces or bars. \u201cWhat makes this even more exceptional is that mass killings are going up at a time when general homicides, overall homicides, are going down,\u201d James Densley, a criminologist and professor at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota, told the Associated Press. \u201cThis seems to be the age of mass shootings,\u201d Densley said, expressing worry over a \u201ccontagion effect\u201d spreading mass killings. \u201cWhat fuels contagion is fear,\u201d explained James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern. \u201cThese are still rare events. Clearly the risk is low but the fear is high.\u201d The Associated Press contributed reporting",

There was an air of inevitability that Danny Ings would play a key part here given the Crystal Palace manager spent much of the buildup to this match highlighting the striker\u2019s predatory instincts inside the box. It was under Hodgson in Lithuania four years ago that the in-form Southampton striker won his sole England cap and here Ings, who turned his nose up at a move to Palace in favour of a return to his boyhood club last year, seized on a sloppy Martin Kelly pass to score his 12th goal of the season, cancelling out James Tomkins\u2019s headed opener to earn a revived Southampton a point. Ings\u2019s equaliser came just as things seemed to be getting away from them but in the end Palace, who had a first-half goal disallowed by VAR owing to a marginal offside decision, were grateful for a point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/28/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-report\">Brighton\u2019s Aaron Mooy produces cracker to finish off Bournemouth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Southampton substitute Moussa Djenepo assumed centre stage from Wilfried Zaha for the final half an hour and the winger would have snatched a winner but for a brilliant left-handed save by Vicente Guaita after Ings\u2019s goal had galvanised the hosts. \u201cThe fact is that is what he does,\u201d Hodgson said of Ings. \u201cHe is a goalscorer, he was alert to the misplaced back pass and then, of course, when he gets through to the goalkeeper you know he has the technique to score the goal. After the goal, they really took advantage of that Southampton. It gave them a lot of wind in their sails, they brought on fresh players to run at our defence and, to be honest, the last 15 minutes were a lot hairier than I\u2019d have liked them to be, and maybe they needed to be.\u201d</p> <p>Pantomime season is in full swing and Zaha relished the role of the villain but the opening stages were more slapstick than anything. Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg patrolled the Southampton midfield with his back bare for a minute or two after tussles with Zaha and Luka Milivojevic left his shirt in tatters, flapping like a cape before a replacement was located. Zaha is Palace\u2019s talisman and Southampton sought to stop him at source. When Djenepo entered, a panicking Palace backline were faced with a similar problem, with Guaita denying the winger before keeping out fine efforts by Ings and James Ward-Prowse, the latter from a free-kick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c68667910ecf2202464a91374543c475d28c862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c68667910ecf2202464a91374543c475d28c862/0_0_3400_2267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Tomkins heads in the opener.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Tomkins heads in the opener.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But poking and provoking Zaha supercharged Palace\u2019s protagonist.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThat was no surprise, was it?\u201d Roy Hodgson said, shrugging his shoulders ever so slightly. There was an air of inevitability that Danny Ings would play a key part here given the Crystal Palace manager spent much of the buildup to this match highlighting the striker\u2019s predatory instincts inside the box. It was under Hodgson in Lithuania four years ago that the in-form Southampton striker won his sole England cap and here Ings, who turned his nose up at a move to Palace in favour of a return to his boyhood club last year, seized on a sloppy Martin Kelly pass to score his 12th goal of the season, cancelling out James Tomkins\u2019s headed opener to earn a revived Southampton a point. Ings\u2019s equaliser came just as things seemed to be getting away from them but in the end Palace, who had a first-half goal disallowed by VAR owing to a marginal offside decision, were grateful for a point. The Southampton substitute Moussa Djenepo assumed centre stage from Wilfried Zaha for the final half an hour and the winger would have snatched a winner but for a brilliant left-handed save by Vicente Guaita after Ings\u2019s goal had galvanised the hosts. \u201cThe fact is that is what he does,\u201d Hodgson said of Ings. \u201cHe is a goalscorer, he was alert to the misplaced back pass and then, of course, when he gets through to the goalkeeper you know he has the technique to score the goal. After the goal, they really took advantage of that Southampton. It gave them a lot of wind in their sails, they brought on fresh players to run at our defence and, to be honest, the last 15 minutes were a lot hairier than I\u2019d have liked them to be, and maybe they needed to be.\u201d Pantomime season is in full swing and Zaha relished the role of the villain but the opening stages were more slapstick than anything. Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg patrolled the Southampton midfield with his back bare for a minute or two after tussles with Zaha and Luka Milivojevic left his shirt in tatters, flapping like a cape before a replacement was located. Zaha is Palace\u2019s talisman and Southampton sought to stop him at source. When Djenepo entered, a panicking Palace backline were faced with a similar problem, with Guaita denying the winger before keeping out fine efforts by Ings and James Ward-Prowse, the latter from a free-kick. But poking and provoking Zaha supercharged Palace\u2019s protagonist. Zaha fooled C\u00e9dric Soares at the byline, wringing the Southampton defender inside out before supplying a cross for Max Meyer to sweep home. Zaha roared at the Southampton support before joining the celebrations. They were short-lived, though, with Andy Madley indicating the video assistant referee was taking a closer look as Palace rejoiced on halfway. Replays showed it was a preposterously tight offside call by the VAR, Andre Marriner, and presumably one that had those at Stockley Park poring over every angle. Zaha\u2019s left armpit was adjudged to be millimetres beyond Jack Stephens\u2019s right armpit. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the VAR God on our side,\u201d Hodgson said. That disallowed goal galvanised Southampton but rankled Palace, though it was forgotten five minutes after half-time when Nathan Redmond upended James McArthur and Tomkins glanced Milivojevic\u2019s free-kick in off the crossbar. The deft delivery seemed to catch Southampton cold, as Tomkins breezed past a flat-footed Stephens to send a header beyond the former Palace goalkeeper, Alex McCarthy. Southampton had spurned chances, too, with Redmond cornering Mamadou Sakho before Jan Bednarek blazed over when left unmarked from a brilliant Ward-Prowse free-kick. Moments later Guaita spilled a Ward-Prowse corner and another mistake went unpunished but Palace were not quite so fortunate when Kelly gifted the ball to Ings 16 minutes from time. \u201cThe strange thing is that he is always the person in that situation,\u201d Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, the Southampton manager, said. \u201cIt means he feels and smells where the opponent can get problems or into trouble. I think it is the third or fourth time this season where in a pressing situation he is in the right spot, getting the ball and then scoring. It is not a coincidence.\u201d",

It \u201crepresents the most cost-effective and fair means of ensuring temporary migrants make a financial contribution to the operation of the service\u201d, the government says.</p> <p>The fees raised about \u00a3200m a year when they were introduced in 2015, though initially costing \u00a3200 a head. Doubling that to \u00a3400 last December was due to bring in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/increase-to-immigration-health-surcharge-gives-nhs-extra-funding\" title=\"\">a further \u00a3220m a year</a>, the Home Office said. Ministers argue that raising it again to \u00a3625 next year is justified as it costs the NHS on average \u00a3470 a year to treat a surcharge payer who needs care.</p> <p>Critics say it is unfair and wrong to charge overseas-born health professionals for using a service which they help to fund by paying income tax and national insurance.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the new government says it wants to make it easier for international staff to come to work in the health service, they are doing the exact opposite by charging them to use the very service they are contributing their skills to,\u201d said Chaand Nagpaul, who chairs the British Medical Association, which represents doctors.</p> <p>The rise to \u00a3625 \u201cis sending the completely wrong message to talented staff from around the world, who the NHS vitally depends on, and who could as a result be dissuaded from coming here,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cIt cannot be acceptable that nurses that come from overseas to work in the NHS face these charges whether they access NHS services or not. This charge goes against efforts to hire professionals. A new nurse from overseas with two children would have to work for 116 hours just to pay off the charge \u2013 hardly an incentive for coming to work in our NHS.\u201d</p> <p>The government welcomed the \u201cvital contributions which doctors, nurses and other health or care professionals make to the NHS\u201d, a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are delivering on the people\u2019s priorities by increasing the immigration health surcharge for those coming to live in the UK and will be setting out detailed plans shortly.

Boris Johnson has come under fire for deciding to increase the immigration health surcharge for migrants from outside the European Economic Area and to extend it to EU staff for the first time after Brexit, despite acknowledging that the NHS will need to recruit even more personnel from around the world if he is to deliver his key election pledges of 50,000 more nurses and 6,000 extra GPs by 2024. Richard Murray, the chief executive of the King\u2019s Fund, fears the move may exacerbate staff shortages that are causing widespread problems for the overstretched NHS. The charge should also be lifted for people coming to work in social care, he said. \u201cTreating hard-working healthcare staff as a burden on the very services they provide is perverse. It sends out the wrong message and could discourage recruitment at a time when we should be warmly welcoming every healthcare professional who wants to work here,\u201d Murray said. \u201cRemoving the surcharge for health and social care staff would support the government\u2019s own targets for the health services and support struggling social care.\u201d The NHS in England is already struggling with about 100,000 vacancies, according to the most recent official figures. In a vivid illustration of the problem, the Royal Stoke hospital admitted last week it had not been able to open 102 extra beds as planned on 1 December to help it cope with the winter surge in demand because it did not have enough staff. Foreign health workers coming to the UK for at least six months, but not permanently, are required to pay the surcharge upfront for themselves and each family member on top of the \u00a3464 cost of a visa. It \u201crepresents the most cost-effective and fair means of ensuring temporary migrants make a financial contribution to the operation of the service\u201d, the government says. The fees raised about \u00a3200m a year when they were introduced in 2015, though initially costing \u00a3200 a head. Doubling that to \u00a3400 last December was due to bring in a further \u00a3220m a year, the Home Office said. Ministers argue that raising it again to \u00a3625 next year is justified as it costs the NHS on average \u00a3470 a year to treat a surcharge payer who needs care. Critics say it is unfair and wrong to charge overseas-born health professionals for using a service which they help to fund by paying income tax and national insurance. \u201cWhile the new government says it wants to make it easier for international staff to come to work in the health service, they are doing the exact opposite by charging them to use the very service they are contributing their skills to,\u201d said Chaand Nagpaul, who chairs the British Medical Association, which represents doctors. The rise to \u00a3625 \u201cis sending the completely wrong message to talented staff from around the world, who the NHS vitally depends on, and who could as a result be dissuaded from coming here,\u201d he added. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cIt cannot be acceptable that nurses that come from overseas to work in the NHS face these charges whether they access NHS services or not. This charge goes against efforts to hire professionals. A new nurse from overseas with two children would have to work for 116 hours just to pay off the charge \u2013 hardly an incentive for coming to work in our NHS.\u201d The government welcomed the \u201cvital contributions which doctors, nurses and other health or care professionals make to the NHS\u201d, a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are delivering on the people\u2019s priorities by increasing the immigration health surcharge for those coming to live in the UK and will be setting out detailed plans shortly. The vast majority of income collected by the Immigration Health Surcharge goes back into frontline services across the UK.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When the history of our time comes to be written, one of the things that will puzzle historians (assuming any have survived the climate cataclysm) is why we allowed ourselves to sleepwalk into dystopia. Ever since 9/11, it\u2019s been clear that western democracies had embarked on a programme of comprehensive monitoring of their citizenry, usually with erratic and inadequate democratic oversight. But we only began to get a fuller picture of the extent of this surveillance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\" title=\"\">when Edward Snowden broke cover in the summer of 2013</a>.</p> <p>For a time, the dramatic nature of the Snowden revelations focused public attention on the surveillance activities of the state. In consequence, we stopped thinking about what was going on in the private sector. The various scandals of 2016, and the role that network technology played in the political upheavals of that year, constituted a faint alarm call about what was happening, but in general our peaceful slumbers resumed: we went back to our smartphones and the tech giants continued their appropriation, exploitation and abuse of our personal data without hindrance. And this continued even though a host of academic studies and a powerful book by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy\" title=\"\">Shoshana Zuboff</a> showed that, as the cybersecurity guru <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/17/sold-our-souls-and-more-to-internet-giants-privacy-surveillance-bruce-schneier\" title=\"\">Bruce Schneier put it, \u201cthe business model of the internet</a> is surveillance\u201d.</p> <p>The mystery is why so many of us are still apparently relaxed about what\u2019s going on. There was a time when most people had no idea what was happening to their privacy. But those days are gone. We now have abundant evidence of public concern about privacy. A recent Pew survey, for example, found that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/\" title=\"\">roughly six in 10 Americans believe it\u2019s not possible</a> to go through daily life without having their data collected by both the tech industry and the government, and say that they have no idea about what is done with that data by either party. About 80% believe they have little or no control over the data collected by tech companies and that the potential risks of that data collection outweigh the benefits. Yet they continue to use the services provided by corporations of which they are apparently so suspicious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/05/privacy-paradox-why-do-people-keep-using-tech-firms-data-facebook-scandal\">The privacy paradox: why do people keep using tech firms that abuse their data? | John Naughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/05/privacy-paradox-why-do-people-keep-using-tech-firms-data-facebook-scandal\" title=\"\">This is the so-called \u201cprivacy paradox\u201d</a>, and the question is, what is needed to trigger an appropriate shift in regulation and public behaviour.

      "bodyText": "When the history of our time comes to be written, one of the things that will puzzle historians (assuming any have survived the climate cataclysm) is why we allowed ourselves to sleepwalk into dystopia. Ever since 9/11, it\u2019s been clear that western democracies had embarked on a programme of comprehensive monitoring of their citizenry, usually with erratic and inadequate democratic oversight. But we only began to get a fuller picture of the extent of this surveillance when Edward Snowden broke cover in the summer of 2013. For a time, the dramatic nature of the Snowden revelations focused public attention on the surveillance activities of the state. In consequence, we stopped thinking about what was going on in the private sector. The various scandals of 2016, and the role that network technology played in the political upheavals of that year, constituted a faint alarm call about what was happening, but in general our peaceful slumbers resumed: we went back to our smartphones and the tech giants continued their appropriation, exploitation and abuse of our personal data without hindrance. And this continued even though a host of academic studies and a powerful book by Shoshana Zuboff showed that, as the cybersecurity guru Bruce Schneier put it, \u201cthe business model of the internet is surveillance\u201d. The mystery is why so many of us are still apparently relaxed about what\u2019s going on. There was a time when most people had no idea what was happening to their privacy. But those days are gone. We now have abundant evidence of public concern about privacy. A recent Pew survey, for example, found that roughly six in 10 Americans believe it\u2019s not possible to go through daily life without having their data collected by both the tech industry and the government, and say that they have no idea about what is done with that data by either party. About 80% believe they have little or no control over the data collected by tech companies and that the potential risks of that data collection outweigh the benefits. Yet they continue to use the services provided by corporations of which they are apparently so suspicious. This is the so-called \u201cprivacy paradox\u201d, and the question is, what is needed to trigger an appropriate shift in regulation and public behaviour. What would it take for governments to take coherent, effective measures to stop the ruthless exploitation of personal data by surveillance capitalists? What would it take for ordinary users to decide to use services with less unscrupulous and opaque business models? What would transform this from a scandal to a crisis that would lead to systemic change? Earlier this month, in an extraordinary feat of reporting and analysis, the New York Times published an investigation into the smartphone tracking industry that should make it harder for anyone to close their eyes to what\u2019s going on. Every minute of every day, everywhere on the planet, dozens of largely unregulated and unknown companies log, with mobile phones, the movements of tens of millions of people and store the information in gigantic data files. The New York Times obtained one of these megafiles \u2013 which it says is \u201cby far the largest and most sensitive ever to be reviewed by journalists\u201d. It holds more than 50bn location \u201cpings\u201d from the phones of more than 12 million Americans as they moved through several major cities, including Washington, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Each piece of data in this gargantuan file represents the precise location of a single smartphone over a period of several months in 2016 and 2017.

Instead we got Peter Kosminsky\u2019s glittering psychological portrait of Thomas Cromwell, who in Mark Rylance\u2019s hands became a figure as shadowy and representative of then and now as Don Draper. Like all the greatest period dramas of the decade, from The Crimson Petal and the White to Parade\u2019s End, A Very English Scandal to The Crown, darkness was the mode, tone and, in Wolf Hall\u2019s case because it was lit like a Rembrandt painting palette. It turns out the past wasn\u2019t a foreign country after all. It was here, and now.",

When I lived in America, you were sleeping on the couch of the barman I worked with and, I hate to report, I am not sure you were the politest of house guests. We saw you in Baton Rouge with a lot of people screaming \u201cfaggot\u201d and you taunted them by flaunting your enviable curves, as the Daily Mail might say.</p> <p>Anyway, now it is 2019 and you are, amazingly, still here.

Then I wonder about the Barbican, as it\u2019s all so proper. Perhaps you, Mr Pop, will do some poetry and we will clap politely and act like grownups for once.</p> <p>Then there you are. Your face like carved amber. The limp, the scoliosis, always smaller than your huge, striding attitude. The voice, deeper, darker than ever. Yes, it is a little jazzy. Then there is some Stooges and then you mention Bowie and I remember the story of how you wrote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNC1AbhWoAI\" title=\"\">Nightclubbing</a> in 20 minutes, and he wanted a proper drummer and you wanted a cheap drum machine. And we are back in a club in Kreuzberg, and you are everywhere on stage. I think of loss.</p> <p>As you leap and pose, who knows if it\u2019s sex or tai chi or swimming that keeps you this way? All I know is I\u2019ve never seen anyone who loves his audience the way you do and we love you back. You have transformed all that rage into something like prayer.

Of course. But to you \u2026 well, thank you for kicking against the pricks. For knowing about death but showing us how to be the most alive a person can be. Thank you for showing up. Always.

      "bodyText": "The aftershocks of the Thomas Cook liquidation are still being felt some three months after its seismic collapse, if only because the 178-year-old company practically invented modern tourism. Train trips organised for temperance campaigners by the company\u2019s namesake founder in the 19th century were the precursor to the package holiday that shaped the leisure time of the 20th. Such rich history is one reason why the firm\u2019s spectacular implosion met with such genuine sadness, even from competitors. But the reality of business leaves little room for sentiment, and mourning soon gave way to opportunism. German arch-rival Tui pounced swiftly, adding 2 million extra seats on flights for summer 2020 and, at short notice, 580,000 for short- and long-haul journeys over this winter. Looking even further ahead, to 2021, it boasts that customers will be able to choose from hundreds of hotels, \u201cincluding Thomas Cook favourites recently added\u201d. Shares in Tui had begun climbing in the summer even as Thomas Cook was fighting for its survival, as traders bet that it would move into the space likely to be vacated by its rival. The FTSE 100 is nearly unchanged since that date in late September, yet Tui\u2019s stock is now 16% higher. The disappearance of one\u2019s only significant competitor can do that. No-frills carriers have also benefited from the demise of Thomas Cook\u2019s airline, stepping in to help sunseekers make it to holidays from the Med to Miami, and boosting revenues in the process. Jet2 and easyJet both grabbed some of the group\u2019s coveted landing slots from the Official Receiver, the government employee trying to recoup funds from the liquidation. Jet2 snapped up berths at Manchester, Birmingham and Stansted for an undisclosed amount. EasyJet shelled out \u00a336m for slots at Gatwick and Bristol, adding 70,000 seats a year to destinations in Turkey and Tunisia. In the first few weeks after Thomas Cook Airlines\u2019 disappearance, flight prices jumped as rivals capitalised on demand for seats now in short supply. But according to price comparison site Skyscanner, the effect has been only temporary. \u201cWe typically see prices increase for key routes when an airline ceases trading, before reverting back again soon after,\u201d said the website\u2019s Sam Ayles. \u201cHappily, there\u2019s good news for travellers, as this seems to be the case on former Thomas Cook routes,\u201d she added, pointing to prices for destinations such as Alicante, Orlando and Palma, which rose sharply before returning to normal.

Sheldon said: \u201cAs predicted, Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse primarily hurts customers flying from Manchester, where they provided much-needed competition to a fairly large variety of destinations, often being the sole carrier flying direct to certain destinations.\u201d But what of Hays Travel, the private travel agency from Sunderland that took on Thomas Cook\u2019s network of 553 high street outlets in October? The prevailing wisdom in some corners was that the bricks-and-mortar model was an anachronism and that this was at the heart of Thomas Cook\u2019s failure. Not so, said John and Irene Hays, the shrewd husband-and-wife team who run Hays Travel. \u201cAll of the behaviour that we initially saw in terms of the public being supportive of us opening the shops has continued,\u201d said Irene. \u201cBearing in mind the time of year and that not all shops have been fully staffed, we have had a very good November and early December.\u201d The Hayses have always insisted that package holidays have a bright future.

It\u2019s an outcome that would ensure that, though Thomas Cook has departed, its package holiday soul lives on. \u2018The storm hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as feared\u2019 When Thomas Cook collapsed three months ago, reactions in the Canary Islands varied from the bleak to the apocalyptic. One local hotel worker described the news as \u201ca bit of a bombshell\u201d while a Tenerife MP said the company\u2019s demise had triggered \u201cone of the biggest economic crises that the Canaries have faced\u201d. Given that tourism accounts for more than 35% of the region\u2019s GDP and that \u2013 until September at least \u2013 a quarter of all the tourists who came to the islands did so with the British travel giant, their fears seemed painfully justified.

The government has approved \u20ac800m (\u00a3680m) of financial assistance to help the sector weather the storm as well as handing out subsidies of \u20ac15m to the Canaries and \u20ac8m to the Balearics. Jorge Marichal, president of the Spanish hoteliers\u2019 confederation (Cehat), said the acting Spanish government had done what it could given the political circumstances. Marichal said the German government\u2019s \u20ac380m loan to support the Thomas Cook subsidiary Condor had been very important, as had the purchase of the company\u2019s Nordic business by a trio of buyers at the end of October. \u201cBoth of those things really helped people breathe a sigh of relief \u2013 especially in the Canaries where people were worried that they\u2019d have to do without the important northern European customers this winter season,\u201d he added.

After South Africa were finally bowled out for 272 on a pitch that is supposed to be deteriorating, England were set 376 to win.</p> \n<p>\u201cSurely not possible\u201d mumbled the sages and statisticians. England have a team ravaged by the most obstinate of bugs; they have been scrappy in the field, where some of their strategies have been strange on a surface where any self-respecting pace bowler fancies his chances. They were required to pursue the highest score of the match here, where it was rumoured the South Africa hierarchy was beaming when Joe Root chose to bowl on the first morning.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/dec/28/south-africa-v-england-first-test-day-three-live\">South Africa set England 376 to win: first Test, day three \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet the dreams were still flickering thanks to a gem of an innings from Rory Burns, who was unbeaten on 77 at the close. He had some luck, which is probably essential for any surviving batsman here. He was dropped at first slip, on 20, by Rassie van der Dussen and there were a few close calls. But in between he timed the ball exquisitely, especially through his favoured leg-side against the paciest of the South Africans. He is starting to fit at the top of the order.</p> \n<p>Burns was given doughty support from Dominic Sibley, whose 29 was his highest score in Test cricket. He was gutsy and ungainly, except when clipping the ball away on the leg-side, while keeping Burns company for 28 overs. His dismissal was tame as he became the first to succumb to a spin bowler in the match, plopping a short ball from Keshav Maharaj straight back to the bowler. Still, England ended on 121 for one. Only another 255 required.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s highest opening partnership for three years, 92, allowed the travelling faithful to dream. But are two cricketing miracles really possible within six months? After South Africa were finally bowled out for 272 on a pitch that is supposed to be deteriorating, England were set 376 to win. \u201cSurely not possible\u201d mumbled the sages and statisticians. England have a team ravaged by the most obstinate of bugs; they have been scrappy in the field, where some of their strategies have been strange on a surface where any self-respecting pace bowler fancies his chances. They were required to pursue the highest score of the match here, where it was rumoured the South Africa hierarchy was beaming when Joe Root chose to bowl on the first morning. Yet the dreams were still flickering thanks to a gem of an innings from Rory Burns, who was unbeaten on 77 at the close. He had some luck, which is probably essential for any surviving batsman here. He was dropped at first slip, on 20, by Rassie van der Dussen and there were a few close calls. But in between he timed the ball exquisitely, especially through his favoured leg-side against the paciest of the South Africans. He is starting to fit at the top of the order. Burns was given doughty support from Dominic Sibley, whose 29 was his highest score in Test cricket. He was gutsy and ungainly, except when clipping the ball away on the leg-side, while keeping Burns company for 28 overs. His dismissal was tame as he became the first to succumb to a spin bowler in the match, plopping a short ball from Keshav Maharaj straight back to the bowler. Still, England ended on 121 for one. Only another 255 required. There is still hope \u2013 which is remarkable given how the tourists began the day. It was hard to imagine how they could have started more shambolically, though it was not entirely their fault. Jos Buttler became the 10th player in the party to be laid low on this tour.

By way of context, Bairstow could perhaps claim that he was denied a regular slot in the Test and one-day teams for far too long due to the extended retention of favoured sons. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right of course, and I would rather he went away for a bit and worked on his red ball batting. But Buttler keeping in Tests!! Bad enough that he inexplicably gets the gig in the one day team, but surely Foakes must get the call for red ball. If there is anyone who should just focus on his batting it is surely Jos.\u201d</p> <p>I agree that Buttler has probably had too many chances, but his average is higher than Bairstow\u2019s in the last few years. And Foakes has the highest average of any England batsman bar Joe Root in the last three years. I thought he was appallingly treated. Not sure I agree with that point about Bairstow being denied chances because of the retention of others.

I feel sorry for the chap: he\u2019s always being dumped for Buttler who seems to still be getting picked on potential rather than results - a bit like a steady and reliable boy-next-door who keeps on getting dumped and passed over for the flash bad boy who owns their own Vauxhall Nova.\u201d</p> <p>His first-class average for Yorkshire is spectacular, though I think most of those runs were scored before his recall during the 2015 Ashes.

This feels like 350 lead and all out for a miserable 160.\u201d It does a bit. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e0719b18f087e8308e65196\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-28T09:04:22.894Z\">9.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 133-4 (Van der Dussen 46, Nortje 30)</strong> Broad finds Van der Dussen\u2019s edge this time but the ball just fails to carry to a diving Ben Stokes at third slip.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with Vic Marks\u2019 match report from Centurion. Please join us in the morning for what should be England\u2019s final day of cricket in 2019. It\u2019s been such a crazy year that a tied Test would be the only sensible result. You have Super Overs in Test cricket, right? Here\u2019s Graham Thorpe, England\u2019s batting coach \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been a straightforward Test match. We\u2019ve had players coming and going with illness. We were pleased to show character and get through to the close tonight. We\u2019d have taken this position if you\u2019d offered it to us this morning. \u201cWe let ourselves down with our batting in the first innings. We\u2019ve got to keep learning and working out what shots we can play depending on the surface. But you can\u2019t peck away at players too much during a game. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a chance tomorrow if we play well. If we have a good first session they will look at the scoreboard [and remember their famous defeat to Sri Lanka earlier in the year]. We know there\u2019s a long way to go. \u201cIt would have been a struggle for Joe [Root] and Jos to bat today but we hope they will feel a bit better tomorrow.\u201d Joe Denly applauds Rory Burns off the field. They are two admirable characters, so resourceful and courageous. Burns played expertly for his 77 not out, and was ruthless at putting away the bad balls. With every match, he looks more like England\u2019s next Test captain. 41st over: England 121-1 (Burns 77, Denly 10) So nearly a wicket in the last over of the day! Burns edged Maharaj this far short of Elgar, plunging to his left at first slip. Burns survives and will resume tomorrow needing 23 more for a third Test century. More importantly, England need 255 more runs for a miraculous victory. It\u2019s a slim chance, but that\u2019s more than they had this morning. 40th over: England 118-1 (Burns 74, Denly 10) Denly gets his first boundary, guiding a loose ball from Pretorius through backward point. I still think it\u2019s too early to get excited about a possible England win, but they have batted splendidly tonight. 39th over: England 114-1 (Burns 74, Denly 6) Maharaj has switched ends, in fact, to replace Philander. Burns sees him off. There should be time for two more overs. Meanwhile, well done everyone. 38th over: England 112-1 (Burns 72, Denly 6) Pretorius replaces Maharaj, who bowled a crafty spell of 8-3-11-1. England look like they have shut up shop for the night, Denly in particular, and there is just one run from the over. 37th over: England 111-1 (Burns 71, Denly 6) A clever move from South Africa. The keeper de Kock moves up to the stumps, which means Denly has to go back into his crease to face Philander. He is beaten by the first ball under the new terms of battle before working a couple off the pads. England are 265 runs away from a bizarre and brilliant victory. 36th over: England 109-1 (Burns 71, Denly 4) A long hop from Maharaj is pulled vigorously for four by Burns. Maharaj responds with two good deliveries that beat the bat and hit Burns on the body. Good contest, this. 35th over: England 105-1 (Burns 67, Denly 4) Joe Denly has started watchfully, as is his wont, and has four for 21 balls at the end of that Philander over. \u201cForget Root,\u201d says Sam Cooper. \u201cForget Stokes. Forget Buttler. Is Burns the most important England batsman? Seems whenever he starts well the team does well behind him.\u201d I know what you mean, though I wouldn\u2019t quite go that far. But he\u2019s been a very good advert for having a half-decent opener in the team. 34th over: England 102-1 (Burns 66, Denly 2) Maharaj is causing plenty of problems. Burns, out of his crease, misses an attempted work to leg and is grateful that the ball deflects off his pad and wide of de Kock. England have another 26 minutes to survive. 33rd over: England 101-1 (Burns 65, Denly 2) Philander seams another glorious delivery past Burns\u2019 outside edge. His accuracy is almost comical. 32nd over: England 100-1 (Burns 64, Denly 2) A maiden from Maharaj to Denly. It looks like Ben Stokes is the next man in, with Joe Root unwell, though I\u2019d imagine England will use a nightwatchman if a wicket falls in the last 15-20 minutes of the day\u2019s play. 31st over: England 100-1 (Burns 64, Denly 2) Philander returns to the attack and has an optimistic LBW appeal against Denly turned down off his first ball. Far too high. Denly is batting outside his crease to Philander, as he did in the first innings, and works a single to bring up the England hundred. 30th over: England 99-1 (Burns 64, Denly 1) Maharaj gets one to rip sharply at Burns, who inside-edges it onto the body. The mood has changed since the wicket of Sibley, and England could lose one or two more in the 40 minutes before the close. 29th over: England 98-1 (Burns 64, Denly 0) Four more to Burns, nailed through the covers off Rabada. He is playing quite superbly. 28th over: England 92-1 (Burns 58, Denly 0) Sibley swished his bat in disgust when he was dismissed. It was a nothing shot to a poor ball. But he played well, making 29 from 90 balls, and should feel more comfortable in Test cricket than he did three hours ago. Ach, Sibley has fallen to the left-arm spinner. He pushed a short delivery straight back at Maharaj, who took the return catch with glee. I don\u2019t know whether that stopped in the pitch because it looked a very harmless delivery. 27th over: England 91-0 (Burns 57, Sibley 29) Sibley, who is playing confidently now, forces Rabada behind square on the off side for four. This has been an admirable performance from a young man trying to forge a Test career. Here\u2019s John Beaven. \u201cAs Bertie said, \u2018Jeeves, of course, is a gentleman\u2019s gentleman, not a butler, but if the call comes, he can buttle with the best of them.\u2019\u201d 26th over: England 86-0 (Burns 56, Sibley 25) Sibley flicks Maharaj through midwicket for four. He had trouble with Mitchell Santner in New Zealand, which is probably why Maharaj has been brought on. The decision almost pays off for South Africa when Sibley, defending on the front foot, inside-edges the ball into his balls. That could have gone anywhere. 25th over: England 82-0 (Burns 56, Sibley 21) Rabada walks away in disgust at his misfortune after beating Burns with another fine lifter. 24th over: England 80-0 (Burns 54, Sibley 21) There\u2019s a hint of turn for Maharaj, who bowls another accurate maiden to the happily becalmed Sibley. \u201cThere is a common misconception, which the link to fish being brain food shared, that Jeeves was a butler,\u201d says Peter Dymoke. \u201cHe was a valet or gentleman\u2019s personal gentleman. The two are quite different. Yours pedantically.\u201d 23rd over: England 80-0 (Burns 54, Sibley 21) There\u2019s an hour and ten minutes of play remaining. Burns forces Rabada through backward point for four to reach an extremely good half-century from only 62 balls. He\u2019s such a smart, resourceful batsman. He adds four more with a confident extra-cover drive before Rabada produces a beauty to beat the outside edge. Since the start of the Ashes - when he was probably one bad game away from being dropped - Burns averages 46 in Tests. And most of those runs have come against brilliant attacks on lively pitches. 22nd over: England 72-0 (Burns 46, Sibley 21) The left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj comes into the attack and starts with a maiden to Sibley. That\u2019s drinks. \u201cAs you rightly say, we\u2019re not in the dressing room, so everything is based on (mediated) impressions,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cJust between us, I am guessing that Bairstow might have felt somewhat aggrieved by the immediate media clamour for Foakes to be awarded the gloves in perpetuity after just one game (after anklegate). By way of context, Bairstow could perhaps claim that he was denied a regular slot in the Test and one-day teams for far too long due to the extended retention of favoured sons. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right of course, and I would rather he went away for a bit and worked on his red ball batting. But Buttler keeping in Tests!! Bad enough that he inexplicably gets the gig in the one day team, but surely Foakes must get the call for red ball. If there is anyone who should just focus on his batting it is surely Jos.\u201d I agree that Buttler has probably had too many chances, but his average is higher than Bairstow\u2019s in the last few years. And Foakes has the highest average of any England batsman bar Joe Root in the last three years. I thought he was appallingly treated. Not sure I agree with that point about Bairstow being denied chances because of the retention of others. It\u2019s an interesting debate, and I suppose the one thing we can agree on is that none of it is helpful. Anyway, enough for today! I need to watch some cricket rather than talk about it. 21st over: England 72-0 (Burns 46, Sibley 21) If England win this, thanks to an unbeaten 145 from Jonny Bairstow, I am going to look an appreciable plonker. I still think South Africa will win comfortably - they have another 305 runs to play with - but it\u2019s been an uplifting display of determination and commonsense from Burns and Sibley. Out of nothing, Rabada produces a vicious lifter that hits Burns on the glove and loops to safety on the off side. That must have hit a crack. 20th over: England 68-0 (Burns 42, Sibley 21) South Africa have started bowling where Sibley wants. He times Pretorius sweetly through midwicket for four more. Having made six from his first 40 balls, Sibley has scored 15 from the last 26. Textbook stuff. \u201cI\u2019m sure I read a tweet lately that demonstrated that Bairstow had a ludicrously good first class record in county cricket since making his first class debut and, arguably, earns his opportunity through repeatedly going back to the shires and delivering the goods to a greater extent than other English-qualified batsmen,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cHe seems to me like a team man who will do anything he can to tenaciously cling onto his place in the team and deliver: he\u2019ll bat wherever he\u2019s asked to (although he brings the same technique and style) and has delivered in the past. I feel sorry for the chap: he\u2019s always being dumped for Buttler who seems to still be getting picked on potential rather than results - a bit like a steady and reliable boy-next-door who keeps on getting dumped and passed over for the flash bad boy who owns their own Vauxhall Nova.\u201d His first-class average for Yorkshire is spectacular, though I think most of those runs were scored before his recall during the 2015 Ashes. I still think he is potentially England\u2019s second or third best batsman, but his Test game has changed since his ODI success and you can\u2019t keep picking someone who averages 28 over a three-year period. As for the comparison with Buttler, I don\u2019t recognise your Bairstow at all. It\u2019s fascinating that you and Brian Withington have completely the opposite view of him, and I\u2019m right. 19th over: England 63-0 (Burns 42, Sibley 17) Rabada returns to the attack. South Africa won\u2019t be worried just yet, though they will hope the pitch is more malignant tomorrow. They are starting to lose a little patience, and when Rabada is too straight Sibley helps himself to a boundary off the hip. In the circumstances, both personal and collective, Sibley\u2019s ability to stick to his gameplan has been pretty impressive. 18th over: England 58-0 (Burns 41, Sibley 13) \u201cFish: the science bit,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cUseful link for coaches. Remember, if Jeeves says it, it MUST be true.\u201d I thought you meant you\u2019d been using Ask Jeeves. I was about to upbraid you for thinking it was still 1998, never mind 2016. 17th over: England 56-0 (Burns 41, Sibley 11) Sibley hasn\u2019t scored many runs in his short Test career but he has at least hinted at his ability to bat time. This is his fifth Test innings and he has now faced 211 balls for his 53 runs. England are desperate for an old-fashioned opener who can consistently see off the new ball. Burns is much more proactive, as a rule, and he moves into the forties with another efficient clip through midwicket for four off Nortje. The more comfortable he looks at Test level, the more likely it is that he will be England\u2019s next Test captain. 16th over: England 51-0 (Burns 37, Sibley 10) Burns is beaten, chasing a wide one from Pretorius. Nothing else to see here. 15th over: England 51-0 (Burns 37, Sibley 10) \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Daniel McDonald, before proceeding to matters of greater import. If Burns is burned and Sibley is sickly, and Denly is deathly and Root is rooted, and Stokes is stoked but not like Lord\u2019s and Leeds, and Bairstow can only play as straight as [redacted], and Buttler can\u2019t serve and Curran(t) shrivels, and Archer is all aquiver and Broad\u2019s bat is not, Does Anderson become Flenderson And strangle all in Scranton Centurion? 14th over: England 50-0 (Burns 36, Sibley 10) Dwaine Pretorius replaces Vernon Philander, who bowled a classy opening spell of 6-2-13-0. Burns works a single to bring up a determined fifty partnership with his old Surrey mate Dom Sibley. That\u2019s their second in three Tests together. \u201cI\u2019m scratching my head here trying to figure out exactly how Jonny Bairstow became the poster boy for everything that\u2019s wrong with the Test team?\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cWhen did caring so much about playing for England and working like a dog to improve your game become the focus of our opprobrium? My impression from afar is that the guy has none of the Gerrard-Lampard axis of entitlement, which is perhaps why he was so desperate to keep the gloves, regardless of where he was shunted around the batting order. Reminds me more of Paul Scholes than the other pair, except I somehow doubt he will throw in the towel. Joe Cole with attitude, perhaps - he would have offered to take the gloves play in goal in order to get in the England team.\u201d It\u2019s so hard to know, because none of us are in the dressing room, but to me he seems extremely entitled. There\u2019s loads to admire about Bairstow, especially as a one-day batsman, but I don\u2019t think he should be anywhere near the Test team at the moment. The main reason I think a lot of people are irritated with him, and England\u2019s use of him, is the disparity between performance and his apparent chances/expectation of selection. He seems (again, this might not be the case) to be far more pig-headed than someone like Buttler, who also has issues with his performance:selection ratio. 13th over: England 49-0 (Burns 35, Sibley 10) The pitch has been relatively placid today, as if sleeping off the excesses of day two. Sibley is still playing and missing once an over, mind you, and he obliges from Nortje\u2019s fifth delivery. The follow-up ball is too short, too straight, and Sibley works it to fine leg for his fourth boundary. For all his technical eccentricity, there is plenty to admire in Sibley\u2019s temperament. 12th over: England 44-0 (Burns 34, Sibley 6) Philander continues to toy with Sibley, varying his line between fourth and sixth stump. Sibley, beaten again early in the over, eventually decides to play outside off stump - he scythes the last ball through the covers for two. 11th over: England 40-0 (Burns 33, Sibley 3) Too straight from Nortje, and Burns fizzes him through midwicket for four. Excellent shot. Nortje moves around the wicket as a result - but he strays onto the pads a second time and Burns clips another boundary through midwicket. Burns is never going to change the world but he is such an impressive, pragmatic batsman. 10th over: England 32-0 (Burns 25, Sibley 3) Oof, Burns is dropped by van der Dussen! He edged a stunning delivery from Philander to the right of first slip, where van der Dussen put down a tricky low chance. He may have been put off by de Kock diving across in front of him, though I suspect he\u2019d take that seven times out of 10. This time the ball went through and ran away for four runs. \u201cI think England need to bed in and build a solid base from which to hopefully expand and express themselves tomorrow,\u201d says Shane Kirk. \u201cNot only because it\u2019ll be good for the morale of the side, but mainly because we don\u2019t have Sky and we\u2019re not due at the in-laws (who do) until much later this afternoon.\u201d FYI: the World Cup of Pool is on Sky Sports Mix at 3pm. 9th over: England 27-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 3) South Africa have given Sibley nothing that he can work into the leg side. That shouldn\u2019t bother him, such is his patience, although the highest level can do funny things to the brain. All evidence from county cricket suggests Sibley won\u2019t care if he finishes today on 7 not out from 117 balls. At the moment, after a maiden from Nortje, he has 3 from 28. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI\u2019ve become convinced that the England batting unit\u2019s problem is mainly dietary. Could you use your global fame and influence to persuade Waitrose (as a sponsor) to put their Sushi Daily counters in ALL their branches. Here in Northamptonshire, a sushi wasteland, our young people are deprived of healthy and nutritious raw fish and my instinct tells me it\u2019s holding back their development, particularly in respect of maintaining concentration when the balls are nipping back a bit outside the off stump. Would probably also help apprentice pacemen (and women) improve their length and line.\u201d How many times: IT\u2019S NO LONGER 2016! 8th over: England 27-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 3) Burns looks custom-made for a wicket-to-wicket bowler like Philander, given the way he skitters across the crease, but so far he has managed to get a bat on everything straight. Another interrogative over from Philander ends with a peach that just misses Burns\u2019 outside edge. 7th over: England 27-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 3) Anrich Nortje replaces Kagiso Rabada, who bowled three expensive overs before tea, and zips a lovely delivery past Sibley\u2019s outside edge. He\u2019s struggling to survive, but he has enough experience to know things will get much easier if he can get past the new ball. 6th over: England 26-0 (Burns 19, Sibley 3) England run on a misfield and live to tell the tale, with Burns home before Nortje\u2019s throw hit the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end. Sibley is then beaten on the inside by Philander, who is having sadistic fun of the cat/mouse variety. \u201cWhat do England need to do to rescue some respectability from a pretty shambolic start to the tour?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI feel that if they can make the highest innings of the match, they\u2019ll have something to work with, but another collapse takes us into McGrathian territory. Happy New Year... but probably not.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s probably fair. The pitch has looked less spiteful today, so it\u2019s not beyond the realms that they could pull off a triumphant 72-run defeat. \u201cWould it have helped if England had spent more time in South Africa preparing for this series and not gone to New Zealand?\u201d says Paul McIntyre. \u201cEveryone seems to agree the schedule is too busy but no one in the England set-up seems accountable for signing up to it.\u201d That a different issue, I think. Interviews with Ashley Giles, the newish ECB Managing Director, suggest he is acutely aware of the problem, but it\u2019s not easy to resolve. Cricket (and most other sports) has sold so much of its soul in the last 20-30 years that it will be hard to make significant changes. It\u2019s all pretty miserable. \u201cYou wrote that Pope will play the second Test \u2018if he can dislodge Bairstow,\u2019\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cWouldn\u2019t he just need to throw something straight at him? (Sorry!)\u201d That made me laugh more than I expected. It took me by surprise. Like a full delivery at my off stump, honk. 5th over: England 24-0 (Burns 18, Sibley 2) Burns, reaching well wide of off stump, edges Rabada along the ground for four. It looks like he has decided to get as many as he can before the pitch gets him, and he goes to tea having made 18 from 18 balls. England need a further 352 runs to complete a hat-trick of miracles in 2019. \u201cFollowing a few football results over the last couple of evenings, I\u2019m still on a sporting high, so not quite at the \u2018praying for rain\u2019 stage yet (with those famously wet SA summers, and all),\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI am, however, about to spend an afternoon with no mobile signal (yay for West Wales!), so not too sure what I\u2019ll come back to. A couple of big scores, and a good, hard look at themselves before the next Test would be nice. See what you can do, Rob.\u201d Has there been some association football in 2019? I can\u2019t say I noticed. 4th over: England 18-0 (Burns 12, Sibley 2) Philander makes a lone enquiry for caught behind - as much to his team-mates as the umpire - when Sibley is beaten outside off stump. It missed the bottom edge of the bat. Sibley is beaten again later in the over, this time by a gorgeous delivery. Whatever happens in this innings, I hope Sibley is given at least the rest of this series, and probably the Sri Lanka Tests as well. There are concerns about his technique, that much is true. But it would be scandalous to drop him after three Tests, particularly in view of the chances given to more experienced players. 3rd over: England 18-0 (Burns 12, Sibley 2) Burns drives Rabada handsomely through mid-off for four, and England get some bonus runs when a short ball clears de Kock and runs away for four byes. \u201cI\u2019ve suddenly become engrossed in a hardbound 2019 Wisden which was lying untouched,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cKohli was the Cricketer of the Year in both 2018 and 2019. Who do you think will take the honour this time around? Surely, Ben Stokes?\u201d As Sir Alex Ferguson used to say to the press re: his team selections, never try to read the mind of a madman. 2nd over: England 8-0 (Burns 6, Sibley 2) Sibley is the first man to be tied up in the chair and interrogated by Philander. He gets off the mark with a clip for two and survives the over without alarm. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here many times, Rob,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cToo many of them recently. I agree we can\u2019t keep trying to shoehorn the big names in just so no one\u2019s upset. The difference with the Gerrard-Lampard epoch is that we had a great core of players to pick from but stuffed it up. Here we have a mix of brilliant, good, could be legendary and not really sure but by persisting with this rigid must-pick XI, we scupper it for everyone. Right now though, I\u2019d just like us to put up a fight, but this has 145 all out written all over it. Penny for Chris Silverwood\u2019s thoughts. At least Pope should be ok for the next Test.\u201d If he can dislodge Bairstow. Andrew Hurley made an excellent point on email yesterday. For all Silverwood\u2019s coaching ability, there is one big problem with his appointment: he was already part of a set-up that has developed a flawed culture and is in urgent need of a new voice. 1st over: England 6-0 (Burns 6, Sibley 0) Rabada opens the bowling at the Sacrifical Pom End. Burns edges the first ball of the innings along the ground for four. He is then given out LBW, but successfully reviews. It looked a poor decision from Chris Gaffaney and replays confirmed the ball would have missed off stump. It didn\u2019t quite come back enough, though it was a beautiful delivery. Here\u2019s Ian Andrew on the subject of England\u2019s retch-tastic second Test in India in 1963-64. \u201cWhen Jimmy Binks was asked to open the England second innings, his comment was apparently, \u2018Wait till Freddie Trueman hears about this!\u2019\u201d I\u2019d love to have heard Fred\u2019s views as Binks batted on and on. Here\u2019s the Wisden report on that game, which is well worth reading. The first task for the England openers is to negotiate a miserable 20-minute mini-session before tea. Dom Sibley, in particular, could really do with a score. A dogged 30 or 40 would do him the world of good. This is on BT Sport tonight. I\u2019ve seen a preview and can unequivocally recommend it. (Full disclosure: I know the director, but despite his involvement it is fantastic.) The stand-in keeper Bairstow takes a spectacular leaping catch to dismiss Philander and end England\u2019s suffering, at least for the next 10 minutes. England need 376 to win. No. 61st over: South Africa 264-9 (Philander 45, Rabada 9) On Sky Sports, Ian Ward has just referred to \u201cEngland\u2019s powerful middle order\u201d. I wish everyone would realise it\u2019s no longer 2016. It\u2019s 2019, almost 2020, and KG Rabada has just clouted Archer over cover for four more. That brings up Archer\u2019s hundred. For someone so economical, his figures are most peculiar: 17-1-102-5. 60th over: South Africa 258-9 (Philander 44, Rabada 5) Philander loves batting against England. He averages 41 in Tests, easily his highest, and made important runs in victories at Lord\u2019s (2012), Trent Bridge (2017) and Centurion (2019). Rabada, meanwhile, gets off the mark with an elegant cover drive for four off Curran. South Africa lead by 360. That\u2019s fine, because England have a lot of 360 batsmen. Right? RIGHT? 59th over: South Africa 251-9 (Philander 42, Rabada 0) Tum20 Blast is the subject of James Debens\u2019 email. \u201cThese aren\u2019t the runs, big heaves and Trotts I was praying for! *waggles cigar* Try the veal (substitute).\u201d Jofra Archer completes a peculiar five-for when Maharaj top-edges a smear to fine leg. There is no real celebration from Archer, unsurprisingly given the match situation and the fact he\u2019s going at more than six an over. 58th over: South Africa 247-8 (Philander 39, Maharaj 10) The collective sickness has made this a very difficult match for England. It\u2019s only a partial reason for the result, however, and I hope they don\u2019t overplay it. This England Test team are very good - the best in the world, probably - at rationalising defeat and explaining why it will be different next time. Thanks John, morning everyone. We all know how this ends; the only question is whether it will do so today or tomorrow. And that\u2019s drinks \u2013 South Africa lead by 345 and England are in survival mode. So it\u2019s a perfect time for me to pass you over to the estimable Rob Smyth, who\u2019ll take you through the rest of the day. 57th over: South Africa 242-8 (Philander 34, Maharaj 10) Maharaj, who seems to be enjoying himself, edges Archer through the (empty) slips for a single. Philander pushes down the ground for another. Maharaj skews a hook away safely for another. Philander clips off the hop for another. 56th over: South Africa 238-8 (Philander 32, Maharaj 8) Curran returns to the fray. Maharaj bends his front leg and lofts him over the covers for four! Fine shot that. Another Curran is having an interesting time over in Australia: 55th over: South Africa 231-8 (Philander 31, Maharaj 3) Jofra Archer returns in the hope of picking up his third five-fer in 12 Test innings. Philander, after a biiig swing-and-miss, is able to dink him away to leg for a couple. The South Africa batsman actually dealt with that over very well despite that rather optimistic heave early on. 54th over: South Africa 226-8 (Philander 26, Maharaj 3) Philander is the latest batsman to take an injury break after fending off a Stokes delivery with his box. Youchy. The score edges up with a couple of singles \u2013 the lead is now an imposing 329. 53rd over: South Africa 223-8 (Philander 24, Maharaj 2) Maharaj hooks Anderson for a single \u2013 six words which say a bit about England\u2019s bowling performance today. \u201cI am sitting (careful how you spell that!) in my AirBnB in the Centurion area with a ticket for today\u2019s play (and tomorrow\u2019s and all of the Cape Town Test) somewhat indisposed. At both ends!\u201d yelps Neil Waterfield. \u201cIs there any advice coming out of the England camp on how to deal with this bug? The effects of yesterday\u2019s numerous Immodium seem to have Warne off!\u201d If Joe Root is any indication, the best thing to do is to stand in a slip cordon looking like you\u2019ve just got off the waltzers. 52nd over: South Africa 221-8 (Philander 23, Maharaj 1) A neat and tidy over from Stokes, who has probably been England\u2019s best bowler so far today. On the subject of the Sickest Test, here\u2019s Steve Hudson: \u201cI don\u2019t know if this has been mentioned already, and I\u2019d be surprised if it hasn\u2019t, but the second Test between England and India in 1963-4 at the Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai, featured an England side with only two specialist batsmen, three if you include Jim Parks. Two wicket keepers, four pace bowlers and two spinners, plus Mike Smith who was unable to take the field. The 10 players who managed to play throughout the game were the only members of the touring party who were able to.\u201d Oh. Out of nowhere De Kock, who has been pretty much becalmed in the 40 minutes since lunch, pushes forward and feathers an edge through to Bairstow. 51st over: South Africa 220-7 (De Kock 34, Philander 23) Anderson doesn\u2019t look a particularly happy bunny out there \u2013 he\u2019s struggled to ask many questions of this pair. This may explain the presence of a very peaky Joe Root: 50th over: South Africa 218-7 (De Kock 33, Philander 22) De Kock is OK to carry on after some attention but it looked a painful blow. Stokes is a whisker away from picking up Philander but an inside-edge somehow evades the stumps. 49th over: South Africa 216-7 (De Kock 33, Philander 21) Joe Root trots \u2013 ahem \u2013 back on to the field to prompt much headscratching. The England camp first said he was in quarantine. Then he came back. Then he went off again and word was he was looking pretty bad. Now he\u2019s back once more. So who knows? Perhaps only Root himself it seems. Anderson continues but De Kock keeps his powder dry. From the last he takes a whack on a finger and needs some treatment. 48th over: South Africa 216-7 (De Kock 33, Philander 21) Another wonderful drive from Philander sends the ball whistling down the cover boundary as Stokes overpitches. Much of the criticism of England today has focussed on them bowling too short, which is all well and good, but they\u2019ve bowled poorly whenever they\u2019ve pitched it up too. 47th over: South Africa 211-7 (De Kock 32, Philander 17) A few singles off Anderson\u2019s latest. Fact fans will be interested to know that this game in 2000 saw the highest run chase in Centurion. Yes, this one: 46th over: South Africa 206-7 (De Kock 30, Philander 15) Stokes (3-1-6-1) continues but Philander channels a bit of his batting partner and heaves him away over midwicket for a one-bounce four. Again he pinches the strike off the penultimate ball so De Kock only has the one ball to face and he leaves alone outside off. A thought from our chief sports writer: 45th over: South Africa 202-7 (De Kock 30, Philander 10) Joe Root has not returned to the field after lunch \u2013 England\u2019s batting order could be quite interesting. Anyway Anderson gets the ball after the break. He sends down four tidy dots at Philander but the fifth is in the slot and the South Africa No 9 unfurls a superb cover drive four to bring up the 200. He pinches the strike from the last too. Players back out. Can England polish this off quickly? \u201cWin or lose, this ought to be in the 2010s roundups as England\u2019s Sickest Test Ever,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cIs that right? I suspect there have been others where a bug swept through team, but were quite so many laid up?\u201d Indeed, Joe Root was off the field again as the morning session came to an end. The knives are out for England after that morning session. On Sky there\u2019s been nothing but opprobrium for England\u2019s tactics, while Michael Vaughan has tweeted: \u201cThe England Test Team need to admit they have a Test Match Cricket Problem. Only then will it improve ...\u201d So 125 runs and three wickets in a lively session. 44th over: South Africa 197-7 (De Kock 30, Philander 5) The last over before lunch here I reckon. Stokes to bowl it. De Kock lofts him over the infield for a single \u2013 he moves to 30 from 16 \u2013 and Philander blocks one into the on-side for another to make the lead 300. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019ll be at lunch. 43rd over: South Africa 195-7 (De Kock 29, Philander 4) Here we go \u2013 Archer v De Kock II. The first is banged in short \u2026 and heaved away for six! And the second is flat-batted down the ground for four. The third is a short bouncer which is signalled a wide. And Nasser Hussain makes a pertinent point on commentary \u2013 even if this ploy works for England now and De Kock spoons up a catch, the damage is pretty much done. 42nd over: South Africa 181-7 (De Kock 16, Philander 4) England have just about dragged themselves back into this game with three wickets in 19 balls. But they\u2019re hardly in a position of strength. Philander edges for four as the lead heads towards 300. Stokes gets the ball in his hands for the first time this morning and he has struck! Pretorius edges a full one through to Sibley at slip. 41st over: South Africa 177-6 (De Kock 16, Pretorius 7) Four wickets for Archer now. Pretorious gets off the mark with a cracking tip-toed back-foot drive for four. Lovely stuff. He adds two more with a push through the same area. As Pretorius made his way to the crease Stokes and Broad had what appeared to be a very heated discussion in Englan\u2019s huddle. But whatever the disagreement was a fist-bump at the end of the over draws it to a close. Nortje\u2019s vigil comes to an end, Archer finally getting one to flick off bat and pad. Crawley takes a sharp catch at close range. 40th over: South Africa 170-5 (Nortje 40, De Kock 16) Broad takes the opposite tack to De Kock, pitching the ball up. That keeps him quiet for a few balls but from the last he flails a glorious cover drive through for four more. Sixteen from 10 so far for De Kock. 39th over: South Africa 165-5 (Nortje 39, De Kock 12) To say England needed that is something of an understatement. The wicket brings Quinton de Kock to the crease with the lead at 256. He gets off the mark \u2026 with a huge six over backward square leg! Because of course he does. Archer bangs it in short again \u2013 De Kock smashes it for six again! What a cricketer Quinton de Kock is. There was a bit more top edge about the second but it still flew into the stands. And in the blink of an eye the lead races to 268 \u2026 A slower ball from Archer clonks into the front pad and this time the umpire\u2019s finger goes up. Van der Dussen reviews but it\u2019s clipping leg and he has to go. 38th over: South Africa 153-4 (Van der Dussen 51, Nortje 39) Van der Dussen bunts and charges through for a single that brings up his half-century. A terrific knock from the debutant. Nortje is not be far off joining him \u2013 he crashes a back-foot drive through the covers for four more, though his technique against the short ball has been cojone-based more than anything. 37th over: South Africa 145-4 (Van der Dussen 49, Nortje 34) \u201cMay not be in the spirit of the game but if all the English players are this contagious, might one suggest nine men around the bat?\u201d ponders Pete Salmon. To that end (maybe) a very peaky looking Joe Root is unquarantined and back in the slips. Nortje again has to contend with plenty of short stuff, round the wicket from Archer this time. 36th over: South Africa 142-4 (Van der Dussen 48, Nortje 32) Five wides from Broad to add to England\u2019s pain. Illness or no, everyone in the England camp will be feeling a little queasy now. Nortje \u2013 who has delivered a textbook nightwatchman performance \u2013 wears one on the ribcage and has to call for some treatment from the physio. That was a painful one and a sign of a bit of a change of tack from England. Two balls remain after that injury break and from the last Nortje somehow survives after a panicked attempt to fend off another short one drops between three fielders. 35th over: South Africa 136-4 (Van der Dussen 47, Nortje 32) Archer continues and has Nortje fending and dodging, successfully as it happens. \u201cMorning John,\u201d begins Guy Hornsby. Morning Guy. \u201cI know it\u2019s hardly positivity central but we\u2019ve got a night watchman in and we\u2019ve only got two slips and a third man? With the most productive swing bowler in Test history bowling! It all feels a bit negative. Maybe it\u2019s the illness, but the field placings and atmosphere seems pretty flat. This feels like 350 lead and all out for a miserable 160.\u201d It does a bit. 34th over: South Africa 133-4 (Van der Dussen 46, Nortje 30) Broad finds Van der Dussen\u2019s edge this time but the ball just fails to carry to a diving Ben Stokes at third slip. It was a very decent effort from England\u2019s current on-field captain but the ball trundles away for four. VDD celebrates with a couple of gorgeous cover drives for a pair of boundaries. South Africa\u2019s lead races up to 236. 33rd over: South Africa 120-4 (Van der Dussen 33, Nortje 30) Archer sends one fizzing into Van der Dussen\u2019s pads and review it after the umpire shakes his head. Hawkeye shows the ball clipping leg stump \u2013 clipping enough to tear leg stump out of the ground but clipping all the same. Not out. Then a couple of boundaries: an Archer bouncer evades everyone and a very neatly timed Nortje drive. And even more bad news for England: Joe Root is feeling unwell and has joined the band of nauseous brothers in Quarantine: 32nd over: South Africa 109-4 (Van der Dussen 32, Nortje 25) Broad gets through another tidy, uneventful over. A couple of singles come from it. 31st over: South Africa 106-4 (Van der Dussen 31, Nortje 24) Jofra Archer comes into the attack for the first time this morning. Nortje flaps awkwardly at a short one but can\u2019t make contact. From the last ball of the over there\u2019s another run-out chance but Denly can\u2019t hit the stumps from point. 30th over: South Africa 104-4 (Van der Dussen 30, Nortje 23) The first bowling change of the morning \u2013 Stuart Broad comes into the attack. There\u2019s another run-out chance as Nortje sends Van der Dussen back but Zak Crawley, on as a sub fielder, misses his shy at the stumps. Tidy enough from Broad, without being particularly threatening. 29th over: South Africa 103-4 (Van der Dussen 30, Nortje 22) Curran continues and Van der Dussen immediately scampers another single. He\u2019s been quite happy to watch most of this morning\u2019s action from the non-striker\u2019s end while Nortje irritates the bowlers at the other end. And to prove the point, the nightwatchman flails a full delivery down to cow corner for four more. 28th over: South Africa 97-4 (Van der Dussen 29, Nortje 17) Another edge from Nortje, another boundary down to third man. That takes the lead to 200. Anderson \u2013 delighted, of course \u2013 has a brief word with Nortje at the non-striker\u2019s end. England need something to happen and they need it soon. 27th over: South Africa 92-4 (Van der Dussen 28, Nortje 13) Curran comes round the wicket and discomfits the stubborn Nortje with a couple \u2013 there\u2019s a huge appeal after a full one thunders into the back pad but the angle means it\u2019s sliding down. Nortje adds the salt by aiming a drive down the ground and edging wide of slip for the first boundary of the morning. 26th over: South Africa 88-4 (Van der Dussen 28, Nortje 9) Van der Dussen clips Anderson to deep midwicket for three as South Africa continue this steady start. They\u2019ve had a couple of scares \u2013 the run-out chance and that review by Nortje \u2013 but they\u2019re through the first half hour without loss. Anderson beats Nortje all ends up outside off here but the nightwatchman survives again and is able to turn the next to backward square for a single. 25th over: South Africa 84-4 (Van der Dussen 25, Nortje 8) And that\u2019s the end of the over. The ball has clearly come off Nortje\u2019s shoulder. Curran gets one to rear at Nortje, who fends outside off and sees the ball fly through to Bairstow. The finger goes up but he reviews immediately. 24th over: South Africa 81-4 (Van der Dussen 23, Nortje 7) Van der Dussen takes a bonkers single and would\u2019ve been out by a yard had Sibley hit the stumps after running in from cover. That\u2019s the only notable action from an otherwise tidy enough over from Anderson. 23rd over: South Africa 78-4 (Van der Dussen 21, Nortje 6) An uncomfortable moment for Dom Sibley as he slides in the outfield and his knee jams in the soft turf. He\u2019s wincing for the rest of the over but seems otherwise unhurt. Three from the Curran over. 22nd over: South Africa 75-4 (Van der Dussen 20, Nortje 4) James Anderson (4-0-19-1) at the other end and Van der Dussen tickles away the first runs of the morning, Anderson straying on to his pads. There\u2019s a yelp of an appeal as VDD shoulders arms outside off and is struck on the pad but there wasn\u2019t quite enough movement back in for Anderson there. He\u2019s clearly looking for an lbw against the upright Van der Dussen, who clips another single to leg, playing around his front pad a little. And from the last Nortje hops and prods uncertainly. Some excellent stuff from Anderson there. 21st over: South Africa 72-4 (Van der Dussen 17, Nortje 4) Sam Curran gets the honour for England, sending down a couple of wide looseners at Nortje before finding his line just outside off. He has the nightwatchman playing and missing at the last. A maiden. Right, the players are out on the field. Off we go for a(nother) big first hour \u2026 A couple of bits of news: Jos Buttler has joined the England sick ward so Bairstow will take the gloves today. And South Africa\u2019s Aiden Markram has broken a finger \u2013 he\u2019s out of the series. In other news, Jofra Archer has to be careful today after yesterday\u2019s slightly bizarre moment at the very end of the day: And, if you\u2019re interested in such things, several England players picked up gongs in the new year honours list: Hello all and welcome to day three of this enthralling Test. It\u2019s all rather nicely poised isn\u2019t it? South Africa lead by 175 with six second-innings wickets remaining. England aren\u2019t quite out of it but will need a flurry of wickets this morning to stay in the game. South Africa, already in the box seat, know that \u2013 what? \u2013 another 120-odd runs might be all they need. The first few hours today could be spectacular. At least, England will hope they are. To catch up, here\u2019s Vic Marks on day two:",

Homeowners already had to apply to the firm for access to their own homes, with some claiming they are being limited to a maximum number of guests they can receive. Now Police Scotland has stated that any such restrictions are not legally enforceable and are strictly a matter for the event organiser and council authorities. Superintendent Stevie Dolan said: \u201cWe are aware of the plans for wristband access to the Hogmanay street party, following an expansion of the event arena. This is not a policing decision.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not about one incident but the whole relationship between the city, its residents and this company</p> <footer> <cite>Mike Small, activist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It remains unclear how security arrangements will work.

We are sorry if this has been misunderstood, but we want to be clear that our intention was never to prevent access.\u201d</p> <p>Underbelly was unable to provide details of how it would deal with people seeking access to attend private parties, but said it would \u201cstrive to provide a safe and secure solution\u201d.</p> <p>Mike Small, a writer and activist in Edinburgh, believes Underbelly, which organises other city events, is unregulated and has been given too much power by the council.</p> <p>\u201cUnderbelly seems to be spinning desperately,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first it was all fine, then it was that this had been the arrangement for years and now it\u2019s all a terrible misunderstanding. The reality is that this is not about one incident but the whole relationship between the city, its residents and this company. One of the key unanswered questions is how this company secures long-term contracts with the city to provide events which many people believe are poorly managed and badly conceived.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Security arrangements for the UK\u2019s biggest new year street party are in disarray after police revealed they are not legally enforceable. The organiser of Edinburgh\u2019s Hogmanay, which is expected to attract 70,000 visitors over four days, is at the centre of a row with disgruntled city residents over what they perceive to be unreasonable restrictions. The events specialist, Underbelly, has been accused by residents of effectively imposing a social curfew on private party plans. Homeowners already had to apply to the firm for access to their own homes, with some claiming they are being limited to a maximum number of guests they can receive. Now Police Scotland has stated that any such restrictions are not legally enforceable and are strictly a matter for the event organiser and council authorities. Superintendent Stevie Dolan said: \u201cWe are aware of the plans for wristband access to the Hogmanay street party, following an expansion of the event arena. This is not a policing decision.\u201d It remains unclear how security arrangements will work. Under data protection laws, there is no legal requirement for people seeking to bypass security to hand over names and details of intended destinations. Underbelly insisted it never intended to impose party limits on permanent residents. \u201cWe would never prevent residents and their guests from accessing their homes,\u201d it said. \u201cThe arena area needs to be secure, which is why, for many years, there has been a system in place for residents to get access passes which ensure them quick and easy access past security to their homes. We are sorry if this has been misunderstood, but we want to be clear that our intention was never to prevent access.\u201d Underbelly was unable to provide details of how it would deal with people seeking access to attend private parties, but said it would \u201cstrive to provide a safe and secure solution\u201d. Mike Small, a writer and activist in Edinburgh, believes Underbelly, which organises other city events, is unregulated and has been given too much power by the council. \u201cUnderbelly seems to be spinning desperately,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first it was all fine, then it was that this had been the arrangement for years and now it\u2019s all a terrible misunderstanding. The reality is that this is not about one incident but the whole relationship between the city, its residents and this company. One of the key unanswered questions is how this company secures long-term contracts with the city to provide events which many people believe are poorly managed and badly conceived.\u201d",

She estimates that \u201cdozens\u201d of Goyas will have to be reattributed and that it will take years of research: \u201cWe\u2019ve been aware of the problems for many years, but everybody\u2019s got to do their research now. Almost every museum that\u2019s got a Goya has also got a problematic Goya. They\u2019re very widespread. Some are quite clearly later fakes, but many were by his studio assistants.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the problem had been an 1812 inventory of Goya\u2019s studio and other possessions, she said. \u201cWe believed that everything in that inventory must be by Goya. Over time, I have come to the conclusion that some of them could not be by his hand.</p> <p>\u201cThe answer is that Goya, like any great artist, had an active studio with assistants, and that many of the paintings would therefore be by other people, but they would all go out of the studio as by Goya.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd5e40f2b1305fbbc1b4470d7c61464f79db673d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd5e40f2b1305fbbc1b4470d7c61464f79db673d/0_0_3500_5198/673.jpg\" alt=\"Francisco de Goya, self portrait, 1783.\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francisco de Goya, self portrait, 1783.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Muse\u0301e des Beaux-Arts d'Agen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goya was known to have had assistants, she said, but up until recently the role these people played was ambiguous. \u201cNow it\u2019s clear, partly through documentary evidence that proves people were buying Goya and non-Goya works under the same label, that Goya was, in effect, heading a school, as noted by a contemporary.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cThe Metropolitan Museum, New York, has already downgraded several of its paintings as not by Goya, but without being able to confirm their date or authorship.

      "bodyText": "The authenticity of dozens of Goya paintings is being questioned by a leading British art historian who claims that they are not in fact works by the Spanish master but instead created by some of the great painter\u2019s many studio assistants. Juliet Wilson-Bareau, a Goya scholar, told the Observer that museums must re-examine their Goya holdings because there are so many \u201cproblematic\u201d pictures. She regularly sees auction houses and dealers selling works under Goya\u2019s name when she is convinced that they are by lesser hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a minefield,\u201d she said. \u201cPictures that have become doubtful are still being presented as \u2018by Goya\u2019, knowingly or unknowingly. Everybody wants a picture to be by Goya.\u201d Francisco de Goya, who lived from 1746 to 1828, is revered for masterpieces including his savage satires of man\u2019s inhumanity to man in the Disasters of War series. Wilson-Bareau, who has lectured on Goya at Oxford University as a Slade professor, has curated major Goya exhibitions at the Prado, Madrid, and the Royal Academy of Arts, London. She estimates that \u201cdozens\u201d of Goyas will have to be reattributed and that it will take years of research: \u201cWe\u2019ve been aware of the problems for many years, but everybody\u2019s got to do their research now. Almost every museum that\u2019s got a Goya has also got a problematic Goya. They\u2019re very widespread. Some are quite clearly later fakes, but many were by his studio assistants.\u201d Part of the problem had been an 1812 inventory of Goya\u2019s studio and other possessions, she said. \u201cWe believed that everything in that inventory must be by Goya. Over time, I have come to the conclusion that some of them could not be by his hand. \u201cThe answer is that Goya, like any great artist, had an active studio with assistants, and that many of the paintings would therefore be by other people, but they would all go out of the studio as by Goya.\u201d Goya was known to have had assistants, she said, but up until recently the role these people played was ambiguous. \u201cNow it\u2019s clear, partly through documentary evidence that proves people were buying Goya and non-Goya works under the same label, that Goya was, in effect, heading a school, as noted by a contemporary.\u201d She added: \u201cThe Metropolitan Museum, New York, has already downgraded several of its paintings as not by Goya, but without being able to confirm their date or authorship. Convinced by this idea that Goya did have a studio \u2013 which could account for problematic pictures \u2013 the Met will now re-examine [them].\u201d They include a large painting of Majas on a Balcony, a replica of Goya\u2019s original in a private European collection. Bareau-Wilson said: \u201cAnother painting of the same subject was included in the Louvre\u2019s 2013 Goya \u2018study days\u2019. I believe it is by Goya\u2019s close assistant Asensio Juli\u00e0, who may therefore have painted the more Goyesque version in the Met.\u201d Juli\u00e0 features in a major exhibition on Goya\u2019s studio that Bareau-Wilson has curated for the Museum of Fine Arts in Agen, in south-west France. Goya: Avant-Garde Genius. The Master and his School features nearly 90 works loaned by museums and private collections worldwide. Goya masterpieces hang alongside pictures which Bareau-Wilson believes are by his assistants, although they came from his studio: \u201cThat\u2019s why people are able to cling to the fact that they are Goya, even when some of us can see that they aren\u2019t.

In the song, Lily pleads with her weed-smoking little brother to get off his \u201clazy arse\u201d and stop wasting his life away. After eight seasons of HBO\u2019s epic fantasy drama, Allen, 33, appeared to have done just that. But the truth is more complicated.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Lily wrote the song, I was in Canada teaching kids how to snowboard,\u201d he recalls, lighting a cigarette and taking a drag. He\u2019d already moved on, and got his life together. \u201cI was getting a snowboarding qualification. I went on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/myspace\" title=\"\">Myspace</a> [the social network where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/lilly-allen-myspace\" title=\"\">Lily first uploaded her music</a> in 2005] and listened to it, and I was\u2026 entertained. It\u2019s a song about love, isn\u2019t it? She was missing her little bro!\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t bother him that people might have him pegged as a waster? \u201cShe was on the rise. She was killing it. I was like: as long as it helps your creative juices flow, then go for it. I just remember asking for it not to be a single \u2013 but then obviously record labels don\u2019t give a shit what family members think, do they? So that was that.\u201d Alfie, released as a double A-side with Shame For You, peaked at No 15 in the UK charts.</p> <p>If the gamechanging Emmy nomination for his role as Theon Greyjoy hasn\u2019t drawn a line under the song, then this next chapter certainly will. Prior to Game Of Thrones, Allen\u2019s most high-profile work was fleeting roles in films such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/07/romance.keiraknightley\" title=\"\">Atonement</a> (2007) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/07/drama.romance\" title=\"\">The Other Boleyn Girl</a> (2008).

It\u2019s a temporary living arrangement that could turn into something more permanent: he has a one-year-old daughter, Arrow, with his former partner, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/allieteilz/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Allie Teilz</a>, a DJ who is based here.</p> <p>I imagine he is enjoying a more settled lifestyle after being contracted to a juggernaut such as Game Of Thrones for almost a decade. Is it like being released back into civilisation: no more schedules, night shoots or relentless promo tours?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66a3b8cced7a715f950637b605bd40fa71153fb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66a3b8cced7a715f950637b605bd40fa71153fb6/304_62_4130_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Gemma Whelan in Game Of Thrones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Gemma Whelan in Game Of Thrones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Sloan/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was excited to move on, without a doubt,\u201d Allen says. \u201cI think there was always that fear from when we started: God, you know, this is going to be for quite a while. You don\u2019t want to get sucked into thinking negatively about something that\u2019s essentially a very positive thing, but I would fluctuate. The majority of the time, the feeling for me was: I either give it my all, or I piss and moan about it. Even if you are going to piss and moan about something, you\u2019re going to use that emotion to the betterment of your character, and that\u2019s what I tried to do.\u201d</p> <p>A record 10 cast members were nominated for an Emmy this year, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/dec/01/emilia-clarke-i-didnt-want-people-to-think-of-me-as-sick-\" title=\"\">Emilia Clarke</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kit-harington\" title=\"\">Kit Harington</a>; was there competition between them when the cameras stopped rolling?</p> <p>\u201cAt the beginning, me, Kit Harington and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/richard-madden\" title=\"\">Richard Madden</a> were definitely in some sort of competition about who could be in the best shape. It\u2019s not like we were comparing, but there was definitely a macho vibe going around,\u201d he cackles. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say there was competition in any sense other than who had the best six-pack. And Kit will always win that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"726148971fcdcaa501c0dd9a3283c45e06a42ba7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726148971fcdcaa501c0dd9a3283c45e06a42ba7/145_97_2235_2793/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lily Allen and Alfie Allen\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With big sister Lily in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The way Game Of Thrones ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/20/game-of-thrones-finale-final-episode-fan-reaction\" title=\"\">came in for a lot of criticism</a>, with members of the crew trolled online, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/16/game-of-thrones-petition-got-season-8-remake\" title=\"\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/16/game-of-thrones-petition-got-season-8-remake\" title=\"\">petition</a> demanding a reshoot of season eight \u201cwith competent writers\u201d. Its critics felt it was rushed, with no room for character development. Why does Allen think fans reacted in that way? \u201cPeople were just massively emotionally invested in it, and that\u2019s testament to how great the show is. Things ended in a similar fashion with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\" title=\"\">Breaking Bad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-sopranos\" title=\"\">The Sopranos</a>. There\u2019s never a good ending and I think [the show\u2019s writers] David Benioff and DB Weiss had a huge amount of pressure on them.\u201d</p> <p>Allen admits his judgment of the finale may be impaired by the fact that he was so satisfied with his own character\u2019s heroic demise in episode three. He says it allowed him to move on from the show in a positive way; particularly as his character was so polarising and damaged; Theon orchestrated and endured violence so brutal that he was, in one season, captured, castrated and treated like a pet, mockingly named Reek. \u201cIt felt very isolating,\u201d Allen says of the role. \u201cThe character was ridiculed at times.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile Theon\u2019s identity crisis \u2013 raised alongside the Stark children but constantly reminded he wasn\u2019t one of them \u2013 has made Allen think more deeply about men\u2019s mental health in general. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we talk about our problems without wearing that as some kind of badge of identity. Look at who is in power [in the US]. A lot of the bad decisions are down to toxic masculinity. If we can eradicate that, it\u2019s going to be totally beneficial for future generations, and for any kind of kid growing up.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jojo Rabbit, which has Golden Globe nominations and has been tipped for Oscars, couldn\u2019t have come along at a better time. Allen auditioned fresh from a post-Game Of Thrones holiday, looking for something new. Directed by the New Zealand director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/taika-waititi\" title=\"\">Taika Waititi</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/what-we-do-in-shadows-review\" title=\"\">What We Do In The Shadows</a>), the film is certainly unconventional. Set in Nazi Germany, it follows a single mother (Johansson) raising a 10-year-old son who is desperate to join the Hitler Youth and has an imaginary friend, a goofball version of Hitler, played by Waititi himself. Allen plays Finkel, the second-in-command to Captain Klenzendorf (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sam-rockwell\" title=\"\">Sam Rockwell</a>) who runs the youth camp. It\u2019s deeply moving at times, but its comedic treatment of the subject matter has polarised critics.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is entitled to feel any way about any piece of art, but I would say satire is a tool that can be used to shine a spotlight,\u201d Allen says. \u201cOne of the reasons Taika made the movie was because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/21/people-dont-know-about-the-holocaust-they-dont-care\" title=\"\">66% of US millennials d</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/21/people-dont-know-about-the-holocaust-they-dont-care\" title=\"\">on\u2019t know what Auschwitz is</a>. That\u2019s an insane statistic. And with the rise of rightwing politics and fascism, it seems the right time. If you feel it\u2019s a movie where the subject matter is a bit too sensitive to even make a satire out of, I think you should watch it and see how it makes you feel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b91a71ef62548314c737e4bc54d99cfdf843b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b91a71ef62548314c737e4bc54d99cfdf843b48/346_100_5575_3345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfie Allen, Sam Rockwell and Roman Griffin Davis in Jojo Rabbit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Sam Rockwell and Roman Griffin Davis in Jojo Rabbit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Jojo Rabbit, Allen had had little opportunity to showcase his comic timing, or to improvise on set. \u201cTaika wants things to happen spontaneously,\u201d he says. \u201cDave and Dan [the GoT writers] are very precious about their words, and rightfully so. I think one of the only improvs that was allowed was \u2018aye\u2019. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0192377/\" title=\"\">Liam Cunningham</a> and Kit Harington started saying \u2018aye\u2019, so Dave and Dan would allow the odd \u2018aye\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>After Jojo Rabbit, Allen is even more enthused about How To Build A Girl. Starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/lady-bird-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-laurie-metcalf\" title=\"\">Lady Bird</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/booksmart-review-olivia-wilde-beanie-feldstein\" title=\"\">Booksmart</a> star Beanie Feldstein as the protagonist Johanna, it\u2019s a film Allen is \u201creally, really proud of and definitely one I would want my teenage daughter to be watching\u201d. He plays the object of Johanna\u2019s affections, a Welsh rock star called John Kite, and even got to record a song with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/elbow\" title=\"\">Elbow</a>\u2019s Guy Garvey, which he performs in the film. I tell him I didn\u2019t know he could sing. \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s still up for debate,\u201d Allen laughs. \u201cPerforming that song on stage at Camden Palace [the London venue now known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/aug/19/koko-london-gig-venue-guide\" title=\"\">Koko</a>] was the first thing I had to do on my first day on set, which was mad. I went to drum\u2019n\u2019bass raves there when I was a kid.\u201d</p> <p>How To Build A Girl is a family affair for Allen. Lily has a small cameo and their mother, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654077/\" title=\"\">Alison Owen</a>, produced it. Allen laughs awkwardly when I mention this.

      "bodyText": "When Alfie Allen was nominated for an Emmy earlier this year, for his performance in Game Of Thrones, many were quick to point out that the boy from the 2007 Lily Allen single Alfie had finally proved his big sister wrong. In the song, Lily pleads with her weed-smoking little brother to get off his \u201clazy arse\u201d and stop wasting his life away. After eight seasons of HBO\u2019s epic fantasy drama, Allen, 33, appeared to have done just that. But the truth is more complicated. \u201cWhen Lily wrote the song, I was in Canada teaching kids how to snowboard,\u201d he recalls, lighting a cigarette and taking a drag. He\u2019d already moved on, and got his life together. \u201cI was getting a snowboarding qualification. I went on Myspace [the social network where Lily first uploaded her music in 2005] and listened to it, and I was\u2026 entertained. It\u2019s a song about love, isn\u2019t it? She was missing her little bro!\u201d It didn\u2019t bother him that people might have him pegged as a waster? \u201cShe was on the rise. She was killing it. I was like: as long as it helps your creative juices flow, then go for it. I just remember asking for it not to be a single \u2013 but then obviously record labels don\u2019t give a shit what family members think, do they? So that was that.\u201d Alfie, released as a double A-side with Shame For You, peaked at No 15 in the UK charts. If the gamechanging Emmy nomination for his role as Theon Greyjoy hasn\u2019t drawn a line under the song, then this next chapter certainly will. Prior to Game Of Thrones, Allen\u2019s most high-profile work was fleeting roles in films such as Atonement (2007) and The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). Next month, he\u2019ll star alongside Scarlett Johansson in the black comedy Jojo Rabbit, which won the top prize at the Toronto film festival. In spring, he\u2019ll play the love interest in the highly anticipated big-screen adaptation of Caitlin Moran\u2019s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age novel How To Build A Girl; he\u2019ll also appear in the forthcoming true crime mini-series White House Farm, with Stephen Graham. It\u2019s a sunny autumnal day when I meet Allen, who is casually dressed in a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt, black cap and shorts, by the pool at his secluded hotel\u2011style apartment building in a bohemian part of Los Angeles. It\u2019s a temporary living arrangement that could turn into something more permanent: he has a one-year-old daughter, Arrow, with his former partner, Allie Teilz, a DJ who is based here. I imagine he is enjoying a more settled lifestyle after being contracted to a juggernaut such as Game Of Thrones for almost a decade. Is it like being released back into civilisation: no more schedules, night shoots or relentless promo tours? \u201cI was excited to move on, without a doubt,\u201d Allen says. \u201cI think there was always that fear from when we started: God, you know, this is going to be for quite a while. You don\u2019t want to get sucked into thinking negatively about something that\u2019s essentially a very positive thing, but I would fluctuate. The majority of the time, the feeling for me was: I either give it my all, or I piss and moan about it. Even if you are going to piss and moan about something, you\u2019re going to use that emotion to the betterment of your character, and that\u2019s what I tried to do.\u201d A record 10 cast members were nominated for an Emmy this year, including Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington; was there competition between them when the cameras stopped rolling? \u201cAt the beginning, me, Kit Harington and Richard Madden were definitely in some sort of competition about who could be in the best shape. It\u2019s not like we were comparing, but there was definitely a macho vibe going around,\u201d he cackles. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say there was competition in any sense other than who had the best six-pack. And Kit will always win that.\u201d The way Game Of Thrones ended came in for a lot of criticism, with members of the crew trolled online, and a petition demanding a reshoot of season eight \u201cwith competent writers\u201d. Its critics felt it was rushed, with no room for character development. Why does Allen think fans reacted in that way? \u201cPeople were just massively emotionally invested in it, and that\u2019s testament to how great the show is. Things ended in a similar fashion with Breaking Bad and The Sopranos. There\u2019s never a good ending and I think [the show\u2019s writers] David Benioff and DB Weiss had a huge amount of pressure on them.\u201d Allen admits his judgment of the finale may be impaired by the fact that he was so satisfied with his own character\u2019s heroic demise in episode three. He says it allowed him to move on from the show in a positive way; particularly as his character was so polarising and damaged; Theon orchestrated and endured violence so brutal that he was, in one season, captured, castrated and treated like a pet, mockingly named Reek. \u201cIt felt very isolating,\u201d Allen says of the role. \u201cThe character was ridiculed at times.\u201d Meanwhile Theon\u2019s identity crisis \u2013 raised alongside the Stark children but constantly reminded he wasn\u2019t one of them \u2013 has made Allen think more deeply about men\u2019s mental health in general. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we talk about our problems without wearing that as some kind of badge of identity. Look at who is in power [in the US]. A lot of the bad decisions are down to toxic masculinity. If we can eradicate that, it\u2019s going to be totally beneficial for future generations, and for any kind of kid growing up.\u201d *** Jojo Rabbit, which has Golden Globe nominations and has been tipped for Oscars, couldn\u2019t have come along at a better time. Allen auditioned fresh from a post-Game Of Thrones holiday, looking for something new. Directed by the New Zealand director Taika Waititi (What We Do In The Shadows), the film is certainly unconventional. Set in Nazi Germany, it follows a single mother (Johansson) raising a 10-year-old son who is desperate to join the Hitler Youth and has an imaginary friend, a goofball version of Hitler, played by Waititi himself. Allen plays Finkel, the second-in-command to Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) who runs the youth camp. It\u2019s deeply moving at times, but its comedic treatment of the subject matter has polarised critics. \u201cEveryone is entitled to feel any way about any piece of art, but I would say satire is a tool that can be used to shine a spotlight,\u201d Allen says. \u201cOne of the reasons Taika made the movie was because 66% of US millennials don\u2019t know what Auschwitz is. That\u2019s an insane statistic. And with the rise of rightwing politics and fascism, it seems the right time. If you feel it\u2019s a movie where the subject matter is a bit too sensitive to even make a satire out of, I think you should watch it and see how it makes you feel.\u201d Before Jojo Rabbit, Allen had had little opportunity to showcase his comic timing, or to improvise on set. \u201cTaika wants things to happen spontaneously,\u201d he says. \u201cDave and Dan [the GoT writers] are very precious about their words, and rightfully so. I think one of the only improvs that was allowed was \u2018aye\u2019. Liam Cunningham and Kit Harington started saying \u2018aye\u2019, so Dave and Dan would allow the odd \u2018aye\u2019.\u201d After Jojo Rabbit, Allen is even more enthused about How To Build A Girl. Starring Lady Bird and Booksmart star Beanie Feldstein as the protagonist Johanna, it\u2019s a film Allen is \u201creally, really proud of and definitely one I would want my teenage daughter to be watching\u201d. He plays the object of Johanna\u2019s affections, a Welsh rock star called John Kite, and even got to record a song with Elbow\u2019s Guy Garvey, which he performs in the film. I tell him I didn\u2019t know he could sing. \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s still up for debate,\u201d Allen laughs. \u201cPerforming that song on stage at Camden Palace [the London venue now known as Koko] was the first thing I had to do on my first day on set, which was mad. I went to drum\u2019n\u2019bass raves there when I was a kid.\u201d How To Build A Girl is a family affair for Allen. Lily has a small cameo and their mother, Alison Owen, produced it. Allen laughs awkwardly when I mention this. Did his path cross with his mother\u2019s when he was filming? \u201cShe was there. Mum is very committed, very professional. She\u2019s not one of those in-and-outs,\u201d he says jovially, suddenly sounding very cockney. Did he have to answer to her? \u201cNo, not at all. She\u2019s kind of my boss in a weird way but\u2026 Caitlin was the one who was pushing [for Allen to take the role] and obviously my mum was open to the idea.\u201d He changes the subject. \u201cThen Caitlin asked me to put on two stone. She put it on Twitter: \u2018Alfie Allen, you need to go and eat some crisps and chips now, quickly.\u2019 In the book, he\u2019s a larger man.\u201d Eventually, he says, the idea of bulking up was abandoned, but \u201cI would have been totally open to it\u201d. With Owen and actor Keith Allen for parents, Allen and his older sister had a childhood that exposed them to parental narcissism, drugs and often neglect, according to Lily\u2019s 2018 memoir My Thoughts Exactly, but Allen is reluctant to talk about it. Did he read the book? \u201cI did. I thought it was brilliant. It\u2019s really important that everybody is allowed to have their own truth. Lily\u2019s book was beautifully written.

We are all going to go through these similar journeys together, so let\u2019s be nice.\u201d What\u2019s he like as a dad? \u201cI\u2019m very lovey-dovey. I like to put her on my chest. She\u2019s the cutest little thing and I can\u2019t wait till I get to see her.\u201d When Allen was in his 20s, and better known as the boy in the Lily Allen song than for anything else, he was portrayed in the tabloids as a bit of a party animal, hanging out at music festivals and rolling out of clubs. Dating Ray Winstone\u2019s daughter Jaime \u2013 a fixture on the London social circuit \u2013 on and off for seven years probably didn\u2019t help.

It\u2019s a vanishingly rare occurrence to see something on screen and be unable to wrap your head around how it was achieved. But in <em>Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night</em>, Chinese writer/director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/02/chinese-arthouse-film-breaks-box-office-records-marketing-bi-gan-long-days-journey-into-night#maincontent\" title=\"\">Bi Gan</a>\u2019s transcendent memory trip of a movie, some kind of sorcery is at work. I have seen it twice and I am still at a loss to comprehend how Bi pulled off a 55-minute unbroken sequence shot, in 3D, which includes numerous locations, a game of ping pong, a fist fight, karaoke and several minutes in which the camera appears to actually fly. It\u2019s dazzling, baffling and staggeringly ambitious.</p> <p>Nodding to the languid, super-saturated mood sculptures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wongkarwai\" title=\"\">Wong Kar-Wai</a>, this is a picture which has the bones of a genre movie \u2013 there are knives, a shapeshifting femme fatale, a prickling sense of mystery \u2013 but which is constantly dissolving and reforming into something else. Like the water which is a recurring motif in a film which is as unrelentingly rainy as<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znmZoVkCjpI\" title=\"\"><em>Se7en</em></a>, the plot eddies and flows. The structure is more a mosaic of heady, half-dreamt memories than linear storytelling. As such, it is something of a head-scratcher, which shares nothing, beyond the title, with the play by Eugene O\u2019Neill.</p> <p>\u201cDo we know when we are dreaming?\u201d asks the central character, Luo Hongwu (Huang Jue), in a voiceover. The implication is that at least some of what we see on screen might have been dredged up from an unquiet night of sleep. Certainly, the boundaries between the conscious and the subconscious, the past and the present, the magic and the material seem to be porous.</p> <p>The heart of the story is Hongwu\u2019s search for a woman he once loved who said her name was Wan Qiwen. She is played by Tang Wei, who also appears as another character who may or may not be the same woman; likewise, Sylvia Chang, who also plays two separate characters, the second of whom may be the mother that left when Hongwu was a child.</p> <p>There is no hard and fast correct interpretation of the elliptical enigma of the story. Bi is more interested in creating a sensual experience, achieved through soaking each frame in floods of colour and then dripping in hints of an ethereal score which sounds like a long-lost relative of Kenji Kawai\u2019s theme for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/29/ghost-in-the-shell-review-scarlett-johansson-remake\" title=\"\"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em></a>.

But in Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night, Chinese writer/director Bi Gan\u2019s transcendent memory trip of a movie, some kind of sorcery is at work. I have seen it twice and I am still at a loss to comprehend how Bi pulled off a 55-minute unbroken sequence shot, in 3D, which includes numerous locations, a game of ping pong, a fist fight, karaoke and several minutes in which the camera appears to actually fly. It\u2019s dazzling, baffling and staggeringly ambitious. Nodding to the languid, super-saturated mood sculptures of Wong Kar-Wai, this is a picture which has the bones of a genre movie \u2013 there are knives, a shapeshifting femme fatale, a prickling sense of mystery \u2013 but which is constantly dissolving and reforming into something else. Like the water which is a recurring motif in a film which is as unrelentingly rainy as Se7en, the plot eddies and flows. The structure is more a mosaic of heady, half-dreamt memories than linear storytelling. As such, it is something of a head-scratcher, which shares nothing, beyond the title, with the play by Eugene O\u2019Neill. \u201cDo we know when we are dreaming?\u201d asks the central character, Luo Hongwu (Huang Jue), in a voiceover. The implication is that at least some of what we see on screen might have been dredged up from an unquiet night of sleep. Certainly, the boundaries between the conscious and the subconscious, the past and the present, the magic and the material seem to be porous. The heart of the story is Hongwu\u2019s search for a woman he once loved who said her name was Wan Qiwen. She is played by Tang Wei, who also appears as another character who may or may not be the same woman; likewise, Sylvia Chang, who also plays two separate characters, the second of whom may be the mother that left when Hongwu was a child. There is no hard and fast correct interpretation of the elliptical enigma of the story. Bi is more interested in creating a sensual experience, achieved through soaking each frame in floods of colour and then dripping in hints of an ethereal score which sounds like a long-lost relative of Kenji Kawai\u2019s theme for Ghost in the Shell. Appreciation depends on the audience\u2019s ability to let go and drift with the flow.",

      "body": "<p>Every time the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelrosen\" title=\"\">Michael Rosen</a> found out something new about what happened to his Jewish relatives during the Holocaust, he would send a round-robin email to his extended family. \u201cMy research brought me face to face with the destiny of Jews in Europe, seen through the prism of my own family.\u201d Suddenly, he could imagine the \u201cvery real\u201d journeys his relatives had taken, the places they\u2019d hidden, the fear and hope they\u2019d felt. \u201cBecause of the kind of person I am, I wanted to tell that story.\u201d</p> <p>The result is his latest book, <em>The Missing</em>, which will be published next week. A mixture of poetry and prose, it retraces Rosen\u2019s journey as he searches for information about his European relatives who went \u201cmissing\u201d before his birth in 1946.</p> <p>When I confess to him that reading it brought me to tears, he explains how he coped with the pain of writing it: \u201cAnybody who\u2019s a writer knows you have that moment of the encounter, whatever it is. And then when you write about it, to make it safe for yourself, there\u2019s a way in which you turn it into something else. It\u2019s very hard to describe, but I know about it in relation to the death of my son. If you write about it, you put it outside of yourself.\u201d</p> <p>His son, Eddie, died 17 years ago of meningitis, at the age of 18. Rosen thinks the effort of pouring feelings into words can be transformative. \u201cIt gives you the chance to be objective. You can read it as if you are another \u2013 as if it\u2019s not you who\u2019s written it, it\u2019s that bloke Michael Rosen.\u201d </p> <p>Rosen grew up in postwar Britain wondering about his missing relatives. He writes: \u201cStories hung in the air about French and Polish great-aunts and great-uncles, who were there before the war and weren\u2019t after. \u2018What happened?\u2019 I\u2019d ask. \u2018Don\u2019t know,\u2019 my family said.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They would have been full of hope for the future at the moment the Nazis arrived</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Nazis had two objectives, he points out: genocide of the Jews, and the destruction of Jewish culture and presence in Europe. The absence of any French or Polish cousins in his life had always been a painful reminder of this. \u201cIf, in our family, there was a \u2018nothing\u2019, then it felt as if that was almost a Nazi success. Even their names we were not 100% certain of, or where they lived.\u201d The Nazis had created a gap where people in his family should have been, \u201cand therefore they had won, not the war, but somehow over my family.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, he wondered, how could anyone \u2013 even the Nazis \u2013 successfully \u201cdisappear\u201d a human being? There must be traces: letters, photographs, diaries, documents, some kind of paper trail to follow. \u201cFrustratingly, for years, there wasn\u2019t. And so it became this kind of challenge.\u201d</p> <p>There were two aspects of the book he says he found very difficult to write. The first was his discovery, after some amazing detective work, that his paternal great-uncle Oscar and great-aunt Rachel had almost made it out of France in 1943. They missed the boat they planned to escape on by just a few days and were then captured in Nice \u2013 in fact, \u201cit could have been a matter of hours,\u201d Rosen says. \u201cIt was all so near, and so far.\u201d</p> <p>They would have been full of hope for the future at the moment the Nazis arrived. But instead of sailing to freedom, they were immediately deported to Auschwitz on a cattle-truck train. A moving poem in the book, <em>Dear Oscar</em>, explores what they must have gone through on that journey: \u201cDid you see in the dark / horror on Rachel\u2019s face? / Did she see horror on yours?\u201d</p> <p>Poetry like this appears within the book at key moments. Writing poems, Rosen says, helped him to reflect on what he was discovering and, most importantly, it allowed him to search for the feelings and memories that are missing from the factual documents he finds. \u201cIt opens up forms of empathy and emotion.\u201d </p> <p>The second piece of research Rosen found hard to write about was the report of his other paternal great-uncle Martin\u2019s arrest. Four French police officers, acting on instructions from the Nazis, describe how they entered their fellow Frenchman\u2019s house at 2.30am one wintry night and arrested him because, as they note down, he is a Jew. In a handwritten document, they state his appearance in officious detail: 162cm tall, brown eyes, oval face, straight nose. A scar on his left cheek. They even note down his meagre clothing: \u201cYellow cotton trousers, a grey cotton jacket, a Basque beret and low-heeled shoes.\u201d</p> <p>It was reading this description in the officer\u2019s own hand that distressed Rosen the most: \u201cThe humanness of it \u2013 that I found very difficult. The fact that they\u2019ve described what he\u2019s wearing, his height, even his shoes... it\u2019s the banality of evil that [philosopher and political theorist] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/01/totalitarianism-in-age-donald-trump-lessons-from-hannah-arendt-protests\" title=\"\">Hannah Arendt</a> talked about.\u201d He thought about the officers standing over his uncle, jotting all these details down for a report they were going to write up afterwards. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s, sort of, job done.\u201d</p> <p>Martin was handed over to the Nazis and, like his brother, sent to Auschwitz. Rosen thinks he would have been taken by surprise \u2013 the order to arrest Jews had gone out only a few days earlier and his uncle wouldn\u2019t have known about it. \u201cSeeing the vulnerability, the speed with which he was arrested\u2026 it went into [my] \u2018vulnerability river\u2019.\u201d He explains that ever since his son died he has been feeling more vulnerable in general and that writing the book fed this particular river of emotion.</p> <p>\u201cI do think about vulnerability differently since then.\u201d Eddie was his second son. Rosen, 73, who brings his third wife, Emma, to our interview, is now the father of five children and two stepchildren. He says that when he sees one of them fall over or get a cough, he becomes painfully aware of what they have been through and how vulnerable they feel. \u201cI have to do a little check inside myself\u2026 And then I have to make a little check back that all these people are still living, aren\u2019t they, and to remind myself that it\u2019s not that everybody\u2019s dead.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My family\u2019s life is utterly European. I\u2019d never fully sensed that before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His mother used to tell him that if the Nazis had invaded England, he\u2019d never have been born. Finding out what happened to his relatives demonstrated the truth of those words, he says, and made him realise that they were not just victims; they were also refugees.</p> <p>It has made him feel more European. \u201cIf you study history, as I have done, the way in which the narrative of Britain is told is that it\u2019s separate from Europe. But I guess my life and my family\u2019s life are utterly European. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019d fully sensed that before.\u201d</p> <p>He sees shadows of the way his family were treated by the Nazis in the way refugees and asylum seekers today are treated here and by Donald Trump. \u201cRounding up people, putting them into containments, imprisoning them, taking their papers away \u2013 all that is having resonance with me.\u201d</p> <p>Unusually, the book is aimed at children aged 10 and over, as well as adults. Rosen decided to write it that way after visiting a school where a pupil denied the Holocaust to his face. \u201cThis young man put up his hand and said: \u2018It didn\u2019t happen, did it?\u2019\u201d As the teacher panicked, Rosen remembers counting to three and patiently saying: \u201cWell, no, it did happen.\u201d</p> <p>Until then, Rosen (a former Children\u2019s Laureate and the son of two teachers) hadn\u2019t planned to write a book about his family at all. But after going into other schools to talk about the Holocaust, he realised he could explain what had happened to his relatives in a way that children could understand and engage with. \u201cI thought: this is a meaningful thing to do, this is valuable.\u201d Plus, he suspected children would be interested in reading about the mystery of his missing relatives \u2013 and how, by following \u201cthese tiny, separate bits of paper\u201d he had managed to find out what had happened to them. \u201cI do see myself as a storyteller and who do I tell stories to? Largely young people.\u201d</p> <p>It is important, he says, that people \u2013 particularly children \u2013 understand \u201chow these things happen in such banal and ordinary ways. It\u2019s the contrast between the ordinariness of my life, and how near this stuff is to it.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps, Rosen says, his book will inspire other people to tell their own stories. Perhaps one day, his own descendants will read it. And while nothing will ever fill the gap the Nazis created when they murdered Oscar, Rachel and Martin, writing the book has brought him closer to family members all over the world. \u201cI\u2019ve met with first and second cousins who were related to them. I\u2019ve put them back into the family. And that\u2019s very powerful.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/catalog/product/view/id/162751/s/the-missing-9781406386752/\">The Missing</a> is published on 2</em><em> January </em><em>by Walker Books at \u00a38.99; order from <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/catalog/product/view/id/162751/s/the-missing-9781406386752/\">guardianbookshop.com</a> for \u00a37.91.

Sometimes, on TV, they showed what concentration camps were like. They said that hundreds of thousands, probably millions, of people were killed in these camps. I used to lie in bed and think about this. It seemed horrifying. Awful. But I didn\u2019t really get it. Why did they put my great-aunts and great-uncles in these camps? And why did they kill them? And now they were gone. No way of finding out anything at all about them. They had just disappeared. We didn\u2019t even have any pictures of them. All that was left was my dad\u2019s shrug. The Absentees There are gaps, there are blanks, in the house of my life; there\u2019s a face, nothing more, something gone from my life. She was here, he was there, in the rooms of my life; there\u2019s a place for them both in the words of my life. Written for Holocaust Memorial Day, 2018",

      "bodyText": "Aaron Mooy pulled the strings for Brighton and rounded off a fine performance with a wonderful goal. Read on ... Eddie Howe speaks: \u201cNo complaints,\u201d says Bournemouth\u2019s manager in an interview with Sky Sports. \u201cI thought we took time to settle into the game. I thought for 10 minutes we took our time and conceded the goal. The second half was tough for us. We kept giving Brighton the ball and made life difficult for ourselves, especially when we went down to 10 men. The second half was very frustrating for us.\u201d Dan Burn: \u201cI\u2019m buzzing for Ali,\u201d Brighton\u2019s left-back says of his team\u2019s opening goalscorer in an interview with Sky Sports. \u201cHe\u2019s been grafting in training. I really wanted him to do well today and I\u2019m delighted he scored.\u201d On his disallowed goal: \u201cI was gutted,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s about the third time I\u2019ve been done by VAR. It was gutting, especially as I went for the knee-slide [celebration]. I think I was offside by an armpit hair or something stupid like that, but if it\u2019s offside it\u2019s offside and that\u2019s the way it is now.\u201d It was an entertaining game: With the exception of a 15-minute period at the end of the first half, Brighton dominated this game. Jahanbakhsh opened the scoring for them after three minutes, while Dan Burn thought he\u2019d doubled their lead in the second half, only to have his goal ruled out by VAR. The hawk-eyed killjoys spotted a fractional offside in the build-up. Having had that one chalked off, Brighton continued to boss their visitors and a Goal of the Month contender from Aaron Mooy in the 79th minute put the game beyond Bournemouth, who could finish today in the relegation zone if results elsewhere don\u2019t go their way. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It\u2019s a much deserved win for Brighton, who triumph courtesy of goals from Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Aaron Mooy. They move three points clear of Bournemouth into 13th place, five points clear of the drop zone. 90+3 min: Brighton\u2019s fans sing an homage to Graham Potter, who applauds them from his technical area. 90+2 min: Neal Maupay runs on to a pass from Murray and runs at the Bournemouth defence, who keep him at bay. 90+1 min: Glenn Murray brings a smart save out of Ramsdale, at his near post. If he\u2019d scored it wouldn\u2019t have counted as he was well offside as he ran in behind to pick up the through ball into the penalty area. 90 min: Brighton win a corner, but Lewis Dunk is penalised for a foul as the ball is sent into the Bournemouth penalty area. 89 min: Trossard picks out Glenn Murray on the edge of the Bournemouth penalty area, but he\u2019s crowded off the ball before he can unleash a shot. They were quiet earlier, but Brighton\u2019s fans are in full voice now. 88 min: Bournemouth keep plugging away, but this match looks beyond them at this stage. Brighton waste a few seconds with a substitution, with the lesser spotted Glenn Murray coming on for Yves Bissouma. 86 min: Bournemouth are now down to 10 men, as Eddie Howe has withdrawn the injured Jack Stacey. Moments before those changes, Neal Maupay had brought a save out of Aaron Ramsdale with a shot from distance. Brighton double substitution: Goalscorers Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Aaron Mooy make way for Steven Alzate and Dale Stephens. 80 min: Brighton score their second and it\u2019s no more than they deserve. Aaron Mooy has been man of the match for them so far and that was as good a goal as he\u2019ll ever score. Leandro Trossard was the provider with a splendid cross, but Mooy\u2019s finish had Alan Smith, the former Arsenal striker, purring in his role as Sky\u2019s co-commentator. He likens the Australian\u2019s finish to something out of Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s greatest hits. Aaron Mooy scores a beauty. He takes a cross from the left on his chest in the penalty area before cutting inside Chris Mepham with a wonderful touch and curling the ball inside the far post. That was a terrific goal. 77 min: Jack Stacey appears to have done himself a mischief and is limping, but remains on the field as Bournemouth have used all their subs. 75 min: There\u2019s a shout for handball as the ball appears to pop off the thigh of Jack Stacey and hit his hand in his own penalty area. VAR decrees that no penalty should be given. 74 min: Yves Bissouma scurries down the right side of the Bournemouth penalty area and wins his team a corner. Aaron Mooy\u2019s delivery is headed clear. 73 min: Bournemouth substitution: Lewis Cook replaces Josh King. 72 min: In the Bournemouth goal, Aaron Ramsdale hacks clear under pressure from Neal Maupay at the end of another promising Brighton attack. The former editor of the Racing Post speaks ... 68 min: Philip Billing is booked for some indiscretion or other, as Bournemouth remain under the cosh. They were dominating the game in the final 15 minutes of the first half, but it\u2019s Brighton who have been on top since the interval. 65 min: Bournemouth substitutions from a couple of minutes ago: Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson on for Harry Wilson and Junior Stanislas. 65 min: Moments previously, Aaron Mooy had gone close with a rasper that flashed wide of the post. 64 min: Yves Bissouma charges through the middle before unleashing a shot from the edge of the penalty area. It\u2019s a decent effort, which thumps the foot of the upright. Good stuff from Brighton. 62 min: While I\u2019d need to see a replay, I would hazard a guess that about seven or eight different players touched the ball after Aaron Mooy took that free-kick and before Dan Burn fired it past Aaron Ramsdale. The ridiculousness of VAR is showcased once again, as it turns out one of Brighton\u2019s players was fractionally offside as Aaron Mooy sent in his free-kick. We\u2019re talking a toenail, here. It remains Brighton 1-0 Bournemouth. VAR CHECK! It seems that one of Brighton\u2019s players may have been a millimetre offside as Mooy sent in his free-kick. VAR are checking it! Brighton double their lead. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but after a bout of head tennis and pinball in the Bournemouth boxin the wake of an Aaron Mooy free-kick, Dan Burn swivels and shoots into the bottom left-hand corner. 54 min: Dominic Solanke goes to ground in the Brighton penalty area after finding himself with the ball at his feet on the edge of the six-yard box only to be tackled by Lewis Dunk. A Brighton counter-attack is followed by one from Bournemouth and when play eventually breaks down it is - correctly, it seems - decided not to give Solanke a penalty for Dunk\u2019s earlier challenge. 51 min: It\u2019s been a scrappy opening to the second half, with both teams struggling to dominate. Neal Maupay wins a free-kick for Brighton after some dogged persistence. Aaron Mooy swings the ball into the penalty area and Bournemouth can only half clear. The ball finds it\u2019s way to Dunk on the right flank, but his cross is claimed confidently in the Corridor of Uncertainty by Aaron Ramsdale. 47 min: Brighton get forward with Leandro Trossard on the ball on the inside left channel. He passes to Dan Burn, who jinks this way and that, trying to cut inside but is dispossessed by Harry Wilson, who he subsequently fouls with an arm across the face in a fit of frustration. There\u2019s a VAR check to see if it merits a red card, but the officials monitoring the screens say none should be forthcoming. 46 min: Philip Billing wins the ball in midfield and leaves it for Ryan Gosling after running into his teammate. Play switches from the right side of the pitch to the left, where Martin Montoya wins the ball back for the hosts. 46 min: Play resumes at the Amex Stadium, with Bournemouth getting proceedings under way. There are no changes in personnel on either side. Peep! Scored in the third minute, Alireza Jahanbakhsh\u2019s first goal for Brighton separates the sides as they go in for the interval. Brighton roared out of the traps and notched an early lead, but as happens so often with them, failed to further capitalise on their dominance. After a poor first half-hour, Bournemouth have upped their game but have squandered several decent chances. It\u2019s nicely poised at the Amex Stadium. 45 min: The silence is broken with roars of encouragement as Mooy charges forward again, before playing the ball to Jahanbakhsh on his right. A promising attack breaks down quickly, but Brighton win themselves a throw-in. 44 min: The shouts of the players on the pitch are clearly audible, as Brighton fans, whose team are winning, sit in almost total silence. Best league in the world, eh? 40 min: Jack Stacey tries to cross towards the far post from the right side of the six-yard box, attempting to pick out Josh King. He ships a shove in the back and overhits his delivery, but doesn\u2019t win the penalty he perhaps deserved. More to the point, he should have shot himself from an angle that wasn\u2019t particularly tight, but was perhaps aware of his limitations as a right-back who hasn\u2019t scored too often in his career. 38 min: Much better from Bournemouth, who have gradually found their way into this game after a shaky start and are beginning to dominate. Junior Stanislas is teed up on the edge of the box and pulls the trigger, but fails to make clean contact with the ball and his weak shot into the ground is easily blocked. 36 min: Josh King is played in behind the Brighton defence down the inside left. He attempts to pull the ball back into the penalty area for Solanke or Wilson, but Lewis Dunk sticks out a leg and intercepts. 34 min: With Josh King on the ball, Bournemouth find themselves with a three-on-three as they gallop up the field on the counter after a mistake by Shane Duffy. King plays the ball to Harry Wilson, whose shot on goal is brilliantly blocked by Dan Burn. 31 min: Nervy defending from Sergio Rico and Aaron Ramsdale results in Aaron Mooy winning another corner for Brighton. He sends it deep, trying to pick out Lewis Dunk, but his delivery is a mite too high for the central defender to make anything more than glancing contact with the ball. 30 min: Good defending from Mepham, who cuts out an attempted cross from Aaron Mooy after neat build-up play from Lewis Dunk. Nothing comes from the ensuing corner, which concludes with Dunk firing high over the cross-bar. 28 min: Despite watching their team lead and dominate, the fans in the Amex Stadium seem rather subdued. The combined result of the biting cold and assorted Christmas excesses, perhaps. 27 min: continuing to boss midfield, Mooy plays the ball out wide to Jahanbakhsh on the right touchline as Brighton go forward again. His cross is cleared, but Brighton take possession again and continue to press forward. 25 min: A Bournemouth corner is arrowed towards Chris Mepham, who fails to win a clean header. Josh King tries to pick up the scraps and send another cross into the box, but Brighton deal with him and clear their lines. 24 min: Nothing comes of the free-kick and a subsequent Rico cross from the left fails to pick out Josh King, its intended target. Bournemouth are looking a mite out of sorts today. 23 min: Jahanbakhsh is lucky to avoid a booking for a similarly clumsy lunge on Dan Gosling. Free-kick for Bournemouth, wide on the left, a long way out. 22 min: Bournemouth skipper Steve Cook is penalised and booked for an unseemly lunge on Neal Maupay. 21 min: With one senior goal to his name in 57 appearances, Dominic Solanke tries to dribble his way past a defender into the Brighton penalty area, but is dispossessed. 20 min: Making his first start of the season after enduring a world of hamstring hell, Junior Stanislas gets on the ball and tries to create something on the fringes of the Brighton box, but runs down a blind alley and dribbles the ball out of play for a goal kick. 19 min: Mooy sends in an outswinger, which Lewis Dunk can only head straight up in the air. Ramsdale gathers confidently. 17 min: Mooy gets on the ball again with options to his right and left. Brighton surge forward again and win another corner as they continue to assert their authority. 16 min: Mooy sends the ball towards the far post and Aaron Ramsdale is indecisive in coming off his line to claim it. Bournemouth clear, albeit unconvincingly. 14 min: After a frenetic start, things have calmed down a bit, but Jahanbakhsh wins a free-kick wide on the right after a tangle of legs with Diego Rico. Aaron Mooy stands over it and will cross it into the Bournemouth penalty area. 12 min: Yves Bissouma wellies the ball downfield to clear his lines and Bournemouth take possession. Chris Mepham, Dan Gosling and Jack Stacey exchange passes as they try to move up the pitch. 11 min: Brighton continue to dominate, with Aaron Mooy pulling the strings in midfield. Neal Maupay fires another one over the bar after being put through by his Australian teammate. 9 min: That goal is likely to do wonders for Alireza Jahanbakhsh\u2019s confidence. It was a fine, assured strike from a player who has had a torrid time of it since moving to Brighton from AZ Alkmaar in 2018. 8 min: It\u2019s end to end stuff as Neal Maupay squanders a decent chance by firing high over the bar for Brighton. 7 min: Mat Ryan dives low to his left to save well from Josh King, who had got in behind the Brighton defence, but signalled his intention to shoot low and diagonally towards the far corner. It\u2019s been an extremely lively start. 5 min: Alireza Jahanbakhsh scores his first goal for Brighton at the 27th time of asking and he could scarcely be more pleased. Lewis Dunk took the ball out of defence and played it to Aaron Mooy, who charged forward. He played the ball into Neal Maupay in the bpenalty area, who held it up before pulling back towards Jahanbakhsh, who beat Aaron Ramsdale with a low drive into the corner from about 12 yards. Brighton lead! Alireza Jahanbakhsh opens the scoring for the hosts on his first start of the season. 2 min: Davy Propper gallops through midfield and plays the ball wide to Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who wins a corner for Brighton. Aaron Mooy swings the ball into the mixer, from where Bournemouth embark on a counter-attack. Nothing comes of it. 1 min: It\u2019s a bracing day on the south coast as Brighton get the ball rolling. Their players wear blue and white striped shirts, blue shorts and white socks. Bournemouth\u2019s wear red and black striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. Not long now: The teams line up in the tunnel of the well appointed Amex Stadium and are led out by Lewis Dunk and Steve Cook. Pul Tierney picks the match ball off the Premier League approved plinth and we\u2019re just a few handshakes and a coin-toss away from kick-off. Those teams: Lewis Dunk has clambered out of his sick bed and is one of seven changes made by Graham Potter. Martin Montoya, Yves Bissouma, Davy Propper, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Neal Maupay and Leandro Trossard also come in to the side. Bournemout boss Eddie Howe has also shaken things up in the quick turnaround between festive fixtures, with Diego Rico, Junior Stanislas, Philip Billing, Harry Wilson and Dominic Solanke all coming into his side. Brighton: Ryan, Montoya, Dunk, Duffy, Burn, Propper, Bissouma, Mooy, Jahanbakhsh, Maupay, Trossard. Subs: Stephens, Gross, Webster, Murray, Button, Bernardo, Alzate. Bournemouth: Ramsdale, Stacey, Steve Cook, Mepham, Rico, Stanislas, Gosling, Billing, Harry Wilson, King, Solanke. Subs: Boruc, Surman, Lerma, Callum Wilson, Lewis Cook, Fraser, Simpson. Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) Solly March and Jose Izquierdo are both sidelined with injury for Brighton, while Lewis Dunk missed their match against Tottenham with illness. Bournemouth\u2019s current list of the lame and halt is considerably longer, and Eddie Howe has had to plan for this game without Nathan Ake, Adam Smith, Arnaut Danjuma, Charlie Daniels, Lloyd Kelly and David Brooks. Simon Francis could return today after sitting out his side\u2019s game against Arsenal with bad bruising. The games continue to come thick and fast and today\u2019s festive action kicks off at the Amex Stadium, where Brighton host fellow seaside outfit Bournemouth. Brighton were perhaps a little unlucky to lose against Tottenham on Boxing Day, while Bournemouth shared the points with Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal. Locked together in 15th and 16th place, the two sides are level on points and goal difference, but with Brighton having the edge by dint of having scored two goals more. With both sides looking nervously over their shoulders, we\u2019ll find out what, if anything, gives between from 12.30pm (GMT). In the meantime, stay tuned for team news and build-up.",

From equal pay protests to spacewalks, here are 10 memorable moments from the year in patriarchy.</p> <h2>1 America waged war on abortion rights</h2> <p>Accessing a safe and legal abortion became a lot more fraught in the US this year as numerous conservative states attempted to implement so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/09/georgia-effective-abortion-ban-cruelty-anti-choice-movement\">\u201cheartbeat\u201d bills</a> that would effectively ban abortion.

While the kingdom has been taking small steps forward when it comes to women\u2019s rights, there\u2019s still an enormous way to go. To start with, it could <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/12/24/loujain-al-hathloul-torture-saudi-arabia/\">release the women\u2019s rights activists</a> who have been locked up for more than a year and who have been reportedly been tortured.</p> <h2>3 Cat lovers were vindicated by science</h2> <p>There is absolutely no basis to the \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d stereotype, according to a very important study done by <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/21/health/crazy-cat-lady-study-scli-intl/index.html\">researchers at University of California, Los Angeles</a>. Rumour has it that the research was paid for by big feline.</p> <h2>4 Astronauts completed first ever all-female spacewalk</h2> <p>The extraterrestrial expedition, which took place in October, was originally planned for March but had to be postponed due to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/mar/25/nasa-all-female-spacewalk-canceled-women-spacesuits\">wardrobe malfunction</a> \u2013 one of the spacesuits was too big. The giant leap for womankind took place almost 35 years after Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to do a spacewalk.</p> <h2>5 Iran allowed women into soccer stadiums for first time in decades</h2> <p>In October thousands of Iranian women watched their national soccer team play live after the country overturned a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/09/iranian-women-allowed-to-watch-football-at-stadium-for-first-time-in-decades\">decades-long ban</a> on women in stadiums. Unfortunately it took a tragedy for Fifa to shame Iran into this: a fan known as \u201cBlue Girl\u201d set herself on fire after she was jailed for trying to enter Tehran\u2019s Azadi stadium dressed as a man. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/iranian-female-football-fan-who-self-immolated-outside-court-dies\">died of her injuries</a>.</p> <h2>6 The Women\u2019s World Cup brought joy \u2013 and an equal pay discussion</h2> <p>The US women\u2019s soccer team broke records, won fans and became world champions over the summer. Perhaps most impressive of all, however, is the way in which they made the fight for equal pay in sport an urgent talking point and had crowds chanting \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/07/usa-megan-rapinoe-equal-pay-talks-womens-world-cup\">Equal pay!</a>\u201d in the stadiums.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c50750b932b286dfaa9269d8d20d7fcdd47360c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c50750b932b286dfaa9269d8d20d7fcdd47360c3/0_43_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winners: Megan Rapinoe celebrates with Alex Morgan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winners: Megan Rapinoe celebrates with Alex Morgan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7 Jeffrey Epstein killed himself</h2> <p>Or did he? <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-kill-himself-poll-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T\">Forty-five per cent of Americans</a>, including a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f406516-0c9e-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67\">Republican senator</a>, believe the billionaire sex offender, who was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell in August, was actually murdered. \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein_didn%27t_kill_himself\">Epstein didn\u2019t kill himself</a>\u201d was one of the year\u2019s most popular memes. There\u2019s no evidence to support these conspiracy theories, of course, but you can understand why they\u2019re so popular; Epstein was chummy with some of the world\u2019s most powerful men, and one imagines there are a lot of people who are relieved he\u2019s no longer around. But while Epstein may be dead, his associates aren\u2019t entirely off the hook \u2013 as Prince Andrew has very publicly discovered. Here\u2019s hoping in 2020 Epstein\u2019s victims will get justice.</p> <h2>8 Japanese women kicked off their heels</h2> <p>Sick of being obliged to wear high heels to work, campaigners in Japan launched a viral petition to get rid of the painful dress code. The campaign was quickly dubbed #KuToo, a reference to #MeToo and a play on words from the Japanese words for shoe (<em>kutsu</em>) and pain (<em>kutsuu</em>). Japan\u2019s health and labour minister made headlines when he unwisely responded to the petition by saying that heels are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/high-heels-at-work-are-necessary-says-japan-labour-minister\">necessary and appropriate</a>\u201d. Wear them yourself then, mate.</p> <h2>9 A Chilean anti-rape anthem swept the world</h2> <p><em>Un Violador en Tu Camino</em> \u2013 A Rapist in Your Path \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/06/chilean-anti-rape-anthem-becomes-international-feminist-phenomenon\">became a feminist anthem</a> after viral videos of Chilean protesters singing it in the streets. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not my fault / Nor where I was / Nor what I wore,\u201d one section of the song proclaims. \u201cThe rapist is you / It\u2019s the cops / The judges / The state / The president.\u201d</p> <h2>10 Witches went mainstream</h2> <p>2019 might have been the year women went \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/07/monsters-men-magic-trump-awoke-angry-feminist-witches\">full witch</a>\u201d and occultism became cool.

      "bodyText": "A young Sudanese woman, dressed in white, standing high above a crowd and demanding change. A fearless Lebanese woman drop-kicking an armed bodyguard in the groin amid anti-corruption protests in Beirut. A teenage girl from Sweden staring down Donald Trump at the UN climate summit. If there is an image that sums up 2019 it may well be a young woman protesting. As strongmen try to take over the world, women have been fighting back and making their voices heard. While it has been a year marked by political upheaval, there\u2019s also been a lot of light relief. We had Hot Girl Summer and Wagatha Christie. Lizzo\u2019s upbeat anthem Truth Hurts became the longest solo female rap No 1 in history. We got a gay Batwoman. And, thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow and her infinite Goopy wisdom, we spent a lot of time discussing whether you should put garlic up your vagina (spoiler: hell no). We also had a lot of firsts. Karen Uhlenbeck became the first woman to be awarded the Abel prize, mathematics\u2019 most prestigious award. Austria appointed its first female chancellor. Missy Elliott became the first female hip-hop artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Fiona Kolbinger became the first woman to win the Transcontinental, a grueling long-distance cycling race. Simone Biles became the most decorated gymnast in history. It\u2019s been a very, very, very long year. To help you look back on it, we\u2019re here with some of the highlights and lowlights. From equal pay protests to spacewalks, here are 10 memorable moments from the year in patriarchy. 1 America waged war on abortion rights Accessing a safe and legal abortion became a lot more fraught in the US this year as numerous conservative states attempted to implement so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills that would effectively ban abortion. While competition is close, Ohio probably wins scariest state of the year, with a bill requiring doctors to \u201creimplant an ectopic pregnancy\u201d, a medically impossible procedure, or be charged with \u201cabortion murder\u201d. 2020 will be another critical year for reproductive rights in America; Donald Trump has made it clear that pandering to anti-abortion extremists will be a core part of his re-election strategy. 2 Saudi Arabia let (some) women travel In a historic move, Saudi Arabia has relaxed archaic laws that required women to get the permission of a male guardian in order to travel. While the kingdom has been taking small steps forward when it comes to women\u2019s rights, there\u2019s still an enormous way to go. To start with, it could release the women\u2019s rights activists who have been locked up for more than a year and who have been reportedly been tortured. 3 Cat lovers were vindicated by science There is absolutely no basis to the \u201ccrazy cat lady\u201d stereotype, according to a very important study done by researchers at University of California, Los Angeles. Rumour has it that the research was paid for by big feline. 4 Astronauts completed first ever all-female spacewalk The extraterrestrial expedition, which took place in October, was originally planned for March but had to be postponed due to a wardrobe malfunction \u2013 one of the spacesuits was too big. The giant leap for womankind took place almost 35 years after Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to do a spacewalk. 5 Iran allowed women into soccer stadiums for first time in decades In October thousands of Iranian women watched their national soccer team play live after the country overturned a decades-long ban on women in stadiums. Unfortunately it took a tragedy for Fifa to shame Iran into this: a fan known as \u201cBlue Girl\u201d set herself on fire after she was jailed for trying to enter Tehran\u2019s Azadi stadium dressed as a man. She died of her injuries. 6 The Women\u2019s World Cup brought joy \u2013 and an equal pay discussion The US women\u2019s soccer team broke records, won fans and became world champions over the summer. Perhaps most impressive of all, however, is the way in which they made the fight for equal pay in sport an urgent talking point and had crowds chanting \u201cEqual pay!\u201d in the stadiums. 7 Jeffrey Epstein killed himself Or did he? Forty-five per cent of Americans, including a Republican senator, believe the billionaire sex offender, who was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell in August, was actually murdered. \u201cEpstein didn\u2019t kill himself\u201d was one of the year\u2019s most popular memes. There\u2019s no evidence to support these conspiracy theories, of course, but you can understand why they\u2019re so popular; Epstein was chummy with some of the world\u2019s most powerful men, and one imagines there are a lot of people who are relieved he\u2019s no longer around. But while Epstein may be dead, his associates aren\u2019t entirely off the hook \u2013 as Prince Andrew has very publicly discovered. Here\u2019s hoping in 2020 Epstein\u2019s victims will get justice. 8 Japanese women kicked off their heels Sick of being obliged to wear high heels to work, campaigners in Japan launched a viral petition to get rid of the painful dress code. The campaign was quickly dubbed #KuToo, a reference to #MeToo and a play on words from the Japanese words for shoe (kutsu) and pain (kutsuu). Japan\u2019s health and labour minister made headlines when he unwisely responded to the petition by saying that heels are \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d. Wear them yourself then, mate. 9 A Chilean anti-rape anthem swept the world Un Violador en Tu Camino \u2013 A Rapist in Your Path \u2013 became a feminist anthem after viral videos of Chilean protesters singing it in the streets. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not my fault / Nor where I was / Nor what I wore,\u201d one section of the song proclaims. \u201cThe rapist is you / It\u2019s the cops / The judges / The state / The president.\u201d 10 Witches went mainstream 2019 might have been the year women went \u201cfull witch\u201d and occultism became cool. The Democratic process proving slow and unwieldy, \u201cresistance witches\u201d turned to hexes and binding spells to try and get rid of Trump. Perhaps they are having an effect; the man has spent a large portion of the year screaming \u201cWITCH-HUNT\u201d. Hexes are one way to fight the patriarchy, journalism is another.

The leader of Britain First, Paul Golding, also claimed to have joined the Conservatives, though the party said his membership application had not been approved.

      "body": "<p>Wigan-born Kay Burley started out in journalism aged 17, reporting for her local newspaper. She joined TV-AM in 1985 before being poached by Sky News ahead of the channel\u2019s 1989 launch. Now 59, she hosts <em>Kay Burley@Breakfast </em>(Sky News, Monday to Thursday) and has become known for her no-holds-barred political interviews.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s been a busy year in politics. Enjoyed it?</strong><br>It\u2019s been a rollercoaster ride, and I\u2019ve had to buckle up at times, but I\u2019ve enjoyed every second. I started the year with an afternoon show and ended it by grilling politicians for breakfast.</p> <p><strong>You went viral when you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/a-week-in-uk-politics\" title=\"\">\u201cempty-chaired\u201d Conservative </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/a-week-in-uk-politics\" title=\"\">party chairman James Cleverly</a>. Was your speech </strong><strong>planned?</strong><br>No, it was spur of the moment. We expected him to turn up until the very last minute and I had my list of questions ready, so I thought I\u2019d tell viewers what I would\u2019ve asked. James is a decent bloke, one of the good guys. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have lunch in the new year and all will be fine, but tensions run high during an election campaign.</p> <p><strong>You said it was \u201ctime to stand up for ourselves here at Sky\u201d. Do you think you get poorly treated?</strong><br>We\u2019ve spent 30 years being an overnight success. We\u2019re still the new kids on the block. When we launched, Bernard Ingham [Margaret Thatcher\u2019s chief press secretary] took our then-political editor Adam Boulton aside and said: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re a broadcaster on equal footing to the BBC and ITV, so that\u2019s how I\u2019ll treat you.\u201d That\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes we have to fight our corner.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve had some ding-dongs with Rebecca Long-Bailey. Do you think she\u2019ll become Labour leader?</strong><br>No idea. I hope it\u2019s a woman, obviously, but whoever it is, I\u2019ll very happily spar with them, then have a drink with them afterwards.</p> <p><strong>Which politicians are hardest to land a punch on?</strong><br>I don\u2019t think any of the current generation are as challenging as the last. Lord Heseltine was the toughest of all time. He\u2019d always give you a one-word answer at the start of the interview, so you couldn\u2019t get into your groove. You were on the back foot after that. He was really tricky.</p> <p><strong>Who do you get on best with when the cameras stop rolling?</strong><br>I like Chris Bryant, Jeremy Hunt, Yvette Cooper, Harriet Harman\u2026 lots of them. Politicians don\u2019t have two heads, believe it or not. They\u2019re not ogres.</p> <p><strong>During this election campaign </strong><strong>the media </strong><strong>were accused of bias and fake news. How does that affect your job?</strong><br>Politicians have got to have their feet held to the flame. Chris Bryant said last week: \u201cPoliticians complaining about the media are like fishermen complaining about the sea. Their entire job is to navigate choppy waters.\u201d That\u2019s true. We have to make the waters as choppy as possible.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/24/bbc-political-editor-given-bodyguard-for-labour-conference\" title=\"\">attacks on BBC </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/24/bbc-political-editor-given-bodyguard-for-labour-conference\" title=\"\">News and Laura Kuenssberg</a> in particular?</strong><br>Bloody outrageous. The BBC is a very balanced news organisation and I\u2019m honoured to count Laura as a friend. Channel 4 News are doing a great job. Piers Morgan is spectacular, to the extent where he\u2019s just been offered a new two-year contract. It\u2019s easy to pick on us individually, but I use the quote: \u201cFirst they came for the journalists and I did nothing. I don\u2019t know what happened after that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve been accused of bias by both sides. Is that a sign you\u2019re doing something right?</strong><br>Definitely. In the 2015 election, both sides offered me a cabinet position and a safe seat, so neither know how I vote. I wasn\u2019t tempted. God no. I\u2019m a journalist, down and dirty with the hacks. I\u2019m not interested in being a poacher turned gamekeeper.</p> <p><strong>How did your no-nonsense style develop?</strong><br>I\u2019ve always been something of a Wigan street-fighter. Always tried to prove myself, always had sharp elbows. That\u2019s served me well as I\u2019ve come up through the ranks. Am I combative? Only when I need to be.I get paid a good salary to ask the hard questions that people at home would want answered.</p> <p><strong>Was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson running scared of Andrew Neil</a> by refusing to do an interview?</strong><br>Obviously he was, because Andrew Neil is a sensational interviewer. If I was advising Boris, I\u2019d have said to him: \u201cDo not go in front of Andrew Neil whatever you do.\u201d But as a journalist, a viewer and a voter, I want to hear what Boris Johnson thinks. If they\u2019re running scared, it says more about them than our interviewing technique.</p> <p><strong>Who is your dream interview?</strong><br>Barack Obama. I\u2019d ask what he thinks about his legacy in the form of Donald Trump. I interviewed Hillary Clinton in Washington and talk about being well prepared. When we shook hands, she asked: \u201cHow\u2019s Alexander?\u201d She knew my son\u2019s name, knew about the horrible weather in London \u2013 she\u2019d really done her research. It\u2019s impressive and disarming. Trump is more scattergun in his approach but very charming. When you meet him in person, he\u2019s got that charisma Blair and Clinton had. But he\u2019s not one for the details, shall we say.</p> <p><strong>You get up at 4am. What does that do to your mind and body?</strong><br>As you get older, you don\u2019t need as much sleep. It\u2019s actually easier now than when I was in my 20s working for TV-AM.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re scheduled against Piers Morgan on ITV. Who\u2019s winning that fight?</strong><br>We see it more as friendly fisticuffs than a proper fight. There\u2019s also Susanna Reid who I love and on the BBC, Louise Minchin and Naga Munchetty. Rather than being hostile, we look out for each other. We\u2019re the 4 O\u2019Clock Club.

      "bodyText": "Wigan-born Kay Burley started out in journalism aged 17, reporting for her local newspaper. She joined TV-AM in 1985 before being poached by Sky News ahead of the channel\u2019s 1989 launch. Now 59, she hosts Kay Burley@Breakfast (Sky News, Monday to Thursday) and has become known for her no-holds-barred political interviews. It\u2019s been a busy year in politics. Enjoyed it? It\u2019s been a rollercoaster ride, and I\u2019ve had to buckle up at times, but I\u2019ve enjoyed every second. I started the year with an afternoon show and ended it by grilling politicians for breakfast. You went viral when you \u201cempty-chaired\u201d Conservative party chairman James Cleverly. Was your speech planned? No, it was spur of the moment. We expected him to turn up until the very last minute and I had my list of questions ready, so I thought I\u2019d tell viewers what I would\u2019ve asked. James is a decent bloke, one of the good guys. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have lunch in the new year and all will be fine, but tensions run high during an election campaign. You said it was \u201ctime to stand up for ourselves here at Sky\u201d. Do you think you get poorly treated? We\u2019ve spent 30 years being an overnight success. We\u2019re still the new kids on the block. When we launched, Bernard Ingham [Margaret Thatcher\u2019s chief press secretary] took our then-political editor Adam Boulton aside and said: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re a broadcaster on equal footing to the BBC and ITV, so that\u2019s how I\u2019ll treat you.\u201d That\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes we have to fight our corner. You\u2019ve had some ding-dongs with Rebecca Long-Bailey. Do you think she\u2019ll become Labour leader? No idea. I hope it\u2019s a woman, obviously, but whoever it is, I\u2019ll very happily spar with them, then have a drink with them afterwards. Which politicians are hardest to land a punch on? I don\u2019t think any of the current generation are as challenging as the last. Lord Heseltine was the toughest of all time. He\u2019d always give you a one-word answer at the start of the interview, so you couldn\u2019t get into your groove. You were on the back foot after that. He was really tricky. Who do you get on best with when the cameras stop rolling? I like Chris Bryant, Jeremy Hunt, Yvette Cooper, Harriet Harman\u2026 lots of them. Politicians don\u2019t have two heads, believe it or not. They\u2019re not ogres. During this election campaign the media were accused of bias and fake news. How does that affect your job? Politicians have got to have their feet held to the flame. Chris Bryant said last week: \u201cPoliticians complaining about the media are like fishermen complaining about the sea. Their entire job is to navigate choppy waters.\u201d That\u2019s true. We have to make the waters as choppy as possible. What do you make of the attacks on BBC News and Laura Kuenssberg in particular? Bloody outrageous. The BBC is a very balanced news organisation and I\u2019m honoured to count Laura as a friend. Channel 4 News are doing a great job. Piers Morgan is spectacular, to the extent where he\u2019s just been offered a new two-year contract. It\u2019s easy to pick on us individually, but I use the quote: \u201cFirst they came for the journalists and I did nothing. I don\u2019t know what happened after that.\u201d You\u2019ve been accused of bias by both sides. Is that a sign you\u2019re doing something right? Definitely. In the 2015 election, both sides offered me a cabinet position and a safe seat, so neither know how I vote. I wasn\u2019t tempted. God no. I\u2019m a journalist, down and dirty with the hacks. I\u2019m not interested in being a poacher turned gamekeeper. How did your no-nonsense style develop? I\u2019ve always been something of a Wigan street-fighter. Always tried to prove myself, always had sharp elbows. That\u2019s served me well as I\u2019ve come up through the ranks. Am I combative? Only when I need to be.I get paid a good salary to ask the hard questions that people at home would want answered. Was Boris Johnson running scared of Andrew Neil by refusing to do an interview? Obviously he was, because Andrew Neil is a sensational interviewer. If I was advising Boris, I\u2019d have said to him: \u201cDo not go in front of Andrew Neil whatever you do.\u201d But as a journalist, a viewer and a voter, I want to hear what Boris Johnson thinks. If they\u2019re running scared, it says more about them than our interviewing technique. Who is your dream interview? Barack Obama. I\u2019d ask what he thinks about his legacy in the form of Donald Trump. I interviewed Hillary Clinton in Washington and talk about being well prepared. When we shook hands, she asked: \u201cHow\u2019s Alexander?\u201d She knew my son\u2019s name, knew about the horrible weather in London \u2013 she\u2019d really done her research. It\u2019s impressive and disarming. Trump is more scattergun in his approach but very charming. When you meet him in person, he\u2019s got that charisma Blair and Clinton had. But he\u2019s not one for the details, shall we say. You get up at 4am. What does that do to your mind and body? As you get older, you don\u2019t need as much sleep. It\u2019s actually easier now than when I was in my 20s working for TV-AM. You\u2019re scheduled against Piers Morgan on ITV. Who\u2019s winning that fight? We see it more as friendly fisticuffs than a proper fight. There\u2019s also Susanna Reid who I love and on the BBC, Louise Minchin and Naga Munchetty. Rather than being hostile, we look out for each other. We\u2019re the 4 O\u2019Clock Club. We all got together last week at Piers\u2019s Christmas party, shared war stories and compared how tired we were. It says on your Twitter profile that you\u2019ve done \u201cmore live TV than anyone else\u201d. Is that official? It is. Guinness World Records are looking at it as we speak. I\u2019ve done between three and 23 hours per day, depending on the story, for years. More than a million minutes. What are you proudest of?

Australia-based Lion Little World Beverages is a wholly owned subsidiary of Japanese beverage giant Kirin, which owns a little over half of both Myanmar Brewery and Mandalay Brewery in partnership with Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL), a conglomerate of the Myanmar military. The business partnership with Kirin provides not only much-needed foreign currency for the isolated Myanmar military \u2013 which is subjected to global arms embargoes \u2013 but also, crucially, is a source of international legitimacy. Kirin was named in a United Nations Fact-Finding Mission report as having donated money to the Myanmar military \u2013 known as the Tatmadaw.

Suu Kyi acknowledged in court there may have been some war crimes or crimes against humanity but insisted they did not rise to the level of genocide.

That re-evaluation will begin next month. Eddington and Dwyer could not be reached for comment. In a statement to Nikkei, Kirin said that \u201crespect for human rights is fundamental to all of its business activities\u201d and that it was taking steps to protect human rights in its operations. \u201cIn Myanmar, we will continue to actively work with MEHL, our joint-venture partner, to improve transparency and governance, reduce negative risks including human rights, and have a positive impact on Myanmar\u2019s society and economy.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Even in our disputatious world, most people can probably agree that 2019 has been a bumpy ride. Is anyone offering odds on 2020 being better? If they are, that\u2019s not a bet I\u2019d care to make. I am, however, prepared to lay 5-9 that Sheffield Crucible\u2019s new production of <a href=\"https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/events/guys-and-dolls\" title=\"\"><strong>Guys and Dolls</strong></a><strong> </strong>will go down as a classic of its kind. Directed by the theatre\u2019s artistic director, Robert Hastie, with new musical arrangements by Will Stuart and choreography by Matt Flint, this is a near-perfect presentation of the 1950 show that has been described as the \u201cperfect musical comedy\u201d, its winning combination being the stories of Damon Runyon, translated to stage by Abe Burrows and Jo Swerling combined, with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser.</p> <p>The action is located at a crossroads between vice and virtue. Janet Bird\u2019s scaffold-style, mobile set evokes the sharp angles and fast pace of 1920s and 30s Broadway, where Martin Marquez\u2019s fretting, furrow-browed, \u201cno-good nick\u201d, Nathan Detroit, is desperately seeking a venue for an illegal dice game. Meanwhile, nightclub singer Miss Adelaide longs for Nathan, her fiance of 14 years, to stop \u201cstalling and stalling the wedding trip\u201d and so cure her psychosomatic cold and \u201cgrippe\u201d. Natalie Casey is a priceless Adelaide, switchbacking between pouting vamp and hilariously demented gerbil. Sister Sarah of the Save-a-Soul Mission walks the streets, looking for souls to save so as to save her mission. Alex Young\u2019s Sarah has a sideways slide of the eye that suggests her laces are not as strait as might be supposed \u2013 an impression confirmed when she is introduced to Cuba, rum and fun by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/07/crims-bbc3-prison-sitcom-on-set-interview\" title=\"\">Kadiff Kirwan</a>\u2019s super-cool Sky Masterson, the gambler who, by winning a bet, loses his heart.</p> <p>These four may lead the action, but in Hastie\u2019s 22-strong cast there are no minor performances. Every character is a major player, and when they all come together in the big numbers \u2013 especially a brilliantly reworked Sit Down, You\u2019re Rockin\u2019 the Boat, led by TJ Lloyd\u2019s very, very Nicely Nicely Johnson \u2013 the effect is devilishly heavenly.</p> <p>By contrast, Mike Bartlett\u2019s <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/snowflake/\" title=\"\"><strong>Snowflake</strong></a>, first performed last year, is something of a downer. The entire first half is taken up by a lengthy, expository monologue. We are in Oxfordshire in 2019 (the script has been updated). Andy is rehearsing a reunion with his daughter Maya who, having left home abruptly in 2016, three years after her mother\u2019s death, has not been in contact since. Andy has reason to hope she might be back for Christmas, and has hired and decorated the village hall to welcome her. Elliot Levey\u2019s performance is well-paced and vivid, but I still felt I was watching a mashup of standup comedy, radio drama and creative-writing exercise, with plot points wedged into riffs on Andy\u2019s Victor Meldrew-ish views: on dating, customer service, his colleagues at the museum where he works, and on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/30/students-arent-snowflakes-right-grow-up-spectator\" title=\"\">younger generation\u2019s snowflake attitudes</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3962d505fed5e1b2566cf80dcc4c164b2b758510\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3962d505fed5e1b2566cf80dcc4c164b2b758510/0_46_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snowflake @ Kiln Theatre Amber James (Natalie), Elliot Levey (Andy).

Fortunately, Amber James\u2019s thoroughly intelligent performance imbues the character with depth, conveying an impression that Natalie thinks and feels much more than she lets on, as when she counters Andy\u2019s \u201cAll fathers love their daughters\u201d with \u201cActually, a vast lot don\u2019t\u201d.</p> <p>We are more than halfway through the evening before the writing lets the characters grow into something more than mouthpieces.

      "bodyText": "Domestic violence kills 15 times as many people in Britain as terrorism, say campaigners who want the police to be given more money to tackle the problem. The huge disparity is highlighted in figures obtained from official sources by victims\u2019 rights campaigners, who say the police budget for combating domestic violence must be ringfenced, as it is for terrorism. Official figures show there were 1,870 domestic murders in England and Wales between 2000 and 2018, compared with 126 that were terrorism-related. The vast majority of domestic murder victims were women. In addition, campaigners say an estimated 400 victims of domestic violence a year take their own lives. \u201cExpenditure on the prevention and detection of domestic violence must be hugely increased now,\u201d said Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman. \u201cIt is shocking and a disgrace that since 2000 over 6,000 \u2013 predominantly women \u2013 have either been murdered or have taken their own lives following domestic abuse.\u201d Police forces do not reveal how much they spend on tackling domestic violence. But campaigners say it has been cut in recent years. The intelligence and security agencies, charged with combating terrorism have an annual budget of \u00a32.6bn. \u201cSpending on fighting terrorism has been ringfenced whilst money for women\u2019s support services and for the police has been cut,\u201d said Saville Roberts. \u201cFifteen times more [people] have been murdered by partners than have lost their lives because of terrorism. It is right that funds for counter terrorism are not cut, but the budget for domestic abuse must increase and be protected as a matter of priority for the next government.\u201d The call comes amid mounting concern that domestic violence is increasing. Demand for women\u2019s abuse support services rose by 83% in the 10 years up to 2017 while funding fell by almost 50%. The government estimates that domestic violence costs the UK \u00a366bn annually. On average the police receive an emergency call relating to domestic abuse every 30 seconds. Domestic abuse offences in London rose by 63% between 2011 and 2018, according to figures collated by the mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime. At the same time, prosecutions are falling. Domestic-abuse related cases referred to prosecutors for consideration for charge fell 11% last year despite a surge in the number of crimes recorded by police. Thousands of alleged perpetrators remain at large, according to campaigners. \u201cPolice funding and support services for victims of domestic abuse have been severely cut since 2010,\u201d said Harry Fletcher, spokesman for the Victims Rights Campaign. \u201cOver the last 18 years 126 people have been killed by terror in England and Wales whilst over 1,800 mainly women have been killed by partners. This is outrageous. \u201cIt is essential that the new government gives priority to preventing and investigating domestic abuse. Budgets must be protected and ringfenced in the future. The police must be given the resources to find and prosecute the thousands of alleged perpetrators who are at large in the community on the police wanted list.\u201d",

Just days after the minister Darren Chester broke ranks and joined Labor calls for volunteer firefighters to be paid, the prime minister announced eligible volunteers would receive $300 a day up to $6,000 if called out for more than 10 days this fire season. Scott Morrison had previously resisted the idea of paying volunteers, at first calling it a distraction before saying it was the domain of the states and something that would be examined in conjunction with state and fire authority leaders after the crisis had passed. Despite growing community unrest over the amount of paid work volunteers were being forced to give up in order to continue tackling the wildfire emergency, Morrison said the announcement was not about paying volunteers but \u201csustaining volunteer effort\u201d and came as a result of a direct request and consultation with fire chiefs and the NSW government.

I don\u2019t know about you, but I have trouble remembering what day it is. I had a half-hour debate with one of my sons earlier on regarding this very subject. He was convinced it\u2019s Thursday (still is) but after giving it serious thought, I settled on it being Saturday. All day, as my mother would say. Enough digression. The <strong>Boxing Day Test</strong> is continuing at the MCG, we have two <strong>A-League</strong> games today and a Sydney derby in the <strong>Big Bash League</strong>. Plenty else on too, no doubt. Hang around. It\u2019ll be fun.

      "bodyText": "A dramatic ending to Sportwatch tonight. They rarely fail to deliver, the Sydney Smashes, and it\u2019s the Sixers who emerge, pretty in pink, against the Thunder. A blistering start had the Thunder in command, before a run of wickets saw the previously undefeated side pull up a little short total-wise, posting just 149, despite another Ferguson half-century. The Sixers in contrast started slowly, before Dan Hughes and Moises Henriques got things moving. Their respective departures left it all to be done - before enter Tom Curran. 12 off his first three deliveries faced to set up a blockbuster super over finish. He then turned round and got it done with the ball as well - seeing the Sixers home by just one run, despite Alex Hales late heroics. A thriller in Sydney. 34,000+ going home happy. Even those in green couldn\u2019t fault that game for drama. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! They\u2019ve been in their share of super overs throughout the Big Bash, but they don\u2019t win too many, the Sixers. They have this time though! And it\u2019s a hugely relieved Moises Henriques chatting post-game. \u201cWe almost batted ourselves out of the contest, but thanks to TC (Curran) - five out of six yorkers at the death, that\u2019s why they pay him the big bucks.\u201d It\u2019s the final ball, and Curran jams it in full and wide. Hales gets bat on it and it races away, but he can only get four. They\u2019ve won it at the death, in a super over - the Sydney Sixers. Take a bow, Tom Curran - he\u2019s done it with the bat, and now he\u2019s done it with the ball! 2/16 beats 0/15. Hales brave with 11* off 3. But the early singles proving too costly. Big Bash Super Over: Thunder 0/11 (0.5), Khawaja 4*, Hales 7* And it is the experienced Usman Khawaja who gets the nod from the Thunder, to open with Hales at the other end. Curran waits at the top of his mark, ball in hand. First delivery. Khawaja shuffles across and thumps through cover for two. The opener tries the ramp, but they only get one. What can Hales come up with. Curran jams in at the toes - they push for two, but Hales slips, and they only get one! Four off the first three balls. It\u2019s not enough. Thirteen off three needed. Blockhole again - and Khawaja can only manage one! It\u2019s two sixes or game over. And Hales duly delivers the first! Curran gets it up there, but it\u2019s just on the volley, and he crashes it back over the Englishman\u2019s head for six!! And while we wait for the deliberations from both sides, how\u2019s this from the late fixture of the W-League: So - another conference. Who to bowl? Who to bat? Sixers put up Tom Curran once again. But who will face him? Perhaps the skipper Ferguson puts himself in, with the master-blaster Hales? Big Bash Super Over: Sixers 1/16 (1), Henriques 14*, Hughes 1* Can you believe that! First ball, there\u2019s a feather edge and Curran is gone, caught behind!! In comes Dan Hughes. The most auspicious of starts for the Thunder - and the man who single-handedly got the Sixers back in the contest goes for a duck. It\u2019s a wide second up, before a single from Hughes. Here\u2019s Henriques - and first ball is a ramp for four! He then gets two. And next ball - it\u2019s a reverse-ramp six!! He catches the back of the bat, and it\u2019s flown for six. Did he mean that?! Almost certainly not. It was Maxwell-esque! Morris shakes his head and offers a wry smile. The Sixers close it with a wild scamper. Add in overthrows - and they\u2019ve got themselves to 16. My, oh my. What a dramatic end to this Sydney Smash! They rarely fail. Now Callum Ferguson has to decide who will bowl the super over. He confers with Usman Khawaja. The bowling coach Shane Bond gathers his quicks to talk tactics. After 20 overs a piece, it all comes down to these six balls each. Who bats for the Sixers - presumably Curran and Henriques? It\u2019s Chris Morris with the ball for the Thunder - and Curran and Henriques with the bat for the Sixers. Big Bash: Sixers 7/149 (20), Dwarshuis 2*, Curran 35 It\u2019s Tremain with the last over - first ball, and Curran thumps it for six!! They need 10 off five - but the next one is a dot, Curran plays and misses. Good bowling from Tremain who gets it in the blockhole, but they scramble for two, with all the fielders deep. Eight off three needed. Dwarshuis runs like the wind, they get two again. Then Curran jams out an attempted yorker - and it races to the boundary!! Two more off the last ball needed. Curran sweeps it - they race for two, but they don\u2019t make it back!! Ties are scored. We are going to a super over. Big Bash: Sixers 6/134 (19), Dwarshuis 2*, Curran 20* Curran smashes the first ball to the boundary. Morris slams in an ugly one, Curran gets it on the toe of the bat, and Ferguson climbs for the catch - but it trickles out of the hand! That could have been spectacular. Big let off for the Sixers. Dwarshuis swings at a few, but he\u2019s not the man the Sixers want on strike at this stage, as he trickles through for one. An LBW appeal on Curran - not out! Morris bowls well at the death, at Curran gets just the one off the last. Was that the over that wins it for the Thunder? 16 needed to win the Sydney Smash in front of 34,000. Big Bash: Sixers 6/127 (18), Dwarshuis 1*, Curran 14* In comes the left-handed Dwarshuis, and he gets off the mark with a single. Good delivery from Sams cramps Curran in the crease, but they scurry for two. It\u2019s a lovely slower ball wide for a crucial dot ball, and then just a single. Great death bowling - just five off it, but the crucial wicket of Henriques as well. 23 from 12 the runs needed now. Big Bash: Wicket! Sixers 6/122 (17.1), Henriques 44 Henriques looks to go after Sams first ball - but he holes out! It\u2019s a tricky catch in the deep as Ferguson almost loses it in the lights. What a terrific catch in the context - and the skipper goes! What a response from the Thunder. Big Bash: Sixers 5/122 (17), Henriques 41*, Curran 12* Wicket! Edwards looks to go big, but he holes out in the deep. A fine catch from Chris Green, who picks that one out of the lines. Edwards goes for 17. Did the batsmen cross? The umpires say no, and send Henriques to the non-strikers end. Morris lobs a floater outside off and Curran crashes that for four. Then he clips it off his toes for four! A touch of inside edge - that\u2019s very hard on the bowler. And then he smashes him through cover! 12 off three balls - has Tom Curran just turned this contest?! 28 off 18 the equation now. Big Bash: Sixers 4/108 (16), Henriques 40*, Edwards 17* Henriques looks to go after Cook, but he can\u2019t get hold of him cleanly. A big miss off a full toss, before a brace of dot balls late in the over. He finishes with figures of 1/18 off four, Cook. Throw in that first over wicket and that\u2019s a terrific contribution from the spinner. The equation moves to 41 off 24. They need a big over here, the Sixers. Big Bash: Sixers 4/104 (15), Henriques 36*, Edwards 16* So, WinViz had the Thunder at 60% likely winners - I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s that clear cut, especially with Henriques still lurking with intent. Edwards slashes one through cover for four, but it\u2019s singles everywhere else. The skipper tries the lap-shot on the last ball, but he retains the strike. Big Bash: Sixers 4/89 (13), Henriques 31*, Edwards 6* Let\u2019s stay with the Sydney Smash now for the remainder of Sportwatch, as we get to the business end of this one. This is some scratchy stuff from the Sixers, as Henriques calls the tactical timeout with his young colleague, Edwards. 61 off 42 is the equation. Still very gettable, but you\u2019d imagine if the Thunder can get Henriques this could get very interesting, very quickly. Big Bash: Wicket! Sixers 4/72 (10), Henriques 21*, Silk 2 And could that be decisive?! That\u2019s terrific fielding from Green - Silk hits it nicely looking to roll for two, but the fielder flies in from the rope and hits the stumps clean - and he\u2019s run out! The skipper\u2019s still there, but Dan Hughes\u2019 nothing play against the spinner has turned this contest right around. They only need about 80 off the final ten overs - it\u2019s still very gettable, but not if the wickets keep falling! Big Bash: Sixers 2/57 (8), Hughes 36*, Henriques 10* Morris picks up the opener Philippe for what feels a sluggish 11 off 17, bringing the skipper to the crease. Dan Hughes at the other end looking very tidy though - no sixes but six fours as he strikes at over 150. It\u2019s been a controlled innings so far - can he be the man for the Sixers? 90 + 5 min: Jay O\u2019Shea twists and turns and works a cross into the box - but it\u2019s headed over. Thurgate again sprints clear - he\u2019s one-on-one, but this time Young makes up the ground and gets there first. There\u2019s the whistle, and in a game both sides desperately needed to win, neither has. A-League - 90 + 3 min: And now at the other end, it\u2019s Moss saving from the former Jet O\u2019Donovan. It was a tepid encounter early on, but this has really come alive - what a dramatic last 5-10 minutes we\u2019ve seen! Brisbane with back-to-back corners, can they capitalise here? A-League - 89 min: This is great pressure from Newcastle. Petratos wins a corner after superb energy. Miller recycles a ball back into the box and Ben Kantarovski rises highest - he fires a header goalwards.. but the giant paw of Young keeps it out! That\u2019s a superb save from the Brisbane \u2018keeper! A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 1-1 Brisbane Roar (Inman) 87 min: And right on cue, that\u2019s a belter from Brisbane! He swivels on the edge of the box, Brad Inman, and swings the right boot through it sweetly, and that fires past Moss and down off the crossbar. They\u2019re back level - we\u2019ve got a blockbuster finish in Newcastle all of a sudden! A-League - 86 min: Matt Miller does well in defence as Inman again looked the X-factor for the Roar. They have to be careful not to drop too deep and invite Brisbane back into the contest. Big Bash: Sixers 1/22 (4), Philippe 9*, Hughes 13* It\u2019s hardly the blistering start we saw from the Thunder, but it\u2019s steady enough stuff from the Sixers after that disappointing first over. Hughes finds the boundary off Tremain and looks to be the one to make things happening here for the cross-town rivals. A-League - 79 min: It\u2019s an error at the back and Thurgate is clean through one-on-one with the Roar \u2018keeper Young. Who saves! It\u2019s a strong hand from the experienced custodian, but you have to say the youngster\u2019s butchered that. They should have clinched it there, the Jets! A-League - 73 min: And finally, the face on the bench everyone was expecting, as former fan favourite, Roy \u201cthe boy\u201d O\u2019Donovan comes on for Brisbane Roar. A few boos from the crowd, Amadi-Holloway trots to the sideline. Didn\u2019t he write some chapters in the famous blue and red of Newcastle, the well-travelled Irishman. The home fans will be hoping he doesn\u2019t have another narrative handy today. Big Bash: Wicket! Sixers 1/2 (1), Kerr 0, Philippe 1* A dream first over from Jono Cook who dismisses the opener Kerr for a duck, after three consecutive dot balls. As run chases go, it\u2019s not the most auspicious of starts for the Sixers, but there\u2019s still plenty of balls to face and not an insurmountable total to run down. A-League - 68 min: Topor-Stanley with a key near-post intervention after second-half substitute Inman does well down the left. Amadi-Holloway can\u2019t quite find the finish, but credit the experienced defender there. A-League - 60 min: The onus is on the Roar to make the running, but they have to be careful not to leave themselves overcommitted and exposed on the counter. They\u2019ve grown into the game, Newcastle. To the delight of their home fans no doubt. A-League - 53 min: We\u2019re back on in Newcastle, where Petratos has flashed a dangerous effort past the post. A bit of niggle creeping into the contest as the home fans get frustrated by some shirt pull fouls. Roar have lost their captain Aldred to injury, which doesn\u2019t help their plight. The youngster Izaack Powell comes on. Big Bash - End of Innings: Thunder 8/149 (20), Ferguson 52, Nair 11* Ferguson smashes one over the rope, first ball from Abbott - and that brings up his personal milestone of 50. A few singles before Ferguson is caught! But it\u2019s a no ball! At least he\u2019s off strike from a Sixers perspective. Nair is caught on the rope - but its the free hit. An almost comedic finish as Nair ramps back over the \u2018keeper for four, before he completely misses the last ball and runs out his captain! And if you\u2019re a Roar fan feeling a little down and out, spare a thought for Chesterfield over in the UK. They\u2019ve just recorded their lowest home attendance since 1936 and are staring down the barrel of ANOTHER relegation. Oh mis d\u00edas. A-League: Newcastle Jets 1-0 Brisbane Roar - half-time 45 min: There\u2019s the whistle. It\u2019s not been the best we\u2019ve seen from the Jets this season, but they hold the all-important lead in this battle of the cellar dwellers. Three points will see the Jets jump above both the Roar and the Mariners, but if it stays like this a sixth loss in ten games could really put Brisbane in all sorts of trouble, at the turning point of the season. Big Bash: 6/114 (16), Ferguson 30*, Sams 0* That\u2019s the end of a terrific spell from Lloyd Pope - the ginger-haired spinner finishes with 3/23 off 4, including 10 dot balls. Take that bad ball to Ross that flew for six away and he\u2019d be stoked with those figures. Gilks for a duck, Morris for one and Green for one. He\u2019s really ripped through the Thunder middle order. Big few overs for the skipper Ferguson - can he salvage this innings? A-League - 42 min: A big few minutes in the scene of Newcastle\u2019s season - they need to hold on here and go into the sheds ahead. The Roar skipper Tom Aldred rises well to a setpiece, and they\u2019ve only just scrambled, the Jets! A nervy moment there. Big Bash: Wicket! Thunder 4/110 (14.2), Ross 26, Ferguson 28* Ross picks the slower ball from Curran and whack - that flies over the rope! That\u2019s the 50 partnership between these two - they\u2019ve done the steady work, now to accelerate. Ross looks to go big again, but he\u2019s got that one horribly wrong. It\u2019s a fine catch straight down the ground by Sean Abbott - and the English quick Curran gets the last laugh! A-League: Goal! Newcastle Jets 1-0 Brisbane Roar (Petratos) 32 min: It\u2019s a basic play, and the Roar have been badly caught out! A long ball to the far post where Hoffman had ghosted in. Young saved his initial shot but he could do nothing about the follow-up from Petratos! He haunts his former club, once again! A-League - 30 min: The Jets just threatening to come into this contest, as Thurgate tries to weave his way through a crowded Roar penalty area. With their back five Brisbane are a tough side to break down early on - and given the stakes in this one, it\u2019s unsurprisingly defences on top across the first half hour. Big Bash: Thunder 3/85 (12), Ferguson 19*, Ross 16* They go nearly 50 balls without reaching the rope, but it\u2019s a strong ending to that Pope over. Ross with a towering six to make it 14 off it. One of these two needs to go, and needs to go soon, if Thunder are going to put on a game-commanding lead. And a lovely yearender from Suzanne Wrack on a momentous year in women\u2019s sport. Some terrific pics here, and from an Australian and WAFL perspective, great to see our very own Tayla Harris feature: A-League - 16 min: It\u2019s the visitors Brisbane still on the front foot in Newcastle, dominating the possession and territory early on. They\u2019ve had over two-thirds of both so far - Robbie Fowler will be impressed, but he\u2019d dearly love them to be on top on the scoreboard as well. And some NBL action for y\u2019all - where there\u2019s been a big message fired in the top-of-the-table clash: Perth have overcome a fourth-quarter blitz from Casper Ware to claim a dramatic 98-85 victory over Sydney in their top-of-the-table NBL blockbuster. The Kings were down by five points entering the final quarter on Saturday evening when Ware erupted with four long-range bombs to steal the lead. However, Wildcats star Bryce Cotton, who scored a season-high 34 points, showed nerves of steel to produce some timely buckets and ice the win. Ware, who also hit a season-high 33 points, and Cotton traded clutch shots in an electric final period for the 11,569 Qudos Bank Arena crowd. Big Bash: Thunder 3/60 (9), Ferguson 8*, Ross 1* Gilks goes very cheaply off the spinner Pope, and suddenly the run rate has really slowed down here. A big knock needed from the skipper Ferguson - he calls a \u201ctactical time out\u201d, after his side went from 0/48 to 3/54 in quick succession. A-League - 10 min: A first glimpse at Brisbane\u2019s youngster Mirza Muratovic who makes his A-League debut for the Roar today - relegating the hugely experienced Roy O\u2019Donovan to the bench. He twists and turns well and fashions a shot, but it\u2019s well saved by Glen Moss between the sticks. Some news for our yachting aficionados here on Sportwatch: Defending Sydney to Hobart handicap winner Alive has crossed the line behind the five supermaxis as the race for overall honours heats up. The 66-foot boat finished about 2.15pm on Saturday, around seven hours after Comanche won line honours for the third time. While the vast majority of the 154 remaining fleet was still at sea, Alive on Saturday evening was second on the leaderboard in the race for the Tattersall Cup, the prize awarded to the leading overall boat. But her corrected time might be beaten by NSW yacht Ichi Ban, which is slated to finish before midnight along with about 13 other boats. Matt Allen, skipper of Ichi Ban - the 2017 Tattersall Cup winner which came fifth last year - told AAP prior to the race it was a tough field. \u201cThere\u2019s about 15 really good 50-footers and so you\u2019ve got to beat that whole pack to have any chance of winning this race,\u201d he said. A-League - 5 min: Brisbane with some early sustained pressure as they win back-to-back corners. Gillesphey rises, but he can\u2019t get a clean header at it. Newcastle block successive shots before looking to counter through Angus Thurgate. Big Bash: Wicket! Thunder 2/50 (6.1), Hales 32* And that\u2019s two on the spin - it\u2019s the first ball of Curran\u2019s second over that does the damage, as Hales flicks one aimless straight down the throat of Edwards. With two new batsmen at the crease could this be a crucial lull in momentum for the Thunder? That bright start has evaporated very quickly. A-League - kick off! 1 min: And we\u2019re underway in Newcastle: 11th hosting 10th. An absolutely crucial game in the respective seasons of the Jets and the Roar. Big Bash: Wicket! Thunder 1/48 (5.1), Khawaja 16 First ball post-powerplay and what a key wicket that could be! The left-hander goes, and the competition\u2019s golden hat wearer strikes! In comes the in-form Callum Ferguson - no doubt still fuming from the smoke-effected draw last weekend. They\u2019re not out of the woods by any means, the Sixers, but this could be a key over in proceedings. And here\u2019s your A-League starting line ups, where Roar coach Robbie Fowler has made some pretty huge selection calls. Here\u2019s the home side, Newcastle: And here\u2019s that new-look Brisbane XI: Big Bash: Thunder 0/40 (4), Hales 29*, Khawaja 10* Khawaja with a huge hoick over the boundary to join the early explosion from his opening partner. Five fours and a six from Alex Hales to put the bowlers Ben Dwarshuis and Jackson Bird under some heat. Tom Curran to come in and try and stem the bleeding - it\u2019s a steady opening here for the Thunder. And here\u2019s the wrap on a thrilling day three from the Boxing Day Test - on another day on which Pat Cummins reminded the world why he\u2019s the top-rated quick in world cricket: Now, we are underway in Sydney in the Big Bash, where the Thunder have won the toss and elected to bat first in the Sixers-Thunders showdown. I\u2019ll have the updates from that one as soon as they unfold. And, there will be more A-League action as it\u2019s 11th hosting 10th in the battle of the cellar dwellers. Huge game for Newcastle Jets and Brisbane Roar. 90 + 5 min: And there is the final whistle. It\u2019s emphatic in the end for the visitors, who pick up a rare win in Victoria and regain their position in the A-League\u2019s top six. Well worth it for their three points, the Phoenix - can they kick on and ruffle some feathers up the competition\u2019s leaderboard? VAR - no goal! Western United 1-3 Wellington 90 + 5 min: Ugh. And the video men have ruled it out. Gary Hooper started his run from about 3mm offside, allegedly. We\u2019ll never really know because it\u2019s an imprecise science. And a very good goal has been chalked off. Hasn\u2019t it improved football? Got to love VAR. Goal! Western United 1-4 Wellington Phoenix (Hooper) 90 + 4 min: And there is more late goal drama - but it\u2019s the visitors again! It\u2019s a seemingly harmless long ball, but Hooper doesn\u2019t give up on it. Kurto comes but doesn\u2019t claim, and it\u2019s a terrific header from the former Premier League star. Goal! Western United 1-3 Wellington Phoenix (Diamanti) 90 min: No mistake from the veteran Italian Alessandro Diamanti who lashes home an unstoppable effort. Marinovic guesses the right way, but he can\u2019t get a hand on the ball as it nestles into the bottom right-hand corner. And is there a lifeline, however remote, for the home side? 88 min: Penalty! And just as they would have been thinking about a clean sheet it\u2019s a brain explosion from the skipper Steven Taylor who outstretches a hand along the ground and gives away the most obvious of penalties! Entirely needless, you\u2019d have to say - Marinovic was every chance to save the shot! 84 min: Heavy clatter between Durante and Ball, and the former Nix captain gets into a heated war of words with the new Phoenix coach. They never worked together in Durante\u2019s 11 seasons with the clubs, but some real feeling there. Frustration perhaps on the legendary Wellington captain\u2019s part. Goal! Western United 0-3 Wellington Phoenix (Davila) 80 min: And there\u2019s the coup de gr\u00e2ce from the visitors. The points well and truly secured and their prodigious Mexican, Ulises Davila finishes his eighth of the season. Calmly done, and that\u2019s good night to the side from Melbourne\u2019s West, playing in Western Victoria. 76 min: A fresh headache for the homeside - on comes Phoenix\u2019s marquee signing, Gary Hooper, who is still seeking to build match fitness after a late arrival and ankle injury. If they can get some regular minutes into the prolific former Norwich and Celtic man they could be a real threat come the end of the season, Wellington. 72 min: Burgess looks to pull the trigger for Western, but he loops his effort harmlessly wide. They haven\u2019t created anything of note for Berisha up front, and with midfielders blazing away from deeper it\u2019s not likely to test a keeper of Marinovic\u2019s quality. 68 min: Dario Jertec goes in the book and it\u2019s a fair freekick opportunity for the Nix, perhaps a little too far out for the shot. They play short and look to Arsenal their way through a tight defence, and it nearly ends with an opportunity at the back post for Liberato Cacace. 63 min: A sumptuous freekick delivery from Diamanti - he finds Pierias at the far post with a looping ball, but the youngster completely fluffs his lines. They\u2019re cutting deflated figures on the Western United bench, after a 10-15 minute patch in which they thought they\u2019d draw level - only to go further behind. 60 min: Concern here for Western United\u2019s centre back Aaron Calver - they\u2019ve already lost fellow CB Brendan Hamill to a suspected serious knee injury, let\u2019s hope this isn\u2019t a big setback for the young defender. He hobbles to the side line, and it sees Dario Jertec come on, and a possible formation shuffle for Rudan\u2019s side. Goal! Western United 0-2 Wellington (McCowatt) 55 min: Hello! And having weathered a patch of pressure, it\u2019s the Nix who have hit against the run of play. How often do you see that in football? It\u2019s terrific work from Reno Piscopo who feeds the young Kiwi star Callum McCowatt, who swivels well and fires a shot across Filip Kurto. What a sucker punch! 53 min: Devlin and Diamanti continue their scrap in midfield. That\u2019s exactly why you want players with the vast experience of the Italian in the league - what an experience for a talented young Australian midfielder like Cameron Devlin to test his skills against the 17-cap Azzurri? 48 min: Ooh, that\u2019s another terrific intervention from the All Whites No 1 - he denied Dylan Pierias brilliantly to start the first half, now he\u2019s somehow kept out Scott McDonald! Should the former Socceroo have hit the net there? It was a great back stick opportunity, after fine work down the right. This is Western\u2019s best period of the match - can they capitalise? A-League: Second half! Western United 0-1 Wellington Phoenix 45 min: And we\u2019re back, and it\u2019s the veteran Italian Alessandro Diamanti who flashes an early warning shot goalwards, but can\u2019t quite force a save from New Zealand\u2019s number one Stefan Marinovic. And speaking of cricket, the day\u2019s play in the trans-Tasman Test has just finished across the state in Melbourne - here\u2019s our Sportwatch comrade Jonathan Howcroft\u2019s take on play: Interesting developments in the Wagner v Smith battle, which may have some clues for bowlers worldwide, on a day on which Australia remained very much in charge. Afternoon all! H\u00e4id J\u00f5ule / Merry Christmas to all you and yours - I trust this finds you well, during this festive season. Football and cricket are the flavours of the day, so we\u2019ll stay will Western United v Phoenix. A really intriguing game this - they\u2019re on a potentially seven-game unbeaten run, the Nix, and on this showing it\u2019s hard to see where the spark will come from Mark Rudan\u2019s side. All sorts of rumours continuing to emerge from around the club this week, mind, with talk of both coaching staff and players about to depart. Let\u2019s hope that hasn\u2019t distracted the playing group from their task over a busy period of games. A-League: HT: Western United 0-1 Wellington It might be uncomfortably hot in Ballarat, but these two teams are all in and this was a very entertaining half of football. Swift ball movement, clear chances, yellow cards, rash challenges, a drinks break and a Phoenix goal that was thoroughly deserved. Scored by a man called Ball. That\u2019s me out. Richard Parkin, you\u2019re in. A-League: GOAL! Western United 0-1 Wellington (Ball, 41\u2019) Well, it was coming. Wellington\u2019s repeated forward moves have caused United some shape issues down back, and some nice work from D\u00e1vila sets up Ball directly in front. The Englishman doesn\u2019t miss from there. Advantage the visitors. A-League: 37 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington This game has plenty of heat. Now Pain gets a yellow card and deservedly so after cleaning up Ball with a stray leg just outside the box. D\u00e1vila can\u2019t do anything with the free-kick, but moments later Wellington go very close as Ball forces a fingertip save from Kurto. A-League: 30 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington And it\u2019s time for drinks! I\u2019m all for it in football games. Don\u2019t care if it\u2019s really hot, as it is in Ballarat right now, or -40C in a Russian winter. And upon resumption, as if to prove a point, a refuelled and refreshed Burgess slams a piledriver of a strike hard against the right post from distance. Phoenix keeper was beaten. A-League: 23 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington This is getting tasty, and not a little spiteful. Skotadis challenges Ball from behind, raises his arm and collects the Phoenix player square in the back. With meaning. Ball hits the deck, as one might, and there is a break in play while Ball and Skotadis gather their breath, and the gathering throng smoke the peace pipe, take a chill pill and generally chillax. It\u2019s just a game, boys. Boxing Day Test update: Burns is out, Smith is out, the wickets are falling, the New Zealand fans are finding voice at the MCG ... but the Black Caps, who\u2019ll possibly face a few overs tonight, are four-hundred-and-plenty behind and in all sorts. A-League: 10 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington Calver slides into Devlin in the middle of the park and receives the game\u2019s first yellow card. He didn\u2019t miss his former Sydney FC teammate, did Calver. That\u2019s a yellow in anyone\u2019s language. Moments later, Hamill goes down after twisting his left knee. Looked innocuous enough but the Western United man is in some pain. And he\u2019s off, both mentally and physically anguished. Boxing Day Test update: Labuschagne is out, Smith is in ... and New Zealand are still in all sorts of strife. By all means, pop on over to Jonathan Howcroft\u2019s liveblog. A-League: 2 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington An early shot across the Wellington bow from debutant Dylan Pierias, who forces a good save from Marinovic with his solid right-footed strike from just inside the box. A-League stat attack I: Wellington are undefeated in their last six A-League games (W3, D3), having conceded only one first-half goal in that period. A-League stat attack II: Western United\u2019s Andrew Durante boasts a passing accuracy of 91.4% this campaign, the second highest of any player to have made at least 200 passes. A-League teams: WESTERN UNITED (3-2-2-3): Filip Kurto (GK); Aaron Calver, Andrew Durante, Brendan Hamill; Jerry Skotadis, Max Burgess; Dylan Pierias, Connor Pain; Alessandro Diamanti, Besart Berisha, Scott McDonald. SUBS: Ryan Scott (GK), Valentino Yuel, Apostolos Stamatelopoulos, Dario Jertec, Jonathon Aspropotamitis, Joshua Cavallo, Kwabena Appiah-Kubi. WELLINGTON (4-4-2): Stefan Marinovic (GK); Tim Payne, Steven Taylor, Luke DeVere, Liberato Cacace; Reno Piscopo, Cameron Devlin, Matti Steinmann, Callum McCowatt; David Ball, Ulises Davila. SUBS: Oliver Sail (GK), Liam McGing, Te Atawhai Hudson-Wihongi, Ben Waine, Gary Hooper. We\u2019re not far off the start of the A-League game between Western United and Wellington. This will be the first time an A-League game has been played in Ballarat, proving there is life on Mars (Stadium). Wonderful, wonderful photo essay here on Poppy Starr Olsen, the Newcastle teenager on track to represent Australia at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Do yourself a favour. The Sydney to Hobart has been, um, sailed and won. Comanche, which looked down and out at lunchtime yesterday, absolutely \u2018keeled\u2019 them en route to Tassie to take line honours for the third time. Early leader Scallywag collided with a shark and lost ground - or should that be water? Either way, see below for the lowdown and reaction to the annual blue-water classic. The Boxing Day Test is an entirely appropriate moniker for this event in 2o19. Australia, batting for the second time as I type, have New Zealand on the ropes and are landing blow after blow after blow. This will be another massive victory for Tim Paine\u2019s men. Now go and see what Jonathan Howcroft is making of events at the MCG. And then hurry on back. I\u2019ve got a story about a shark for you. Best of the afternoon, lovers of sport. God bless pursuits such as chasing leather and whacking/kicking/catching things. How else would we amuse ourselves in this strange period between Christmas and new year? I don\u2019t know about you, but I have trouble remembering what day it is. I had a half-hour debate with one of my sons earlier on regarding this very subject. He was convinced it\u2019s Thursday (still is) but after giving it serious thought, I settled on it being Saturday. All day, as my mother would say. Enough digression. The Boxing Day Test is continuing at the MCG, we have two A-League games today and a Sydney derby in the Big Bash League. Plenty else on too, no doubt. Hang around. It\u2019ll be fun. You can email me or drop me a tweet. Or, if you\u2019d rather not, don\u2019t.",

      "body": "<p>Ah, yes, says Asa Butterfield, the young star of the explicit and brilliant comedy of sex manners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/17/sex-education-asa-butterfield-gillian-anderson-netflix\" title=\"\">Sex Education</a>. Butterfield is recalling one of the stranger milestones of his acting career, \u201cmy first, big, on-camera wank. That was a fun day on set.\u201d With a second series of the hit Netflix show due to debut online soon, the 21-year-old Londoner has come to a diner in King\u2019s Cross to eat an oozing burger and talk with some pride about a show that first set the internet humming back in January 2019. Part hyperactive teen comedy and part public health broadcast, Sex Education, created by British/Australian screenwriter Laurie Nunn, turned out to be that rare cultural thing: a show that filled a hole we didn\u2019t know was there.</p> <p>\u201cI think it did a great job of normalising young people\u2019s fears, and quirks, and hang-ups around sex,\u201d Butterfield says. He plays Sex Education\u2019s central character, a preternaturally wise teenage boy called Otis, who takes it upon himself to advise his sixth-form peers on the intricacies of sexual contact and sexual politics. \u201cWhen I first signed up, I knew it would be interesting, risky, that the scripts were treading new ground. I guess I hoped the show would be talked about a bit. But I didn\u2019t expect it to connect so instantly, so overwhelmingly, with so many people.\u201d</p> <p>It connected. It also, as the title ironically promised, educated. Over eight episodes, Sex Education explored an array of important topics, including (deep breath) performance anxiety, impotence, consent, possessiveness, wet dreams, premarital sex, virginity loss, fear of masturbation, fear of penetration, mid-sex panic attacks, having a too-large penis, revenge porn, pregnancy, abortion, social-media shaming, and whether to have sex with the lights on or off. It was thoughtful, great fun \u2013 and the only show I can think of that, after eight hours of patient dramatic build-up, culminated in a closeup of a young man pleasuring himself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019d all done their share of revealing sexual things. I thought, \u2018Well guys! My turn. Watch this\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI did my big wanking scene towards the end of the shoot,\u201d Butterfield recalls, \u201cso I\u2019d kind of warmed up to it. I knew I\u2019d gotten off pretty lightly compared with the others in the cast.\u201d (His costars included British newcomers such as Ncuti Gatwa and Emma Mackey, as well as veterans Gillian Anderson and James Purefoy.) \u201cThey\u2019d all done their share of revealing sexual things. I thought, \u2018Well guys! My turn. Watch <em>this</em>.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On set that day Butterfield was fitted, under his trousers, with a prosthetic erection. He was strapped to a rising gurney, to simulate floating, blissed-out pleasure. The rest was all him: fluttering cheek muscles, rolling eyeballs\u2026 Butterfield, who has acted since he was seven years old, but never like this, aced his big moment, I tell him. He says: \u201cWell, thank you. Uh, when we signed up for this job we kind of knew we\u2019d be putting our pride behind us. But it was worth it, I think. I\u2019m super-proud of the show.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97a927534ec2853b918f2ecfca65b503c1fefb0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97a927534ec2853b918f2ecfca65b503c1fefb0b/23_150_5710_3426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Patricia Allison in the new series of Netflix\u2019s Sex Education.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Patricia Allison in the new series of Netflix\u2019s Sex Education.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Taylor/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such was the response to the first series, at the start of 2019, that Netflix broke its weird omert\u00e0 about viewing figures and gave an idea of how many had tuned in \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/sex-education-renewed-season-2-at-netflix-1181807\" title=\"\">40m households in a month</a>, we were told. \u201cI think it hit at the right time,\u201d Butterfield says. \u201cIt was zeitgeist-y, and people really wanted something like this, given what was going on with feminism, with toxic masculinity, everything.\u201d</p> <p>Butterfield is tall and narrow, with pale skin and black hair that\u2019s just been shaved for the first time. He has come to the burger diner dressed in two distinct halves that neatly represent his chief occupations. From the waist down he looks like a young actor, in dapper patterned trousers, suede-effect sneakers, camel socks. On the top half (shapeless hoodie, specs) he looks like a computer gamer, one itching to get home to his London flat and fire up a beloved Nintendo.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a big gamer,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of my closest friends are from that world. I go along to professional tournaments sometimes.\u201d I knew this about Butterfield from his Instagram feed, which is unusual for a working actor\u2019s in that it mixes images of ritzy screen gigs with photos of him unboxing new control pads or looking hunched and pained in front of a keyboard at an esports event. Employed fairly regularly for the last 14 years, Butterfield has stood in the glow of Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Martin Scorsese. But it\u2019s pro-gamers who\u2019ve always impressed him, he says.</p> <p>\u201cI just love that whole world. The competition. The pace of the games. As an actor, the work is often quite slow, I guess. Quite contemplative. I like the way the high energy of gaming offsets that. Acting\u2019s great \u2013 I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the most soul-satisfying job, all of the time.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that actors never say such things in public, perhaps for fear that a gang of drama professors and method types will beat them up for letting down the guild. There\u2019s also a risk of sounding ungrateful. But Butterfield is just being honest. He thinks a gentle ambivalence towards acting has probably been a healthy thing over time.</p> <p>\u201cI could always interrupt the acting and do other things, be interested in other things. It wasn\u2019t my whole world. It\u2019s a tight industry \u2013 an industry in which a lot of the conversations are inward-looking. And I don\u2019t really love talking about the job, to give an example. It\u2019s not that I get embarrassed. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s humbleness, but I think it comes from that. Often, even just talking about being an actor, it means someone putting you on a pedestal. It might mean people being a little bit in awe, or even revering you.

Why does he think he went back to acting? Butterfield opens his eyes very wide and says, \u201cI did it for fun, and because I didn\u2019t have to be in school \u2013 I got to spend three months in Budapest, or wherever, instead.\u201d</p> <p>By this time, he was at secondary school. \u201cThey were super-supportive. On average, I would do a film a year, be away for a few months before coming back.\u201d But often, he says, film shoots crossed over with the summer holidays.</p> <p>What did the other children make of it? \u201cKids can be cruel, they can be arseholes, but I surrounded myself with good people, I think, and I was never bullied, when a lot of people [in that position] might have been. The teachers made a bigger deal out of it than the kids, to be honest. They treated me\u2026 almost too well. Asked a lot of questions. I\u2019d think, \u2018Stop sucking up.

He brought an affecting, eerie, melancholy to the film. Next \u2013 and before he\u2019d even sat his GCSEs \u2013 he was in another Hollywood blockbuster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/24/enders-game-review\" title=\"\">Ender\u2019s Game</a>, playing a teenage soldier in a computerised future world. There were life moments that happened at home in London (first beer, first smoke) and there were those that happened on set. He had a first girlfriend, aged 15, on Ender\u2019s Game. \u201cOne of the supporting actresses. It was fleeting. But, y\u2019know, it\u2019s all experience, part of growing up.\u201d</p> <p>Another landmark occurred a few years later, when Butterfield was finally old enough to fly to a location shoot in Albuquerque (for 2015\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/09/the-space-between-us-review\" title=\"\">The Space Between Us</a>) without an adult chaperone.

I got to know these older actors, good people, who\u2019d done everything: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-graham\" title=\"\">Stephen Graham</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sam-claflin\" title=\"\">Sam Claflin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-bettany\" title=\"\">Paul Bettany</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/toby-jones\" title=\"\">Toby Jones</a>.\u201d The war movie went on worldwide release in the spring of 2018, around the time Butterfield was sent the script for something a little different in tone.</p> <p>Sex Education was conceived by its creator Nunn as a sort of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-breakfast-club\" title=\"\">Breakfast Club</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/30/fetch-happens-why-mean-girls-is-the-perfect-teen-movie\" title=\"\">Mean Girls</a> for the present generation. In episode one, Butterfield\u2019s character Otis realises that, having been raised by a sex-therapist mum (Anderson), he is unusually savvy about sex. Pals Eric (Gatwa) and Maeve (Mackey) convince him to monetise his knowledge and become an ad hoc therapist for his friends and peers. Each episode presents Otis and the gang with one or more sex problems to solve, the solution to which, generally speaking, is: be more honest.</p> <p>\u201cSince doing the show, it\u2019s definitely made me a lot more open to conversations about sex,\u201d Butterfield says. He could have done with something like Sex Education to watch as a primer, back when he was a baffled teen, he says. \u201cYou have sex ed at school, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve garnered my knowledge from a school curriculum, y\u2019know?\u201d</p> <p>Does he think we do enough, in schools, to educate young people about this stuff? \u201cI think there\u2019s only so much you can teach in school. Cos teenagers are going to not listen, and whisper, and giggle, and not be totally there. There were definitely elements missing, bits we were never taught about, like gay sex, female masturbation, <em>pleasure</em>. The curriculum is very biological \u2013 it\u2019s mostly about pregnancy, safety, consent. All important things, but they\u2019re on the surface level of sex and sexuality. The other things, I didn\u2019t even realise they were missing, not till I got older, and started doing the show, and I thought, \u2018You know what, that never came up at school.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>How did he learn? \u201cLike most people \u2013 on my own. I think a lot of my knowledge came from talking with friends, and hearing whispers, words that I didn\u2019t understand, and Googling them later.\u201d</p> <p>To my Gen X ears it doesn\u2019t sound an ideal learning journey, and Butterfield catches me wincing. He has a wry and deadpan sense of humour that is reminiscent of Steve Coogan\u2019s. (Next year, Butterfield will appear alongside Coogan in a comedy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/greed\" title=\"\">Greed, directed by Michael Winterbottom</a>.) The young actor teases: \u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t have Google, then, as a child. What was it\u2026 like, books? In a library?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a surprise to me that Sex Education has not yet been awarded any major prizes; I half-feel the Department for Education ought to divert a chunk of its budget towards Nunn and her team, in simple thanks. What makes the show such an effective means of delivery, I say to Butterfield, is that it resists preachiness. He nods. He says he knew that something was right with its tone, from the speed with which it opened up the young cast to frank sexual chat during their off-time. \u201cIt fed into us, the whole message of the show, that sex is nothing to be frightened or embarrassed about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b492a1816e18dbf954d32b6717c4b90102e2cec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b492a1816e18dbf954d32b6717c4b90102e2cec/616_0_2832_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Hailee Steinfeld in 2013\u2019s Ender\u2019s Game.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Hailee Steinfeld in 2013\u2019s Ender\u2019s Game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Summit Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the diner, Butterfield has made short work of his burger. While he picks at the few remaining chips I ask about his nonsexual politics. There are things he feels strongly about, he says. \u201cThe environment is the big one for me.\u201d But in his blithe and frank way, he also admits to an uncomfortable feeling that, as a young person with a public platform, he is obliged to take firm positions on matters he has only a sketchy understanding of.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politically, what's going on in the UK is so depressing.\u00a0Our generation seems to be being taken advantage of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPolitically, what\u2019s going on in the UK, I often feel it\u2019s so depressing, I can\u2019t make myself read another article on it, or take any more in. But as someone who has a tiny bit of a spotlight, I feel this responsibility to spread positivity. Or have a view to share \u2013 when all things being equal I would rather keep my thoughts to myself. Probably loads of people [my age] are in the same position. But it can feel like a selfishness to stay quiet when our generation seems to be being taken advantage of.\u201d</p> <p>We chat for a bit about a computer game he\u2019s been designing and coding with a mate, a comedy script he\u2019s written, his efforts to learn the bass guitar. Before long, the plates are being cleared away and we\u2019ve drifted back to sex. I came to meet him today with a list of prepared questions. Nothing unusual about that. What was odd, I admit to Butterfield, was how many of the things I meant to chat to him about involved sex. Does he find, given the freedom and unflinchingness of Sex Education, a lot of conversations tend in this direction?</p> <p>\u201cNo one comes to me with their sex problems, exactly,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat the show has done, I guess, has steered a lot of conversation towards my own sexual experience. And that was never something I got asked about when I was younger and being interviewed for films.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d hope not, I say, given that you were about 12.</p> <p>\u201cWell, exactly,\u201d Butterfield says. \u201cBut I do feel more confident talking about this stuff.\u201d So bring it on, Butterfield says. \u201cIt would be hypocritical for me to be any other way.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The new series of <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80197526\" title=\"\">Sex Education is on Netflix on 17 January</a></p> <p>If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:%20weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ah, yes, says Asa Butterfield, the young star of the explicit and brilliant comedy of sex manners, Sex Education. Butterfield is recalling one of the stranger milestones of his acting career, \u201cmy first, big, on-camera wank. That was a fun day on set.\u201d With a second series of the hit Netflix show due to debut online soon, the 21-year-old Londoner has come to a diner in King\u2019s Cross to eat an oozing burger and talk with some pride about a show that first set the internet humming back in January 2019. Part hyperactive teen comedy and part public health broadcast, Sex Education, created by British/Australian screenwriter Laurie Nunn, turned out to be that rare cultural thing: a show that filled a hole we didn\u2019t know was there. \u201cI think it did a great job of normalising young people\u2019s fears, and quirks, and hang-ups around sex,\u201d Butterfield says. He plays Sex Education\u2019s central character, a preternaturally wise teenage boy called Otis, who takes it upon himself to advise his sixth-form peers on the intricacies of sexual contact and sexual politics. \u201cWhen I first signed up, I knew it would be interesting, risky, that the scripts were treading new ground. I guess I hoped the show would be talked about a bit. But I didn\u2019t expect it to connect so instantly, so overwhelmingly, with so many people.\u201d It connected. It also, as the title ironically promised, educated. Over eight episodes, Sex Education explored an array of important topics, including (deep breath) performance anxiety, impotence, consent, possessiveness, wet dreams, premarital sex, virginity loss, fear of masturbation, fear of penetration, mid-sex panic attacks, having a too-large penis, revenge porn, pregnancy, abortion, social-media shaming, and whether to have sex with the lights on or off. It was thoughtful, great fun \u2013 and the only show I can think of that, after eight hours of patient dramatic build-up, culminated in a closeup of a young man pleasuring himself. \u201cI did my big wanking scene towards the end of the shoot,\u201d Butterfield recalls, \u201cso I\u2019d kind of warmed up to it. I knew I\u2019d gotten off pretty lightly compared with the others in the cast.\u201d (His costars included British newcomers such as Ncuti Gatwa and Emma Mackey, as well as veterans Gillian Anderson and James Purefoy.) \u201cThey\u2019d all done their share of revealing sexual things. I thought, \u2018Well guys! My turn. Watch this.\u2019\u201d On set that day Butterfield was fitted, under his trousers, with a prosthetic erection. He was strapped to a rising gurney, to simulate floating, blissed-out pleasure. The rest was all him: fluttering cheek muscles, rolling eyeballs\u2026 Butterfield, who has acted since he was seven years old, but never like this, aced his big moment, I tell him. He says: \u201cWell, thank you. Uh, when we signed up for this job we kind of knew we\u2019d be putting our pride behind us. But it was worth it, I think. I\u2019m super-proud of the show.\u201d Such was the response to the first series, at the start of 2019, that Netflix broke its weird omert\u00e0 about viewing figures and gave an idea of how many had tuned in \u2013 40m households in a month, we were told. \u201cI think it hit at the right time,\u201d Butterfield says. \u201cIt was zeitgeist-y, and people really wanted something like this, given what was going on with feminism, with toxic masculinity, everything.\u201d Butterfield is tall and narrow, with pale skin and black hair that\u2019s just been shaved for the first time. He has come to the burger diner dressed in two distinct halves that neatly represent his chief occupations. From the waist down he looks like a young actor, in dapper patterned trousers, suede-effect sneakers, camel socks. On the top half (shapeless hoodie, specs) he looks like a computer gamer, one itching to get home to his London flat and fire up a beloved Nintendo. \u201cI\u2019m a big gamer,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of my closest friends are from that world. I go along to professional tournaments sometimes.\u201d I knew this about Butterfield from his Instagram feed, which is unusual for a working actor\u2019s in that it mixes images of ritzy screen gigs with photos of him unboxing new control pads or looking hunched and pained in front of a keyboard at an esports event. Employed fairly regularly for the last 14 years, Butterfield has stood in the glow of Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Martin Scorsese. But it\u2019s pro-gamers who\u2019ve always impressed him, he says. \u201cI just love that whole world. The competition. The pace of the games. As an actor, the work is often quite slow, I guess. Quite contemplative. I like the way the high energy of gaming offsets that. Acting\u2019s great \u2013 I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the most soul-satisfying job, all of the time.\u201d It\u2019s worth pointing out that actors never say such things in public, perhaps for fear that a gang of drama professors and method types will beat them up for letting down the guild. There\u2019s also a risk of sounding ungrateful. But Butterfield is just being honest. He thinks a gentle ambivalence towards acting has probably been a healthy thing over time. \u201cI could always interrupt the acting and do other things, be interested in other things. It wasn\u2019t my whole world. It\u2019s a tight industry \u2013 an industry in which a lot of the conversations are inward-looking. And I don\u2019t really love talking about the job, to give an example. It\u2019s not that I get embarrassed. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s humbleness, but I think it comes from that. Often, even just talking about being an actor, it means someone putting you on a pedestal. It might mean people being a little bit in awe, or even revering you. And I hate that feeling, hate it.\u201d Butterfield fell into the business as a kid, long before he was old enough to think about different futures for himself. He grew up in two homes in London, raised by his mother (psychologist) and father (advertising copywriter), who lived a few miles apart. \u201cThey split up when I was young. But they stayed good friends,\u201d Butterfield says. \u201cWith my older brother, I spent equal time with both. We\u2019ve got half-sisters on either side, who are friends as well. So we\u2019re all \u2013 yeah \u2013 pretty lucky.\u201d Around the age of six, he joined a drama group, the Young Actors Theatre in Islington. (The theatre counts Get Out\u2019s Daniel Kaluuya among other alumni who hit big.) While Butterfield was still at primary school, he got a part in an ITV Christmas drama called After Thomas. He had a few lines in Son Of Rambow, that strange and lovely coming-of-age film from 2007. That was it, in terms of his climbing-the-ladder phase. From the age of 10, when he was cast in the Holocaust drama The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas, he more or less played lead characters only. \u201cI remember bits of that job,\u201d Butterfield says of The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas, \u201cand the bits that stick with me were the hardest.\u201d The film, based on a bestseller by John Boyne, told the story of two boys in the 1930s, one Jewish (Jack Scanlon), one not (Butterfield), as they formed an unlikely friendship through the fence of a Nazi concentration camp. Spoiler coming: the film had an unhappy ending. Butterfield: \u201cThe gas chamber scene, at the end, I knew what it was, I knew what we were demonstrating, I knew it was only acting. But I remember being in a room full of men, some of whom were completely naked, and it was dark, and they shut the door on us, and it was just\u2026 awful.\u201d Butterfield, in those days, would be chaperoned on set by one of his parents or grandparents. \u201cThere were a few times I came out and said, \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 We took gaps between takes, we played games. But it\u2019s hard for a kid. That topic.\u201d Has he spoken to his parents about all this, since getting older? \u201cA bit? Not really. They always wanted to protect me. And it wasn\u2019t like they were on the sidelines saying, \u2018Get back in that gas chamber.\u2019 At all. They always said, if you don\u2019t wanna do it, you don\u2019t have to do it. When we were finished on Boy In The Striped Pyjamas \u2013 I don\u2019t remember this, but my mum told me after I finished that job \u2013 I said I didn\u2019t want to be an actor any more. Which I find interesting now.\u201d He was back working on a film a couple of years later: a flashback scene in a fantasy movie called The Wolfman. Why does he think he went back to acting? Butterfield opens his eyes very wide and says, \u201cI did it for fun, and because I didn\u2019t have to be in school \u2013 I got to spend three months in Budapest, or wherever, instead.\u201d By this time, he was at secondary school. \u201cThey were super-supportive. On average, I would do a film a year, be away for a few months before coming back.\u201d But often, he says, film shoots crossed over with the summer holidays. What did the other children make of it? \u201cKids can be cruel, they can be arseholes, but I surrounded myself with good people, I think, and I was never bullied, when a lot of people [in that position] might have been. The teachers made a bigger deal out of it than the kids, to be honest. They treated me\u2026 almost too well. Asked a lot of questions. I\u2019d think, \u2018Stop sucking up. You\u2019re my PE teacher.\u2019\u201d At 14, Butterfield made his biggest movie to date, playing the title character in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2011 fantasy Hugo. He brought an affecting, eerie, melancholy to the film. Next \u2013 and before he\u2019d even sat his GCSEs \u2013 he was in another Hollywood blockbuster, Ender\u2019s Game, playing a teenage soldier in a computerised future world. There were life moments that happened at home in London (first beer, first smoke) and there were those that happened on set. He had a first girlfriend, aged 15, on Ender\u2019s Game. \u201cOne of the supporting actresses. It was fleeting. But, y\u2019know, it\u2019s all experience, part of growing up.\u201d Another landmark occurred a few years later, when Butterfield was finally old enough to fly to a location shoot in Albuquerque (for 2015\u2019s The Space Between Us) without an adult chaperone. Boy, he says, the disappointment when he got there, expecting high mischief, and realised \u201cthere was fuck-all to do in Albuquerque\u201d. Probably his first wholly satisfying film experience, Butterfield says, came quite recently, when he starred in the first world war drama Journey\u2019s End. \u201cThat was the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t the kid on set. I got to know these older actors, good people, who\u2019d done everything: Stephen Graham, Sam Claflin, Paul Bettany, Toby Jones.\u201d The war movie went on worldwide release in the spring of 2018, around the time Butterfield was sent the script for something a little different in tone. Sex Education was conceived by its creator Nunn as a sort of Breakfast Club or Mean Girls for the present generation. In episode one, Butterfield\u2019s character Otis realises that, having been raised by a sex-therapist mum (Anderson), he is unusually savvy about sex. Pals Eric (Gatwa) and Maeve (Mackey) convince him to monetise his knowledge and become an ad hoc therapist for his friends and peers. Each episode presents Otis and the gang with one or more sex problems to solve, the solution to which, generally speaking, is: be more honest. \u201cSince doing the show, it\u2019s definitely made me a lot more open to conversations about sex,\u201d Butterfield says. He could have done with something like Sex Education to watch as a primer, back when he was a baffled teen, he says. \u201cYou have sex ed at school, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve garnered my knowledge from a school curriculum, y\u2019know?\u201d Does he think we do enough, in schools, to educate young people about this stuff? \u201cI think there\u2019s only so much you can teach in school. Cos teenagers are going to not listen, and whisper, and giggle, and not be totally there. There were definitely elements missing, bits we were never taught about, like gay sex, female masturbation, pleasure. The curriculum is very biological \u2013 it\u2019s mostly about pregnancy, safety, consent. All important things, but they\u2019re on the surface level of sex and sexuality. The other things, I didn\u2019t even realise they were missing, not till I got older, and started doing the show, and I thought, \u2018You know what, that never came up at school.\u2019\u201d How did he learn? \u201cLike most people \u2013 on my own. I think a lot of my knowledge came from talking with friends, and hearing whispers, words that I didn\u2019t understand, and Googling them later.\u201d To my Gen X ears it doesn\u2019t sound an ideal learning journey, and Butterfield catches me wincing. He has a wry and deadpan sense of humour that is reminiscent of Steve Coogan\u2019s. (Next year, Butterfield will appear alongside Coogan in a comedy, Greed, directed by Michael Winterbottom.) The young actor teases: \u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t have Google, then, as a child. What was it\u2026 like, books? In a library?\u201d It\u2019s a surprise to me that Sex Education has not yet been awarded any major prizes; I half-feel the Department for Education ought to divert a chunk of its budget towards Nunn and her team, in simple thanks. What makes the show such an effective means of delivery, I say to Butterfield, is that it resists preachiness. He nods. He says he knew that something was right with its tone, from the speed with which it opened up the young cast to frank sexual chat during their off-time. \u201cIt fed into us, the whole message of the show, that sex is nothing to be frightened or embarrassed about.\u201d In the diner, Butterfield has made short work of his burger. While he picks at the few remaining chips I ask about his nonsexual politics. There are things he feels strongly about, he says. \u201cThe environment is the big one for me.\u201d But in his blithe and frank way, he also admits to an uncomfortable feeling that, as a young person with a public platform, he is obliged to take firm positions on matters he has only a sketchy understanding of. \u201cPolitically, what\u2019s going on in the UK, I often feel it\u2019s so depressing, I can\u2019t make myself read another article on it, or take any more in. But as someone who has a tiny bit of a spotlight, I feel this responsibility to spread positivity. Or have a view to share \u2013 when all things being equal I would rather keep my thoughts to myself. Probably loads of people [my age] are in the same position. But it can feel like a selfishness to stay quiet when our generation seems to be being taken advantage of.\u201d We chat for a bit about a computer game he\u2019s been designing and coding with a mate, a comedy script he\u2019s written, his efforts to learn the bass guitar. Before long, the plates are being cleared away and we\u2019ve drifted back to sex. I came to meet him today with a list of prepared questions. Nothing unusual about that. What was odd, I admit to Butterfield, was how many of the things I meant to chat to him about involved sex. Does he find, given the freedom and unflinchingness of Sex Education, a lot of conversations tend in this direction? \u201cNo one comes to me with their sex problems, exactly,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat the show has done, I guess, has steered a lot of conversation towards my own sexual experience. And that was never something I got asked about when I was younger and being interviewed for films.\u201d I\u2019d hope not, I say, given that you were about 12. \u201cWell, exactly,\u201d Butterfield says. \u201cBut I do feel more confident talking about this stuff.\u201d So bring it on, Butterfield says. \u201cIt would be hypocritical for me to be any other way.\u201d \u2022 The new series of Sex Education is on Netflix on 17 January If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Never fear: there\u2019s hardly any cooking involved in this banoffee trifle, and it\u2019s all about the celebration \u2013 just stick a few sparklers in it and get back to the party. Have an easy, happy new year. Prep 20 min Cook 20 min Serves 12 For the toffee sauce 150ml double cream 40g unsalted butter 50g light muscovado sugar \u00bc tsp fine sea salt For the brittle 230g caster sugar 20g unsalted butter 150g mixed nuts, roughly chopped For the trifle 600g extra-thick double cream 100ml Baileys 400g chocolate digestives, broken 5 large bananas, peeled and sliced 2 x 500g ready-made vanilla custard To finish 75g dark chocolate, grated Melt the cream, butter and sugar in a medium-sized saucepan, then leave it to bubble and turn a toffee sauce-like colour. Add the salt to taste, and set aside. Put four tablespoons of water into a saucepan and slowly add the caster sugar, stirring with a whisk or spatula, until combined. Cook over a medium heat until the sugar turns a deep amber colour. Remove the pan from the heat and quickly stir in the butter. Tip in the nuts and stir until they\u2019re well-coated in the sugar. Carefully pour the sugary nuts on to a silicone mat or a tray lined with baking paper and leave to cool. Once cool, smash into shards. Mix the cream with three tablespoons of Baileys and set aside. Divide the broken biscuits over the bottom of a large dish. Drizzle more Baileys over the biscuits, top with the sliced banana, custard and Baileys-infused cream. Squiggle over some caramel sauce and finish with grated chocolate. Pop in the fridge until needed. When ready to serve, top with shards of brittle (and some sparklers).",

      "bodyText": "What goes up must come down, and in 2019, gravity reasserted itself for the tech industry. After years of relatively unchecked growth, the tech industry found itself on the receiving end of increased scrutiny from lawmakers and the public and attacks from its own employees. \u201cThe whole year has been brutal for tech companies,\u201d said Peter Yared, chief executive officer and founder of data compliance firm InCountry. \u201cThe techlash we have seen in the rest of the world is just now catching up in the US \u2013 it\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d From new privacy legislation to internal strife, here are some of the major hurdles the tech industry has faced in the past year. Elections intensify scrutiny As the 2020 presidential race intensified, tech companies faced a growing backlash over the campaign-related content they allow on their platforms. In October, Facebook quietly revised its policy banning false claims in advertising to exempt politicians, drawing fierce criticism from users, misinformation watchdogs, and politicians. Following the change in policy, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took out advertisements on Facebook purposely making false statements to draw attention to the policy. Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilled Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, over the policy change in a congressional hearing in October. \u201cDo you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of factchecking on political advertisements?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked, as Zuckerberg struggled to answer. \u201cSo, you won\u2019t take down lies or you will take down lies?\u201d Meanwhile, other tech companies took the opposite stance. TikTok, whose reported 500 million users makes it one of Facebook\u2019s largest rivals, made clear in a blogpost in October it would not be hosting any political advertisements. And Facebook rival Twitter banned almost all political advertising in October. Google stated in November it would no longer allow political advertisers to target voters based on their political affiliations. Investigations threaten big tech At one time, tech giant acquisitions were shrugged at. But the instant skepticism that met Google\u2019s acquisition of Fitbit represented a shift in how regulatory agencies are looking at big tech: investigations are coming. Throughout the year, tech giants faced congressional hearings on issues such as privacy, antitrust and misinformation. The US Congress announced in June it would investigate tech firms over anti-competitive behavior. In July, Facebook, Google, and Amazon faced a grilling before the House subcommittee regarding antitrust. A week later, the US justice department announced it was opening a broad antitrust review into Facebook, Alphabet\u2019s Google, Amazon and Apple. Shortly after, Facebook said it had agreed to pay a record $5bn penalty in the US for mishandling user data in the Cambridge Analytica breach. Later in 2019, Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg spent hours in the hot seat as Congress members grilled him over the social media giant\u2019s privacy practices and its plans to launch a digital currency. While the hearings did not immediately result in legislative action, the tone of questioning underscored growing bipartisan animosity against tech executives. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said Facebook showed \u201cbreathtaking arrogance\u201d in attempting to launch a digital financial service after a number of major privacy scandals and called Facebook \u201cdangerous\u201d. New privacy laws loom In 2019, US lawmakers and regulatory agencies began to direct at tech firms the kind of criticism that has been advancing in the European Union for years. In the year since the the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018, the US has started to look at its own regulation addressing what data is collected on its citizens. \u201cThroughout the world, you see that people are fed up and you see more and more laws popping up,\u201d Yared said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s coming to the US now.\u201d As the average American became more aware of the privacy issues and the magnitude of data collection, calls for legislation intensified, said Hayley Tsukayama, a legislative activist at the not-for-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Consumers are increasingly aware of privacy violations after their own data was mishandled by Equifax, Facebook and in other massive breaches. \u201cPrivacy has become an even bigger theme in 2019,\u201d Babel said. \u201cThings have fundamentally changed \u2013 consumers care more about their personal information than they did in the past, and businesses do, too.\u201d In 2019, over 150 pieces of legislation on consumer data were considered in the US on the state and federal level as criticism over the companies\u2019 growing reach and power intensifies. Nevada, Maine, Washington, New York, Texas, Oregon and Maryland all passed laws related to data breach notification requirements, privacy and cybersecurity in 2019. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which was passed in 2018, was finalized in 2019 and is set to go into effect on 1 January 2020. It is set to enact privacy regulations similar to Europe\u2019s GDPR, giving consumers the right to know what data is kept on them and request it be deleted. AB5 comes for the gig economy Among consumers and legislators alike, 2019 brought a growing awareness that the explosion of the gig economy has come with huge challenges for workers. California attempted to address that in September 2019 when it passed a landmark workers\u2019 rights bill threatening to upend the gig economy. The bill, known as AB5, will change the way contract workers are classified. With tech giants including Uber and Lyft headquartered in California, the bill is likely to resonate far beyond state lines. When the law goes into effect in January 2020, it will implement a three-part standard for determining whether workers are properly classified as independent contractors, requiring that (a) they are free from the company\u2019s control, (b) they are doing work that isn\u2019t central to the company\u2019s business and (c) they have an independent business in that industry. Gig economy startups, including Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have pledged millions of dollars against the bill, threatening to fund a ballot initiative to counteract it in 2020. A year of organizing Tech companies also faced intense backlash from within \u2013 the year of 2019 was \u201cpivotal for worker organizing\u201d, said Shona Clarkson, an organizer at Gig Workers Rising said. The rise in activism marked a breaking point for the gig economy, Clarkson noted, with workers increasingly uniting to address workplace issues affecting employees at all levels. \u201cThis was a year we saw workers rising up across the board,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cIt is long overdue \u2013 workers have been suffering within tech since the industry began, and now we are seeing the rising up of workers who are building the power necessary to win.\u201d At Google, repercussions from internal protests over sexual harassment policies that began in November 2018 continued into 2019. Workers at fundraising startup Kickstarter organized to fight for workers rights. Gig workers at Instacart and Uber also organized strikes to fight for better pay and benefits. Companies have responded by allegedly cracking down on worker activists. Google hired an anti-union security firm and fired at least five employees involved in organizing. Two Kickstarter employees allege they were fired over their activism. The protests were not only over worker treatment, but technology\u2019s responsibility to larger political issues. In June, workers at online furnishings retailer Wayfair walked out of the job to protest the company\u2019s contracts with detention centers for immigrants. In July, Amazon workers and activists protested the company\u2019s contracts with government agencies.",

I want future generations to be aware of the pain that we lived in, how one small (very easily lost or broken) thing held the key to a good bus journey or a bad one, and I want humanity to never be held over such a barrel again. I would want us to look back at the absurdity of man and hopefully we would have somehow progressed. Jamie Demetriou Tattoo gun I was born crossing my fingers, eyes closed, praying that when I first caught a glimpse of myself, I would be covered in drawings of crap all over my body and face. Alas, it was just boring old skin, and I\u2019d have to wait to get a snake on my head or a bin on my neck or a question mark by my penis until I was, like, 50?! Crushed. Luckily, over the last decade, tattooing has become so common and wicked that kids as young as nothing are inking it up! And every single one anyone has got has been so nice. Genuinely. (Spoiler: I didn\u2019t get one in the end because I hate them now so much that it makes it quite difficult to focus on work or my relationship.) Stath Lets Flats is available to stream on All 4 John Kearns John Bercow\u2019s tie For 10 years, Bercow chaired the House of Commons, and though he ditched the wig and robes, there\u2019s no denying he lit the place up with his choice of tie. Whether you wanted to ask him where it was from or give him a peanut is another matter. John Kearns is touring 20 Feb to 22 Mar; tour starts Hyde Park Book Club, Leeds Clara Amfo Woozy face emoji Although emojis were first invented in 1999, this one sums up so much about modern living: like, if I can\u2019t think of a tweet when I want to tweet. Or if I didn\u2019t like something on Netflix and wanted to tell people. Or if I went on a bad date with a guy and wanted to let my friends know. It\u2019s perfect for this decade. At the risk of sounding extremely trite, if you look at society today, the general mood is a mix of joyful, frustrating, worrying \u2013 like the emoji. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of scholars who would probably turn their noses up at emojis, but, good or bad, they\u2019ve affected the way we speak to each other.

Sixteen African inventors from six countries \u2013 including, for the first time, Malawi \u2013 have been shortlisted to receive funding, training and mentoring for projects intended to revolutionise sectors ranging from agriculture and banking to women\u2019s health. The winner will be awarded \u00a325,000 and the three runners-up will receive \u00a310,000 each.</p> <p>This year\u2019s inventions include facial recognition software to prevent financial fraud, a low-cost digital microscope to speed up cervical cancer diagnosis, and two separate innovations made from water hyacinth plants. Four inventors spoke to the Guardian about their innovations and their plans to change Africa for the better.</p> <h2><strong>Ghana: </strong><strong>tackling online fraud</strong></h2> <p>Identity fraud and cybercrime are big business in Ghana, where financial institutions spend about $400m (\u00a3306m) a year verifying their customers.

I thought: \u2018I\u2019m a software engineer, let\u2019s talk to banks and see what we can do about this.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Along with two friends she met while studying a tech training programme offered by the Accra-based Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology, N\u2019Guessan developed software that uses facial recognition and artificial intelligence to verify identities remotely. Their invention, Bace API, replaces existing methods such as two-step verification or password memorisation. Instead, live images or short videos taken on phone cameras are used to detect whether the image is of a real person, or a photo of an existing image. It then matches the picture or short video to either a pre-saved reference photo, or the person\u2019s government-issued identity documents.</p> <p>\u201cIf it matches, it means the person accessing the services is the same person, it\u2019s not a fake account or a robot,\u201d says N\u2019Guessan. \u201cWe have to make sure it\u2019s a human.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84ee4a433cb08c9ec37923cc8ae7be8c7d237985\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ee4a433cb08c9ec37923cc8ae7be8c7d237985/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bace API software matches live imagery with stored photos or identity documents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bace API software matches live imagery with stored photos or identity documents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/Africa prize for engineering innovation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bace API is currently being used by two local financial organisations. N\u2019Guessan plans to roll out services to more clients within the next three months, primarily in Ghana and Nigeria. She also aims to partner with universities to create a database of students who don\u2019t currently have government-issued ID cards, helping them to gain access to financial services.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many universities in Ghana, yet so many students miss out on being able to open bank accounts simply because they don\u2019t have passports or driving licences,\u201d she says. \u201cWith Bace API they\u2019d be able to use their university ID cards instead. Students would benefit and businesses would tap into a whole new market as well.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Uganda: </strong><strong>cervical cancer screening</strong></h2> <p>In 2016, William Wasswa was preparing medical equipment to help pathologists manually analyse pap smears for cervical cancer. The complicated process was time-consuming and prone to error, and wasn\u2019t helped by long queues of female patients waiting outside the lab for their test results. The experience gave Wasswa, 30, a biomedical sciences assistant lecturer at Uganda\u2019s Mbarara University, an idea how to improve things.</p> <p>\u201cCervical cancer is the leading cause of death among female cancer patients in Uganda, and I\u2019ve lost family and friends to the disease,\u201d says Wasswa. \u201cBut misdiagnosis is very common.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Academy of Engineering\u2019s Africa prize, now in its sixth year, is the continent\u2019s biggest award for engineering innovation. Sixteen African inventors from six countries \u2013 including, for the first time, Malawi \u2013 have been shortlisted to receive funding, training and mentoring for projects intended to revolutionise sectors ranging from agriculture and banking to women\u2019s health. The winner will be awarded \u00a325,000 and the three runners-up will receive \u00a310,000 each. This year\u2019s inventions include facial recognition software to prevent financial fraud, a low-cost digital microscope to speed up cervical cancer diagnosis, and two separate innovations made from water hyacinth plants. Four inventors spoke to the Guardian about their innovations and their plans to change Africa for the better. Ghana: tackling online fraud Identity fraud and cybercrime are big business in Ghana, where financial institutions spend about $400m (\u00a3306m) a year verifying their customers. For Ivory Coast tech entrepreneur Charlette N\u2019Guessan, 25, who led research into what technology Ghanaian banks were using to prevent fraud, the cost was far too high. \u201cWe live in the age of data and fraudsters are getting smarter every day,\u201d says N\u2019Guessan, one of six women shortlisted for the prize. \u201cOnline fraud is very high in Africa, and although financial institutions spend a lot of money trying to fix it, they don\u2019t have a real system to prevent it. I thought: \u2018I\u2019m a software engineer, let\u2019s talk to banks and see what we can do about this.\u2019\u201d Along with two friends she met while studying a tech training programme offered by the Accra-based Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology, N\u2019Guessan developed software that uses facial recognition and artificial intelligence to verify identities remotely. Their invention, Bace API, replaces existing methods such as two-step verification or password memorisation. Instead, live images or short videos taken on phone cameras are used to detect whether the image is of a real person, or a photo of an existing image. It then matches the picture or short video to either a pre-saved reference photo, or the person\u2019s government-issued identity documents. \u201cIf it matches, it means the person accessing the services is the same person, it\u2019s not a fake account or a robot,\u201d says N\u2019Guessan. \u201cWe have to make sure it\u2019s a human.\u201d Bace API is currently being used by two local financial organisations. N\u2019Guessan plans to roll out services to more clients within the next three months, primarily in Ghana and Nigeria. She also aims to partner with universities to create a database of students who don\u2019t currently have government-issued ID cards, helping them to gain access to financial services. \u201cThere are so many universities in Ghana, yet so many students miss out on being able to open bank accounts simply because they don\u2019t have passports or driving licences,\u201d she says. \u201cWith Bace API they\u2019d be able to use their university ID cards instead. Students would benefit and businesses would tap into a whole new market as well.\u201d Uganda: cervical cancer screening In 2016, William Wasswa was preparing medical equipment to help pathologists manually analyse pap smears for cervical cancer. The complicated process was time-consuming and prone to error, and wasn\u2019t helped by long queues of female patients waiting outside the lab for their test results. The experience gave Wasswa, 30, a biomedical sciences assistant lecturer at Uganda\u2019s Mbarara University, an idea how to improve things. \u201cCervical cancer is the leading cause of death among female cancer patients in Uganda, and I\u2019ve lost family and friends to the disease,\u201d says Wasswa. \u201cBut misdiagnosis is very common. I said to myself: \u2018This process could be sped up and improved by using artificial intelligence.\u2019\u201d An estimated 100,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in sub-Saharan Africa, and 62% are expected to die if they don\u2019t receive treatment. Women who are HIV-positive are five times more likely to develop the preventable disease, which is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), the world\u2019s most common sexually transmitted infection. Women in Uganda are disproportionately affected by HIV, accounting for 59% of the 1.3 million adults living with the disease. Wasswa was inspired to transform the entire process of cervical cancer screening in Uganda. Instead of relying on low-cost microscopes \u2013 which, though ubiquitous in labs across the nation, are unable to digitally store samples for analysis \u2013 he developed a digital microscope slide scanner to study high-resolution cervical cell images from pap smears, using a 3D printer to make the parts. The device has very good results and only costs a quarter of the price of commercial microscopes, he says. He then turned his attention to the poor management of patients\u2019 records, none of which are digitised. Again, Wasswa designed specialist software, this time to assess the likelihood of a patient contracting cervical cancer given her risk factors, as well as a separate system for managing and archiving patients\u2019 records using AI. \u201cRight now, there is almost no follow-up for patients, no reminder when they should come in for their next smear, but our platform also provides telemedicine support,\u201d he says. Finally, Wasswa created a tool to diagnose and classify cancerous images and plans to establish a repository of images that can be used for cancer research. Overall, his system has had 90-100% accuracy and has been published in peer-reviewed academic journals. \u201cOur classification system has had very good results, over 98%, but we want to keep improving,\u201d said Wasswa, who is collecting more data to capture the exact workflow of Ugandan hospitals. \u201cWe need a dataset based on the Ugandan population, which we can hopefully one day compare with classification models from India or China or the US. And by engaging different stakeholders, such as the ministry of health, we can integrate the system across the whole country.\u201d Kenya: water hyacinth cake Jack Oyugi\u2019s first job out of university was as a dairy farm manager in Mombasa. As the farm was spending 70% of its expenses on animal feed alone, making a profit was nearly impossible. Oyugi travelled to neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda to source cheaper protein sources such as sunflower and soya to feed his livestock, before realising there was a potential protein at home that he could harvest instead: water hyacinth. The invasive weed, native to South America, first appeared in Africa in the early 1900s. After spreading from the Cape and clogging up major dams and rivers, it made its way to Lake Victoria, where it has closed off fishing routes and provided a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes. (The plant, dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s worst aquatic weed\u201d, is also the focus of another engineering prize invention: Kenyan finalist Richard Arwa has created a clean cooking ethanol made from invasive water hyacinth.) Oyugi, who hails from western Kenya, remembers watching livestock graze on the leaves of water hyacinth during droughts. \u201cThey\u2019d just graze on the leaves and then move on. But it made me think maybe there was something in it that the animals didn\u2019t like too much, as they didn\u2019t eat the whole plant. That was when I got the idea to process it,\u201d he says. After taking on a new job as a government researcher in veterinary science, Oyugi, now 28, got funding to experiment with the plant. His first hyacinth cake had about 20% protein \u2013 equivalent to sunflower cake, which is sold in Kenyan markets as animal feed \u2013 but Oyugi then created a patented fermentation process using a fungus to increase the protein levels to 50%, comparable to soya. The water hyacinth is steam boiled, dried, crushed and fermented to make a powder, which is then mixed with minerals and energy-rich materials like maize bran to make an affordable feed sold at a fraction of the price of soya feed. In a pilot study, Kenyan farmers experienced a 20% increase in milk production and 30% decrease in feed costs after using Oyugi\u2019s water hyacinth recipe. Oyugi has received about $50,000 (\u00a338,000) from the Kenyan government to work on the product and, if he wins the engineering prize, plans on rolling the hyacinth feed out to other African countries plagued by the weed, including Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to stop our lake from dying,\u201d says Oyugi. \u201cWater hyacinth is here to stay and it is so difficult to get rid of that we need to find a way to work with it. The byproducts from making the feed can be sold as fertilisers and we employ the fishermen as [hyacinth] harvesters, as they can no longer fish because the hyacinth levels are so high.\u201d Ghana: bamboo bicycles Cycling enthusiast Bernice Dapaah grew up using her bike to get to and from school on the outskirts of Kumasi in southern Ghana.

The attendance of 931 marked the club\u2019s lowest since 1936. Chesterfield\u2019s 1-0 defeat damned them to five straight home losses, a sequence the club has recorded only once before. Three years after competing in League One, Chesterfield are 22nd in the National League and in danger of a third relegation in four years. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/02/chesterfield-relegation-from-football-league\">\u2018It is an absolute travesty\u2019: Chesterfield's fall from Football League | David Conn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI have to say this to [the fans]: they\u2019ve never had it so good over the last six years, have they?\u201d Dave Allen, the owner, told the BBC last year. He first invested in the club in 2009 and took over as chairman in 2012. </p> <p>It was in 2012 that Chesterfield hired Paul Cook, who guided them to the League Two title in 2014 and the League One play-offs in 2015. The following season Cook departed for Portsmouth and players such as Eoin Doyle and Sam Clucas were quickly sold. The managerial hires have failed to alter the club\u2019s downward trajectory.</p> <p>The latest is John Sheridan, who is in his second spell. Chesterfield started the season by failing to win any of their first 10 matches and have lost six of their past nine. On Boxing Day a 2-0 lead over Solihull evaporated, the visitors equalising in the fifth minute of stoppage time; they travel to Halifax on Saturday.</p> <p>After a difficult 2-1 defeat by Bromley in September Sheridan publicly questioned his decision to return. \u201cI could\u2019ve waited around, I didn\u2019t have to come back to Chesterfield,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI could have probably got a job and got higher. People warned me about coming down to this level.\u201d</p> <p>The financial problems were apparent, even during the better days. When Chesterfield won League Two in 2013-14 they were operating on losses of \u00a31.06m and they recorded profits of \u00a385,000 and \u00a340,000 in 2015 and 2016 respectively, after selling several players.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7e994867b1f2c33fc7ebdc2b82755cab843060a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e994867b1f2c33fc7ebdc2b82755cab843060a/0_67_4201_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Sheridan, in his second spell as Chesterfield\u2019s manager, said: \u2018People warned me about coming down to this level.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Sheridan, in his second spell as Chesterfield\u2019s manager, said: \u2018People warned me about coming down to this level.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As of 30 June the club owed \u00a39.2m to Allen, even after he wrote off \u00a32m in loans. He has put the club up for sale several times since his attempts to lift them to the Championship failed. \u201cThe one thing I have done, I\u2019ve supported the club because I\u2019ve kept putting money in every month to pay the wages, which nobody in Chesterfield\u2019s willing to do,\u201d he has said.</p> <p>Numerous incidents have eroded trust in the management of the club. Chesterfield admitted to fielding a reserve player, Liam Graham, under false names, Jake Hudson and Tom Jarrald, between November 2015 and January 2016. Then there was \u201crafflegate\u201d, when the club advertised a fundraiser in 2016 with the prize of accompanying the team during preseason. Only four tickets were sold and Chesterfield announced the prize had been won by Surrey-based James Higgins, who was too sick to attend.

      "bodyText": "Chesterfield\u2019s stadium is clean and handsome with a capacity of 10,504 and in recent memory delirious crowds were roaring the Spireites into the League One play-offs; but no amount of solid architecture can distract from the gloom within. In mid-December Chesterfield hosted Notts County in the FA Trophy at the Proact Stadium but only 595 home fans turned up. The attendance of 931 marked the club\u2019s lowest since 1936. Chesterfield\u2019s 1-0 defeat damned them to five straight home losses, a sequence the club has recorded only once before. Three years after competing in League One, Chesterfield are 22nd in the National League and in danger of a third relegation in four years. \u201cI have to say this to [the fans]: they\u2019ve never had it so good over the last six years, have they?\u201d Dave Allen, the owner, told the BBC last year. He first invested in the club in 2009 and took over as chairman in 2012. It was in 2012 that Chesterfield hired Paul Cook, who guided them to the League Two title in 2014 and the League One play-offs in 2015. The following season Cook departed for Portsmouth and players such as Eoin Doyle and Sam Clucas were quickly sold. The managerial hires have failed to alter the club\u2019s downward trajectory. The latest is John Sheridan, who is in his second spell. Chesterfield started the season by failing to win any of their first 10 matches and have lost six of their past nine. On Boxing Day a 2-0 lead over Solihull evaporated, the visitors equalising in the fifth minute of stoppage time; they travel to Halifax on Saturday. After a difficult 2-1 defeat by Bromley in September Sheridan publicly questioned his decision to return. \u201cI could\u2019ve waited around, I didn\u2019t have to come back to Chesterfield,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI could have probably got a job and got higher. People warned me about coming down to this level.\u201d The financial problems were apparent, even during the better days. When Chesterfield won League Two in 2013-14 they were operating on losses of \u00a31.06m and they recorded profits of \u00a385,000 and \u00a340,000 in 2015 and 2016 respectively, after selling several players. As of 30 June the club owed \u00a39.2m to Allen, even after he wrote off \u00a32m in loans. He has put the club up for sale several times since his attempts to lift them to the Championship failed. \u201cThe one thing I have done, I\u2019ve supported the club because I\u2019ve kept putting money in every month to pay the wages, which nobody in Chesterfield\u2019s willing to do,\u201d he has said. Numerous incidents have eroded trust in the management of the club. Chesterfield admitted to fielding a reserve player, Liam Graham, under false names, Jake Hudson and Tom Jarrald, between November 2015 and January 2016. Then there was \u201crafflegate\u201d, when the club advertised a fundraiser in 2016 with the prize of accompanying the team during preseason. Only four tickets were sold and Chesterfield announced the prize had been won by Surrey-based James Higgins, who was too sick to attend. James Higgins did not exist. In 2018 the director Ashley Carson sent a message to a former club mascot: \u201cBe very careful Paul, step one foot out of the truth and I will go for you,\u201d it read. In a statement Carson described it as a \u201cfriendly warning\u201d after inaccurate comments had been made. And in July 2018 the club was fined \u00a312,500 by the FA for allowing an affiliated third party company, Chesterfield Football Club Football Development School, to pay the wages of two players, Jake Orrell and Myles Wright. To add to the problems, in September the then captain Anthony Gerrard responded to a supporter\u2019s taunt on Twitter by telling them he had been \u201crifling\u201d their mother. He was later stripped of the captaincy. The attendance figures reflect apathy among supporters, many of whom are desperate for a change in ownership. \u201cWe have very good training facilities and one of the nicest grounds in the league so there is a potential there to become a high League One team, even maybe Championship team, which was the dream,\u201d one of them, Ben Ramsdale, said. \u201cSo it\u2019s surprising nobody has come in or is interested in taking over the club.\u201d Falling into the National League seemed unthinkable not so long ago. Now it is not certain Chesterfield have even hit rock bottom.",

But I suspect over time, we will see a difference in the reactions to a male of a certain age coming in and taking photographs to women coming in.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that these female sports photographers are going to be able to get into the locker room and into those spaces that maybe a man couldn\u2019t and and that\u2019s going to then affect the stories that we tell around women\u2019s sport too.\u201d</p>",

The decision to take on two together felt important, too. \u201cYou go to games, you know how much abuse a poor female photographer gets,\u201d Swift adds. \u201cSo giving them the power of being able to stick together was very important.\u201c Some of the biggest barriers faced by women photographers are faced my many other women workers in freelance and casual industries \u2013 antisocial hours, tough conditions and prohibitively expensive equipment. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a solution that we can all say \u2018oh, if we do that, then things will change.\u2019 But it\u2019s it\u2019s those little decisions we make along the way that matter,\u201d says Swift. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky one because that that\u2019s exactly what we get told is that female photographers get to the point where they can\u2019t be bothered with the hassle of it and go on and do something else, and it\u2019s those things have to be looked at in more detail.\u201d The effects of having female photographers following female athletes is not something very measurable, but Swift is hopeful that a more representative industry will throw up different, closer coverage. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell right now what our female sports photographers bring to an image versus our male photographer because they are equally as good, they are all highly skilled photographers. But I suspect over time, we will see a difference in the reactions to a male of a certain age coming in and taking photographs to women coming in. \u201cI suspect that these female sports photographers are going to be able to get into the locker room and into those spaces that maybe a man couldn\u2019t and and that\u2019s going to then affect the stories that we tell around women\u2019s sport too.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Clarence Thomas, the longest serving justice of the supreme court, is Donald Trump\u2019s favourite judge. He is also, along with Brett Kavanaugh, one of the few members of the court most of us have heard of \u2013 mainly due to the accusations brought against both men by women. Apart from his association with law professor Anita Hill \u2013 who in 1991 made allegations of sexual harassment against him \u2013 Thomas is known in the US for his silence on the bench, but what Corey Robin argues in this superb book is that,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/feb/29/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-asks-question-10-year-silence\" title=\"\"> even when he does speak</a>, no one hears what he has to say.</p> <p>A conservative with an almost visionary faith in the morality of capitalism, Thomas is also a black nationalist. America, Robin argues, \u201chas seen black conservatives. It has seen black nationalists. It has seen conservative black nationalists. It has never seen a conservative black nationalist on the Supreme Court.\u201d Thomas\u2019s politics are based on his belief that the state can do nothing for African Americans other than perpetuate an underclass and that positive discrimination can only disable black men (there is no room in Thomas\u2019s \u201cdreamscape\u201d, as Robin puts it, for black women). </p> <p>Robin is a left-leaning political theorist with an interest in the reactionary mind and Thomas, a figure of bottomless complexity, is thus his ultimate challenge. Like all the best biographies <em>The Enigma of Clarence Thomas</em> aims to reveal the inner workings of its subject, and Robin achieves this not by trawling through Thomas\u2019s private life and talking to his colleagues but by anatomising his 700 authored opinions, including those on abortion, gun rights and campaign financing. Placing his judicial opinions at the centre of his black nationalism, and his black nationalism at the centre of his identity as a black man, Robin makes what he calls Thomas\u2019s \u201cinvisible justice visible\u201d, and in doing so he reveals the invisibility of Thomas himself. Robin takes for his epilogue the words of the unnamed black protagonist in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/26/fiction.comment\" title=\"\">Ralph Ellison</a>\u2019s novel, <em>Invisible Man</em>: \u201cI am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018Thomas\u2019s politics are based on his belief that\u00a0the state can\u00a0do nothing for African Americans. Segregation is the only solution\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The man Robin brings into focus \u201chas chosen to express himself and his politics through a medium that puts severe constraints on how that politics and self may be expressed\u201d. Robin himself, however, expresses Thomas\u2019s politics with a consistent clarity and as much impartiality as he can muster: \u201cHis beliefs are disturbing, even ugly; his style is brutal. I want to make us sit with that discomfort rather than swat it away.\u201d By maintaining his authorial distance, Robin creates the impression of not hearing so much as overhearing Thomas\u2019s thought process.</p> <p>Born in Pinpoint, Georgia in 1948, Thomas was raised by his grandparents when his mother, a maid, could no longer afford to look after her three children. Thomas\u2019s biological father left when he was two, and was thereafter referred to by him as \u201cC\u201d; his mother was known as \u201cPigeon\u201d. His grandfather, Myers Anderson, who Clarence called Daddy, was a self-employed businessman whose own grandfather had been a slave. Anderson, who ran a successful fuel oil business and a set of rental homes, was, Thomas said, \u201cthe greatest man I have ever known\u201d and it was Daddy who provided the model for his later paternalistic vision of the black man as protector of and provider for the family.</p> <p>Thomas described in his memoir, <em>A Grandfather\u2019s Son</em>, how Anderson \u201cloomed over us like a dark behemoth, instilling fear and demanding absolute adherence to all his edicts, however arbitrary they might appear to be\u201d. Accepting government aid, Anderson counselled, meant giving up your manhood and he would \u201cprefer to starve to death first\u201d. Depending on government handouts, he further explained, is \u201ca more deceptive\u201d form of slavery. The clarity of Jim Crow was preferable to the mush of liberalism, because hardship and struggle are better for the black man\u2019s sense of self than the culture of dependence and condescension. From his grandfather, Thomas learned not only the value of self-sufficiency but the importance of money. It will be through capitalism rather than the ballot box, Thomas believes, that the black American will be freed. Electoral politics can only confirm white power, but money can allow a man to speak and be heard. The Thomas revealed by Robin is a prophet of pessimism whose America is a place of \u201cmen armed to the teeth, people locked up in jails, money ruling all, and racial conflict as far as the eye can see\u201d.</p> <p>Raised a Catholic, Thomas\u2019s nickname in the playground was \u201cABC\u201d, short for \u201cAmerica\u2019s Blackest Child\u201d. \u201cIf he were any blacker,\u201d his classmates jeered, \u201che\u2019d be blue.\u201d From school he went on to the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, where he majored in English literature, founded the black student union and learned by heart the speeches of Malcolm X.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"81b1261d5cf5a53c2b3c9a3eed775b61d629b764\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81b1261d5cf5a53c2b3c9a3eed775b61d629b764/236_0_1801_1959/919.jpg\" alt=\"Anita Hill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991.\" width=\"919\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anita Hill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Law/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After graduating from Yale law school in 1974, Thomas read Richard Sowell\u2019s <em>Race and Economics</em> and swerved to the right. What is striking about his conversion, as Robin describes it, is that the militancy of his youth remained unaltered. When Thomas joined the Reagan administration in 1981 he was the same black nationalist as before. The programme of black self-sufficiency that he embraced at Holy Cross remained the bedrock of his politics and he set out his vision in the Atlantic Monthly: \u201cThere is nothing you can do to get past black skin. I don\u2019t care how educated you are, how good you are \u2013 you\u2019ll never have the same contacts or opportunities, you\u2019ll never be seen as equal to whites.\u201d</p> <p>It was in Washington, as chairman of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that Thomas encountered Hill, whose accusations of sexual harasment were made 10 years later, in 1991. Because Robin is interested in what we don\u2019t know about Thomas rather than what we do, he does not rehearse the details of Hill\u2019s testimony before the judiciary committee. Robin casts doubt on Thomas\u2019s account to the Senate, and details his argument in a chapter explaining the judge\u2019s views on black paternalism. Thomas regarded Hill\u2019s accusations, which he denied, and the subsequent media attention as a form of lynching. \u201cI have been harmed worse than I have ever been harmed in my life,\u201d he said of the Hill hearing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t harmed by the Klan, I wasn\u2019t harmed by the Knights of Camelia, I wasn\u2019t harmed by the Aryan race, I wasn\u2019t harmed by a racist group. I was harmed by this process which accommodated these attacks.\u201d</p> <p>The attack on his masculine authority confirmed what he had long suspected about the disempowerment of black men. The father, Thomas says, is \u201cthe founder, the originator, the leader\u201d, the \u201csetter of standards\u201d, the \u201csetter of direction\u201d and \u201cthe setter of rules\u201d. Thomas considers the effects of being raised without a father figure, Robin argues, to be \u201cdevastating\u201d. His own mother would have been \u201ca disaster, unable to provide the structure, the hard rules and firm authority\u201d that his grandfather was able to supply. \u201cTo stay there,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cwould have doomed me to a dismal life of ignorance, perhaps even of crime \u2013 a life lost before it started.\u201d His sister Emma, raised by an aunt, is a case in point: \u201cShe isn\u2019t educated. She works in the crab factory, picking crabs, just like my mother did. My brother is a comptroller of a Sheraton Hotel in Chicago. He\u2019s got an accounting degree. And my grandfather is responsible for that.\u201d</p> <p>Blind to the inequality that ensures the future of boys is worth more than that of girls, and indifferent to the importance of caregiving, Thomas holds fast to his belief that \u201cthe salvation of our race\u201d depends on \u201cthe strength and the will of black men\u201d. The women in his dreamscape remain invisible.

Look, I see merit in four-day Tests if it means getting an extra fixture into series that would otherwise be one or two. Take the disgraceful way Australian administrators have treated Bangladesh, a nation they haven\u2019t hosted in Test cricket since 2003. If four-day affairs can help with that, well, it\u2019s worth a look. Tim Wigmore has written passionately on this point, one that New Zealand officials are keen on for similar reasons.

Even so, it didn\u2019t feel like this was the next move after such a relentless first hour for the home side. Latham takes full advantage, twice carving shorter balls behind point, the second of those beating Lyon to the rope. It\u2019s a no-ball, too. He gets half an over at de Grandhomme, which is a better match-up for his away-swingers. The all-rounder obliges, driving at the first of those, stopped in Wade\u2019s follow through.

He requires 49 further runs today in order to overtake Stephen Fleming as New Zealand\u2019s highest Test runscorer. We\u2019ll keep an eye on that. Latham plays and misses his first delivery of the day, an excellent offering from around the wicket cutting away off the seam after angling in. Not a lot he can do about it. A <strong>huge shout from the Australians</strong> to finish the over! Cummins has beaten the inside edge and he wants an lbw decision; the fielders around the bat are also interested in whether it hit an inside edge on the way through before landing in Warner\u2019s diving hands at gully. They elect not to review and technology confirms that was the right call - the lbw was going over the stumps and the sound was bad on pad, not ball.

Day three, or moving day as we cricket writers call it when there\u2019s no better introduction to go with than ripping something off from golf. But for New Zealand, this is survival day first and foremost. At different periods through this series, the the visitors have found something from nothing. Having lost Kane Williamson, their skipper and superstar, not long before the close last night, they now need plenty to go their way if they are to withstand the inevitable Australian surge. In simple terms, they have to bat all day. <br></p> <p>With Ross Taylor, there is always hope of such a feat. Yes, he was lucky to survive a compelling leg before shout when James Pattinson was steaming in just before stumps, but the veteran is in form and has the patience for the task. Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls and BJ Watling have also achieved this often enough in Test cricket. The real quiz here is whether they can do so on this much bigger stage.</p> <p>For the home side, their quicks were swaming last night in the best traditions of a bowling group who had their feet up for nearly two days. It being Saturday, there\u2019s every reason to think there\u2019ll be another 60,000 Melburnians in to urge then on - especially Pattinson, the home town boy who has been waiting for an MCG return for eight years. With a hint of volatile bounce on show already, the dice is loaded their way. The Kiwis, of course, are still 223 away from the follow-on. Eeek.<br></p> <p>But let\u2019s be positive. Let\u2019s hope the Black Caps can show some of the backbone that has elevated them to the second ranked team in the world. Let\u2019s hope we\u2019re sitting here in seven hours with a serious contest on our hands. And if not, let\u2019s enjoy the world-class Australian bowlers going to work. And whatever the case, enjoy it with myself and JP Howcroft. <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">We\u2019re looking forward to your company.</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdPBOX-y7Pc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wdPBOX-y7Pc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "If day one was Australia\u2019s - just - and day two theirs convincingly, then day three was where they asserted their dominance over New Zealand in this Boxing Day Test, and in merciless fashion. Pat Cummins (5-28) and James Pattinson (3-34) tore through the visiting batting order with fast bowling that was in equal parts controlled and hostile. They exploited what was on offer in the surface, finding the right lengths to draw edges, ruffle feathers, and make batting look extraordinarily difficult. They were backed up by some smart fielding, as well as the handy relief options of Mitchell Starc (2-30) and Nathan Lyon (0-35). New Zealand were dismissed midway through the middle session but despite boasting a lead in excess of 300 Tim Paine opted against the follow on. That precipitated three hours of pretty ordinary cricket while the home pacemen put their feet up. Late in the day there was a lively half hour or so when a few wickets fell in a cluster, one of those again being Steve Smith (7) bodylined by the irrepressible Neil Wagner (2-39). Australia\u2019s lead is already enough for them to win two Test matches, such is the mismatch between their bowling and New Zealand\u2019s batting, but while they have the luxury of batting on the game will remain in this odd stasis. Let\u2019s hope for the punters making their way to the MCG on day four there is an early declaration and the battle proper can resume. To find out when New Zealand will once again have to face the music, join Adam Collins and I right here. 45th over: Australia 137-4 (Wade 15, Head 12) Neil Wagner bowls the final over of the day, but it\u2019s a laboured effort that Travis Head navigates safely. 44th over: Australia 136-4 (Wade 15, Head 11) Boult\u2019s short balls go for runs this over, the penultimate one of the day. First Wade cuts hard for four then he pulls in front of square for two. Australia are now in the safe waters of a lead in excess of 450. 43rd over: Australia 129-4 (Wade 9, Head 10) The TV broadcast spends most of the over avoiding Wagner\u2019s bumpers to Head, preferring instead to focus on the New Zealander\u2019s with their tops off en masse in the crowd, and showing highlights of Australia\u2019s surgical performance with the ball earlier in the day. Slightly fugged, after a hot stuffy afternoon watching a whole lot of nothing, it\u2019s easy to forget how eviscerating Cummins and Pattinson were this morning. 42nd over: Australia 127-4 (Wade 8, Head 9) Lovely shot from Head, ramping Boult from very close to his chest up and over Watling for four. Trademark hustle from Boult this over but Australia are wise to his full swinging yorkers and occasional bumper. 41st over: Australia 122-4 (Wade 7, Head 5) Wade does that weird thing again where he just accepts a Wagner bouncer thudding into his body - his right elbow on this occasion. It can\u2019t be an advisable tactic. 40th over: Australia 120-4 (Wade 6, Head 4) Despite waiting on the results of a scan on his injured right hand, Trent Boult is back for a spell bowling with his left. It starts innocuously, to the backdrop of an increasingly voluble Kiwi contingent in the cheap seats. 39th over: Australia 117-4 (Wade 5, Head 2) A comparatively uneventful Wagner over goes for a couple. Not long to go today now, our penance nearly done, and the contest proper can resume tomorrow. 38th over: Australia 115-4 (Wade 4, Head 1) Wade drives Southee square for a nice three. Meanwhile, Trent Boult has been taken for a scan on his right hand after he was hit on the glove while batting earlier on. 37th over: Australia 112-4 (Wade 1, Head 1) Wagner\u2019s having a bit of fun now out there, ignoring the match situation and just hurling rocks as hard as he can at Matthew Wade. Wade survives, but is fortunate a mistimed hook lands short of fine leg. Wagner is now the second-fastest Kiwi to 200 Test wickets, behind only Richard Hadlee. 36th over: Australia 110-4 (Wade 0, Head 0) Southee maiden. #Declarationspeculation can get an early night. Impressive numbers. 35th over: Australia 110-4 (Wade 0, Head 0) Wicket-maiden for Wagner, a man you know would make a very handy brother-in-law. I bet he\u2019s got all the tools. After a slow afternoon this is turning into quite a jolly old evening. With Smith on strike Williamson recalls Wagner to resume his bodyline-lite on the best since Bradman. Smith begins by mistiming another forehand smash then clips a relaxed pull shot straight to Southee at a slightly deeper than usual square-leg! Four times this series that plan has worked now. Australia are throwing away their *checks notes* 429 run lead. 34th over: Australia 110-3 (Smith 7) After plenty of derision Santner is turning in a decent day\u2019s work. He now has 1-22 from his eight overs of increasingly tight bowling. Eamonn Maloney opens a big old can of worms on the email. \u201cA couple of mates of 20+ years mispronounce my name. No big deal, just too much emphasis on the o. It just got too late to correct them. I still think there\u2019s time for Ricky \u2018Lahhhhbuschagne\u2019 Ponting if someone would just have a quiet word.\u201d Here\u2019s the official record, which to my reading, indicates we\u2019re all pronouncing Labuschagne incorrectly - but with his consent - in favour of an easier life. Very Orazio Fantasia areas. Santner finally gets in on the act when Burns doesn\u2019t get enough on a dab to third-man and Watling takes a fine catch stood up to the stumps. 33rd over: Australia 108-2 (Burns 34, Smith 6) Oi oi! Smith has come out in Glenn Maxwell T20 beast mode, forehand smashing Southee through mid-on for four and turning ones into twos like he\u2019s twocced something (Australian ownership of the Finn brothers, perhaps?). Maybe we can fire up #Declarationspeculation after all? 32nd over: Australia 101-2 (Burns 33, Smith 0) A much better over from Santner, capped by the terrific fielding. Well, that was dumb. Labuschagne runs himself out, taking on Latham\u2019s arm at short fine-leg. The ground fielding was sharp but Santner\u2019s gather at the non-striker\u2019s end to complete the dismissal was even better. Actually, that was behind square, so it was probably Burns\u2019 call. He owes his Queensland teammate a XXXX. 31st over: Australia 100-1 (Burns 32, Labuschagne 19) Just the single from Southee\u2019s over. Play since drinks has not been thrilling. 30th over: Australia 99-1 (Burns 32, Labuschagne 18) Just the single from Santner\u2019s over. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Brendan Brown. \u201cYou know things aren\u2019t going well for NZ when a commentator brings up the underarm ball from almost 40 years ago.\u201d My favourite of that genre is when a captain makes what proves to be a poor decision at the toss and everyone piles on Ricky Ponting and/or Nasser Hussain; two of the most erudite and likeable voices in the modern game. This is why we can\u2019t have nice things anymore. 29th over: Australia 98-1 (Burns 32, Labuschagne 17) Bazinga! Southee\u2019s first delivery is launched by the hitherto becalmed Burns straight over the sightscreen for six runs so handsome you could call them Hemsworth. With the blood still flowing Burns cuts four more! Just in case that was all a hallucination, it\u2019s time for drinks. 28th over: Australia 88-1 (Burns 22, Labuschagne 17) Four singles from Santner\u2019s latest over. The Kiwi spinner is failing to play his way into the Sydney Test. 27th over: Australia 84-1 (Burns 20, Labuschagne 15) Tim Southee replaces Neil Wagner and his first over back goes for one. Joe Burns is now 20 from 74 balls. Speaking of things to keep you occupied for an hour-and-a-half or so, you could do worse than watch this documentary on the cultural impact of rave culture in the UK. 26th over: Australia 83-1 (Burns 20, Labuschagne 14) Australia milk five from Santner\u2019s throwdowns. The lead is now over 400; 402 to be precise. Make your own fun for the next hour-and-a-half. 25th over: Australia 78-1 (Burns 20, Labuschagne 9) Not Wagner\u2019s best effort this time. A bouncer called a wide is among a hotchpotch of deliveries both batsmen convert into runs. 24th over: Australia 70-1 (Burns 17, Labuschagne 5) 90 minutes or so left in the day, still no indication Australia are going to declare tonight. Santner skips through a benign over-rate booster. Meanwhile, New Zealand\u2019s fans in the stands join in the grim tradition of applauding themselves after singing their own national anthem. 23rd over: Australia 67-1 (Burns 16, Labuschagne 3) Wagner is playing a different game to his teammates, peppering Labuschagne and Burns with short balls mixed with the odd well-placed yorker to keep the batsmen guessing. Stifled appeals for a glove behind and LBW come to nought. 22nd over: Australia 66-1 (Burns 16, Labuschagne 2) Santner, bowling to a new batsman without a slip, does not win back the unconditional support of the selectors with an over so mundane its aura would be ecru. 21st over: Australia 63-1 (Burns 14, Labuschagne 1) Wagner rarely goes wicketless in an innings. That\u2019s the 12th innings in a row he\u2019s celebrated at least one dismissal. In 86 attempts he\u2019s only failed to take a wicket 12 times - but on five of those occasions he bowled fewer than ten overs. Out of nowhere, a wicket. And a wild wicket it is too. Wagner comes around the wicket, Warner steps miles to leg, Wagner drops short, Warner slaps hard with a horizontal bat, Blundell holds onto a stinger at cover. 20th over: Australia 62-0 (Warner 38, Burns 14) Of the few subplots on offer this innings this is perhaps the most significant, the introduction of Mitchell Santner. Another poor showing from the left-arm spinner may well spell the end of his time in a Black Cap (for now, anyway). He starts by conceding four singles and looking as toothless as a champion gurner. 19th over: Australia 58-0 (Warner 36, Burns 12) Wagner\u2019s doggedness from around the wicket keeps Warner honest for four balls before Australia\u2019s openers exchange well-run singles. 18th over: Australia 56-0 (Warner 35, Burns 11) \u201cIt looks to me like he\u2019s just going through the motions a little bit.\u201d Not my words, the words of Ricky Thomas Ponting, on the batting of Joe Burns. Another CdG over drifts by like a counted sheep. 17th over: Australia 54-0 (Warner 34, Burns 11) Wa - and I cannot emphasise this enough - hey! After 48 balls scratching around for 7, Burns whipcracks a pull of crisp precision off Wagner to move into double figures. 16th over: Australia 49-0 (Warner 33, Burns 7) Warner tickles CdG fine for four then rotates strike. Burns continues to look like a man who\u2019s been told the ball is actually a priceless Faberge egg that should be treated with the utmost delicacy. Robin Hobbs has emailed to praise Mac Millings for his 12 days of Christmas. \u201cGreat work by Mac Millings. But not including post war Aussie spinner Doug Ring feels like a miss.\u201d 15th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 28, Burns 7) First authentic chance of the innings goes begging. Wagner finds the shoulder of Warner\u2019s bat but Southee can\u2019t grab a difficult low chance diving full stretch at second slip. Abhijato Sensarma picks up on the earlier topic of Australia now blossoming into an excellent Test cricket unit, with a trip to India again the major question mark over their quality. \u201cLet\u2019s look at how they need to go about it conventionally - they need two or three excellent spinners in their side. One is Lyon for sure, but who will be the other two? That\u2019s their biggest area of concern. Also, as many articles have pointed out after the conclusion of India\u2019s Test season this year, there\u2019s been a trend - pacers have been doing exceedingly well on international surfaces in the country. And they have often stood out to be the biggest difference between the home team and the visitors. The Australians have one of the best units in the world, however - going to be an epic showdown next time they visit the subcontinent, eh?\u201d. 14th over: Australia 37-0 (Warner 22, Burns 6) Burns dabs a single and Warner slashes three from a CdG over delivered with all the intent of a dads v lads knockabout. 13th over: Australia 33-0 (Warner 19, Burns 5) Wagner has the ball for the first time this innings but he\u2019s too wide to Warner, allowing the Australian opener to cut for three. He\u2019s tighter to Burns, who shows no indication Australia\u2019s game plan is to declare this evening. This is an instructive stat. It also hides some brutal conditions in which to field too. Ok, play will resume shortly. It will cease for the day 39 overs from now, or - as is more likely - at 6pm local time. Spend your tea break with Mac Millings, who has emailed in his magnum opus.

Time for a 20-minute break from all that excitement. Hopefully Australia will spend it mapping out a strategy whereby they dash a bit after tea then give themselves half an hour with the ball. 12th over: Australia 28-0 (Warner 16, Burns 4) A couple of singles from CdG\u2019s avuncular over. Burns has raced to four from 34 deliveries. 11th over: Australia 26-0 (Warner 15, Burns 3) Over a 60% increase in Australia\u2019s second-innings score this over with Warner clipping a couple then driving Boult forcefully though cover for four. The bowler\u2019s disappointment is compounded when a short ball bobbles away for four byes after looping over a flailing BJ Watling. 10th over: Australia 16-0 (Warner 9, Burns 3) Colin de Grandhomme is the first bowling change of the innings but his arrival does not magically energise this torpid spectacle. We. Are. Going. Through. The. Motions. 9th over: Australia 15-0 (Warner 8, Burns 3) Oooh, genuine beauty from Boult that beats Warner outside off, followed up by one that spits off a length. 8th over: Australia 14-0 (Warner 7, Burns 3) Maiden from Southee. Maiden from Stratford: 7th over: Australia 14-0 (Warner 7, Burns 3) One more for Burns, couple more for Warner. Jeopardy in short supply. Australia lead by 331. 6th over: Australia 11-0 (Warner 5, Burns 2) If you want to know where New Zealand\u2019s fielders are stationed, just ask Joe Burns, because everything he hits finds one. Eventually he locates a gap and doubles his score. Burns has avoided the ignominy of an MCG pair. The last to endure the pain was Michael Atherton back in 1998. 5th over: Australia 10-0 (Warner 5, Burns 1) O Burnso! O Burnso! You are Burnso no more. A streaky single through gully means only Burns now. Or Joe. Or Burns Joe, to be sure. I\u2019ve been reading my four-year-old way too much Dr Seuss. 4th over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 5, Burns 0) New Zealand burnso through a review when Southee gets one to jag back into Warner from around the wicket. Erasmus declines the LBW appeal and DRS confirms his judgement that there was probably an inside-edge before the ball struck the pad. Maiden over. 3rd over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 5, Burns 0) Warner again gets off strike smartly, this time with a three through midwicket, allowing his partner to continue the pretence his name is actually Burnso. 2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 2, Burns 0) Tim Southee shares the new ball, and after Warner earns his second single of the innings, the right-arm swing bowler probes outside Burns\u2019 off stump. The Queenslander remains on a pair. \u201cCan\u2019t shake the feeling that this Aus v NZ series is like a rehearsal for the pasting England are facing in the next Ashes,\u201d emails Brian Withington. \u201cHow did Aus get so bloody good again at this game? Any chance Cummins &amp; co would like to spend more time with family, or focus on white ball cricket?\u201d Indeed Brian, Australia - and their attack in particular - is going to be very good for quite some time. For them, the only question remaining is whether it\u2019s equipped to do it in India? 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 1, Burns 0) Trent Boult opens for New Zealand, silencing the hubbub over his injured hand. It\u2019s a tidy start from the Kiwi quick, featuring a sharp single to David Warner and four legbyes off the pads of Joe Burns. Time to reawaken the #Declarationspeculation leviathan. 50 overs remaining today, so Australia could even be back out tonight. It would be unlikely though, so I\u2019d expect shortly after lunch tomorrow, giving them the best part of five sessions to dismiss New Zealand with a target of around 550 to defend. The players are back out onto the field for a 45-minute or so session before tea. It matters for Joe Burns, who remains uncertain of his medium term future in the side, but not a lot for anyone else. Now Adam\u2019s snatching some low quality shut-eye, remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. After that flurry of activity, a belated chance to thank Adam for his sterling work, and invite him to enjoy being awake at 3am, for now, and - once his soon-to-arrive firstborn pops out - forever. Australia have not enforced the follow on, so the remainder of the day will be centre wicket practice for Australia\u2019s top order. Boult moved to off, revealed his stumps, and Starc shot them down like tin ducks at a carnival popgun stall. When the fun stops, stop. 54th over: New Zealand 148-9 (Wagner 18, Boult 8) Lyon is brought on to replace Pattinson to finish it off, Boult immediately smashing him over long-on for six! It lands just short of the quasi-corporate enclosure in the bottom of the Great Southern Stand. Have that. He goes again, with far less force, his swipe landing at midwicket for a couple. Next? A reverse sweep! Oh, stop it Trent. Now Wagner smashes six more! Over long-on again, just clearing Head on the boundary there. An eventful way to round out my stint, 15 coming from the over. With that, and drinks on the field, I\u2019ll hand over to JP Howcroft. Will I see you tomorrow? I expect so... unless Australia pop them in again and finish it quick. Entirely possible. Bye! 53rd over: New Zealand 133-9 (Wagner 10, Boult 1) Boult wants nothing to do with Starc\u2019s array of short balls from around the wicket, dancing around the crease like Phil Tufnell. Very No11 areas. He\u2019s eventually off the mark taking a ball from a metre outside the off-stump down to fine leg with his back foot behind the stumps when he makes contact. Yeah, that\u2019s what I said. Wagner\u2019s turn and he strokes a lovely cover drive for four! The visiting fans love that. The physio is out at the end of the over - one of those short balls hit his right hand. Send in the magic spray. 52nd over: New Zealand 128-9 (Wagner 6, Boult 0) Wagner tries to hook Pattinson, the ball coming from the back of his bat over first slip for four. They\u2019ll take it. Andrew Samson on SEN notes that between them, Cummins and Pattinson have missed 135 Tests since their respective debuts in consecutive matches in November 2011. Blimey. Wagner has another go at Pattinson and this time the ball comes off the bottom of the bat spitting out to cover, but not to hand. The bouncer follows, which he misses. Will Australia enforce the follow-on? In Adelaide it was easier to justify because of the forecast rain - there\u2019s none of that this week. On that basis, I wonder whether they\u2019ll let the quicks have a breather? No rush here. Cummins gets his fifth! After playing and missing a couple of times, Southee edges the final ball of the over through to Paine, who claims his fifth catch too. Cummins has 11/45 in his most two recent Test bowling innings at the MCG. 51st over: New Zealand 124-9 (Wagner 2) 50th over: New Zealand 123-8 (Southee 10, Wagner 1) Edge, four! Pattinson finds he right part of Southee\u2019s bat but it flies through the cordon instead of going to hand. Wagner\u2019s turn later in the over, exposed two more of bouncers. He won\u2019t see many balls in his half. He does get off the mark with a clip, keeping the strike. Want to learn more about James Pattinson? Geoff Lemon and I sat down with him at Lord\u2019s in August on The Final Word podcast for an extended chat. Great fella. 49th over: New Zealand 117-8 (Southee 5, Wagner 0) Another near run out! Southee pushes Cummins\u2019 first ball to cover and takes off straight away, exposing Wagner to a diamond duck had Lyon\u2019s throw been on target. Of course, Wagner cops a bumper first up - they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. I\u2019m sure they will be sledging him relentlessly to go with it and I\u2019m even more certain that Wagner won\u2019t care. Another bouncer, ducked more convincingly the second time around. Wade now drops him at short leg! In and out! Played from the gloves, turned right into the fielder, but his fingers got tangled up in the helmet grille before arriving. It\u2019s hard to think of how Australia could have bowled better today. Pattinson\u2019s turn! It\u2019s a peach of a delivery, angling in before seaming away then catching the edge. The local boy loves it. He has 3/24. We aren\u2019t far away from Australia enforcing the follow-on here, their lead still 351 runs. 48th over: New Zealand 116-8 (Southee 4) 47th over: New Zealand 116-7 (Santner 3, Southee 4) Cummins now searches for a fifth, adding to the ten he took on this ground 12 months ago. For the briefest moment it appeared Southee might have given him that chance, flicking high in the air off his pads, but it doesn\u2019t go to the man at deep backward square. Latham didn\u2019t need to play at that but this is the pressure a bowler of Cummins\u2019 quality creates from that angle around the wicket. Quicker with a bit of shape after pitching - enough to find the outside edge, straight into Paine\u2019s gloves. 46th over: New Zealand 112-6 (Latham 50, Santner 3) Pattinson is too good for Santner\u2019s outside edge once more after probing in at the stumps earlier in the over. Classy bowling, moving it both ways at pace. Deserves a couple more. The quick bouncer is on him in a flash as well, ducked just in time. Oooi! Nearly a run out! Santner did well to play it with soft hands behind point and called Latham through for two. Coming back to the danger end, a direct hit and he was gone. Not to be. 45th over: New Zealand 110-6 (Latham 50, Santner 1) Latham has turned his last five Test half-centuries into tons. The trend of this innings would suggest he will run out of partners to do so again, but if Santner can find a way to hang around... okay, I won\u2019t get ahead of myself. A maiden from Cummins to the opener, both players at the top of their games. One edge is found, deflected with soft hands. 44th over: New Zealand 110-6 (Latham 50, Santner 1) Boy, he\u2019s earned that. Latham moves to his half-century with three past point, collected across 132 relentless deliveries. Pattinson will fancy is chances against Santner and goes very close to finding his edge with the final delivery of the over, sent down at pace. There are more than 40,000 people currently in the MCG today to go with 80,000 on day one and 60,000 on day two. A fantastic turn out from the sporting capital. 43rd over: New Zealand 107-6 (Latham 47, Santner 1) Huge inside edge for four first ball! Cummins was ever so close to either going through the gate or Latham chopping on from around the wicket. There\u2019s the bumper, ducked by the opener - his default option when it comes each over. That wouldn\u2019t be a bad study: in this series, has there been a greater percentage of short balls bowled since the provision was brought in to deny more than two bouncers an over? He gets one chance at Santner here, who was both lucky and vulnerable before the break... and he\u2019s through the gate! BIG shout for caught behind - not out. There was a sound as the ball past the blade but the conclusion from the captain, which the replay confirms, is that it was ball on pad not the inside edge. Yet another fine over. The players are back on the field. Cummins has the ball in his hand. Who else would you want to start a session? Latham is the man on strike, who batted so well after his life early in the day. PLAY! Six out of 137 (!). Today\u2019s was the first I haven\u2019t been at the ground to observe. A special report on a special bloke. I can\u2019t think of a better human being than Jesse Hogan, who I\u2019m sure all of you would know for his writing on our game. This is a fantastic piece about his recovery from the stroke that nearly killed him in 2016 and the book he triumphantly released before Christmas - For Cap and Country. 42nd over: New Zealand 102-6 (Latham 42, Santner 1) Big spin and considerable bounce from Lyon, who has bowled his own lovely spell leading into the lunch break. He beats Latham with one that goes a long way, taken tidily by Paine. The opener finishes the session positively, getting down the track to drive a single. 41st over: New Zealand 100-6 (Latham 41, Santner 1) Such good bowling, in keeping with the theme of the morning for all three Australian quicks. Latham isn\u2019t giving it away this close to lunch, the strike returning to Santner. The short ball arrives to finish, whacking him on the arm. This has been a nasty spell. They will get one more in, Lyon racing around to give his hat to ump to make sure of it. 40th over: New Zealand 100-6 (Latham 41, Santner 1) Probably Lyon\u2019s last over before lunch, with fielders around the bat including a silly point. Warne makes the good point that he rarely has a man under the lid on the off-side. He\u2019s getting him in the game with ample flight, Santner leaping forward to defend. There\u2019s enough turn there to beat the edge once, the left-hander doing well not to follow it. 39th over: New Zealand 100-6 (Latham 41, Santner 1) There are still plenty of Black Caps fans in the MCG and they give it big when the the 100 is brought up by Santner, off the mark (and out of the Starc firing line) in the process with his tuck behind square. Latham is well set, refusing to give an inch to the Australians. Strong from Ricky Ponting. When he talks, people listen. 38th over: New Zealand 99-6 (Latham 41, Santner 0) Lyon does his job, sending down a tidy over that gets Santner back on strike for Starc next up. 37th over: New Zealand 97-6 (Latham 39, Santner 0) The end of a successful over that should have been a double-wicket maiden for Starc. As Ian Smith clears up on telly, if there is a sweatband on the glove, it is part of the glove. That\u2019s conclusive - it was, therefore, his glove. It\u2019s beyond belief how often we are seeing mistakes in the third umpire\u2019s booth in Test cricket. The wicket from earlier in the over. NOT OUT! Unbelivable decision from Aleem Dar. It clearly hit Santner\u2019s glove wristband. You can see it move! IS SANTNER CAUGHT SECOND BALL? Starc\u2019s bumper came off something before landing in the cordon. About five players convince Paine to have a pop upstairs. Nup, he couldnt do it. de Grandhomme prods at the first ball of Starc\u2019s fresh over, staight into the hands of Warner at gully. No footwork. Poor cricket. 36th over: New Zealand 97-5 (Latham 39, de Grandhomme 11) Latham is setting in for a long stay - if he can find someone to ride shotgun, that is. Here, against Lyon, he plays inside a huge turning off-break before getting well forward to drive beautifully down the ground - shot of the morning. But then when de Grandhomme is at the business end, he nearly holes out to midwicket. Yes, the all-rounder is built to biff but he\u2019s not at all convincing so far so he has to support Latham by getting himself to lunch - not hitting out. 35th over: New Zealand 89-5 (Latham 32, de Grandhomme 10) Latham\u2019s turn for a Starc working over. But after getting underneath both the bouncers - coming from the first two balls - he\u2019s able to watch from the front foot for the rest of the set. 34th over: New Zealand 88-5 (Latham 31, de Grandhomme 10) Lyon is already bowling with serious flight and drift. He\u2019s going to be a handful here. Kerry O\u2019Keeffe says that he spoke to the spinner last night and he was excited to be bowling on an MCG track with some bounce. The last time he had one of those here, for the 2013-14 Ashes Test, he picked up a six-wicket bag in the second dig. 33rd over: New Zealand 85-5 (Latham 29, de Grandhomme 9) Starc wants in on this, attacking Latham\u2019s stumps with the opener getting his bat down just in time through an inside edge for a couple. There\u2019s the bouncer at de Grandhomme we\u2019ve been waiting for - a fast one, ducked. They will come at him constantly with this. 32nd over: New Zealand 80-5 (Latham 26, de Grandhomme 8) Nup - one and done: Wade is off, Lyon is on. He misses his mark first up, Latham taking full advantage with an easy sweep for four, fine of the man on the 45. Sure enough, he\u2019s right on it thereafter, flighting his stock delivery beautifully. By the middle of the set he\u2019s appealing for leg before wicket when the opener misses a clip after dancing at him. 31st over: New Zealand 76-5 (Latham 22, de Grandhomme 8) Starc had to wait a full hour to get his go this morning so he\u2019s had plenty of time to limber up, shown by how fast he\u2019s already sending them down. Early in the over he hits de Grandhomme on the pad before twice beating his inside edge. Oh, make it three! The all-rounder is nowhere near it so far in this innings. Will Wade continue? \u201cHi Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Graeme Thorn. \u201cI think the argument should be that the ICC should get teams to concentrate on getting their 90 overs bowled in the six hours before more are crammed in to allow four-day Tests.\u201d Yep, that too. Look, I see merit in four-day Tests if it means getting an extra fixture into series that would otherwise be one or two. Take the disgraceful way Australian administrators have treated Bangladesh, a nation they haven\u2019t hosted in Test cricket since 2003. If four-day affairs can help with that, well, it\u2019s worth a look. Tim Wigmore has written passionately on this point, one that New Zealand officials are keen on for similar reasons. But should bad behaviour be rewarded? 30th over: New Zealand 76-5 (Latham 22, de Grandhomme 8) Ummm, Matthew Wade replaces Pattinson for the first over after drinks. As I\u2019ve said before on the OBO, he takes a lot of scalps bowling in the nets, routinely making life difficult for players as capable as David Warner. Even so, it didn\u2019t feel like this was the next move after such a relentless first hour for the home side. Latham takes full advantage, twice carving shorter balls behind point, the second of those beating Lyon to the rope. It\u2019s a no-ball, too. He gets half an over at de Grandhomme, which is a better match-up for his away-swingers. The all-rounder obliges, driving at the first of those, stopped in Wade\u2019s follow through. There\u2019s no stopping the square drive that follows though, a second boundary from a ball well wide of the off-stump. He\u2019s furious at himself. 13 runs from it but New Zealand still trail by 391. Cummins talks to TV at drinks. He\u2019s very polite and positive. \u201cAt the moment it is all going to plan.\u201d It sure is. Three wickets in that first hour, very much Australia\u2019s. 29th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 2) Starc replaces the captivating Cummins, who now has 137 Test wickets in his 29th Test. A reminder that he\u2019s only 26. He has 57 of those scalps at 19.82 in 2019, by far the best in the world. de Grandhomme is in strife here when the left-armer brings a full ball back at him, the inside edge his saviour. There\u2019s no let up with this attack. DRINKS! 28th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 2) de Grandhomme doesn\u2019t settle here, beaten by Pattinson to begin then hacking when he should have been defending. Crucially, he gets off strike. Latham has to deal with another rapid short ball, ripping his bat out of the way at the last possible moment. 27th over: New Zealand 62-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 1) Another Andrew Samson gem on SEN, with respect to Tom Latham, who is on for carrying his bat here. He already has the highest ever score when acheiving that feat - 264 not out. The lowest total for an opener not out at the end of a completed innings is 26, from 1889. History: we\u2019ll take it where we can get it. His edge is found by the final ball of this Cummins over, albeit on the bounce to Warner at gully. He\u2019s playing well as these wickets fall around him, comfortable ducking the short stuff too. 26th over: New Zealand 62-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 1) All of a sudden, that follow-on mark has to be in the frame. You don\u2019t normally expect that at the MCG but they have only been out there for 25.2 overs - with a sleep in between - as de Grandhomme walks to the middle. He\u2019s off the mark first ball behind square. Latham has a crack at a bumper now that he\u2019s back on strike, pulling in front of square for three. Nicely played. Pattinson is all over the new man with the two balls he has to come, beating him outside the off-stump them crashing into his front pad with an off-cutter. These two have been quite magnificent this morning. Kevin Roberts was on SEN radio this morning, the main news point that the CA boss is very keen on four-day Tests, saying they will \u201cseriously consider\u201d them. I\u2019m far from convinced. Yes, you can point to the number of Tests that would have finished in four days if applying the extra overs but the rhythm of the game changes entirely when that fifth day is taken out of the equation. Not for me. Outstanding bowling, Pattinson angling in at pace, Watling edging to first slip from the shoulder of his bat. He tried to keep it down but there was too much going on. 25th over: New Zealand 57-4 (Latham 12, Watling 7) Cummins keeps the cordon jumping, hitting Latham on the arm with a short ball that he can\u2019t get out the way of. Next up, showing his class, the off-cutter finds the inside edge and nearly deflects back onto the woodwork. Andrew Samson reveals on SEN radio that Nicholls wicket was the first lbw decision Cummins has won for 70 dismissals! 24th over: New Zealand 56-4 (Latham 11, Watling 7) Another testing Pattinson over, Latham playing a short ball early in the over with both feet off the deck. Plays it well. Ooh, less so later in the over when wafting at a ball outside the off-stump. There have been a stack of those already this morning. Deserves a scalp. 23rd over: New Zealand 55-4 (Latham 10, Watling 7) Good again from Watling, playing carefully through cover with the movement of the ball, taking a couple. That shape is there again next up, beating his outside edge. Once again, there isn\u2019t a lot he could have done about that. Cummins has 10-3-16-3. What a bowler. \u201cGood morning from a 25C beach shack in northern Tasmania,\u201d reports Tom Lewis. \u201cWith that and OBO, my day is set.\u201d Great to have you with us. \u201cYou suggest that \u2018technology confirms that was the right call\u2019. Could it be instead that technology hinted/indicated/postulated ... etc.\u201d I\u2019m Team Technology, mostly because it pits me against the dinosaurs and that\u2019s usually the right lane to be in. 22nd over: New Zealand 53-4 (Latham 10, Watling 5) Smith DROPS LATHAM! It was going straight down the throat of Burns at first slip but Smith decided to dive right in front of him from second and put it down. That should have been three wickets in eight balls. Disappointing for Pattinson, who has been just as good as Cummins this morning. It\u2019s hard to understand why Smith went there. It\u2019s different going the other way when the ball isn\u2019t going to carry but that was not an issue there. He ran down to apologise to the bustling quick at the end of the over. 21st over: New Zealand 51-4 (Latham 9, Watling 4) Watling is off the mark with a crisp off-drive for four. It\u2019s a rugged time for him to be walking out, but if we\u2019ve learned one thing about the Kiwi stumper it\u2019s that he\u2019s unflappable. Here\u2019s a replay of that first Cummins wicket. WATLING DEFENDS THE HAT-TRICK BALL. He had to play and did it well. That\u2019s the fourth time in four Tests this summer an Australian has been on one. Oh, that\u2019s out! It\u2019s hitting leg stump, Cummins having beaten the inside edge from around the wicket on the angle. Superb bowling. He\u2019s on a hat-trick! An Australian man hasn\u2019t taken one in a Test since Siddle - on his birthday - in November 2010. CUMMINS IS ON A HAT-TRICK! So long as DRS agrees that Nicholls is lbw first ball. He was given on the field and looked very, very good. Taylor dropped by Labuschagne but is caught on the deflection by Burns at first slip! Miller and Tavare, anyone? Such good bowling. Taylor never settled. 20th over: New Zealand 46-2 (Taylor 4, Latham 9) Wheels from Pattinson to begin from the Great Southern Stand end, where he will be well supported today. Into Taylor, he thumps into the back thigh pad then beats the outside edge with a lovely little bit of movement away from the bat. He has three slips, Labuschagne setting up nice and close at third. Taylor is a cool customer and responds with a neat tuck, behind square for one. Latham\u2019s turn now, who has a couple to get through. He\u2019s forward defending the first of those with a nice, straight bat but he\u2019s beaten on the angle to finish. That wasn\u2019t far away at all. Two tip top overs to begin for Australia\u2019s big, bad right-arm fast bowlers. 19th over: New Zealand 44-2 (Taylor 2, Latham 9) Cummins is right on it to Taylor, finding the outside half of his bat. The Black Caps veteran gets down the other end for his first run of the day from the fourth ball, pushing to mid-on. He requires 49 further runs today in order to overtake Stephen Fleming as New Zealand\u2019s highest Test runscorer. We\u2019ll keep an eye on that. Latham plays and misses his first delivery of the day, an excellent offering from around the wicket cutting away off the seam after angling in. Not a lot he can do about it. A huge shout from the Australians to finish the over! Cummins has beaten the inside edge and he wants an lbw decision; the fielders around the bat are also interested in whether it hit an inside edge on the way through before landing in Warner\u2019s diving hands at gully. They elect not to review and technology confirms that was the right call - the lbw was going over the stumps and the sound was bad on pad, not ball. Great over. The players are on the field! Cummins, the world\u2019s best quick, will be starting us off from the Members End. Ross Taylor is on strike. This should be good. PLAY! Another from Tim Paine last night. He said that Travis Head was always playing and commentary from the skipper about potentially playing five bowlers ahead of this Test was strategic misdirection of the New Zealanders via the media. Hmm. I know there\u2019s a lot of distaste for cricket reporters and plenty of conspiracy theories about us concocting our stories, but, yeah, I\u2019m not sure about this. It\u2019s becoming one of the great midsummer traditions. Backyard cricket, the Boxing Day Test and questioning the ball-tracking technology used by DRS. Tim Paine played his part at stumps last night, saying he\u2019s lost faith in the system. Back to the MCG, where solar panels are on the way. Good get this, from Andrew Wu at the SMH. It follows an Australian Conservation Foundation report yesterday, which detailed some serious challenges for the Boxing Day Test. Speaking of the England team, did you catch the highlights overnight? Crazy scenes from start to end at Centurion. As one colleague noted, it can sometimes be quite a lot of fun watching two teams who can\u2019t bat. Delicious fast bowling, too. Eoin Morgan CBE, Ben Stokes OBE... and so on. Joe Root, Jos Buttler, Trevor Bayliss, Alan Knott! Sir Clive Lloyd. Colin Graves is in there too, of course. It must be the New Year Honours list! Good morning to you all. Day three, or moving day as we cricket writers call it when there\u2019s no better introduction to go with than ripping something off from golf. But for New Zealand, this is survival day first and foremost. At different periods through this series, the the visitors have found something from nothing. Having lost Kane Williamson, their skipper and superstar, not long before the close last night, they now need plenty to go their way if they are to withstand the inevitable Australian surge. In simple terms, they have to bat all day. With Ross Taylor, there is always hope of such a feat. Yes, he was lucky to survive a compelling leg before shout when James Pattinson was steaming in just before stumps, but the veteran is in form and has the patience for the task. Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls and BJ Watling have also achieved this often enough in Test cricket. The real quiz here is whether they can do so on this much bigger stage. For the home side, their quicks were swaming last night in the best traditions of a bowling group who had their feet up for nearly two days. It being Saturday, there\u2019s every reason to think there\u2019ll be another 60,000 Melburnians in to urge then on - especially Pattinson, the home town boy who has been waiting for an MCG return for eight years. With a hint of volatile bounce on show already, the dice is loaded their way. The Kiwis, of course, are still 223 away from the follow-on. Eeek. But let\u2019s be positive. Let\u2019s hope the Black Caps can show some of the backbone that has elevated them to the second ranked team in the world. Let\u2019s hope we\u2019re sitting here in seven hours with a serious contest on our hands. And if not, let\u2019s enjoy the world-class Australian bowlers going to work. And whatever the case, enjoy it with myself and JP Howcroft. We\u2019re looking forward to your company.",

This dizzying power of total and instant recall went into hyperdrive during the 2010s, thanks to streamers such as Spotify, Netflix and Amazon. Rather than simply usurping the place of the old mass-media monoculture, these gigantic platforms have a curious effect of simultaneously unifying and fracturing.

Daft Punk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Canute defying the tide of history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/daft-punk\">Daft Punk</a> attempted a kind of monoculture reenactment on their 2013 album Random Access Memories. Renouncing \u201cdigital love\u201d in favour of analogue production and \u201creal\u201d musicianship (human drumming!), they staged a homage to the lost golden age of record-making that had resulted in blockbusters such as Rumours and Off the Wall. The duo\u2019s promotional campaign pointedly made use of old-fashioned pre-internet techniques like billboards and television ads. The entire project ached with nostalgia not so much for the monoculture as for monotemporality: \u201cthe event\u201d, the mass synchronised experience of \u201cthe whole world\u201d ardently focused on a single cultural artefact, from movies such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/18/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-death-is-not-the-end-in-new-trilogys-laborious-exit\">Stars Wars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/saturday-night-fever\">Saturday Night Fever</a> to records like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/05/sgt-pepper-is-50-new-documentary-beatles-alan-g-parker\">Sgt</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/05/sgt-pepper-is-50-new-documentary-beatles-alan-g-parker\"> Pepper</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/31/john-landis-on-the-making-of-michael-jacksons-thriller-i-was-adamant-he-couldnt-look-too-hideous\">Thriller</a>. The roll-out and the release succeeded in dominating public attention and critical discourse. Get Lucky ruled the radio for a year and Daft Punk cleaned up at the Grammys. Yet Random Access Memories rapidly and thoroughly evacuated itself from popular memory, to the point where it has barely featured in all the end-of-decade list-making.</p> <p>The monoculture and that particular sense of shared temporality has not disappeared altogether. But like a dwarf star it has shrunk, and its power to irradiate the lives of everyone is much weaker. Even the astronomically famous have had to resort to ruses to commandeer public attention \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/beyonce\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> with her surprise release, in December 2013, of a self-titled \u201cvisual album\u201d. But this kind of media ambush \u2013 designed to cut through the noise, like a radio station with a very powerful signal drowning out its rivals \u2013 only works for the already famous, those whose celebrity capital was built up during the earlier monoculture. For anybody smaller, it would be an act of promotional suicide.</p> <p>It feels like there are fewer household names, more cult figures \u2013 and the gulf between the universally famous and the known-to-just-some grows wider and wider. A discussion about music with an old friend or a new acquaintance can go quite a long way before you find something that you have both heard. Not only there is a sprawling span of contemporary niche sounds and micro-genres, but there are several generations of ageing stars and tenacious fringe figures still out there gigging and recording, Meanwhile, the reissue industry constantly rescues obscure artists from oblivion and repositions them as deserving of attention and ear-time, while the amateur archivists of YouTube and album-sharing sites mop up anybody and everybody else remaining with a scintilla of significance.</p> <p>Over the last decade, television has grown equally profuse and amorphous. For a moment at the turn of the 21st century, the culturally centralising role of TV seemed to undergo a renaissance in the form of the Golden Age of prestige drama and innovative comedy. Indie-film auteurs, blocked from a blockbuster-obsessed Hollywood in which superheroes and CGI ruled, charged into the small-screen medium, which now welcomed risky material and formal innovation. Appointment TV, the punctual convergence of large audiences for the latest episode of shows such as The Sopranos or Breaking Bad, kept alive the idea of the public as unitary bloc whose aesthetic horizons could be collectively expanded. But then came streaming, with its vastly enlarged menu of options and its flexibility of use. You could binge an entire series in one go, or catch up with it long after everyone else. Aware of the dangers of dithering and drowning posed by the very surfeit of choices they offered, streamers devised algorithms to \u201csurface\u201d programs that might appeal to your habitual tastes. But the downside of this attunement to the individual consumer is that fewer viewers are tuned into the same shows.</p> <p>Streaming represents the next level in a general digital-era tendency: consumer control of time becomes vastly more personalised, but that experience of time becomes more brittle. The ability to stop and restart the flow of cultural information proves to be an irresistible temptation: pausing for a call of nature or a conversational digression, or to rewind a bit of knotty dialogue. Netflix is toying with a new feature that will allow viewers to watch programmes at 1.5x speed, allowing consumers to keep up with the challenging surfeit of must-see TV.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPXIgEAGe4U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IPXIgEAGe4U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>High Hopes by Panic!

      "body": "<p>Tom Watson\u2019s friends say he is half the man he used to be. He has lost eight stone, and over the past couple of years a fitter, sleeker, more energised Watson has emerged; he is now retraining as a gym instructor. Those of a less friendly disposition would also say he is half the man he used to be. They accuse Labour\u2019s former deputy leader of betraying his party, by undermining Jeremy Corbyn time and again. Longer-term critics would say he was never much of a man, and wish they could have dispensed with him years ago.</p> <p>It\u2019s 11am on Friday 13 December, the day after the night before, and the inquest into Labour\u2019s trouncing has already begun. Watson is upset, emotional and exhausted. He has been up all night, and is about to phone friends who have lost their seats to offer support. There are lots of them. Even West Bromwich East, the seat he held for 18 years, has gone Tory \u2013 for the first time.</p> <p>Watson talks about the reasons for the defeat: a familiar list including Brexit, Corbyn, a manifesto that overpromised, antisemitism, a failure to unite the left and centre of the party. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the message of our campaign was,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were announcements everywhere, but none of them got through because there were so many. You knew what Boris Johnson was: get Brexit done. What was the Labour strapline?\u201d Has politics got to be so simplistic? \u201cNo, politics is very complicated. But you have to be able to condense what you stand for into a mantra or a single message.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the lack of a clear message, Watson thinks Labour was all over the place organisationally. \u201cI don\u2019t actually know where the key-seat list was for this election. I don\u2019t know whether rigorous, disciplined assessment of which seats were under threat and which could be won took place. In 2010, under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown</a>, we were very disciplined and many seats were saved from defeat as a result. The mechanics of elections really do matter.\u201d</p> <p>There is, he says, a simple question that the party must address. \u201cDoes the Labour party in its current form actually want power? The ultimate betrayal of working-class people is not to take power when you can, and if you are a party that believes in power through elections, then that requires pragmatism, prioritisation, compromise and collaboration.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48cef87e4ae17432cd5a25d969de4d2d7af82ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48cef87e4ae17432cd5a25d969de4d2d7af82ff/0_0_4574_3053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson with Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour party conference in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson with Jeremy Corbyn at the Labour party conference in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You sense Watson could talk for hours, possibly days. This is therapy, a process of understanding \u2013 and part of that process is working out what part he played in all this himself. Did his party get hammered because Corbyn and his advisers refused to listen to Watson\u2019s call for a broader church? Or was Watson part of the reason for the hammering?</p> <p>Some have argued that Labour lost because remainers such as Watson forced them into a fuddled compromise on Brexit. (\u201cBy all means criticise me for the position I took, but at least it was a position,\u201d Watson says. \u201cSomething I strongly believe in, to the point that it influenced my decision to leave elected office, because I would have found it very difficult to hold the party line and I didn\u2019t want to dissemble.\u201d) Others have suggested that Watson failed them by standing down as deputy leader and an MP.</p> <p>It came as a shock, because politics had been his life, as a trade union officer and member of parliament. But Watson had decided he\u2019d had enough; that politics wasn\u2019t good for his health. \u201cI did worry that the brutality and hostility would get to me in the end.\u201d Can he give an example? \u201cWell, two weeks before I resigned, a guy was arrested for giving me a death threat. He was a Labour supporter. The police got in touch and said, \u2018We\u2019ve arrested this guy\u2019, assuming I knew about it. But I didn\u2019t. The Labour party had sent out a fundraising email that he had responded to with a death threat. The party reported it to the police, but didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d Why not? \u201cI have no idea \u2013 it\u2019s neither here nor there now. The point is that the brutality and hostility is real and it\u2019s day to day. So I just thought: now\u2019s the time to take a leap, do something different \u2013 you\u2019ve had a good innings. You\u2019ve done good stuff. Go now. And it was quite quick.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was asked to order an Ikea sofa for Peter Mandelson\u2019s office. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be doing that when I joined at 15</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So the brutality and hostility was from outside the parliamentary party? He shakes his head. No, he says, there was plenty from inside. He reels off a long list. \u201cThe return of political factionalism. The idea that you could be portrayed as the enemy within. People questioning your motives. Social media pile-ons. Condemnation from powerful trade union general secretaries on broadcast media. Internal bickering. On their own, you deal with them and they\u2019re a normal part of life. Combine them, and you\u2019re carrying a very heavy load. And sometimes you\u2019ve got to realise when that balance of life shifts and there are other things that are more rewarding.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Watson is publishing a memoir, aptly titled Downsizing. He assures me his new life is going to be smaller in every way. He will dedicate himself to his two children Malachy, 14, and Saoirse, 11, staying fit, and helping others get fit, too. </p> <p>A few years ago he weighed 22 stone and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. \u201cI had overwhelming thoughts of death. I thought: you can\u2019t walk upstairs without feeling as if you need an oxygen mask. How have you got to this point?\u201d Watson realised that he could no longer fully function as a father, politician or human being. \u201cYou get to that point where you go: I\u2019ve got kids \u2013 I want to stay alive. You think what a useless dad you are: you can\u2019t kick a ball around with Malachy, you can\u2019t jump in the pool without emptying it.\u201d Watson went on a fat-heavy, low-carb, sugar-free diet. He ate bacon and eggs for breakfast, full-fat cheese and walnuts for dessert, and glugged back glasses of double cream if he still wasn\u2019t sated. And the weight just fell away. Even more astonishingly, his diabetes went into remission.</p> <p>***</p> <p>A couple of weeks before the election, I meet Watson in Bewdley, a small riverside town in Worcestershire. We are three miles from Kidderminster, where he grew up, and barely a mile from where he lives today. Watson recently moved in with his new partner, and shares the parenting of his two children with his wife, Siobhan, from whom he separated in 2010, and who lives in Yorkshire. He wanted to meet here so we could go for a walk, and so he could show off his renewed stamina and love of the natural world. Most days Watson walks around 12km, and he looks a good decade younger than he did. For many years he could only wear outsized suits. Now, aged 52, he can wear what he wants, and he\u2019s loving it. Even his glasses look lighter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0306161e68e9be714a26a1c0a8c46c3075f4681a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0306161e68e9be714a26a1c0a8c46c3075f4681a/0_64_1492_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With his ex-wife, Siobhan, during the election count in his constituency in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"914\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his ex-wife, Siobhan, during the election count in his constituency of West Bromwich East in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: News Team International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His political life goes back generations. His grandmother was a communist until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and his mother and father were both Labour; she was a secretary, he was an odd-job man, before both retrained as social workers. He remembers them running a tiny committee room from the family home in Kidderminster in 1974 \u2013 the intense seriousness of it all, the boisterous debates in the living room. He found it intoxicating.</p> <p>By the time Watson was 12, he was filling envelopes for the 1979 election from the more substantial committee room of the Power Loom Carpet Weavers\u2019 and Textiles Workers\u2019 Union. At 17, he was hired as a \u00a35,400-a-year trainee librarian at the Labour party\u2019s Walworth Road HQ, on the strength of being the only candidate who had seen the job advert, and because he knew how to use a word processor. He went to Hull University as a mature student in 1990, was elected president of the student union in 1991, became the Labour party\u2019s youth officer in 1993, and worked on the 1997 general election campaign, before leaving to become national political officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. Watson was elected MP for West Bromwich East in 2001.</p> <p>He was 17 stone when he entered parliament, with a reputation as a bruiser \u2013 partly because of his appearance, partly because of his trade union history, and partly because he could deliver a devastating attack with the understated calm of a mafioso. To his credit, Watson has rarely chosen easy targets, instead going for global media magnates and leaders of his own party. The one time he did was as campaign manager for Liam Byrne in the 2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill byelection. Watson took responsibility for a filthy campaign including a leaflet that featured the line: \u201cLabour is on your side; the Lib Dems are on the side of failed asylum-seekers.\u201d He says he \u201cwinces\u201d when he thinks about it now. \u201cI was so hungry for winning, I just took my eye off the ball. We won it by a few hundred votes, but I\u2019m very sorry about it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are people around Jeremy who live in a binary world of left and right, good and evil, us and them, in and out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For all Watson\u2019s scheming, he was clubbable. Indeed, he says, this is why he put on even more weight. \u201cI loved eating, I loved the craic, I loved people\u2019s company, I loved long lunches with left-leaning journalists and a few beers after work.\u201d He would often start the day with two or three bacon butties in the members\u2019 tea room. Watson says as soon as he entered parliament he became more class conscious, aware that some regarded him as an oik. \u201cI\u2019d never order three bacon butties at the same time because that was a social faux pas even I was aware of.\u201d What stopped him \u2013 that it made him look greedy or plebby? \u201cDefinitely plebby.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, he says, how desperate he was to escape Kidderminster as a young man, only to spend decades being condescended to in the Commons. \u201cThere\u2019s a terrible snobbery. It was a very exciting time, but I was patronised by people who were better educated and very ambitious in a classic way.\u201d He mentions a stint working as deputy general election coordinator in 1997. \u201cBenjamin Wegg-Prosser, who worked for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-mandelson\" title=\"\">Peter Mandelson</a>, brought the Ikea catalogue to my desk and asked me to order the right sort of sofa for Peter in Millbank Tower, for when the great lord arrived to direct the campaign. I sat there thinking: when I joined the Labour party at 15, I didn\u2019t know I would be buying sofas for Peter Mandelson.\u201d He pauses, before adding how well he gets on with Mandelson these days, and what a charming man Wegg-Prosser is.</p> <p>By 2006, Watson had been promoted to under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Defence, successfully campaigning to ensure that soldiers shot for cowardice in the first world war received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/16/military.immigrationpolicy\" title=\"\">a posthumous pardon</a> \u2013 one of his proudest achievements. It looked as if he was destined for swift elevation to a senior position. But then came the first of his famous acts of disloyalty \u2013 and the first in a series of resignations. After Tony Blair announced he would not stand down as prime minister, Watson was a signatory on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/07/uk.labourleadership1\" title=\"\">a letter saying </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/07/uk.labourleadership1\" title=\"\">the leader should go</a>, after nine years. The government\u2019s chief whip, Jacqui Smith, told him he had to withdraw his name. The next day he resigned instead. Blair responded that Watson\u2019s intervention was \u201cdisloyal, discourteous and wrong\u201d.</p> <p>Today, he says this is one of his great regrets. \u201cIt was rash and chaotic. I\u2019ve never said this publicly, but I shouldn\u2019t have done it that way.\u201d Why not? \u201cIf I\u2019d lost confidence in him, I should have told him to his face, and done it more respectfully. I was a kid, a junior minister, in a government that had achieved great things, and he deserved better.\u201d He\u2019s being candid, but knowingly so: it\u2019s not the only time Watson will say he\u2019s never said something publicly before, as if telling me where the story is.</p> <p>Watson returned to government under Gordon Brown a year later, first as a whip, then as minister for digital engagement and civil service issues. He had lost none of his love of the craic; there was nothing he liked more than a night out on the Guinness. How many could he get through? \u201cI could do eight or nine Guinnesses on a Friday.\u201d Is he being conservative? \u201cI could have probably got to a dozen. Not beyond that, because I\u2019m not a great drinker. But I liked drinking a lot.\u201d Did he worry that he was an alcoholic? \u201cNo. I never felt addicted. I could always not drink.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e43315039934bd5889b6fb6ac877490de33fbc7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43315039934bd5889b6fb6ac877490de33fbc7c/0_763_6466_4410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson sitting in an empty room with large windows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Labour party only wins elections when it\u2019s the broadest of churches,\u2019 said Watson the day after the defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson has resigned under every Labour leader he has worked for (from Brown\u2019s cabinet for personal reasons; and as the Labour party\u2019s campaign coordinator under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband,</a> after a row about candidate selection and losing faith in his boss). Watson insists it\u2019s a record he\u2019s not proud of, but I\u2019m not so sure. He stresses that he\u2019s never been sacked. In 2009, he joined the culture, media and sport select committee, where he found himself at the heart of an investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/24/phone-hacking-scandal-timeline-trial\" title=\"\">phone hacking scandal</a>. \u201cIt became my expert subject. It was overwhelming and obsessional. I was very boring to be with in those days. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. I was utterly driven by it.\u201d He made headlines with his forensic interrogation of Rupert and James Murdoch. In 2011, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/jul/07/news-of-the-world-closes-live-coverage\" title=\"\">News of the World was closed down</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2011/jul/07/news-of-the-world-closes-live-coverage\" title=\"\"> </a>after detectives said as many as 4,000 people had been hacked.</p> <p>A year later, Watson began another high-profile campaign to expose a so-called \u201cVIP paedophile ring\u201d. The campaign will probably be remembered for the attention he drew to \u201cNick\u201d, a man who accused senior politicians and establishment figures of sadistic sexual abuse and murder, prompting a \u00a32m investigation by the Metropolitan police. Nick was eventually named as Carl Beech, who in July this year was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/26/carl-beech-vip-paedophile-ring-accuser-jailed-for-18-years\" title=\"\">sentenced to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment</a> after making false allegations against Conservative politicians Harvey Proctor, Leon Brittan and former prime minister Edward Heath, among others.</p> <p>How did Watson feel when Beech was found guilty? He pauses. The seconds pass slowly. \u201cI felt sick as a dog for the genuine victims, that this one case and this one person had set it back. There are people even now who are the victims of child sexual abuse who are not going to bring their cases to the attention of the criminal justice system.\u201d</p> <p>Did he feel that at any point he mishandled the situation? \u201cYes, when Leon Brittan died.\u201d After Brittan\u2019s death, Watson wrote an article in which he repeated a claim by Beech that Brittan was \u201cas close to evil as any human being could get\u201d. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that and I regret that, because it was an emotional response. I\u2019ve apologised for that. It was a mistake. I don\u2019t want to beat myself up for every mistake.\u201d</p> <p>While undoubtedly well intentioned, Watson\u2019s pursuit of a Westminster paedophile ring felt like an act of hubris; he seemed to have developed a sense of his own invincibility. Lady Brittan called for Watson to resign or be sacked, but he still insists he did more good than harm. \u201cPlease look at the lifelong predatory child sex abusers who went to jail as a result of the evidence provided to the police from whistleblowers who came to me. Please look at the work of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, which came about as a result of working with a group of cross-party MPs. Look at the work we did on bringing a group of MPs together to look at institutional abuse in music schools.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>We head off for a stroll along the River Severn. The four miles from Bewdley to Upper Arley is one of Watson\u2019s regular routes, and he is relaxed, easy company. As he walks, Watson chats about his love of music and the joys of nature \u2013 the cormorant that flies up and down the river, the cobalt blue of the kingfisher flashing past, the pike that always breaks his fishing line. Meanwhile, I\u2019m telling him how I have spent much of the past four years screaming at Corbyn\u2019s Labour. He nods sympathetically. No, I say, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I\u2019ve been screaming at you as well. Why, he asks. Because you were a supremely disloyal deputy. Because at times you seemed to be revelling in the chaos, making political capital out of sectarianism, antisemitism and Brexit division.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c41c8ab0aab25bd4c843bfb829409a6f4abdf103\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c41c8ab0aab25bd4c843bfb829409a6f4abdf103/0_451_5440_6794/801.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Does Watson believe he was an honourable deputy? \u2018Oh God! Well, I hope so.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Quinton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He counters by asking if I would have preferred him to stay quiet and betray his principles. \u201cI was trying to stand up for pluralism. The Labour party only wins elections when it\u2019s the broadest of churches. But there are some sections around Jeremy and the Unite group that live in a binary world of left and right, good and evil, us and them, in and out. You can\u2019t run a two-party system without nuance and complexity, pluralism and respect for difference. Because ultimately you end up becoming a sect not a party.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn and Watson, both lifelong rebels (Watson from the centre ground, Corbyn from the left), might have been the dream team, uniting two factions. I remind Watson that when he was elected deputy in 2015, he said: \u201cMy role is to unify the party, hold things together and make it work in difficult times.\u201d He smiles. \u201cWell, what\u2019s that Meat Loaf track? Two out of three ain\u2019t bad? I\u2019ve definitely not unified the party, have I? Nobody has done that. But I have helped hold it together in more ways than some people appreciate. And I\u2019ve definitely tried to make it more functional.\u201d</p> <p>He says he sensed the partnership with Corbyn was doomed from day one. \u201cWe had just won the leader and deputy leader ballots, and we were in this room on our own, and the first thing he said to me was, \u2018We\u2019ve got our party back.\u2019\u201d For Corbyn, he had wrestled control from the Blairites, but Watson had never felt part of any faction. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, <em>I\u2019ve</em> never really lost this party. We\u2019re going to have a bit of fun here, Jeremy.\u201d</p> <p>He talks about how ineptly his party dealt with antisemitism, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) inquiry. \u201cI made private representations on what we needed to do to stamp it out, and I still think that we need to do a lot more work. If the EHRC inquiry goes the wrong way, a great shame will befall the institution that I love. One of the reasons I joined the Labour party in the 1980s was because I was an avowed anti-racist, and you can\u2019t be discriminatory in that view.\u201d</p> <p>But he is fulsome in his praise of Corbyn as a man: his sincerity and devotion, the kindness he showed Watson\u2019s children. He is less kindly disposed towards Corbyn\u2019s advisers, and is furious that they involved themselves in the party\u2019s investigation into antisemitism. \u201cWhy were Andrew Murray and Seumas Milne anywhere near what are internal disciplinary racist cases? Milne is the press guy, Murray is the trade unionist seconded to help do whatever he was doing in the leader\u2019s office. They should not be involved in that process, period.\u201d He pauses, before returning to the subject of Murray. \u201cI did find it surprising that he would be in the Labour party, given that he is an avowed Stalinist.\u201d </p> <p>Watson briefly lived in a houseshare with another Labour power broker, Unite general secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/len-mccluskey\" title=\"\">Len McCluskey</a>, after he separated from his wife in 2010. McCluskey and Watson had an acrimonious falling out. Watson says he can tell me exactly when: it was July 2016, the Saturday of the Unite conference, after Corbyn lost a vote of no confidence by Labour MPs, a seemingly disastrous 172-40 against.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time I spoke to Len was when we were having private talks about how we handle the vote of no confidence in Jeremy. He was basically offering a fairly long-term departure date for Jeremy to go \u2013 hints at, not absolute offers, that Jeremy would go in 2018. It was very delicate because I had not been authorised by anyone to negotiate, so I didn\u2019t know who I was negotiating for. I was trying to stop a damaging leadership election.\u201d Hold on: are you telling me McCluskey has the clout to decide when Corbyn goes? \u201cI suspect he was using a bit of licence himself. He was caveating it, but it was certainly dangled.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b61392f8d69137357c550ad33c0a378ee6a72ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b61392f8d69137357c550ad33c0a378ee6a72ab/0_0_3658_2568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson at the 2011 Labour party conference with Len McCluskey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the 2011 conference with Len McCluskey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does he believe he was an honourable deputy? \u201cOh God!

Watson seems taken aback, and stutters to an answer. \u201cErm, I never said who I voted for. Nor did I endorse any candidate.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI did vote for Owen, but I\u2019ve never said it publicly before.\u201d Why him, rather than his boss? \u201cI thought, as soon as the leader loses the confidence of the parliamentary party it\u2019s almost impossible to see how you can form a government. I thought Jeremy should have resigned, and he nearly did. But actually I was wrong on that. He went over the heads of the PLP and won a resounding mandate from the membership.\u201d</p> <p>Watson is still thinking about whether he behaved honourably. \u201cI didn\u2019t nominate Owen, which caused some irritation to his team. Nor did I publicly endorse him.\u201d I burst out laughing \u2013 blimey, asking you to nominate Smith while you were Corbyn\u2019s deputy is a bit much, I say. Now it\u2019s Watson\u2019s turn to laugh. \u201cWell, they were feverish times. And you know, I did think about it \u2013 not nominating anybody seemed a bit cowardly.\u201d</p> <p>As the Brexit process wore on, Watson says he tried to voice his opinion privately. \u201cI raised my view that there should be a people\u2019s vote at the shadow cabinet Brexit subcommittee in 2018, and I was never invited back.\u201d Whose decision was that? \u201cI\u2019ve no idea. So I decided to say it publicly, and we moved to a position in favour of a people\u2019s vote, albeit a slightly nuanced one. I think I contributed to a policy decision that was pretty fundamental to the party and I was perfectly within my rights to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b218db50aaade83ae2a1e894824a4f962e8a54d1/1_86_620_775/400.jpg\" alt=\"Watson at Glastonbury in 2016\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m not a great drinker.

Watson survived, and the motion was withdrawn, but he looked very isolated. Was he surprised by the motion? He was astonished, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could pre-empt such political idiocy, and collective self-harm.\u201d</p> <p>But you do have a reputation for being serially disloyal to your leaders, I say. Actually, he says, he prefers to look at it another way: that he is non-tribal. \u201cA tribal politician is somebody who stays within a particular faction and takes a line. I guess occasionally I\u2019ve been a contrarian, more than disloyal. I\u2019ve never really taken kindly to being told what to do.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Watson if he thinks he has changed over the years. \u201cI was a bit shrill and immature in my early days. I\u2019m much more aware of my frailties. I don\u2019t feel the need to hide my inadequacies.\u201d People have called him a bully \u2013 is that fair? He thinks long and hard. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bully.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound totally convinced. \u201cI\u2019m not a bully, but I\u2019ve got a tendency to get obsessed with certain issues and not let them go. A dog with a bone is probably what I am.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Watson already refers to himself as an ex-politician, and he clearly feels liberated. He is taking his level two gym instructor qualification, and admits it\u2019s a struggle \u2013 he is older and less supple than the other students. But he insists the career change is real. He wants to educate people on the risk of diabetes and how to treat it through diet. What if he were offered a place in the House of Lords?</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to be a level two gym instructor.\u201d Is that a promise? \u201cWell, has it been offered and have I asked for it? No. And I think it\u2019s highly unlikely that I\u2019d be on Jeremy\u2019s list. But were it offered me, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d Is that a yes? \u201cI\u2019ve got redundancy pay till 12 February. I haven\u2019t even written a CV yet. I don\u2019t know what my future holds. What I do know is that my days of frontline politics are definitely over.\u201d</p> <p>He returns to the heady days of 1974, when he was seven years old, watching his parents fight for Harold Wilson, and 1979, when he was campaigning for Jim Callaghan in a classroom mock election. That buzz has long gone, he says. And for much of the time since it has been all sound and fury. \u201cPolitics was like a cacophony of voices in my head for 35 years. And if I\u2019ve got Jeremy to thank for anything, it\u2019s that those voices are extinguished. I just feel free. I want to be an instrument for good. But I want to work with relentlessly positive people I like. And it\u2019s very hard to say I\u2019ve worked with relentlessly positive people in recent years.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Tom Watson\u2019s Downsizing is published on 2 January by Octopus at \u00a314.99.

      "bodyText": "Tom Watson\u2019s friends say he is half the man he used to be. He has lost eight stone, and over the past couple of years a fitter, sleeker, more energised Watson has emerged; he is now retraining as a gym instructor. Those of a less friendly disposition would also say he is half the man he used to be. They accuse Labour\u2019s former deputy leader of betraying his party, by undermining Jeremy Corbyn time and again. Longer-term critics would say he was never much of a man, and wish they could have dispensed with him years ago. It\u2019s 11am on Friday 13 December, the day after the night before, and the inquest into Labour\u2019s trouncing has already begun. Watson is upset, emotional and exhausted. He has been up all night, and is about to phone friends who have lost their seats to offer support. There are lots of them. Even West Bromwich East, the seat he held for 18 years, has gone Tory \u2013 for the first time. Watson talks about the reasons for the defeat: a familiar list including Brexit, Corbyn, a manifesto that overpromised, antisemitism, a failure to unite the left and centre of the party. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the message of our campaign was,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were announcements everywhere, but none of them got through because there were so many. You knew what Boris Johnson was: get Brexit done. What was the Labour strapline?\u201d Has politics got to be so simplistic? \u201cNo, politics is very complicated. But you have to be able to condense what you stand for into a mantra or a single message.\u201d As well as the lack of a clear message, Watson thinks Labour was all over the place organisationally. \u201cI don\u2019t actually know where the key-seat list was for this election. I don\u2019t know whether rigorous, disciplined assessment of which seats were under threat and which could be won took place. In 2010, under Gordon Brown, we were very disciplined and many seats were saved from defeat as a result. The mechanics of elections really do matter.\u201d There is, he says, a simple question that the party must address. \u201cDoes the Labour party in its current form actually want power? The ultimate betrayal of working-class people is not to take power when you can, and if you are a party that believes in power through elections, then that requires pragmatism, prioritisation, compromise and collaboration.\u201d You sense Watson could talk for hours, possibly days. This is therapy, a process of understanding \u2013 and part of that process is working out what part he played in all this himself. Did his party get hammered because Corbyn and his advisers refused to listen to Watson\u2019s call for a broader church? Or was Watson part of the reason for the hammering? Some have argued that Labour lost because remainers such as Watson forced them into a fuddled compromise on Brexit. (\u201cBy all means criticise me for the position I took, but at least it was a position,\u201d Watson says. \u201cSomething I strongly believe in, to the point that it influenced my decision to leave elected office, because I would have found it very difficult to hold the party line and I didn\u2019t want to dissemble.\u201d) Others have suggested that Watson failed them by standing down as deputy leader and an MP. It came as a shock, because politics had been his life, as a trade union officer and member of parliament. But Watson had decided he\u2019d had enough; that politics wasn\u2019t good for his health. \u201cI did worry that the brutality and hostility would get to me in the end.\u201d Can he give an example? \u201cWell, two weeks before I resigned, a guy was arrested for giving me a death threat. He was a Labour supporter. The police got in touch and said, \u2018We\u2019ve arrested this guy\u2019, assuming I knew about it. But I didn\u2019t. The Labour party had sent out a fundraising email that he had responded to with a death threat. The party reported it to the police, but didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d Why not? \u201cI have no idea \u2013 it\u2019s neither here nor there now. The point is that the brutality and hostility is real and it\u2019s day to day. So I just thought: now\u2019s the time to take a leap, do something different \u2013 you\u2019ve had a good innings. You\u2019ve done good stuff. Go now. And it was quite quick.\u201d So the brutality and hostility was from outside the parliamentary party? He shakes his head. No, he says, there was plenty from inside. He reels off a long list. \u201cThe return of political factionalism. The idea that you could be portrayed as the enemy within. People questioning your motives. Social media pile-ons. Condemnation from powerful trade union general secretaries on broadcast media. Internal bickering. On their own, you deal with them and they\u2019re a normal part of life. Combine them, and you\u2019re carrying a very heavy load. And sometimes you\u2019ve got to realise when that balance of life shifts and there are other things that are more rewarding.\u201d Now, Watson is publishing a memoir, aptly titled Downsizing. He assures me his new life is going to be smaller in every way. He will dedicate himself to his two children Malachy, 14, and Saoirse, 11, staying fit, and helping others get fit, too. A few years ago he weighed 22 stone and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. \u201cI had overwhelming thoughts of death. I thought: you can\u2019t walk upstairs without feeling as if you need an oxygen mask. How have you got to this point?\u201d Watson realised that he could no longer fully function as a father, politician or human being. \u201cYou get to that point where you go: I\u2019ve got kids \u2013 I want to stay alive. You think what a useless dad you are: you can\u2019t kick a ball around with Malachy, you can\u2019t jump in the pool without emptying it.\u201d Watson went on a fat-heavy, low-carb, sugar-free diet. He ate bacon and eggs for breakfast, full-fat cheese and walnuts for dessert, and glugged back glasses of double cream if he still wasn\u2019t sated. And the weight just fell away. Even more astonishingly, his diabetes went into remission. *** A couple of weeks before the election, I meet Watson in Bewdley, a small riverside town in Worcestershire. We are three miles from Kidderminster, where he grew up, and barely a mile from where he lives today. Watson recently moved in with his new partner, and shares the parenting of his two children with his wife, Siobhan, from whom he separated in 2010, and who lives in Yorkshire. He wanted to meet here so we could go for a walk, and so he could show off his renewed stamina and love of the natural world. Most days Watson walks around 12km, and he looks a good decade younger than he did. For many years he could only wear outsized suits. Now, aged 52, he can wear what he wants, and he\u2019s loving it. Even his glasses look lighter. His political life goes back generations. His grandmother was a communist until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and his mother and father were both Labour; she was a secretary, he was an odd-job man, before both retrained as social workers. He remembers them running a tiny committee room from the family home in Kidderminster in 1974 \u2013 the intense seriousness of it all, the boisterous debates in the living room. He found it intoxicating. By the time Watson was 12, he was filling envelopes for the 1979 election from the more substantial committee room of the Power Loom Carpet Weavers\u2019 and Textiles Workers\u2019 Union. At 17, he was hired as a \u00a35,400-a-year trainee librarian at the Labour party\u2019s Walworth Road HQ, on the strength of being the only candidate who had seen the job advert, and because he knew how to use a word processor. He went to Hull University as a mature student in 1990, was elected president of the student union in 1991, became the Labour party\u2019s youth officer in 1993, and worked on the 1997 general election campaign, before leaving to become national political officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. Watson was elected MP for West Bromwich East in 2001. He was 17 stone when he entered parliament, with a reputation as a bruiser \u2013 partly because of his appearance, partly because of his trade union history, and partly because he could deliver a devastating attack with the understated calm of a mafioso. To his credit, Watson has rarely chosen easy targets, instead going for global media magnates and leaders of his own party. The one time he did was as campaign manager for Liam Byrne in the 2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill byelection. Watson took responsibility for a filthy campaign including a leaflet that featured the line: \u201cLabour is on your side; the Lib Dems are on the side of failed asylum-seekers.\u201d He says he \u201cwinces\u201d when he thinks about it now. \u201cI was so hungry for winning, I just took my eye off the ball. We won it by a few hundred votes, but I\u2019m very sorry about it.\u201d For all Watson\u2019s scheming, he was clubbable. Indeed, he says, this is why he put on even more weight. \u201cI loved eating, I loved the craic, I loved people\u2019s company, I loved long lunches with left-leaning journalists and a few beers after work.\u201d He would often start the day with two or three bacon butties in the members\u2019 tea room. Watson says as soon as he entered parliament he became more class conscious, aware that some regarded him as an oik. \u201cI\u2019d never order three bacon butties at the same time because that was a social faux pas even I was aware of.\u201d What stopped him \u2013 that it made him look greedy or plebby? \u201cDefinitely plebby.\u201d It\u2019s funny, he says, how desperate he was to escape Kidderminster as a young man, only to spend decades being condescended to in the Commons. \u201cThere\u2019s a terrible snobbery. It was a very exciting time, but I was patronised by people who were better educated and very ambitious in a classic way.\u201d He mentions a stint working as deputy general election coordinator in 1997. \u201cBenjamin Wegg-Prosser, who worked for Peter Mandelson, brought the Ikea catalogue to my desk and asked me to order the right sort of sofa for Peter in Millbank Tower, for when the great lord arrived to direct the campaign. I sat there thinking: when I joined the Labour party at 15, I didn\u2019t know I would be buying sofas for Peter Mandelson.\u201d He pauses, before adding how well he gets on with Mandelson these days, and what a charming man Wegg-Prosser is. By 2006, Watson had been promoted to under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Defence, successfully campaigning to ensure that soldiers shot for cowardice in the first world war received a posthumous pardon \u2013 one of his proudest achievements. It looked as if he was destined for swift elevation to a senior position. But then came the first of his famous acts of disloyalty \u2013 and the first in a series of resignations. After Tony Blair announced he would not stand down as prime minister, Watson was a signatory on a letter saying the leader should go, after nine years. The government\u2019s chief whip, Jacqui Smith, told him he had to withdraw his name. The next day he resigned instead. Blair responded that Watson\u2019s intervention was \u201cdisloyal, discourteous and wrong\u201d. Today, he says this is one of his great regrets. \u201cIt was rash and chaotic. I\u2019ve never said this publicly, but I shouldn\u2019t have done it that way.\u201d Why not? \u201cIf I\u2019d lost confidence in him, I should have told him to his face, and done it more respectfully. I was a kid, a junior minister, in a government that had achieved great things, and he deserved better.\u201d He\u2019s being candid, but knowingly so: it\u2019s not the only time Watson will say he\u2019s never said something publicly before, as if telling me where the story is. Watson returned to government under Gordon Brown a year later, first as a whip, then as minister for digital engagement and civil service issues. He had lost none of his love of the craic; there was nothing he liked more than a night out on the Guinness. How many could he get through? \u201cI could do eight or nine Guinnesses on a Friday.\u201d Is he being conservative? \u201cI could have probably got to a dozen. Not beyond that, because I\u2019m not a great drinker. But I liked drinking a lot.\u201d Did he worry that he was an alcoholic? \u201cNo. I never felt addicted. I could always not drink.\u201d Watson has resigned under every Labour leader he has worked for (from Brown\u2019s cabinet for personal reasons; and as the Labour party\u2019s campaign coordinator under Ed Miliband, after a row about candidate selection and losing faith in his boss). Watson insists it\u2019s a record he\u2019s not proud of, but I\u2019m not so sure. He stresses that he\u2019s never been sacked. In 2009, he joined the culture, media and sport select committee, where he found himself at the heart of an investigation into the phone hacking scandal. \u201cIt became my expert subject. It was overwhelming and obsessional. I was very boring to be with in those days. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. I was utterly driven by it.\u201d He made headlines with his forensic interrogation of Rupert and James Murdoch. In 2011, the News of the World was closed down after detectives said as many as 4,000 people had been hacked. A year later, Watson began another high-profile campaign to expose a so-called \u201cVIP paedophile ring\u201d. The campaign will probably be remembered for the attention he drew to \u201cNick\u201d, a man who accused senior politicians and establishment figures of sadistic sexual abuse and murder, prompting a \u00a32m investigation by the Metropolitan police. Nick was eventually named as Carl Beech, who in July this year was sentenced to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment after making false allegations against Conservative politicians Harvey Proctor, Leon Brittan and former prime minister Edward Heath, among others. How did Watson feel when Beech was found guilty? He pauses. The seconds pass slowly. \u201cI felt sick as a dog for the genuine victims, that this one case and this one person had set it back. There are people even now who are the victims of child sexual abuse who are not going to bring their cases to the attention of the criminal justice system.\u201d Did he feel that at any point he mishandled the situation? \u201cYes, when Leon Brittan died.\u201d After Brittan\u2019s death, Watson wrote an article in which he repeated a claim by Beech that Brittan was \u201cas close to evil as any human being could get\u201d. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that and I regret that, because it was an emotional response. I\u2019ve apologised for that. It was a mistake. I don\u2019t want to beat myself up for every mistake.\u201d While undoubtedly well intentioned, Watson\u2019s pursuit of a Westminster paedophile ring felt like an act of hubris; he seemed to have developed a sense of his own invincibility. Lady Brittan called for Watson to resign or be sacked, but he still insists he did more good than harm. \u201cPlease look at the lifelong predatory child sex abusers who went to jail as a result of the evidence provided to the police from whistleblowers who came to me. Please look at the work of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, which came about as a result of working with a group of cross-party MPs. Look at the work we did on bringing a group of MPs together to look at institutional abuse in music schools.\u201d *** We head off for a stroll along the River Severn. The four miles from Bewdley to Upper Arley is one of Watson\u2019s regular routes, and he is relaxed, easy company. As he walks, Watson chats about his love of music and the joys of nature \u2013 the cormorant that flies up and down the river, the cobalt blue of the kingfisher flashing past, the pike that always breaks his fishing line. Meanwhile, I\u2019m telling him how I have spent much of the past four years screaming at Corbyn\u2019s Labour. He nods sympathetically. No, I say, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I\u2019ve been screaming at you as well. Why, he asks. Because you were a supremely disloyal deputy. Because at times you seemed to be revelling in the chaos, making political capital out of sectarianism, antisemitism and Brexit division. He counters by asking if I would have preferred him to stay quiet and betray his principles. \u201cI was trying to stand up for pluralism. The Labour party only wins elections when it\u2019s the broadest of churches. But there are some sections around Jeremy and the Unite group that live in a binary world of left and right, good and evil, us and them, in and out. You can\u2019t run a two-party system without nuance and complexity, pluralism and respect for difference. Because ultimately you end up becoming a sect not a party.\u201d Corbyn and Watson, both lifelong rebels (Watson from the centre ground, Corbyn from the left), might have been the dream team, uniting two factions. I remind Watson that when he was elected deputy in 2015, he said: \u201cMy role is to unify the party, hold things together and make it work in difficult times.\u201d He smiles. \u201cWell, what\u2019s that Meat Loaf track? Two out of three ain\u2019t bad? I\u2019ve definitely not unified the party, have I? Nobody has done that. But I have helped hold it together in more ways than some people appreciate. And I\u2019ve definitely tried to make it more functional.\u201d He says he sensed the partnership with Corbyn was doomed from day one. \u201cWe had just won the leader and deputy leader ballots, and we were in this room on our own, and the first thing he said to me was, \u2018We\u2019ve got our party back.\u2019\u201d For Corbyn, he had wrestled control from the Blairites, but Watson had never felt part of any faction. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, I\u2019ve never really lost this party. We\u2019re going to have a bit of fun here, Jeremy.\u201d He talks about how ineptly his party dealt with antisemitism, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) inquiry. \u201cI made private representations on what we needed to do to stamp it out, and I still think that we need to do a lot more work. If the EHRC inquiry goes the wrong way, a great shame will befall the institution that I love. One of the reasons I joined the Labour party in the 1980s was because I was an avowed anti-racist, and you can\u2019t be discriminatory in that view.\u201d But he is fulsome in his praise of Corbyn as a man: his sincerity and devotion, the kindness he showed Watson\u2019s children. He is less kindly disposed towards Corbyn\u2019s advisers, and is furious that they involved themselves in the party\u2019s investigation into antisemitism. \u201cWhy were Andrew Murray and Seumas Milne anywhere near what are internal disciplinary racist cases? Milne is the press guy, Murray is the trade unionist seconded to help do whatever he was doing in the leader\u2019s office. They should not be involved in that process, period.\u201d He pauses, before returning to the subject of Murray. \u201cI did find it surprising that he would be in the Labour party, given that he is an avowed Stalinist.\u201d Watson briefly lived in a houseshare with another Labour power broker, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, after he separated from his wife in 2010. McCluskey and Watson had an acrimonious falling out. Watson says he can tell me exactly when: it was July 2016, the Saturday of the Unite conference, after Corbyn lost a vote of no confidence by Labour MPs, a seemingly disastrous 172-40 against. \u201cThe last time I spoke to Len was when we were having private talks about how we handle the vote of no confidence in Jeremy. He was basically offering a fairly long-term departure date for Jeremy to go \u2013 hints at, not absolute offers, that Jeremy would go in 2018. It was very delicate because I had not been authorised by anyone to negotiate, so I didn\u2019t know who I was negotiating for. I was trying to stop a damaging leadership election.\u201d Hold on: are you telling me McCluskey has the clout to decide when Corbyn goes? \u201cI suspect he was using a bit of licence himself. He was caveating it, but it was certainly dangled.\u201d Does he believe he was an honourable deputy? \u201cOh God! Well, I hope so.\u201d I ask Watson if it\u2019s true that he voted for Owen Smith in the subsequent leadership challenge. Watson seems taken aback, and stutters to an answer. \u201cErm, I never said who I voted for. Nor did I endorse any candidate.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI did vote for Owen, but I\u2019ve never said it publicly before.\u201d Why him, rather than his boss? \u201cI thought, as soon as the leader loses the confidence of the parliamentary party it\u2019s almost impossible to see how you can form a government. I thought Jeremy should have resigned, and he nearly did. But actually I was wrong on that. He went over the heads of the PLP and won a resounding mandate from the membership.\u201d Watson is still thinking about whether he behaved honourably. \u201cI didn\u2019t nominate Owen, which caused some irritation to his team. Nor did I publicly endorse him.\u201d I burst out laughing \u2013 blimey, asking you to nominate Smith while you were Corbyn\u2019s deputy is a bit much, I say. Now it\u2019s Watson\u2019s turn to laugh. \u201cWell, they were feverish times. And you know, I did think about it \u2013 not nominating anybody seemed a bit cowardly.\u201d As the Brexit process wore on, Watson says he tried to voice his opinion privately. \u201cI raised my view that there should be a people\u2019s vote at the shadow cabinet Brexit subcommittee in 2018, and I was never invited back.\u201d Whose decision was that? \u201cI\u2019ve no idea. So I decided to say it publicly, and we moved to a position in favour of a people\u2019s vote, albeit a slightly nuanced one. I think I contributed to a policy decision that was pretty fundamental to the party and I was perfectly within my rights to do that.\u201d In September this year, just before the Labour party conference, Watson was the victim of what he described as \u201ca drive-by shooting\u201d when Momentum founder Jon Lansman tabled a motion to scrap the post of deputy. Watson survived, and the motion was withdrawn, but he looked very isolated. Was he surprised by the motion? He was astonished, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could pre-empt such political idiocy, and collective self-harm.\u201d But you do have a reputation for being serially disloyal to your leaders, I say. Actually, he says, he prefers to look at it another way: that he is non-tribal. \u201cA tribal politician is somebody who stays within a particular faction and takes a line. I guess occasionally I\u2019ve been a contrarian, more than disloyal. I\u2019ve never really taken kindly to being told what to do.\u201d I ask Watson if he thinks he has changed over the years. \u201cI was a bit shrill and immature in my early days. I\u2019m much more aware of my frailties. I don\u2019t feel the need to hide my inadequacies.\u201d People have called him a bully \u2013 is that fair? He thinks long and hard. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bully.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound totally convinced. \u201cI\u2019m not a bully, but I\u2019ve got a tendency to get obsessed with certain issues and not let them go. A dog with a bone is probably what I am.\u201d *** Watson already refers to himself as an ex-politician, and he clearly feels liberated. He is taking his level two gym instructor qualification, and admits it\u2019s a struggle \u2013 he is older and less supple than the other students. But he insists the career change is real. He wants to educate people on the risk of diabetes and how to treat it through diet. What if he were offered a place in the House of Lords? \u201cNo. I\u2019m going to be a level two gym instructor.\u201d Is that a promise? \u201cWell, has it been offered and have I asked for it? No. And I think it\u2019s highly unlikely that I\u2019d be on Jeremy\u2019s list. But were it offered me, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do.\u201d Is that a yes? \u201cI\u2019ve got redundancy pay till 12 February. I haven\u2019t even written a CV yet. I don\u2019t know what my future holds. What I do know is that my days of frontline politics are definitely over.\u201d He returns to the heady days of 1974, when he was seven years old, watching his parents fight for Harold Wilson, and 1979, when he was campaigning for Jim Callaghan in a classroom mock election. That buzz has long gone, he says. And for much of the time since it has been all sound and fury. \u201cPolitics was like a cacophony of voices in my head for 35 years. And if I\u2019ve got Jeremy to thank for anything, it\u2019s that those voices are extinguished. I just feel free. I want to be an instrument for good. But I want to work with relentlessly positive people I like. And it\u2019s very hard to say I\u2019ve worked with relentlessly positive people in recent years.\u201d \u2022 Tom Watson\u2019s Downsizing is published on 2 January by Octopus at \u00a314.99.

Every season brings its own particular joy for walkers, but the winter months hold the landscape\u2019s subtlest pleasures: goldcrests, linnets and hawfinches; frosted hazel and hornbeam; the red hips of the wild dog rose. The paths are clay, and soft underfoot, which makes for occasionally muddy though always pleasurable walking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The jewel in the walk is undoubtedly Sissinghurst Castle, once home to the writer Vita Sackville-West</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Head out from St Dunstan\u2019s Church in Cranbrook. Known as the Cathedral of the Weald, the church is more than 500 years old, and the depictions of the pagan Green Man, in both wooden shields and a porch stone carving, nod to the time when the surrounding area was covered by dense forest. From here you head northwards, away from the town and the main road and out into woodland. There is an intimacy to the landscape here, in part due to the patchwork of small, oddly shaped fields, a remnant of medieval times when the land was first cleared for farming: the hedgerows you pass today evolved out of the strips of woodland \u2013 or \u201cshaws\u201d \u2013 that once divided them.</p> <p>This particular walk is long, though easy to abbreviate, and guides you through some of the county\u2019s agricultural history \u2013 past fruit orchards, hopper huts that housed workers from London during the picking season, former millponds, and clothiers\u2019 houses. At one point you will spill out on to the intriguingly named Digdog Lane \u2014 so-called for the stray dogs that would dig up plague victims buried in the land nearby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45100bc915ef5ad8f84249e76f8058b2ea75f25c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45100bc915ef5ad8f84249e76f8058b2ea75f25c/38_902_3863_2318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Three Chimneys pub, Biddenden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Three Chimneys pub, Biddenden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The jewel in the walk is undoubtedly Sissinghurst Castle, once home to the writer Vita Sackville-West and her husband, author and diplomat Harold Nicolson. Over the course of 30 years, the couple transformed the one-time farmstead into one of the most revered gardens in England. Winter, when Sackville-West\u2019s exuberant planting stands in relief, is a fine moment to relish the formality of Nicolson\u2019s garden design: the series of garden rooms and immaculate hedges, the long walk of pleached limes.</p> <p>From the castle you may turn towards Sissinghurst itself, a handsome village built on the wealth of the Wealden iron and cloth industries, and then back to Cranbrook.

It\u2019s worth taking this route up Coille na Glas Leitir (the Wood of the Grey Slope) slowly, because there\u2019s an extraordinary amount to see. The pines on the lower slopes accommodate rich communities of mosses and liverworts. Look out for pine martens and woodland birds. Soon, these tall trees give way to stunted rowans and the bird-life becomes sparse. But an eagle \u2013 white-tailed or golden \u2013 might drift above.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/oct/05/glen-coe-glencoe-scotland-adventure-holiday-ice-climbing-hiking-cycling-skiing\">Peak and mix: adventure activities in Glen Coe, Scotland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Climb higher, and things get stranger.

You might spot flurries of snow buntings, and even orange liverwort (the species is found in only four known sites; the other three are in Norway). The greatest appeal of this walk, however, is the scale of the view as you breach the plateau.

Here it turns east along a never-ending line of hedgerows alive with the flitterings of small birds, including linnets and corn buntings. In front of 16th-century Bower Hall, the swiftly flowing Stour is shrouded by willows, a perfect spot to watch for kingfishers and, less likely, the otters now re-established on this stretch. Nearing Cavendish, at Pentlow hamlet, an evocative early medieval church, St Gregory\u2019s, with an unusual round tower and in great nick, appears between trees.</p> <p>Now turning north and crossing the river back into Suffolk, the route passes gardens and eccentric cottages as it enters Cavendish. The unpretentious, Greene King-serving Five Bells commands the large village green and is an ideal pit stop.

      "bodyText": "Cranbrook-Sissinghurst, Kent Start/finish Cranbrook Distance/time 10 miles/5 hours Refuel The Three Chimneys, Biddenden \u201cUnless a man understands the Weald, he cannot easily write about the beginnings of England,\u201d Hilaire Belloc noted early in the last century, admiring \u201call that roll of land which lies held between and above the chalk of south-eastern England\u201d and that crosses Sussex, Kent, Surrey, Hampshire. The point at which the High Weald arcs into Kent is to my eye the English landscape at its most sublime \u2013 a stretch of ancient woodland and oast housed-prettiness, where the combination of earth scent and leaf shade seems to suggest that here the land sits at its deepest. Every season brings its own particular joy for walkers, but the winter months hold the landscape\u2019s subtlest pleasures: goldcrests, linnets and hawfinches; frosted hazel and hornbeam; the red hips of the wild dog rose. The paths are clay, and soft underfoot, which makes for occasionally muddy though always pleasurable walking. Head out from St Dunstan\u2019s Church in Cranbrook. Known as the Cathedral of the Weald, the church is more than 500 years old, and the depictions of the pagan Green Man, in both wooden shields and a porch stone carving, nod to the time when the surrounding area was covered by dense forest. From here you head northwards, away from the town and the main road and out into woodland. There is an intimacy to the landscape here, in part due to the patchwork of small, oddly shaped fields, a remnant of medieval times when the land was first cleared for farming: the hedgerows you pass today evolved out of the strips of woodland \u2013 or \u201cshaws\u201d \u2013 that once divided them. This particular walk is long, though easy to abbreviate, and guides you through some of the county\u2019s agricultural history \u2013 past fruit orchards, hopper huts that housed workers from London during the picking season, former millponds, and clothiers\u2019 houses. At one point you will spill out on to the intriguingly named Digdog Lane \u2014 so-called for the stray dogs that would dig up plague victims buried in the land nearby. The jewel in the walk is undoubtedly Sissinghurst Castle, once home to the writer Vita Sackville-West and her husband, author and diplomat Harold Nicolson. Over the course of 30 years, the couple transformed the one-time farmstead into one of the most revered gardens in England. Winter, when Sackville-West\u2019s exuberant planting stands in relief, is a fine moment to relish the formality of Nicolson\u2019s garden design: the series of garden rooms and immaculate hedges, the long walk of pleached limes. From the castle you may turn towards Sissinghurst itself, a handsome village built on the wealth of the Wealden iron and cloth industries, and then back to Cranbrook. Or head east towards the Three Chimneys, an oak-beamed and open-fired freehouse, winner of the Good Pub Guide\u2019s county dining award, and a fine place to sample Kentish ale. Laura Barton, journalist and author of Twenty-One Locks Beinn Eighe Mountain Trail, Wester Ross Start/finish A832 by Loch Maree Distance/time 4 miles/3\u00bd hours Refuel Kinlochewe Hotel, Kinlochewe Setting out from the luscious banks of Loch Maree, this walk climbs through pine woods to an icy quartzite plateau with stupendous mountain views. The ascent is hard work, but the steepness makes it special. In few other places can walkers cross so many habitats, or seem to see so many seasons, quite this quickly. The ascent is up a well-marked but extremely rugged path that\u2019s unalleviated by flat ground (a free guide to the route can be picked up in the car park). It\u2019s worth taking this route up Coille na Glas Leitir (the Wood of the Grey Slope) slowly, because there\u2019s an extraordinary amount to see. The pines on the lower slopes accommodate rich communities of mosses and liverworts. Look out for pine martens and woodland birds. Soon, these tall trees give way to stunted rowans and the bird-life becomes sparse. But an eagle \u2013 white-tailed or golden \u2013 might drift above. Climb higher, and things get stranger. Look for polygonal patterns of frost heave underfoot, and spiny prostrate junipers that cower in fissures in the rock. You might spot flurries of snow buntings, and even orange liverwort (the species is found in only four known sites; the other three are in Norway). The greatest appeal of this walk, however, is the scale of the view as you breach the plateau. This is the kind of scene that you can only usually get from the highest peaks (which would require crampons and ice axe); catch it on a cold, clear day and these mountains will be etched in your memory for ever. From the plateau you could take a different route back down the same slope, but there are many alternatives to extend the walk. Whatever you choose, warm up at the Kinlochewe Hotel afterwards. It has rooms, a bunkhouse, hearty dishes and whisky, including Octomore (an intense peat hit) and the full range of Old Pulteneys (for warming sweetness on any budget). You can also take a look at Beinn Eighe: the Saw-Toothed Mountain, Dick Balbarry and J Laughton\u2019s book outlining the rich history of the slopes you\u2019ve just climbed. \u2022 Check weather conditions and mountain guide advice, scotlandinfo.eu David Gange, author of The Frayed Atlantic Edge: A Historian\u2019s Journey from Shetland to the Channel Chelmorton, Peak District Start/finish Main Street, Chelmorton Distance/time 6 miles/2\u00bd hours Refuel The Church Inn, Chelmorton Winter sees the Peak District at its bleakest, but as vegetation disappears and pasture is stripped of wildlife, the landscape gives up clues to its history. The linear village of Chelmorton is famous for its distinctive pattern of drystone walls, which delineate thin strips of land said to predate the enclosure acts. From Main Street, the hill of Chelmorton Low, topped by two prehistoric tumuli, looms over the village. At its foot is St John the Baptist, said to be the highest church in Derbyshire, where a golden locust weather vane glints atop the spire. The road ends at Bank Pit Spring where Illy Willy Water cascades into an underground stream. The uphill path runs through the remains of a rake, a mined vertical vein of lead. Some of the undulating grassy mounds in the fields are old mine workings. The industrial is never far away in the Peak District. At the top, it is worth taking a short detour along the concessionary path to Five Wells cairn, one of the UK\u2019s highest megalithic burial chambers, with fine views across Taddington Moor. There are many ancient tombs on the hills around Chelmorton, most of them excavated (or desecrated, depending on your point of view) by Victorian antiquarians. Back on the bridleway, tramp through the fields until you meet the Limestone Way, the long-distance footpath through the White Peak plateau. Head towards the village of Flagg, whose Elizabethan manor was once renowned for its \u201chaunted\u201d skull, which repelled all attempts to give it a decent burial. The final leg, crossing fields on signposted footpaths, leads to a junction known as Chelmorton Thorn, a reminder of the old tradition of planting hawthorn bushes at crossroads and other liminal places. From here, it drops back down into Chelmorton and the 18th-century Church Inn, with its excellent food and an open fire that keeps temperatures inside close to tropical. A welcome contrast to the Peak District bite. Sarah Ward, author of the DC Connie Childs crime novels (Faber Books) Meall a\u2019Bhuachaille, Cairngorms Start/finish Glenmore Forest visitor centre Distance/time 5.5 miles/4 hours Refuel The Pine Marten Bar, Glenmore For a journey into winter wonderland, the circular walk up Meall a\u2019Bhuachaille (the Shepherd\u2019s Hill) takes some beating. Stunning views, rare wildlife and native woodland regeneration: think of this walk as a whisky; the Cairngorms distilled into pure, rich form. Climbing this peak, I always experience \u201cthat joyous release of body\u201d that Nan Shepherd terms feyness. From the visitor centre, follow a track uphill through the forest. Keep your eyes peeled for red squirrels, roe deer and pine martens. As the track narrows to a path, you emerge on to open southern slopes. The hard edge of the forest is beginning to soften. Deer are carefully managed to enable pine, birch and willow trees to self-seed and grow up the hill. Among the new seedlings, regal old granny pines stand tall. When the sun reflects off the snow, the crowns of these 100-year-old survivors glow a wonderful warm copper colour. Gaining the ridge, continue uphill to the bulky granite cairn. At 810 metres high, there are excellent views across Glenmore Forest, the Cairngorms plateau, the Moray Firth and \u2013 on an exceptionally clear day \u2013 Ben Nevis. It can be very cold and windy, so lunch is best saved for the shelter of Ryvoan bothy; then turn right along the Thieves Road, an old drovers\u2019 route that was also used by fearsome cateran (cattle raiders). The track leads into a dramatic glacial valley: meltwater once poured through this channel; now the steep sides are lined with regenerating Caledonian forest. Leave the track for a moment to visit Lochan Uaine (the Green Lochan). The water is a distinctive turquoise because fairies wash their clothes here (although the wee people must struggle in winter, because the lochan is often frozen). Turn right on a smaller path that soon winds uphill through beautiful old Scots pines with views to the Northern Corries. A gentle descent on forest track leads back to your starting point. Call into the Reindeer Centre to see if Rudolph is at home. Finish up in the cosy wood-panelled Pine Marten Bar for a taste of Cairngorm apr\u00e8s ski. \u2022 Check weather forecast and mountain guide advice before setting off, walkhighlands.co.uk Anna Fleming, writer and climber, whose book, Time on Rock: A Climber\u2019s Route into the Mountains, will be published by Canongate in 2022 The Blorenge, Brecon Beacons Start/finish Abergavenny Distance/time 10 miles/5 hours Refuel The Angel Hotel, Abergavenny Pick up an almond croissant from the town\u2019s Angel Bakery. You\u2019ll need energy, because after a gentle (pre)amble past the castle, along the River Usk and then under the Monmouthshire and Brecon canal using a low, vaulted, dripping foot tunnel, you start the steep ascent of the Blorenge. The climb follows the route of Hill\u2019s Tramroad, built in the 1820s to transport pig iron and limestone to the canal, a reminder of the area\u2019s rich industrial heritage. Luckily, the stone sleepers are still there to provide steps. Two-thirds of the way up, turn left and follow the mercifully flatter path along the Cwm Craf, a hollow on Blorenge\u2019s north-east face, past Keeper\u2019s Pond, cradled by the Punchbowl, once the scene of bare-knuckle fights, and along a sunken road between huge, ancient trees described by Richard Mabey as \u201ca whirlpool of wood \u2026 immense gargoyles of beech\u201d. Climb again now, above the trees, squelching through bog and gorse, to the bleak, tussocky summit plateau, the world around you opening up. To the north the Skirrid and Sugar Loaf loom proprietorially over Abergavenny; to the west is Pen y Fan, south Wales\u2019 highest peak; and to the south the Bristol Channel glints under the winter sun, if you are so blessed. Take extra clothes, for the Blorenge can be a beast when she blows. Near the summit (561 metres) is a bronze age burial site, and a plaque marking the place where Foxhunter, a champion showjumper, was buried in 1959. The ashes of his rider, Sir Harry Llewellyn, were scattered on the same spot in 1999. Find a place in the lee of rocks to eat your sandwiches and contemplate the two words in the English language that rhyme with orange. You\u2019re sitting on one. Turn for home now, the hard work done, dropping down around the western flank of the mountain, past a Somme-like wasteland on the hillside, until recently a magnificent larch wood before the rampaging ramorum disease wiped it out. Back in Abergavenny, bag one of the sumptuous leather sofas next to the roaring fire in the wood-panelled Foxhunter bar of the Angel Hotel \u2013 2020 Cesar Welsh Hotel of the Year \u2013 and order a pint of Sir Harry, named after the late, great showjumper. You will have earned it. Mike Carter, whose latest book is All Together Now: One Man\u2019s Walk in Search of His Father and a Lost England Clare and Cavendish, Suffolk/Essex Start/finish Clare country park Distance/time 7 miles/3 hours Refuel Five Bells, Cavendish; Swan, Clare It would be perfect to arrive in picturesque Clare by train to start this stroll amid quietly magical countryside, but Richard Beeching took that from us in the 1960s. The ornate Victorian station building is now the friendly, warm Platform One cafe. Clare country park is hard to tear yourself away from, with its lofty ruins of a Norman castle, its greens, woods, old priory, ponds and railway platforms. And then there\u2019s one of southern England\u2019s most charismatic rivers, the Stour, of Constable fame. His most famous painting, at Flatford Mill, depicts scenes 30 miles south-east, in the more frequented Dedham Vale. But Clare revels in its relative obscurity, with a profusion of well-signposted walks starting from the country park. This route to another characterful village, Cavendish, takes walkers south initially, past the handsome Mill House and across the Stour into Essex. Here it turns east along a never-ending line of hedgerows alive with the flitterings of small birds, including linnets and corn buntings. In front of 16th-century Bower Hall, the swiftly flowing Stour is shrouded by willows, a perfect spot to watch for kingfishers and, less likely, the otters now re-established on this stretch. Nearing Cavendish, at Pentlow hamlet, an evocative early medieval church, St Gregory\u2019s, with an unusual round tower and in great nick, appears between trees. Now turning north and crossing the river back into Suffolk, the route passes gardens and eccentric cottages as it enters Cavendish. The unpretentious, Greene King-serving Five Bells commands the large village green and is an ideal pit stop. Behind is St Mary\u2019s church, where it\u2019s claimed that in 1381 the local big cheese, John Cavendish, was seized, later to be killed in revenge for the slaying of peasants\u2019 revolt leader Wat Tyler. Cross the green and pass the cemetery to head west across low hills and vast fields, gold, green and black under the lowering winter sun, and through woody dips back to Clare. The village finally appears below, dominated by yet another Grade I-listed church. Drop in at the traditionally styled Swan, which serves Adnams, Timothy Taylor\u2019s Landlord and solid homemade pub grub, including four veggie options and pizzas. But beer aficionados who aren\u2019t hungry might prefer to walk through the village for 10 minutes to The Globe, a lively Camra-award winner, with guest ales and live bands. Both are dog friendly. \u2022 clarewalks.co.uk Adam McCulloch, author of the Kent Walks Near London guide St Ives to Zennor, Cornwall Start St Ives, Porthmeor beach Finish Tinners Arms, Zennor Distance/time 6.5 miles/4 hours Refuel Tinners Arms New Year\u2019s Day is my New Year\u2019s Eve. I celebrate when the first light of a new year hits the skies. For day one I need to be outside, with a face full of cold sea air and a view of some broiling waves. This walk delivers exactly that. It is a point-to-point walk along the North Cornwall coastal path. The path is clear but requires scrambling in places. It\u2019s one of those you might decide upon casually, perhaps the morning after a night in St Ives, thinking a walk to a pub would be nice; then halfway through you remember it\u2019s four hours long and that\u2019s quite a long time. After a couple of hours, the headland becomes wild Atlantic coast. You might see seals below, basking on black rocks by turquoise, ice-cold water. You consider scrambling down the cliffside to strip off and dunk yourself in that refreshing scene as a baptism of faith \u2013 in the days and seasons to come. The walk becomes a meditation of sorts, where all that needs to happen is to reach point B and you will find civilisation again; but for now the work of putting one foot in front of the other brings space and peace. Just when you feel thoroughly fatigued you take the path away from the sea to Zennor, and find yourself in a low-ceilinged 13th-century inn with a roaring fire, ordering thick-cut salty chips and sipping cold beer through wind-chapped lips. DH Lawrence called Zennor \u201cthe most beautiful place\u201d, with a view of the \u201cinfinite Atlantic \u2026 lovelier even than the Mediterranean \u2026 It is the best place I have been in, I think.\u201d Made even lovelier by arriving on foot, the whole walk is a fantastic way to process the year past and begin anew. On reaching Zennor you can book a taxi back to St Ives, or take the bus, although as there are no buses on New Year\u2019s Day, you could make this a circular walk back through the countryside, via Tremedda and Trevalgan \u2013 a total distance of 12 miles. \u2022 stives.co.uk Kate Friend, photographer Craggy Woods, Cumbria Start/finish Staveley village Distance/time 3 miles/ 1 hour 20 minutes Refuel Wilf\u2019s Caf\u00e9 At the entrance to the Kentmere valley a perfect wooded dome rises behind the village of Staveley. The path enters Craggy Woods at a small wooden gate on the back road to Littlewood, then traverses the hillside beneath the eponymous vaulting crags. The route winds its way steeply, affording views south over the valley of the River Kent. Buzzards frequent Craggy, as the wood is known, and with the right conditions they can be heard mewing contact calls as they surf thermals. On reaching the top, the rewards are great. Not only do walkers continue at the level of the ancient beech canopy, but looking north, a zen landscape of rocky outcrops and sheltering field hawthorn unfolds, leading the eye into the head of the Kentmere valley and the summits of Shipman Knotts, Kentmere Pike, Froswick, Ill Bell and Yoke. The path continues through a sheltered vale of ancient yew and beech, accumulations of last season\u2019s golden leaves and beech mast crunching underfoot, then passes a pair of four-foot-high stone obelisks. The pillars mark the position of air-vents used during the construction of the Thirlmere-to-Manchester aqueduct. This feat of engineering, which opened in 1894, transports water directly from the centre of the Lake District 96 miles into the heart of Manchester, and tunnels directly underneath the wooded hillside. It\u2019s the longest gravity-fed aqueduct in Britain \u2013 there\u2019s not a single pump along the route. Elsewhere, a series of black gates inserted into drystone walls mark the ongoing route of the aqueduct. At the woodland boundary turn right over the fields to Littlewood, along the lanes at the back of Craggy, passing beneath the slopes of Potter Fell and winding past a discreet little tarn hidden behind an outcrop fusion of rock and tree. Staveley offers a choice of excellent hostelries, from the Mill Yard\u2019s Wilf\u2019s Caf\u00e9, on the banks of the River Kent, More Bakery or, further along the main street, ale and good grub at the Eagle and Child. Karen Lloyd, author of The Blackbird Diaries The Twelve Apostles, West Yorkshire Start/finish Dick Hudsons Pub, Bingley Distance/time 4 miles/1 hour 30 minutes Refuel Dick Hudsons Pub A shifting and moody landscape, one minute frozen solid, then squelching through mud, this is the perfect walk to shift gear into winter. It\u2019s not a taxing route, but encourages a steady rhythm, allowing the mind to wander and random conversation to ensue while bumping into the odd fell runner or solo walker. The landscape provides a rich tapestry of colours and textures you can\u2019t help but pause to take in, savouring the moment and allowing yourself the pleasure of setting your own pace. Long enough to feel virtuous, the real treat is finding The Twelve Apostles, a prehistoric stone circle set high up on the moors, the perfect place for a winter solstice gathering to gaze at the stars. Originally said to have been 20 stones, it is believed it was used to observe the sun and the moon, allowing bronze age settlers to know when winter was coming. This intriguing and playful ancient site is the perfect pit stop before continuing on to either the Doubler Stones and Ilkley, or back to the pub for warmth and rewards. Dick Hudsons Pub was formerly a hostelry that was famous for its food and wine between 1850 and 1878, long before it was taken over by the eponymous Mr Hudson, who was a farmer and food lover. A cosy country pub complete with roaring log fire, it welcomes \u201cmuddy boots and paws\u201d. Savour a hot chocolate or a warming whisky as you look out onto one of the best views in the country and plan your next ramble. \u2022 See another version of this walk at ilkleymoor.org Shanaz Gulzar, presenter of Yorkshire Walks on BBC Four, available on BBC iPlayer North Down coastal path, County Down Start Holywood Esplanade End Orlock Point, Portavo Distance/time 16 miles/7 hours Refuel The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn; Grace Neill\u2019s, Donaghadee Taking in some of Northern Ireland\u2019s most picturesque coastal towns and villages, this 16-mile trek sees beachy vistas and country parks give way to tucked-away treasures and much more besides. After taking in postcard-worthy panoramas at the esplanade in Holywood, start off in the morning towards Bangor via the Royal North Yacht Club. In this first section, navigating a little public footpath before rejoining the coastal path is a pay-off in itself \u2013 with the consistent promise of beautifully rugged coastline, by way of winding gravel and asphalt pathways, blooms of winter wildflowers, offshore grey seals and a soul-affirming sea breeze. A jewel in the crown of windswept North Down, even in winter, Helen\u2019s Bay Beach in Crawfordsburn country park is as idyllic as it comes. Set aside some time to take in its gently shelving sands, which are framed by the wooded headlands and meadows. Ready for a little rest? Mosey into the village of Crawfordsburn to warm up in The Old Inn, which is also a fine boutique hotel (doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B) located on one of the island\u2019s most ancient highways, leading from Holywood Priory to the Parent Abbey at Bangor. You will find easy access to Helen\u2019s Bay railway station if you wish to cut the walk short here. Otherwise, resume towards Orlock Point in Portavo via the seaside town of Bangor. Offering stunning views of the Copeland Islands, across the Irish Sea towards Scotland, the end of the trail doubles up as an enchanting mosaic of semi-natural habitats which support a rich medley of plants and animals. Still kicking? A further two-mile amble down the coast to rest up at the supremely cosy Grace Neill\u2019s in Donaghadee will seal the deal. Opened in 1611, it\u2019s a perfectly secluded little inn to come into from out of the cold, sip a hot whiskey and reflect upon sore heels and a day well spent. From Orlock Point or Donaghadee catch the frequent bus back to Bangor station or beyond. \u2022 walkni.com Brian Coney, writer and editor living in Belfast Looking for a holiday with a difference?

L&amp;Q told Guardian Money that it manages several shared ownership homes within the Azure building, and that responsibility for providing the information which many mortgage lenders are asking for lies with the freeholder, Telford Homes. It says that due to an administration error, it did not refer residents to Telford Homes in the first instance. \u201cSince then, we have secured confirmation from the freeholder that the Azure Building, which is largely a brick structure, meets government requirements and contains no ACM [aluminium composite material] cladding. We hope this information will be sufficient for mortgage lenders and are liaising with the freeholder about getting this report to residents.\u201d</p> <p>L&amp;Q is a member of the <a href=\"https://g15.london/\" title=\"\">G15</a>, a group of London\u2019s largest housing associations. G15 chair Helen Evans told us: \u201cThis is a situation affecting thousands of leaseholders up and down the country and should be high on the new government\u2019s agenda. We are calling on them to help unstick this process, provide urgently needed clarity to their confusing guidance, and explore funding as costs associated with building safety will otherwise leave many leaseholders with unaffordable bills and reduce the capacity of housing associations to build new affordable homes.\u201d</p> <p>Peabody told us it sympathises with Jerome Cox and adds that the industry \u201cdesperately needs\u201d the government to step in on this issue.</p> <h2>What the big mortgage lenders are saying</h2> <p>Nationwide says that, like other lenders, it requires a valuer acting for it to get confirmation from an expert that the property is safe and meets the requirements of advice note 14. It adds: \u201cThe industry is working on an external wall form which will make it easier for a valuer to understand the output of the fire reports and for them to understand what works need doing, which will help them value the property.\u201d</p> <p>Santander told us it considers a range of factors before deciding whether to lend including, on some high-rise buildings, whether the safety of the construction materials used meets government guidelines.</p> <p>The Lloyds group, which includes Halifax, says it is working closely with the industry on this \u201ccomplex issue\u201d. It says the advice of its valuation and conveyancing service providers is considered on lending applications to ensure the relevant official guidelines are met, adding: \u201cWe review such applications to help support customers\u2019 individual circumstances.\u201d</p>",

It says that due to an administration error, it did not refer residents to Telford Homes in the first instance. \u201cSince then, we have secured confirmation from the freeholder that the Azure Building, which is largely a brick structure, meets government requirements and contains no ACM [aluminium composite material] cladding. We hope this information will be sufficient for mortgage lenders and are liaising with the freeholder about getting this report to residents.\u201d L&amp;Q is a member of the G15, a group of London\u2019s largest housing associations. G15 chair Helen Evans told us: \u201cThis is a situation affecting thousands of leaseholders up and down the country and should be high on the new government\u2019s agenda. We are calling on them to help unstick this process, provide urgently needed clarity to their confusing guidance, and explore funding as costs associated with building safety will otherwise leave many leaseholders with unaffordable bills and reduce the capacity of housing associations to build new affordable homes.\u201d Peabody told us it sympathises with Jerome Cox and adds that the industry \u201cdesperately needs\u201d the government to step in on this issue. What the big mortgage lenders are saying Nationwide says that, like other lenders, it requires a valuer acting for it to get confirmation from an expert that the property is safe and meets the requirements of advice note 14. It adds: \u201cThe industry is working on an external wall form which will make it easier for a valuer to understand the output of the fire reports and for them to understand what works need doing, which will help them value the property.\u201d Santander told us it considers a range of factors before deciding whether to lend including, on some high-rise buildings, whether the safety of the construction materials used meets government guidelines. The Lloyds group, which includes Halifax, says it is working closely with the industry on this \u201ccomplex issue\u201d. It says the advice of its valuation and conveyancing service providers is considered on lending applications to ensure the relevant official guidelines are met, adding: \u201cWe review such applications to help support customers\u2019 individual circumstances.\u201d",

You\u2019re funny and sensitive, interested and modern. You\u2019re bright without being a smartarse. You\u2019re gorgeous but haven\u2019t got a clue you are. These days, you\u2019ve got loads of aches and pains, and a fair few worries, but you don\u2019t bang on about them.</p> <p>Our Sharon and I often talk about how when we were young, loads of our friends wished you were their mum because they could talk to you, have a laugh with you and never felt patronised or snubbed by you. They loved coming to our house when we were kids, and it wasn\u2019t just because of the huge carrier bag we had crammed with chocolate (credit to Dad, here). It was because of you.</p> <p>At 91 it\u2019s fair to say you\u2019re a bit diminished \u2013 you\u2019ve lost about five inches, I reckon. So there\u2019s less of you, but only physically. Those friends who wanted you as their mum all those years ago think you\u2019re even more of a marvel than they used to. I can\u2019t wait to tell them you\u2019ve just bought your first leather skirt. And, of course, as time goes on and they lose their mums, or their mums become more cranky or mean-spirited or bigoted, they want a bit of you more than ever. But they can\u2019t have you.

They loved coming to our house when we were kids, and it wasn\u2019t just because of the huge carrier bag we had crammed with chocolate (credit to Dad, here). It was because of you. At 91 it\u2019s fair to say you\u2019re a bit diminished \u2013 you\u2019ve lost about five inches, I reckon. So there\u2019s less of you, but only physically. Those friends who wanted you as their mum all those years ago think you\u2019re even more of a marvel than they used to. I can\u2019t wait to tell them you\u2019ve just bought your first leather skirt. And, of course, as time goes on and they lose their mums, or their mums become more cranky or mean-spirited or bigoted, they want a bit of you more than ever. But they can\u2019t have you. Because you\u2019re mine (and Sharon\u2019s). Simon",

How weird it was that we had been paired with someone we already knew, and the clearly quite impressive matchmaking skills of the Blind Date team. Any awkward moments? When he asked why I never messaged him back after he asked me out for a drink a few months ago (he was very understanding). Also, the gay couple who hit on us in the bar afterwards, and then heckled us in the street. Good table manners? Admirable. Best thing about Robbie? His laid-back and fun nature \u2013 and that he sneezes when he\u2019s full. Would you introduce him to your friends? Well, he already knows a couple. So why not the rest? Describe Robbie in three words Big, fun, energy. What do you think he made of you? A tall, giggly, Scottish idiot with a passion for shopping Did you go on somewhere? A bar in Soho for a few more drinks. And\u2026 did you kiss? Yes, for the whole of Soho to see \u2013 stunning. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? That the custard buns ended up in my bag. I could\u2019ve really used one to soak up the booze on the way home, or to snack on as I write these answers. Marks out of 10? 9. Would you meet again? Sure thing, it would be a waste not to. Robbie on Sam What were you hoping for? Please not someone I\u2019ve chatted to on the apps before. First impressions? It\u2019s Sam from Tinder! What did you talk about? Our mutual friend Nancy, Quorn picnic eggs, Drag Race UK, Scotland. Any awkward moments? The couple next to us asking us incredibly awkward questions about sex. Good table manners? Sam was the perfect pescatarian sharing partner. Best thing about Sam? He\u2019s an absolute smiler. Would you introduce him to your friends? He already knows a few, but definitely. Describe Sam in three words Cute, chatty, confident. What do you think he made of you? Tiny, funny, easy to chat with. Did you go on somewhere? A local gay bar for a drag show. And\u2026 did you kiss? A snog outside the tube. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Softer lighting in the restaurant. Marks out of 10? 9. Would you meet again? Absolutely. \u2022 Robbie and Sam ate at Bun House, London WC2 Fancy a blind date?

The middle one walks to the end of the road, leaving me alone on the pavement with two banjos, two guitars, an amp, a harmonium, a harmonium stand, a pile of clothes and a bag full of wires. I sit down on the amp and stare at the backs of my hands. Well, I think. That was that.

There are more jobs than people to fill them and record numbers of tourists, mainly from other parts of Asia, are bringing a glimmer of hope to depopulated regions. But there have been policy failures that highlight the perils of vowing to nudge Japan out of its deflationary, low-growth orbit. Abe\u2019s attempt to achieve 2% inflation came up short \u2013 the CPI rate is running at 0.5% \u2013 and questions persist over corporate governance in the wake of the allegations against the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn.

Abe\u2019s first two arrows are still in flight, with the government announcing a record budget this month that its architect hopes will buy his economic project time and win him support after a series of damaging political scandals. It includes 13.2tn yen ($121bn) in public spending on disaster reconstruction, infrastructure and scientific research designed to shield the economy from a possible slowdown caused by a US-Japan trade war and a post-2020 Olympic hangover. But critics say the third and most critical part of his programme, structural reform, looks more like a badly thrown dart than an arrow, despite grim warnings about the failure to address the effects on long-term growth of a super-ageing, declining population. Abe has encouraged more women to enter the workforce and relaxed immigration laws to allow a modest number of blue-collar workers to fill gaps in pressurised sectors of the economy. But much needed reform of the labour market, corporate governance and healthcare have been slow to materialise. \u201cMonetary easing and fiscal stimulus were supposed to make room for structural reform,\u201d says Koichi Nakano, a politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. \u201cBut structural reform hasn\u2019t happened.

God knows what will happen after the Olympics. \u201cAbe\u2019s economic policy gave him enough political capital to push through much of his rightwing agenda \u2013 like the state secrets law and security legislation \u2013 but the government can\u2019t continue to pump money into the economy, and the Bank of Japan can\u2019t continue to subsidise Japan, Inc. It is telling that he never achieved his inflation target. The fundamental weaknesses of the Japanese economy have never been properly addressed.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A former down-at-heel corner of east London, the borough of Newham, has witnessed the steepest rise in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">property prices</a> in the UK this century, according to data from Halifax, while the slowest increases have been in Newry in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The average house price in Newham has leapt by 429% since the start of the century, from \u00a375,762 in 2000 to \u00a3400,574, a gain of 429%. The borough encompasses Stratford, home to the 2012 Olympics, and is peppered with new glass and steel residential towers, as well as some of the most deprived wards in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started working here 18 years ago we were lucky to get \u00a3170,000 for a terraced house,\u201d said estate agent Ian Merchant, of Bairstow Eves in Stratford. \u201cWe thought they would never go through \u00a3200,000. Now they sell for \u00a3500,000.\u201d</p> <p>The 429% gain in Newham compares with the UK average 207% increase in house prices in the two decades to November 2019, according to figures prepared exclusively for the Guardian by Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. The second most rapid price growth was in Waltham Forest, a north-east London borough. Hackney, Barking and Dagenham and Redbridge, all boroughs in east or north-east London, all featured among the top 10 risers.</p> <p>Only one local authority outside of London \u2013 Brighton and Hove \u2013 was ranked in the top 10 for price growth this century.</p> <p>But the figures also reveal how far house prices have marched ahead of wage growth since the start of the millennium. While the average UK house price has tripled from \u00a391,199 to \u00a3279,998 over the past 20 years, wages have risen only by about 70%.</p> <p>There were no price rises of less than 100% anywhere in the UK over the two decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1nVdP2iniK6vwpDFQ1Z3JfnKtjDgpqxpuwN1zWNwUjLI\" data-alt=\"House price changes\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1nVdP2iniK6vwpDFQ1Z3JfnKtjDgpqxpuwN1zWNwUjLI\">House price changes</a> </figure>  <p>However, interest rates have tumbled since 2000, easing the pain for homebuyers, as well as underpinning high prices. In 2000, a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage for first-time buyers from Abbey (now Santander) carried an interest rate of 6.79%. Today, the bank\u2019s best deal is priced at 1.89%.</p> <p>The local authority with the lowest price growth has been Newry, Mourne and Down, in the south-east of Northern Ireland, where the average price rose from \u00a378,843 to \u00a3162,222.</p> <p>In late 1999, the typical home in that part of the Northern Ireland, dominated by the Mourne mountains in the south and Strangford Lough in the north, fetched a few thousand more than the average home in Newham. But today, while \u00a3250,000 will buy <a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/53358889?search_identifier=38f24a8440a992364975924362b5d4eb\">a four-bed, three-bathroom detached home </a><a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/53358889?search_identifier=38f24a8440a992364975924362b5d4eb\"> in </a><a href=\"https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/53358889?search_identifier=38f24a8440a992364975924362b5d4eb\">about a quarter of a hectare (0.5 acres) in Newry</a>, it\u2019s only enough for a <a href=\"https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-75945427.html\">one-bed ex-council flat in Stratford</a>.</p> <p>Four local authority areas in Northern Ireland appeared at the bottom of the table for price growth in the UK, with Newry joined by Derry, Antrim and Lisburn.</p> <p>The factors driving house prices in Northern Ireland are markedly different from the rest of the UK. In the early part of the century, the peace dividend spurred price rises, followed by the extraordinary Celtic Tiger property boom in the Republic that reverberated across the border into Newry, before spectacularly crashing. More recently, Brexit and its impact on the border with Ireland has dominated the property market.</p> <p>\u201cHouse prices have always been on the low side here,\u201d said Charlie Casey, Sinn F\u00e9in councillor and chairperson on the Newry, Mourne and Down council. But with the market soaring again in the Dublin area, some people are taking advantage of low prices around Newry. \u201cWe\u2019re roughly halfway between Dublin and Belfast and we\u2019re finding now that some people are buying here and commuting every day on the train down to Dublin.</p> <p>\u201cA hard border would have been an absolute disaster,\u201d Casey added. \u201cA Brexit border down the Irish sea at least leaves the island of Ireland as more of a single economic entity. Let\u2019s see how that works out.\u201d</p> <p>In Newham, the Olympics sparked a construction boom in the area, which has transformed the skyline. \u201cI remember very well the day they announced the Olympics were coming to London,\u201d says Merchant. \u201cWe had a three-bedder on at \u00a3200,000. The day after the announcement, we had an offer of \u00a3250,000 on it.\u201d</p> <p>House price rises in the area cooled markedly after 2015, said Merchant, with many properties still 10% below their peak, partly because tax on buy-to-let homes has removed many investment buyers. \u201cFive years ago, about 70% of buyers were buy-to-let. Now, most landlords are selling up or sticking with what they have because of the changes in tax.\u201d</p> <p>But a cooling market is little comfort for Newham council, which says housing stress in the borough is intense.

      "bodyText": "A former down-at-heel corner of east London, the borough of Newham, has witnessed the steepest rise in property prices in the UK this century, according to data from Halifax, while the slowest increases have been in Newry in Northern Ireland. The average house price in Newham has leapt by 429% since the start of the century, from \u00a375,762 in 2000 to \u00a3400,574, a gain of 429%. The borough encompasses Stratford, home to the 2012 Olympics, and is peppered with new glass and steel residential towers, as well as some of the most deprived wards in the UK. \u201cWhen I started working here 18 years ago we were lucky to get \u00a3170,000 for a terraced house,\u201d said estate agent Ian Merchant, of Bairstow Eves in Stratford. \u201cWe thought they would never go through \u00a3200,000. Now they sell for \u00a3500,000.\u201d The 429% gain in Newham compares with the UK average 207% increase in house prices in the two decades to November 2019, according to figures prepared exclusively for the Guardian by Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. The second most rapid price growth was in Waltham Forest, a north-east London borough. Hackney, Barking and Dagenham and Redbridge, all boroughs in east or north-east London, all featured among the top 10 risers. Only one local authority outside of London \u2013 Brighton and Hove \u2013 was ranked in the top 10 for price growth this century. But the figures also reveal how far house prices have marched ahead of wage growth since the start of the millennium. While the average UK house price has tripled from \u00a391,199 to \u00a3279,998 over the past 20 years, wages have risen only by about 70%. There were no price rises of less than 100% anywhere in the UK over the two decades. However, interest rates have tumbled since 2000, easing the pain for homebuyers, as well as underpinning high prices. In 2000, a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage for first-time buyers from Abbey (now Santander) carried an interest rate of 6.79%. Today, the bank\u2019s best deal is priced at 1.89%. The local authority with the lowest price growth has been Newry, Mourne and Down, in the south-east of Northern Ireland, where the average price rose from \u00a378,843 to \u00a3162,222. In late 1999, the typical home in that part of the Northern Ireland, dominated by the Mourne mountains in the south and Strangford Lough in the north, fetched a few thousand more than the average home in Newham. But today, while \u00a3250,000 will buy a four-bed, three-bathroom detached home in about a quarter of a hectare (0.5 acres) in Newry, it\u2019s only enough for a one-bed ex-council flat in Stratford. Four local authority areas in Northern Ireland appeared at the bottom of the table for price growth in the UK, with Newry joined by Derry, Antrim and Lisburn. The factors driving house prices in Northern Ireland are markedly different from the rest of the UK. In the early part of the century, the peace dividend spurred price rises, followed by the extraordinary Celtic Tiger property boom in the Republic that reverberated across the border into Newry, before spectacularly crashing. More recently, Brexit and its impact on the border with Ireland has dominated the property market. \u201cHouse prices have always been on the low side here,\u201d said Charlie Casey, Sinn F\u00e9in councillor and chairperson on the Newry, Mourne and Down council. But with the market soaring again in the Dublin area, some people are taking advantage of low prices around Newry. \u201cWe\u2019re roughly halfway between Dublin and Belfast and we\u2019re finding now that some people are buying here and commuting every day on the train down to Dublin. \u201cA hard border would have been an absolute disaster,\u201d Casey added. \u201cA Brexit border down the Irish sea at least leaves the island of Ireland as more of a single economic entity. Let\u2019s see how that works out.\u201d In Newham, the Olympics sparked a construction boom in the area, which has transformed the skyline. \u201cI remember very well the day they announced the Olympics were coming to London,\u201d says Merchant. \u201cWe had a three-bedder on at \u00a3200,000. The day after the announcement, we had an offer of \u00a3250,000 on it.\u201d House price rises in the area cooled markedly after 2015, said Merchant, with many properties still 10% below their peak, partly because tax on buy-to-let homes has removed many investment buyers. \u201cFive years ago, about 70% of buyers were buy-to-let. Now, most landlords are selling up or sticking with what they have because of the changes in tax.\u201d But a cooling market is little comfort for Newham council, which says housing stress in the borough is intense. The borough\u2019s population has risen more rapidly than almost anywhere else in the UK, jumping from 243,891 in the 2001 census to an estimated 352,005 in 2018, an increase of 44%. Newham\u2019s mayor, Rokhsana Fiaz, wrote to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, this week following the Conservative election victory. \u201cOf all London boroughs, Newham spends the most on temporary accommodation, a figure of some \u00a361.1m in 2017-18. We have a housing waiting list of over 27,000, and high levels of homelessness in our borough. Truly, the sharp edge of the housing crisis is felt by Newham residents,\u201d she said. Fiaz is deeply concerned that in the days before the election, the government quietly raised the interest rate for council borrowing by one percentage point, making it more difficult for Newham to finance new council houses. Meanwhile, looking back over the past year, the fastest-rising prices have not been in London but in the north-east and north-west of England. In Billingham, Co Durham, average house prices grew by the most, from \u00a3192,717 in October 2018 to \u00a3216,328 in the same month in 2019, a rise of 12.3%. House prices in the town, birthplace of the Billy Elliot actor Jamie Bell, are around eight times that of the average salary (\u00a326,471). At the opposite end of the table are many locations around London and the south-east where prices have fallen. In Harrow, north London, prices declined by 3.6% in the year to October 2019, said Halifax. One area of London manages to appear in both the top 10 over 20 years and the bottom 10 over one year. Prices in Bexleyheath fell by 0.1% over the last 12 months, said Halifax but the Bexley local authority area recorded a gain of 311% over 20 years.",

      "bodyText": "Governments should be judged not just on what they do with their time in office but also on what they don\u2019t do. There are only so many hours in a day, and so many parliamentary sitting weeks in a year (there were just 10 since the May election). Nevertheless it\u2019s important to know not just what the top priorities are but also what\u2019s been pushed to the backburner. In 2019 the re-elected Morrison government prioritised income tax cuts, which passed parliament in the first week of July, the repeal of medical evacuation provisions for people in offshore detention, which passed in the last week of parliament, and drought relief. But what were the reforms that were promised or proposed which have dropped off the political radar, stalled, or the government is accused of doing too little too late? LGBT students in religious schools What was promised: Discrimination law amendments so that no student at a private or religious school can be expelled on the basis of their sexuality. When it was announced: On 13 October 2018 \u2013 one week out from the Wentworth byelection \u2013 Scott Morrison suggested parliament could deal with the issue in the next fortnight after Labor started a push to change the laws. Why it is late: The reform stalled when the Coalition refused to agree to Labor and the Greens\u2019 plan to protect LGBT students from discrimination unless the current legal exemptions were replaced by other protections for religious freedom. Where is it up to: The Morrison government referred the question to the Australian Law Reform Commission in December 2018 while announcing its response to the Ruddock review of religious freedom. Payday lending What was promised: To lower the cap on small amount credit contracts and introduce a new cap on total payments on a consumer lease. When was it announced: In November 2016, the then revenue and financial services minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, committed the government to the reforms. Where is it up to: The government released legislation for consultation but never introduced it to parliament despite Malcolm Turnbull promising in August 2018 it would progress within a year. In February, Labor introduced a private member\u2019s bill mirroring the Coalition\u2019s proposal. Why is it late? The delay occurred after a backlash from the Nationals MP George Christensen and other backbenchers. The assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, said the government was trying to get \u201cthe right balance\u201d between consumer protection and the \u201cimportant role\u201d of small amount credit contracts in the economy. \u201cThe government will progress the reforms further early in the new year.\u201d Federal integrity commission What was proposed: Labor, the Greens and the crossbench \u2013 prompted by public incredulity there wasn\u2019t one already \u2013 called for a federal anti-corruption body \u201cwith teeth\u201d. What was promised: The Coalition was dragged to the promise and it showed \u2013 the integrity commission it put forward wouldn\u2019t have the power to make corruption findings against MPs, or their staff, and investigations in the proposed public-sector division would remain secret until the end of any resulting court case. When was it announced: In December 2018. And then again in August, and then again in November. An exposure draft was promised by the end of the year and still hasn\u2019t popped up \u2013 certainly not in time for parliament to do anything about it. Where is it up to: The attorney general\u2019s office promises it is coming. But even if it does come out in the next week, it is likely to get little notice in a textbook case of taking out the trash in the quiet Christmas/new year period. Why is it late? Because everyone, including members of the government, like Queensland backbencher Llew O\u2019Brien, hate it. Aged care What was proposed: In an interim report in November the aged care royal commission called for more home care packages to reduce the waiting list of 120,000. What was promised: Later in November the government promised an extra $496.3m for 10,000 home care packages. Where is it up to: The royal commission is due to report by 12 November 2020 but there might be more for aged care in the 2020 budget before then. Why is it late: The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, has said home care packages have grown from 60,000 to 150,000 since the Coalition was elected but it doesn\u2019t want to \u201ccreated a circumstance for shonky providers to come into the market\u201d by ramping up the program too quickly, as occurred with Labor\u2019s home insulation scheme and vocational education loans. Banking royal commission What was promised: By the end of the year more than one-third of commitments arising out of banking royal commission recommendations will be implemented or before parliament; with 90% implemented or introduced by mid-2020 and all commitments at least introduced by the end of 2020. When was it announced: The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, unveiled the roadmap on 19 August 2019. Where is it up to: In early December, Labor\u2019s shadow assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, accused the government of implementing just six of 76 recommendations of the royal commission. Some commitments are already behind \u2013 the Coalition promised to introduce legislation to remove claims handling exemptions for insurance by the end of 2019 but it hasn\u2019t been seen. Labor is also concerned that even on its own timetable the Coalition will not take action on hawking or compensation schemes until 2020. Why is it late: This is a substantial part of the government\u2019s agenda and just takes time (says the Coalition); or the government was just never that committed to fixing the sector to begin with (says Labor). Beneficial ownership register What was promised: A register publicly listing the identities of people and entities which own shell companies and benefit from trusts to increase transparency and crack down on multi-national tax avoidance. When was it announced: April 2016, when the then financial services minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, said the government wanted to help meet its G20 transparency commitments, and then again in December 2017, when Stuart Robert told Guardian Australia the government remained committed to the promise. Where is it up to: In February, Treasury said there was never any commitment to introduce the register. No legislation has been forthcoming. In December this year, in response to questions in Senate estimates, the government recommitted to the spirit of the original promise \u2013 \u201cimproving the transparency of information around beneficial ownership and control of companies\u201d. Why is it late? That too remains unclear, although Sukkar told Guardian Australia the government wants to avoid placing an \u201cunnecessary regulation\u201d burden on business. Money laundering and terrorist finance laws What was proposed: Broadening anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws to take in real estate agents, lawyers and gem dealers. When it was announced: The move, known as \u201cphase 2\u201d in AML CTF jargon, was recommended in a review by the attorney general\u2019s department that began in 2013 and finished in 2016. In November 2017 the government committed to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Where is it up to: After consultation closed in January 2017, nothing has happened since. A spokeswoman for the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the Morrison government was \u201ccommitted to continually improving\u201d the laws but \u201cany potential future reforms will be reviewed in a careful and considered way\u201d. Why is it late: Not clear, although the changes are bitterly opposed by lawyers, who say it interferes with their ethical responsibilities towards clients. Director identification numbers What was promised: A unique identifier for company directors to help combat the scourge of phoenixing, a business practice in which directors wind up companies to avoid paying workers\u2019 entitlements and other debts. When it was announced: The government announced it would consider the measure in August 2017 and opened consultation for a bill to implement it in October 2018. Why it is late: The bill lapsed at the 2019 election. Where is it up to: Sukkar reintroduced the bill on 4 December, 2019 \u2013 the second last day of the parliamentary sitting year. In the mid-year economic and fiscal update the government allocated $60.6m to modernise the Australian Business Register and introduce the director identification number. Charities donation reforms What was proposed: Nationally consistent regulations for not-for-profit and charitable fundraising activities. When it was proposed: In February 2019, the Senate select committee on charity fundraising in the 21st century \u2013 including two Liberal senators \u2013 recommended the reform be delivered within the next two years. Where is it up to: On 2 December the assistant minister for charities, Zed Seselja, told the Senate the government is \u201cstill considering and consulting with stakeholders on the report\u2019s recommendations\u201d and is \u201cnot in a position\u201d to table a response. Seselja also said the government is \u201cfinalising its response\u201d to a separate Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission legislation review that dealt with fundraising.",

A rat \u2013 not a \u201cqueer sardonic\u201d one, as in Isaac Rosenberg\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/nov/10/in-the-trenches-isaac-rosenberg\">Break of Day in the Trenches</a>, or even a Tory politician, but an inquisitive, engaging little creature \u2013 scuttled across the path in front of me.

Standing in the black ooze of a lake inlet, a grey heron, with the slightest inclination of its head, logged its progress. As the rat slipped down the bank into the water, a spindly leg stepped forward, a spear-like bill hurled down. The rat was brandished briefly aloft before slipping into the heron\u2019s gullet. I watched in horrified fascination as a lump travelled slowly down the plumed elegance of the bird\u2019s neck. A final shake, a harsh and long, drawn-out \u201ckraark\u201d, and the heron was spreading its huge wings and trailing its legs across the lake surface, sending ripples that gently rocked the Canada geese and Slavonian grebes roosting on the water.</p> <p>Majestic and slow, it heeled round towards who knows what treetop refuge miles away. Neck tucked back between its shoulders, a bulge showed there against street-lights of the park\u2019s perimeter as it glided away into \u201cthe same old druid Time as ever\u201d.</p>",

Better still is Sefton Park, across the Mersey in Liverpool. I walked through it one recent cold evening, on my way to a rendezvous in Lark Lane. A rat \u2013 not a \u201cqueer sardonic\u201d one, as in Isaac Rosenberg\u2019s Break of Day in the Trenches, or even a Tory politician, but an inquisitive, engaging little creature \u2013 scuttled across the path in front of me. It arrived at the railings around the lake, stood on hind legs with vibrissae twitching, and studied me for a few moments before ducking under the fence. In doing so, it sealed its doom. Standing in the black ooze of a lake inlet, a grey heron, with the slightest inclination of its head, logged its progress. As the rat slipped down the bank into the water, a spindly leg stepped forward, a spear-like bill hurled down. The rat was brandished briefly aloft before slipping into the heron\u2019s gullet. I watched in horrified fascination as a lump travelled slowly down the plumed elegance of the bird\u2019s neck. A final shake, a harsh and long, drawn-out \u201ckraark\u201d, and the heron was spreading its huge wings and trailing its legs across the lake surface, sending ripples that gently rocked the Canada geese and Slavonian grebes roosting on the water. Majestic and slow, it heeled round towards who knows what treetop refuge miles away. Neck tucked back between its shoulders, a bulge showed there against street-lights of the park\u2019s perimeter as it glided away into \u201cthe same old druid Time as ever\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "New South Wales firefighters are gearing up for hotter, drier and windier conditions next week, after a Christmas reprieve. Meanwhile the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has repeated his calls for the federal government to compensate the thousands of volunteer firefighters who have been battling the fires for months, after a Coalition minister questioned the sustainability of the volunteer model. On Saturday morning there were more than 70 fires burning across the state, with eight out of control and about 23 being controlled, as the unprecedented bushfire crisis continued. Saturday began with no fires above advice level after more than 1,500 firefighters in the field took advantage of milder conditions over the Christmas week to strengthen containment lines and prepare for a forthcoming heatwave and high fire danger. However, on Saturday afternoon the Currowan fire on the south coast was upgraded to a watch and act, with a significant increase of fire activity to the west of Nelligen. The Green Wattle Creek fire in the southern highlands is also among those still out of control, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS), but the Gospers Mountain \u201cmegafire\u201d and the nearby Grose Valley fire, to the north-west and west of Sydney, are listed as being controlled. At least three fires remain burning in South Australia at advice level, including two on Kangaroo Island, at Bunbury, and at Cudlee Creek where there have been flare-ups in recent days. In Western Australia, a watch and act warning remained in place for a fire in Gnowangerup, which started in the Stirling Range national park. In Victoria, residents in parts of the East Gippsland region were urged to evacuate on Saturday afternoon ahead of a bushfire that threatened to hit Goongerah and nearby Martins Creek within the next 48 hours. The CFA has declared a district fire ban for the Mallee fire for Sunday, and for the entire state on Monday. The Blue Mountains city council mayor, Mark Greenhill, said this year\u2019s extended bushfire season meant locals were living with immense stress. The area continues to be affected by the Ruined Castle and Grose Valley fires, which spread from the Gospers Mountain mega-blaze to the north. The Green Wattle Creek fire to the south may also pose a threat in the future, Greenhill said, adding the community was \u201cfar from out of the woods\u201d. \u201cFor the whole community this is a very stressful, long endurance episode for them; it just goes on and on,\u201d he said on Friday. The NSW emergency services minister, David Elliott, meanwhile, has gone on a family holiday overseas but says he will continue to receive twice-daily RFS updates. \u201cIf the bushfire situation should demand it, I will return home without hesitation,\u201d Elliott said. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, faced widespread criticism after going on a family holiday to Hawaii in the midst of the bushfire crisis without publicly announcing it, and with his office reportedly telling journalists he was not in Hawaii. Morrison returned early last week, apologising for going away. He continued to face criticism for his government\u2019s failure to develop a credible climate change policy. He was also earlier criticised for saying volunteer firefighters \u201cwant to be there\u201d, when asked by Guardian Australia if they should be compensated. On Tuesday, Morrison announced government employees would all receive standardised paid leave if they were volunteer firefighters but the opposition leader said it did not go far enough. On Saturday, Albanese said it been more than a month since he wrote to Morrison about doing more to address the fires. \u201cNo firefighter should have to choose between continuing to serve their community with courage and distinction and being able to provide the essentials of life,\u201d he said. Albanese said there was precedent for providing financial relief to volunteer firefighters and noted a government minister had now questioned the sustainability of relying on volunteers. The veterans\u2019 affairs minister, Darren Chester, told the ABC on Friday there had to be a conversation about compensation. \u201cCan it be sustainable in the longer term when it\u2019s actually required under these changed climatic conditions, to be out there in the field for days, weeks and months?\u201d Chester said. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time away from your family.\u201d At least nine people, including two firefighters, have been killed in fires this season \u2013 eight of them in NSW. Almost 1,000 homes are estimated to have been destroyed in the NSW bushfire crisis, according to the most recent impact assessment from the RFS, published on Christmas Eve. Another 68 facilities and 2,048 \u201coutbuildings\u201d were also confirmed destroyed. More than 7,800 homes have been saved by firefighters. Canberra has added the Wingecarribee local government area, which covers NSW\u2019s southern highlands, to the areas eligible for Australian government disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child, as well as recovery allowances for people who lost income because of the fires. Grants of up to $10,000 are also being made available to people who have had their uninsured homes damaged or destroyed by the recent South Australian bushfires, and who need to replace or repair their homes or replace essential household items. Total fire bans were in place for the southern ranges, southern slopes and Monaro alpine areas in NSW, and the ACT, where hot and windy conditions were bringing elevated fire danger. The RFS urged people to prepare their homes, including raking leaves, moving firewood stocks away from the house, and patching up gaps in tiles and other places where embers could catch. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a strong wind warning for the Macquarie coast, Hunter coast, Sydney coast, Illawarra coast, Batemans coast and Eden coast on Saturday, and the Macquarie coast, Hunter coast and Sydney coast on Sunday. Temperatures were forecast to be above or well above average across the state for the rest of the year. \u201cA near-stationary high pressure system over the Tasman Sea extends a ridge towards the northern New South Wales coast, while a trough of low pressure extends across south-western parts of the state,\u201d the bureau said on Saturday. \u201cThis pattern will allow increasingly hot air to be drawn down from central Australia during the next few days, with heatwave conditions returning in many areas.\u201d Saturday was expected to see highs of around 29C in Sydney but nearing 40 in the western and north-western suburbs. High 30s to low 40s were predicted for multiple regions of NSW, with the coolest temperatures in the northern rivers region where most places would hover around the high 20s. Temperatures will peak on New Year\u2019s Eve, with 44C in Richmond, 35C in Sydney and 33C in Wollongong before a possible late storm. In South Australia, Adelaide was in the grips of its second heatwave in as many weeks with forecasters tipping more to come this summer. After four days with temperatures above 40C last week, the city was expected to have the second of four similar days on Saturday. Police have charged a 71-year-old man for allegedly lighting a fire without a permit north-west of Moruya on the NSW south coast, causing a 40-hectare bushfire in the Wandera state forest, and charged another man for allegedly lighting two bushfires near Cessnock in the Hunter.",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has retweeted material that publicly names the purported whistleblower whose complaint about the US president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine led to his impeachment.</p> <p>The president on Friday night sent a retweet from one of his supporters containing the alleged name of the individual. Trump drew the attention of his 68 million Twitter followers to the post which, along with publicising the name, inaccurately claimed that the whistleblower \u201ccommitted perjury by making false statements\u201d and is being protected by Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee. There is no evidence to support these assertions.<br><br>Earlier, on Thursday, Trump had also retweeted a post by his re-election campaign\u2019s \u201cwar room\u201d that linked to an article by the conservative Washington Examiner news website. The article, published on 3 December, has the name of the alleged whistleblower in its headline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/27/eddie-gallagher-trump-navy-seal-iraq\">Navy Seal pardoned of war crimes by Trump described by colleagues as 'freaking evil'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s retweet quickly drew sharp criticism. Amy Siskind, president of <a href=\"https://thenewagenda.net/\">the New Agenda</a>, a nonpartisan advocacy organisation, posted on Friday: \u201cThis is not acceptable behavior from the so-called leader of our country, and he must be called to task for it!\u201d</p> <p>The whistleblower is reportedly a CIA analyst . They filed an anonymous complaint in August alleging Trump pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to announce an investigation into a political rival \u2013 a violation of laws against seeking foreign help in US elections.</p> <p>The nine-page memo was based on secondary sources, but the whistleblower\u2019s colleagues in the intelligence and diplomatic communities corroborated and fleshed out the account in closed-door and public hearings. This culminated in last week\u2019s House of Representatives vote to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, setting the stage for a Senate trial in the coming weeks.</p> <p>With so much evidence on the record, Democrats have largely moved on from the whistleblower, who has become something of a rightwing obsession. Their alleged name and photograph have been circulating in conservative media for months. Despite whistleblower protection laws, they have to be driven to work by security detail to protect their safety.</p> <p>The president was following in the footsteps of his own son, Donald Trump Jr, who last month tweeted an article that contained the name and was then grilled about it on the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-jr-talks-triggered-impeachment-inquiry/story?id=66771386\">TV talk show The View.</a> Trump Jr claimed he was a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d sharing information on social media. The show\u2019s hosts argued this was disingenuous considering that he is the president\u2019s son.</p> <p>Yet for all his sense of raw grievance and righteous indignation over impeachment, Trump himself had been showing uncharacteristic restraint. Last month the Guardian asked him if he was thinking about tweeting out the name of the whistleblower.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-74/\">The president replied</a>: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what. There have been stories written about a certain individual \u2013 a male \u2013 and they say he\u2019s the whistleblower.\u201d</p> <p>Trump went on to claim, without evidence, that the whistleblower is linked to John Brennan, the former director of the CIA, and Susan Rice, the ex-national security adviser. \u201cIf he\u2019s the whistleblower, he has no credibility because he\u2019s a Brennan guy, he\u2019s a Susan Rice guy, he\u2019s an Obama guy, and he hates Trump, and he\u2019s a radical.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has retweeted material that publicly names the purported whistleblower whose complaint about the US president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine led to his impeachment. The president on Friday night sent a retweet from one of his supporters containing the alleged name of the individual. Trump drew the attention of his 68 million Twitter followers to the post which, along with publicising the name, inaccurately claimed that the whistleblower \u201ccommitted perjury by making false statements\u201d and is being protected by Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee. There is no evidence to support these assertions. Earlier, on Thursday, Trump had also retweeted a post by his re-election campaign\u2019s \u201cwar room\u201d that linked to an article by the conservative Washington Examiner news website. The article, published on 3 December, has the name of the alleged whistleblower in its headline. Trump\u2019s retweet quickly drew sharp criticism. Amy Siskind, president of the New Agenda, a nonpartisan advocacy organisation, posted on Friday: \u201cThis is not acceptable behavior from the so-called leader of our country, and he must be called to task for it!\u201d The whistleblower is reportedly a CIA analyst . They filed an anonymous complaint in August alleging Trump pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to announce an investigation into a political rival \u2013 a violation of laws against seeking foreign help in US elections. The nine-page memo was based on secondary sources, but the whistleblower\u2019s colleagues in the intelligence and diplomatic communities corroborated and fleshed out the account in closed-door and public hearings. This culminated in last week\u2019s House of Representatives vote to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, setting the stage for a Senate trial in the coming weeks. With so much evidence on the record, Democrats have largely moved on from the whistleblower, who has become something of a rightwing obsession. Their alleged name and photograph have been circulating in conservative media for months. Despite whistleblower protection laws, they have to be driven to work by security detail to protect their safety. The president was following in the footsteps of his own son, Donald Trump Jr, who last month tweeted an article that contained the name and was then grilled about it on the TV talk show The View. Trump Jr claimed he was a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d sharing information on social media. The show\u2019s hosts argued this was disingenuous considering that he is the president\u2019s son. Yet for all his sense of raw grievance and righteous indignation over impeachment, Trump himself had been showing uncharacteristic restraint. Last month the Guardian asked him if he was thinking about tweeting out the name of the whistleblower. The president replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what. There have been stories written about a certain individual \u2013 a male \u2013 and they say he\u2019s the whistleblower.\u201d Trump went on to claim, without evidence, that the whistleblower is linked to John Brennan, the former director of the CIA, and Susan Rice, the ex-national security adviser. \u201cIf he\u2019s the whistleblower, he has no credibility because he\u2019s a Brennan guy, he\u2019s a Susan Rice guy, he\u2019s an Obama guy, and he hates Trump, and he\u2019s a radical. Now, maybe it\u2019s not him. But if it\u2019s him, you guys ought to release the information.\u201d Trump has made several more appeals for the media to out the whistleblower, amplified by Republican allies in Congress, who allege the person is a Democrat pursuing a vendetta. At a Trump rally in Kentucky, the US senator Rand Paul urged reporters: \u201cDo your job and print his name!\u201d Trump applauded. Trump himself has never come closer to doing it himself than Thursday\u2019s retweet. The Daily Beast reported: \u201cSeveral people close to the president, such as Ivanka Trump and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, had privately cautioned him against saying or posting the name in public, arguing it would be counterproductive and unnecessary.\u201d Legal experts disagree on whether identifying a whistleblower is a crime. Some argue the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 forbids retaliation against an employee for blowing the whistle on perceived wrongdoing but does not prevent a president or member of Congress from identifying a whistleblower. But Robert Litt, former general counsel for the office of the director of national intelligence, told National Public Radio last month: \u201cAnybody who is thinking about outing the whistleblower has to take into account the possibility that if something happens to the whistleblower, there would be some civil liability for causing that to happen.

      "bodyText": "In early December, China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs jumped the Great Fire Wall used by Beijing to block access to many foreign websites, and joined Twitter to communicate directly with the outside world. Its tweets so far have ranged from calling the US a \u201cSUPER LIAR\u201d and upbraiding foreign journalists, to lauding China\u2019s victories: \u201cChina\u2019s vast land of 9.6 million km\u00b2 is free from war, fear, refugees and displacement. People of 56 ethnic groups live happy life, BEST human rights achievement!\u201d China\u2019s new, defensive, somewhat Trumpian, social media strategy betrays Beijing\u2019s anxiety over the country\u2019s image as it enters 2020. \u201c2019 has been a very, very bad year for China\u2019s international reputation across a whole range of fronts \u2013 Hong Kong, Xinjiang, foreign interference, espionage, technology, strategic competition,\u201d said Adam Ni, co-editor of China Neican, a a newsletter on Chinese policy. China under the leadership of Xi Jinping will enter 2020 on the back foot, after a year of converging crises. More than seven months of protests on its doorstep in Hong Kong have captured global attention and mobilised citizens to push back against Beijing\u2019s influence over the city. A year-and-a-half-long trade war with the US has escalated into near full-on rivalry with Washington. Meanwhile, China\u2019s ties with Canada, Australia, and the UK have all come under strain in the past year as concerns about Beijing as a national security threat grow. More recently, two major leaks of classified government documents detailing China\u2019s programme of mass detention of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang have emboldened critics, witnesses and other countries to speak out, and raised questions about possible dissent within government ranks. At home, the government faces a slowing Chinese economy, which is growing at its most sluggish pace in 30 years, raising fears about unemployment. Chinese residents have been hit by rising consumer prices, highlighted by the fact that the cost of pork, the country\u2019s staple meat, has skyrocketed, prompting the government to release strategic pork reserves. A recent high-level economic planning meeting, attended by Xi and other top officials, named \u201cstability\u201d as one of the key priorities for the government next year. \u201cWe are at a critical period,\u201d an official summary of the conference said, acknowledging \u201cdownward economic pressure\u201d and \u201cintertwined structural, institutional and cyclical problems\u201d. It said: \u201cWe need to be well prepared with contingency plans.\u201d But rather than weakening the ruling Chinese Communist party\u2019s hold, observers say chaos gives it pretext to exert yet more control. \u201cThe party draws a lot of strength from weakness. It\u2019s able to justify crackdowns, party loyalty campaigns,\u201d said Samantha Hoffman, who researches Chinese security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The government has in the last few months released new guidelines for patriotic education, the training of party members, morality guidelines for citizens, and new restrictions on content. Secondary and primary schools have been ordered to cull their libraries of \u201cillegal\u201d or \u201cimproper\u201d books \u2013 leading to one incident of a book burning at a county library. External pressures also give Beijing the ability to deflect. The Chinese economy was facing headwinds before the trade war, yet officials can now blame some of those problems on Washington. \u201cSimilarly, even though the Hong Kong protests are fuelled by local concerns, the official media on the mainland has been working overtime to make them seem the result of foreign influence, which plays into the CCP narrative that the west is determined to do what it can to interfere with China\u2019s rise,\u201d said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, who teaches Chinese history at the University of California at Irvine. \u201cThere is a lot of nationalist sentiment that plays into the CCP\u2019s [Chinese communist party] hands, which is actually partly strengthened by the problems Xi Jinping and company face,\u201d he said. Some of the pressure China faces in this next year is also self-inflicted. Xi has staked out \u201cthree tough battles\u201d that his party must win by the end of next year in order to be on track to achieve an even larger goal, the \u201cgreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d by 2049, the 100-year anniversary of the country\u2019s founding. Xi has set 2021, which is also the centenary of the founding of the Chinese communist party, as the deadline for his government to have created a \u201cmoderately prosperous society\u201d. \u201cLooking ahead to that, I\u2019m sure CCP leaders would prefer both their country and their party to be in a much stronger position.

Observers say the strategy is unlikely to be that effective. \u201cThe CCP has traditionally been completely incapable of handling criticism.

Another discovery was the Elizabethan playhouse where Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet was premiered, built in 1576-7 and known as the Theatre, the earliest known example of a polygonal playhouse in London. Between 2014 and 2015 the shipwreck of the London, which blew up in 1655 off Southend-on-Sea, was excavated and an array of items were found, from musket balls to leather shoes. A rare and well-preserved wooden gun carriage was also brought to the surface. More unusual findings in the last decade include Britain\u2019s earliest rabbit, which was found in Sussex. A fragment of a rabbit bone was identified, believed to be from the 1st century AD, at Fishbourne Roman Palace. Rabbits are native to Spain and France and it had been thought that they were a medieval introduction to Britain, but the new discovery showed they arrived 1,000 years earlier. In Norfolk in 2016 archeologists uncovered an Anglo-Saxon burial site containing more than 80 rare wooden coffins that were preserved in the wet ground at Great Ryburgh. A major Roman settlement was discovered in Yorkshire in 2017, which predated settlements in York and Carlisle by 10 years. It made historians realise that the Romans probably expanded their occupation into northern England earlier than previously thought. A range of personal objects were found, from shoes and keys to a snake-shaped silver ring. In the last decade, there have been many advances in research methods used to understand past civilisations, according to Historic England. These include improvements in the accuracy of radiocarbon dating. It is now easier to narrow down dates of sites from centuries to decades. Historic England said these changes mean that Neolithic sites, which they had previously dated at between 4000 BC and 3500 BC, can now be narrowed to a span of 25 years.",
