      "bodyText": "The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has said he \u201ccan\u2019t explain\u201d Scott Morrison\u2019s behaviour during Australia\u2019s unprecedented bushfire crisis and that his successor had \u201cdownplayed\u201d the catastrophe and had not behaved the way a prime minister should. Turnbull made the extraordinary criticism of Morrison during an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, in which he also blamed News Corp and rightwing thinktanks in Australia for promoting climate change denialism. He \u201ccould not explain\u201d why Morrison had refused to meet former fire chiefs \u2013 who early last year attempted to warn him of the risks posed by the coming fire season \u2013 and then decided to holiday in Hawaii in the midst of the crisis in December. \u201cEverybody knew we were in a very dry time and as a consequence the fire season was likely to be very bad,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cSo rather than doing what a leader should do and preparing people for that, he downplayed it \u2013 and then of course chose to go away on holiday in Hawaii at the peak of the crisis. \u201cI can\u2019t explain any of that. It\u2019s not consistent with the way in which a prime minister would and should act.\u201d Morrison cut short his family holiday to Hawaii after two volunteer firefighters in New South Wales died. He came home two days early and apologised, saying he \u201cdeeply regretted\u201d any offence caused. But he was then heckled on a visit to the fire-ravaged town of Cobargo in NSW, where three people died, and mistakenly said that nobody had died on South Australia\u2019s Kangaroo Island, where two people had died. \u201cI do not know why Scott Morrison has acted the way he has,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for 20 years, at least. I can\u2019t explain his conduct.\u201d Morrison\u2019s personal approval rating and rating as preferred prime minister fell in the first polls after the bushfire season began. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why he didn\u2019t meet the former fire commissioners who wanted to see him in March last year to talk about the gravity of the threat,\u201d Turnbull said. In November the former fire chiefs said Morrison had turned down a meeting with them because his government \u201cfundamentally doesn\u2019t like talking about climate change\u201d. Turnbull also criticised the role of rightwing politics in Australia and the Murdoch press in promoting climate denialism. \u201cIf you go to any of the rightwing thinktanks or read the Murdoch press it is just full of climate denialism,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is designed to deflect from the real objective which has to be to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cTo be a climate change denier is a badge of honour on the right wing of politics here and in the US, and it is mad.\u201d Turnbull said Australia was \u201cin the frontline of the consequences\u201d and needed to act on the climate crisis to show the world that it was important. \u201cHow many more coral reefs have to be bleached, how many more million hectares of forest have to be burned?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow many more lives and homes have to be lost before the climate change deniers acknowledge they are wrong? \u201cIf a country like Australia is not prepared to grapple with this issue seriously, itself being in the frontline of the consequences and being an advanced, prosperous, technologically sophisticated country, with the means to do so, then why would other countries take the issue as seriously as they should?\u201d On Tuesday Morrison said reducing fuel loads with hazard reduction burns was at least as important as reducing carbon emissions to prevent future bushfire disasters. \u201cHazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has an even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season,\u201d he told the Australian. In November former heads of the NSW, Queensland, Victorian and Tasmanian fire services said they were not allowed \u201cto utter the words \u2018climate change\u2019\u201d even though it contributed to longer, more intense bushfires. \u201cBushfires are a symptom of climate change,\u201d said Neil Bibby, the former chief executive of Victoria\u2019s Country Fire Authority. \u201cFirefighters are the immune system that gets rid of that symptom. But [the problem is] still there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The message, it seems, could not have been clearer. On 8 November 2018, just one month after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man, received an unsolicited text from Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s WhatsApp account. According to the UN, the message from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia contained a single photograph that bore a striking similarity to the woman with whom the married billionaire was having a secret affair. It also contained what appeared to be a sardonic message. It read: \u201cArguing with a woman is like reading the Software Licence Agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree.\u201d For Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur who is investigating the murder of Khashoggi, it seemed the message was evidence of an attempt by the future king, also known as MBS, to \u201cintimidate\u201d Bezos. She told the Guardian it appeared intended to make him feel vulnerable, even as his own newspaper, the Washington Post, continued to publish hard-hitting stories about the murder of one of its own journalists. The new UN revelations, which follow the Guardian\u2019s report that Bezos\u2019s phone was allegedly hacked by Saudi Arabia in the months before the Khashoggi killing, point to an orchestrated cyber campaign to target Bezos, and the close circle of individuals around Khashoggi. Callamard said: \u201cThis shows that during this period, there is a concerted effort to hack into the system of people who are considered as a threat somehow to MBS or to the government system of Saudi Arabia. That does not mean it is aimed at picking up particular information. It is done to use that information in the future.\u201d According to a timeline provided by the UN, the story began on 21 March 2018, when Bezos was invited to a small dinner party in honour of the crown prince. A fortnight later \u2013 on 4 April \u2013 the two men exchanged phone numbers at a dinner whose guest list included former basketball player Kobe Bryant and the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger. And a month after that, on 1 May, Bezos received \u201ca message from the crown prince account \u2026 through WhatsApp,\u201d the UN explained. \u201cThe message is an encrypted video file. It is later established, with reasonable certainty, that the video\u2019s downloader infects Mr Bezos\u2019 phone with malicious code.\u201d This rapidly infected his phone \u2013 and a huge exfiltration of data began. That was the conclusion of a report undertaken for Bezos by FTI Consulting, an advisory firm, whose findings were passed to Callamard, and another UN special rapporteur, David Kaye. The Guardian has seen this report. If the analysis is correct, the crown prince\u2019s close circle had obtained the contents of the mobile phone of one of the world\u2019s most powerful businesspeople. Bezos \u2013 like hundreds of other victims \u2013 would have had no reason to know he had been hacked. In the days and weeks that followed, Bezos \u2013 who was married at the time \u2013 sent private text messages to his girlfriend, describing his romantic feelings. Those texts would later be published in the National Enquirer, although the exact circumstances around their publication have yet to be determined. What is known is that the crown prince had twice met with the owner of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, who was known in Hollywood and Washington as a man who had ties to Donald Trump, and had a history of solving problems for the US president, including \u201ckilling\u201d negative stories about Trump and his extramarital affairs. New information published by Callamard and Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, suggest that the alleged targeting of Bezos was just the beginning of a broader campaign to pick off individuals who were close to Khashoggi and in frequent contact with the journalist. The timeline published by the investigators on Wednesday refers to four other prominent Saudi critics who were targeted with malware in the weeks that followed: Yahya Assiri and Omar Abdulaziz, who were in frequent contact with Khashoggi, the London-based satirist Ghanem al-Dosari, and an Amnesty International official who was working in Saudi Arabia. On 2 October, Khashoggi entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul and was killed. US intelligence agencies and Callamard\u2019s own report would later allege that Bin Salman bore responsibility for the killing. Shortly thereafter, the investigators said there had been a \u201cmassive online campaign\u201d against Bezos and Amazon in Saudi Arabia, principally targeting him as the owner of the Washington Post. Then, in January last year, the National Enquirer published an expos\u00e9 of Bezos\u2019s extramarital affair, including text messages that were sent after the billionaire\u2019s phone was allegedly hacked by the Saudis. American Media Inc, owner of the National Enquirer, has denied that any \u201cthird party\u201d was involved in it obtaining information about Bezos, and has insisted that it received its tip-off from the estranged brother of Bezos\u2019s girlfriend. But the brother, Michael Sanchez, publicly stated last year that the Enquirer was already aware of the illicit relationship when he was first contacted by the tabloid in July 2018 and had already \u201cseen\u201d text messages between the couple. While experts contend that Bin Salman may have been seeking to silence Bezos, the Amazon CEO publicly accused AMI of trying to \u201cextort and blackmail\u201d him, after the company suggested that it would agree to not publish compromising photographs of the billionaire if he agreed to shutdown his investigation into the leaked texts. Bezos flatly denied the apparent deal. The FTI Consulting report says that Bezos obtained a detailed briefing about the extent of the Saudi campaign against him on 14 February. It was provided over two separate phone calls. Yet two days later, according to the FTI report, the crown prince sent another message to Bezos, claiming \u201cwhat you hear or told it\u2019s not true and it\u2019s matter of time tell [sic] you know the truth\u201d. UN investigators say the online campaign against Bezos ended on 1 April. At about that time, the Guardian reported that Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had privately urged the crown prince to cut his ties to a close adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, who had been known as a key architect of Saudi Arabia\u2019s cyber warfare and Twitter campaigns. The Saudi embassy in Washington declined to respond to the Guardian\u2019s questions. But in a tweet, the Saudi government called allegations that the crown prince was involved in the hacking of Bezos \u201cabsurd\u201d. \u201cWe call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,\u201d it said.

Their anger at the club\u2019s stagnation in the face of massive financial outlay is currently being vented at the club\u2019s owners, the Glazers, and their executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who are ultimately responsible for the club\u2019s disastrous transfer policy over the past five or six seasons. </p> <p>It\u2019s hardly a stretch to suggest that if on-field results don\u2019t improve, it is a certain over-promoted Norwegian who will be scapegoated, as his employers are unlikely to be willing to shoulder any blame \u2013 of which there is plenty to go around \u2013 for the club\u2019s current woes. Kick-off tonight is at the ungodly hour of 8.15pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime. <br></p> </div>   </div>",

We know we\u2019re going to do the basics well and we have to hope they have a quiet day. It\u2019s up to them to say whether that was the case or not tonight. I thought we put in a really good shift, it was really well organised and we scored two great goals. I\u2019m pleased for the fans - we\u2019ve had some ups and downs this season but we\u2019ve just had two good results.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything other than hold our hands up and say this isn\u2019t good enough for this club,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cYou can talk about our poor start [to the season] all day long but of course we work every single day with these boys to improve. We\u2019re looking to improve, definitely.\u201d On whether or not he\u2019s being given the backing to improve his squad: \u201cWe\u2019ve got our targets and days like this highlight how well some of our results have been this season,\u201d he says, although I can\u2019t fathom what he means. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our second match at home and I thought we\u2019d turned the corner regarding days like this, but we clearly haven\u2019t. We\u2019ve started a clear-out and a get-players-in job. We\u2019re working on things.\u201d Jay Rodriguez speaks: \u201c\u201cThis result means everything,\u201d says the man whose goal of the season contender put the game beyond United in a chat with BT Sport. \u201cWe worked hard and we showed quality. We stuck at it. Coming here, it is always one of the places you want to play at.\u201d Ben Mee speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the game out and keep a clean sheet,\u201d says Burnley\u2019s skipper, who was given the man of the match award. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny game. We lost four league games in a row and now we\u2019ve beaten Leicester and Manchester United in the space of a few days.\u201d Jamie Jackson was at Old Trafford for the Guardian to chronicle another insipid performance from the home side from a team who hadn\u2019t beaten them in nearly 70 years. How things stand ... Manchester United remain in fifth place (which speaks volumes about how dreadful the teams beneath them must be), six points behind Chelsea. Behind them, breathing down their necks on the same number of points, sit Tottenham Hotspur and Wolves in sixth and seventh. In 13th place, Burnley are sandwiched between Everton and Newcastle with all three clubs on 30 points, just four points behind United. Manchester City were found to have made inadmissible submissions to Uefa over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the Guardian\u2019s David Conn can exclusively reveal. Read on ... Elsewhere in the Premier League: Leicester City have beaten West Ham 4-1 but lost Jamie Vardy to injury just before half-time. Tottenham have beaten Norwich City by the odd goal of three. Chris Wood speaks: \u201cIt was indeed,\u201d he says to BT Sport upon being commended on his side\u2019s good performance. \u201cWe grinded it out at times, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re good at. We got the two goals and put in a great defensive performance.\u201d Burnley have won at Old Trafford: \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d says Rio Ferdinand on BT Sport. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to be here. THey\u2019ve spent \u00a3600m on players in recent years and I don\u2019t see it out there. WEHat\u2019s to show for it here? You can\u2019t defend this? Young kids in schools around the country aren\u2019t going to want to wear Man United shirts or come here and watch this. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It\u2019s all over at a practically empty Old Trafford, where Sean Dyche has finally masterminded victory over Manchester United at the 10th time of asking. Goals from Chris Wood and Jay Rodriguez helped Burnley beat United at Old Trafford for the first time since 1962. Stay tuned for post-match reaction and our report. 90+4 min: Burnley\u2019s fans roar their approval as Juan Mata is penalised for a foul and then angrily kicks the ball away. He isn\u2019t booked, but does get a ticking-off from Jon Moss. 90+2 min: United continue to huff and puff around the edge of the Burnley penalty area, albeit to little or no avail. They\u2019ve been diabolically bad tonight. 90 min: There now look to be more empty seats than occupied ones at Old Trafford as the game goes into time added on. Luke Shaw thinks he\u2019s pulled a goal back, but his headed conversion of Juan Mata\u2019s cross is chalked off by Jon Moss for a foul in the build-up. A quick VAR consultation later and Moss sticks with his decision. 89 min: Dwight McNeill goes down injured after being caught by a late tackle from Aaron Wan-Bissaka. 88 min: Tarkowski leathers the ball clear as Luke Shaw tries to shimmy his way into the Burnley penalty area. 87 min: Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the only United player to put in a decent shift tonight, is penalised for a foul on Jay Rodriguez. It was borne out of frustration, I suspect ... and that frustration is entirely understandable. 86 min: Another shot from distance, this time from Anthony Martial. He sends the ball high over the bar. He had few other options, such has been the paucity of movement from his fellow forwards. United have been utterly toothless tonight. 84 min: There are plenty more empty red seats to be seen in Old Trafford as a steady stream of home fans make for the exits. They\u2019ve seen enough. 83 min: Mason Greenwood rumbles forward and unleashes a rasping shot that fizzes narrowly wide of Nick Pope\u2019s right post. 82 min: Charlie Taylor is called upon to clear, as Burnley continue to defend stoutly. Manchester United seem completely bereft of ideas as to how best to break them down. 81 min: Another block on the fringes of the Burnley penalty area, this time from Jeff Hendrick as he prevents Luke Shaw from getting a cross in. 81 min: Wan-Bissaka slings another cross into the Burnley penalty area, only for Ben Mee to dispatch it down the field with an agricultural clearance. He and James Tarkowski have been immense when called upon tonight. 80 min: Jesse Lingard has a shot blocked by a defender after being teed up by a Luke Shaw pull-back. 78 min: Anthony Martial picks up a pass from Nemanja Matic on the edge of the Burnley penalty area, cuts inside and shoots feebly. Nick Pope saves, although the ball was going wide and he probably didn\u2019t need to. 77 min: Burnley win a corner deep in Manchester United territory. Nothing comes of it and United clear their lines. 74 min: The ball\u2019s swung into the mixzer and Phil Jones heads it down into the mixer. Juan Mata sends a soft shot trickling straight at Pope. 74 min: Anthony Martial tries his luck with a shot from distance, which Nick Pope saves comfortably. Corner for Manchester United. 72 min: Manchester United continue to dominate possession but are struggling to convert it into anything resembling decent goalscoring opportunities. They\u2019ve been bang average tonight, truth be told. 69 min: Man United double-substitution: Dan James and Brandon Williams make way for Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard, meaning Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has changed his team\u2019s entire left side. 68 min: Juan Mata flicks the ball over both defensive wall and cross-bar. 67 min: Ben Mee fouls Dan James on the edge of the penalty area, giving away a free-kick directly in front of goal, inside the D on the edge of the penalty area. 65 min: Another free-kick from deep is lumped into the United penalty area. Ben Mee gets the knockdown and it doesn\u2019t fall quite in the right place for Jack Cork, who gets his legs in a tangle while trying to control it and goes to ground. A let-off for United, if truth be told. 64 min: Dan James cuts in from the left and curls a shot from the edge of the penalty area around the right upright. It\u2019s a decent effort, but Burnley will be happy to restrict United to long range efforts like that all night. 62 min: Looking at replays of that Rodriguez goal, it gets better with every viewing. There didn\u2019t appear to be anything on for him, but the ball sat up nicely as he unleashed the shot that went in off the underside of the cross-bar from a very tight angle. 61 min: Now Steve McManaman is criticising the cowardice of assorted Manchester United players, pointing out that the only player on their side prepared to take responsibility is Wan-Bissaka, who is a young right-back and one of the club\u2019s most recent arrivals. 58 min: That\u2019s definitely one for the show-reel. Jay Rodriguez picked up the ball wide on the left. Without appearing to look goalwards, he smashes a surface-to-air screamer past David De Gea, beating the stunned goalkeeper at his near post with a shot that fizzed into the top corner. Burnley double their lead. It\u2019s a remarkable goal from Jay Rodriguez, who rifles the ball into the top corner from a ridiculous angle. 55 min: Burnley will be very happy with how things are going in the early stages of this second half. They\u2019re nursing a one-goal lead and are keeping Manchester United at bay quite easily. With the exception of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, their hosts are completely lacking in cutting edge. 54 min: \u201cWho me?\u201d asks an incredulous Juan Mata when he\u2019s penalised for a foul just outside the Burnley penalty area. On BT Sport, Steve McManaman criticises Manchester United\u2019s players for taking the easy option rather than trying to take on and beat men when they have the ball at their feet. They are, he says, afraid of getting booed if they try anything clever and it doesn\u2019t come off. 52 min: James Tarkowski is on hand to block at the near post as the ball threatens to make its way to Dan James in a good shooting position. 50 min: Aaron Wan-Bissaka dispossesses Dwight McNeill with a good tackle over by the touchline. The Burnley winger would have been away down the left flank without that intervention. 49 min: Burnley appeal for a penalty when Fred slips in his own penalty area and inadvertently hits the ball with his arm twice upon landing. As he had no way of getting out of the way of the ball, it\u2019s not a spot-kick. 48 min: Ashley Westwood\u2019s corner is a poor one, failing to clear Greenwood at the near post. 47 min: Mason Greenwood concedes a corner, despite taking the ball off McNeill\u2019s toe about 40 yards from his own goal. 47 min: Dan James canters down the inside left and his shot towards the Burnley goal takes a little nick off Matt Lowton before sailing into the arms of Nick Pope. 46 min: Mason Greenwood is on for Andreas Pereira, as Burnley get play started in this second half. Elsewhere in the Premier League: Leicester City lead West Ham 3-1 but have lost Jamie Vardy to injury. At White Hart Lane, Tottenham lead Norwich City 2-1. Both those games are in their closing stages. Burnley lead at the break. One of the most Route One goals you\u2019ll ever see separates the sides as they traipse in for their half-time brew. Having seen United miss a couple of good chances in an otherwise dreary encounter, Ashley Westwood hoofed the ball forward, Ben Mee headed it across the penalty area and Chris Wood provided the finish. Things have gone from bad to worse for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. 45+2 min: Ashley Westwood sends in a wonderful corner-kick, which almost finds Wood. David De Gea punches clear. 45+1 min: Burnley win another free-kick in the centre-circle. The ball\u2019s played to Lowton, who lumps it towards the far post. Nemanja Matic wins his header against Mee this time, but concedes a corner. From that, they win another one. 44 min: Another shot from Pereira, who pulls a harmless low, diagonal effort from distance across the face of goal and into the waiting arms of Pope. A nearby pitchside microphone picks out a contemptuous cry of \u201cSHITE!\u201d from a nearby spectator with a Mancunian accent. 43 min: A hopelessly optimistic Andreas Pereira tries a shot from distance that prompts whistles of derision from the fans behind Nick Pope\u2019s goal. 40 min: Well, that could scarcely have been more direct, but whatever works, eh? Very much against the run of play, United have conceded from yet another set-piece. The ball was wellied to the edge of the penalty area, where Ben Mee headed it into the mixer. Wood\u2019s finish was excellent, his reactions commendably quick as the ball sat up for him about 10 yards from goal. Burnley take the lead. A free-kick from the centre-circle finds Ben Mee, who flicks it on. The ball sits up nicely for Chris Wood, who swivels and smashes the ball past De Gea. 37 min: Lowton sends a hopeful ball from deep towards the Manchester United penalty area, trying to pick out Chris Wood. David de Gea claims the ball with a minimum of fuss. 36 min: More crisp, quick passing from Manchester United as they unsuccessfully try to find an opening in the Burnley defence. They make it to the edge of the final third before Matt Lowton intervenes and wellies the ball 60 yards down the pitch. 33 min: Charlie Taylor dives in with a perfectly timed tackle to prevent Anthony Martial from opening scoring after being teed up in the Burnley penalty area. A poor first touch from the United striker didn\u2019t help his cause. 31 min: More good play from Wan-Bissaka, who gets the better of McNeill down the right and sends a cross arcing into the Burnley penalty area. The ball goes out for a corner, with Pope diverting Dan James\u2019s header wide. Nothing comes from the set-piece. 30 min: Dearie me. Burnley win a free-kick just outside the Manchester United penalty area in a great position, but Dwight McNeill balloons his effort high over the bar. 28 min: No sooner do I type that than Juan Mata misses a glorious opportunity to put Manchester United ahead. Aaron Wan-Bissake sends in another cross from the right and it takes a slight deflection off a defender. On the edge of the six yard box, Mata completely misses the ball when he looked certain to score. 27 min: As we approach the half-hour mark, you\u2019d have to conclude the people who chose not to occupy their seats tonight made a very wise decision. THere\u2019s not much in the way of entertainment here, with neither side providing any cutting edge. 24 min: Chris Wood heads a good chance narrowly wide from the edge of the six year box. Burnley had a free-kick a long way out, the ball was lumped into the box, where Wood was teed up by a knock-down from Mee. Had he hit the target he would have scored, although the pointy-heads at VAR HQ might have had something to say about either his (a) possibly being offside and (b) sly shove in the back of Harry Maguire as the ball came in. 23 min: ANthony Martial tries to pick out Dan James, who is on a gallop down the left wing. His pass is intercepted by Tarkowski. 23 min: Nick Pope gets down quickly to save a low left-footed drive from Fred. 21 min: Empty seat watch: There are visible clusters of unoccupied seats dotted here and there around the ground. Unsurprising, I guess, seeing as it\u2019s a school night and the opposition aren\u2019t particularly glamourous. 19 min: Manchester United continue to dominate, with Burnley having got just one touch of the ball inside their hosts\u2019 penalty area. Pereira picks out Wan-Bissaka on the right and United work the ball across the face of the Burnley penalty area. Excellent pressure from the defence sends them backwards again, with Harry Maguire forced to pass the ball back into his own half. Good, well organised defending from the visitors. 16 min: Dan James plays the ball wide to Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who squares the ball for Anthony Martial. It\u2019s on a plate for the Frenchman, who sticks out a toe and somehow steers the ball well off target when scoring looked easier. A poor miss, or is he still lame from his injury in the opening minutes? 15 min: Manchester United are forced back into their own half by the Burnley press, with Matic eventually passing the ball back to his goalkeeper, David de Gea. 13 min: Manchester United have started well and are moving the ball around quickly and largely accurately, their full-backs fully involved as they play high up the pitch. No chances of note for either side yet, mind. 11 min: Aaron Wan-Bissaka gets the better of Taylor and sends a low cross fizzing into the Manchester United penalty area from the right. Andreas Pereira is unable to turn and shoot, trapped as he is in the shackles of Jack Cork. Good defending from the midfielder. 10 min: Brandon Williams jinks this way and that on the inside left, before sending in a cross. Fred shapes to pull the trigger, but his shot is blocked by Charlie Taylor. 9 min: Manchester United corner. Andreas Pereira sends the ball into the penalty area, where Nick Pope claims comfortably. 8 min: Matt Lowton hoofs the ball long for Jay Rodriguez to chase, but the Burnley forward runs it out of play under pressure for a throw-in. 7 min: There\u2019s a pause in play as Anthony Martial receives treatment after landing awkwardly. He gets to his feet and hobbles to the touchline and then limps back on when summoned by the referee. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll be able to continue for much longer, although he may just run the injury off. It looks like he\u2019s twisted his ankle. 6 min: United fans concerned about the presence of Phil Jones in their team\u2019s ranks will be relieved to hear the defender has started reasonably well in this, only his second Premier League start of the season. He\u2019s had a couple of good clearing headers and made one interception on the deck so far. 4 min: Manchester United play the ball out from the back, with assorted Burnley players pressing hard. Their pressure and hard work pays off as Harry Maguire sends a wayward pass out for a throw-in. 3 min: Juan Mata gets forward down the right touchline, with Andreas Pereira in support. A promising looking move breaks down when Aaron Wan-Bissaka is flagged for offside. 2 min: Fred shoots from just outside the Burnley penalty area, but fails to get any power on a shot which rolls tamely wide. 1 min: Juan Mata gets the ball rolling with Manchester United playing into the Stretford End. Jack Cork clatters into Fred, going right through the Manchester United midfielder and conceding a free-kick. That should have been a booking, but he gets that one for free early doors. Phil Bardsley: The Burnley defender is out with a back injury. He wanted to play, according to his manager Sean Dyche, but the Burnley manager didn\u2019t want to risk him doing a Rashford and making things worse. Not long now: Out march the teams, with the players of Manchester United wearing red shirts, white shorts and black socks. Burnley\u2019s wear light blue shirts, shorts and socks, perhaps in the hope it will lend the occasion a derby feel and help them play like Manchester City. A win for Manchester United ... would move them within three points of Chelsea in the battle for fourth place, following the failure of Frank Lampard\u2019s side to see off 10-man Arsenal last night. Into the dragon\u2019s den: This is not something I\u2019ve noticed before - Manchester United training tops festooned with a dragon motif to celebrate the 2020 Chinese New Year. A quick Google reveals they were debuted ahead of their match against Norwich City earlier this month. Weirdly, 2020 is the Year of the Rat, but I suppose a giant rodent motif wouldn\u2019t look quite as ... em, fetching. An email: \u201cHere in the U.S. there is a brand new commercial on NBC Sports promoting their coverage of the Premier League in which the voice over man declares \u2018Manchester United\u2019s resurgence has them climbing back up the table;,\u201d writes JR in Illinois. \u201cFor real. What a world we live in, eh?\u201d Resurgence, eh? Nurse! The screens! Growing apathy at Old Trafford? It may just be the particular echo chamber of Twitter that I inhabit, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice a few Manchester United-supporting folk mention today that they either weren\u2019t bother going to tonight\u2019s game, or knew other fans who couldn\u2019t be bothered to go. If the sight of empty seats at Old Trafford becomes a regular one, the Glazers and Ed Woodward would not be best pleased, even if they are almost entirely to blame for this apparent apathy. Those teams ... The Phil Jones klaxon has been sounded loud and clear over Old Trafford, with this match perhaps coming a little too soon for Eric Bailly, who has been out all season with a knee injury. Mason Greenwood starts on the bench, with Andreas Pereira and Juan Mata getting the nod ahead of him. Luke Shaw also drops to the bench. Sean Dyche makes one change to the Burnley side that beat Leicester at the weekend. Matthew Lowton is in for Phil Bardsley, who is not in the match-day squad. Man Utd: De Gea, Wan Bissaka, Jones, Maguire, Williams, Fred, Matic, Andreas Pereira, Mata, James, Martial. Subs: Bailly, Lingard, Dalot, Romero, Shaw, Greenwood, Gomes. Burnley: Pope, Lowton, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Hendrick, Cork, Westwood, McNeil, Wood, Rodriguez. Subs: Brady, Hart, Pieters, Lennon, Vydra, Long, Goodridge. Referee: Jonathan Moss (County Durham) Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba latest ... Manchester United target Bruno Fernandes will not still be at Sporting Lisbon after the summer and Paul Pogba may decide to leave Old Trafford, according to the players\u2019 agents. Portugal international Fernandes is a United target this month, although reports suggest the clubs cannot agree a fee. Jorge Mendes, who is helping to broker the midfielder\u2019s exit, confirmed that Fernandes will leave Sporting this summer, if not this month. \u201cIf he will not leave now he will leave for sure in the summer because Sporting, they have spoken already with other clubs and something will happen,\u201d Mendes told Sky Sports News. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if [it will happen] now or the end of the season.\u201d Speculation over Pogba\u2019s future at United rumbles on, with his agent Mino Raiola refusing to rule out a summer move for the France midfielder. \u201cI expect my players to be happy and I expect the clubs to be happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my work. I do not want to work in front of what might be happening in the summer. For now he needs to be getting fit and then it is my job to get both parties, if possible, happy. If one of those parties is not happy then there are other ways to resolve that. \u201cBut that is not today the way to talk or to speculate. I don\u2019t say anything for sure. There\u2019s only one thing for sure in life and that is that one day you die. A lot of people did not think he would have gone back to Manchester United, people tend to forget that, people tend to imagine that Manchester United was the only club he could have signed for. \u201cThat was not the case. He chose Manchester United. Maybe [Sir Alex] Ferguson did not like that but he chose Manchester United.\u201d Early team news ... Having been sent on to play against Wolves last week despite suffering from a back injury that he promptly made worse, Marcus Rashford is expected to be out for up to three months, while Victor Lindelof is also a doubt after being sent home early from training by club medical staff yesterday. With Marcos Rojo and Axel Tuanzebe also injured, Eric Bailly or Phil Jones could start in the heart of Manchester United\u2019s defence. Midfielders Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay also remain sidelined. Shaun Dyche is comparatively lucky and has an almost fully fit squad to choose from. He will, however, be without Ashley Barnes, who is recovering from a hernia operation, but Icelandic winger Johann Berg Gudmondsson could feature after recovering from a hamstring injury. While Burnley eased the pressure on themselves with a much-needed win over Leicester at the weekend, Manchester United had no such luck. While there was no shame in only going down 2-0 to Liverpool, the gaping chasm in class between the two sides could scarcely have been more apparent and they Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s men could easily have lost by five or six. While Manchester United fans are desperate for Ole to succeed, one suspects that anything less than a win against their visitors from Turf Moor could result in their patience wearing thin. Their anger at the club\u2019s stagnation in the face of massive financial outlay is currently being vented at the club\u2019s owners, the Glazers, and their executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who are ultimately responsible for the club\u2019s disastrous transfer policy over the past five or six seasons. It\u2019s hardly a stretch to suggest that if on-field results don\u2019t improve, it is a certain over-promoted Norwegian who will be scapegoated, as his employers are unlikely to be willing to shoulder any blame \u2013 of which there is plenty to go around \u2013 for the club\u2019s current woes. Kick-off tonight is at the ungodly hour of 8.15pm (GMT), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime.",

      "body": "<p>Apparently, Hugh Laurie is not only British but he can do comedy, too! This discovery about an actor the majority of American viewers know only as caustic doctor Gregory House in House is currently falling on US audiences like manna from heaven, courtesy of his starring role in Armando Iannucci\u2019s new space-dystopian sitcom Avenue 5 (HBO/Sky One).

It\u2019s something of an (inter)stellar lineup. Laurie plays Ryan Clark, captain of space cruise ship Avenue 5 and a man with a much-valued talent for soothing even the most fractious passenger on an eight-week jaunt around the solar system. This is particularly useful as his colleague, Matt Spencer (Zach Woods, of the US version of The Office and Silicon Valley), has no such talent, despite being the head of passenger communications. \u201cI\u2019m here to make sure your body wash gets replenished,\u201d he explains to warring couple Mia (Jessica St Clair) and Doug (Kyle Bornheimer), who have taken the holiday to try to save their relationship, \u201cnot to rectify the catastrophe of human existence.\u201d Spencer has many of the best lines, often as a hologram shilling the ship\u2019s luxury services, including all-you-can-eat buffets: \u201cIf you\u2019re not completely satisfied \u2013 you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Also in the mix, and a further cross for Spencer to bear, is domineering Karen Kelly (Iannucci\u2019s rep-company stalwart Rebecca Front), who is married to the beleaguered Frank (fellow Office-mate of Woods, Andy Buckley) and has many ongoing complaints about their malfunctioning cabin.

This was a defeat that spoke of their deep callowness and their inability to turn possession into goals. Burnley were sharper at the business end of the pitch, leaving United to rue a chance to close the gap to fourth-placed Chelsea to three points. Instead the deficit is six and United\u2019s one-step forward, one-step back form continues. During a torrid evening there were anti-Glazer and anti-Ed Woodward chants from a Stretford End seriously disgruntled at the owners and executive vice-chairman.

      "bodyText": "Protesters calling for the release of a senior Chinese telecommunications executive arrested in Canada have admitted they were paid actors, in the latest twist in a closely watched extradition case that has chilled relations between Ottawa and Beijing. More than a dozen people joined a demonstration on Monday outside a Vancouver courtroom where the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is fighting extradition to the US for alleged fraud related to sanctions against Iran. The protesters held handwritten signs that read \u201cFree Meng\u201d and \u201cTrump stop bullying us\u201d \u2013 but it soon emerged that they were actors who had been promised C$100 ($76) for two hours\u2019 work on a movie. In a Facebook post, one of the actors, Julia Hackstaff described the fake protest as a \u201cfilthy cheap scam\u201d that has resulted in her receiving hate messages online. Hackstaff said she had been offered work as a movie extra, but soon after arriving at the court realized she had been duped into attending a real event. \u201cI feel cheated, used, abused, angry, deeply saddened and emotions that I don\u2019t even have words to describe,\u201d she wrote. It was unclear who had recruited the actors. A Huawei spokesman told the AP that the company had no involvement with the protest. China\u2019s embassy in Ottawa did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Another protester, Ken Bonson, gave an identical account to the Toronto Star, saying she \u201chad no idea what I was going into\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m honestly pretty ashamed and embarrassed,\u201d she said, explaining that she had not known about Meng or her legal saga. The revelations came as Canadian government lawyers returned to court for the third day, to argue that Meng \u2013 Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer \u2013 should be extradited because she was guilty of fraud \u2013 and not because she violated US sanctions against Iran. Meng\u2019s legal team has argued that she was caught up in a US effort to use its extradition treaty to get Canada to enforce US banking sanctions against Iran. The US alleges Meng lied to HSBC about Huawei\u2019s relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. \u201cLying to a bank in order to get banking services that creates a risk of economic prejudice is fraud. Fraud \u2013 not sanctions violations \u2013 is at the heart of this case,\u201d Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater told the court on Wednesday. In order to win extradition, lawyers for Canada\u2019s attorney general \u2013 acting on behalf of the US justice department \u2013 must demonstrate that the US accusations against Meng would be considered a crime in Canada if they had occurred there. Meng has maintained her innocence, saying the alleged conduct was not illegal in Canada. Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized commencing with the extradition, her lawyers have said. The proceedings are expected to conclude on Friday, but a ruling is not expected this week.",

      "bodyText": "Tom Kohler-Cadmore accepts he was \u201c100% in the wrong\u201d to be part of the sordid WhatsApp group that emerged during Alex Hepburn\u2019s rape trial and is now trying to prevent young cricketers from doing the same. The Yorkshire batsman, 25, was among the England Lions white-ball squad that flew to Australia on Wednesday, his first outing for the second string since he and Nottinghamshire\u2019s Joe Clarke were removed from a tour to India last January. It followed details of their involvement in a sexual conquest game on WhatsApp coming to light during Hepburn\u2019s initial court case, with the former Worcestershire player later convicted on one count of oral rape after April\u2019s retrial and sentenced to five years in prison. Both Kohler-Cadmore and Clarke were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing but still reprimanded for bringing the game into disrepute. The England and Wales Cricket Board retrospectively banned them for four of the Lions games they missed, fined them \u00a32,000 each and ordered them to attend an educational course. With that punishment now served, Kohler-Cadmore has returned to the Lions set-up after another strong season at Headingley \u2013 the ECB insists Clarke\u2019s continued absence is based solely on performance \u2013 and he appears keen to own his mistake. Kohler-Cadmore said: \u201cOne hundred per cent I was in the wrong. We all had our part to play in the group and it was meant as a bit of a joke. I know it\u2019s not a joke now but it was never meant to be malicious. \u201cThey were my actions, I was part of it and I was the one that created the group. It was never meant to have any outcome like that, it was just us three being young, single lads. We were naive.\u201d Kohler-Cadmore knows his proximity to the Hepburn case is \u201cnot something I am ever going to get away from\u201d but insists he is a reformed character these days, having feared his career was \u201ccrashing down\u201d when Andy Flower, the former Lions head coach, initially stood him down from the India tour 12 months ago. He said: \u201cI 100% respect the ECB\u2019s decision, I know I was in the wrong, and it was a stupid mistake. I thought it was quite a fair punishment for me, and the rehabilitation course I went on, I felt it\u2019s given me more knowledge on the area. \u201cThe learning from it was that it was about you as a whole. You can\u2019t allow yourself to be acting in that way, you have got to conduct yourself a lot better. \u201cSince then my life has had a proper U-turn in how I conduct myself.

Now it appears the heat was so immense it turned one victim\u2019s brain to glass \u2013 thought to be the first time this has been seen. Experts say they have discovered that splatters of a shiny, solid black material found inside the skull of a victim at Herculaneum appear to be the remains of human brain tissue transformed by heat. They say the find is remarkable since brain tissue is rarely preserved at all due to decomposition, and where it is found it has typically turned to soap. \u201cTo date, vitrified remains of the brain have never been found,\u201d said Dr Pier Paolo Petrone, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Naples Federico II and a co-author of the study.

Petrone said the caretaker was killed instantly when deadly currents of superheated gases, ash and rock fragments, known as pyroclastic flows, swept through the town. Other evidence backs up the grisly fate: the caretaker\u2019s skull and other bones had exploded and become charred, while some of the bones \u2013 as well as a fragment of charred wood \u2013 also showed signs of glassiness. The team also found a solid, spongy mass around the chest bones, probably formed from the lungs and other organs, Petrone said.

City\u2019s submissions for the 2012 and 2013 financial years were questioned in relation to \u00a3118.75m in sponsorships from companies in Abu Dhabi, the home state of the club\u2019s owner, and their accounting methods over transfer fees and the formation of two new companies were rejected. Almost \u00a360m was added to the club\u2019s losses by the European game\u2019s governing body as a result of findings relating to accounting methods, the Guardian\u2019s investigation can reveal. The findings against City were made by consultants appointed by Uefa in spring 2014 to delve further into the accounts the club submitted. The Guardian can reveal Uefa concluded City had made losses totalling approximately \u20ac180m in 2012 and 2013, vastly exceeding the \u20ac45m FFP maximum deficit allowed, provided those losses were covered by an owner. Uefa\u2019s first inquiry into City over FFP has been known about for six years. So too has the deal which City eventually and reluctantly agreed with Uefa to limit their transfer spending. But the detail of the process, revealed today by the Guardian, has never officially been made public. The Guardian understands that within Uefa there were people who believed the regulations should have been more strictly enforced in 2014 and one staff member working on FFP is said to have left shortly after the settlement was agreed. The exposure of these details has come as a second investigation into City\u2019s FFP compliance, sparked by revelations in November 2018, is nearing completion. The Abu Dhabi sponsorships became bitterly contested issues in November 2018 when Der Spiegel published \u201cleaked\u201d internal City emails and documents which suggested the club\u2019s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, was largely funding the Etihad sponsorship deal himself, unknown to Uefa. The \u201cadjudicatory chamber\u201d of Uefa\u2019s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) is understood to be hearing the charges made against the club this week. If its panel finds the charges proven it could ban City from the Champions League, the trophy the club has most coveted since the start of Mansour\u2019s \u00a31.3bn project and transformational 2016 appointment of Pep Guardiola as manager. City are certain to appeal against any adverse finding to the court of arbitration for sport. In 2014 European football\u2019s governing body was led by the now Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and leaks published in 2018 by Der Spiegel appear to show he was personally involved in the settlement. The club risked severe sanctions for the scale of its deficit including possible exclusion from the Champions League, yet a controversial settlement was agreed in May 2014. City vehemently objected to the process and the conclusions, and were seriously threatening legal action against FFP, arguing that the break-even principle could be considered unlawful. The consultants reported to Uefa that City had not provided them with bank statements so that the payments, including from the sponsoring companies, could clearly be seen, the Guardian understands. City did make available their online bank account, which went back 12 months to the spring of 2013, but that did not cover 2012 or most of the 2013 financial year, which together constituted the first accounting period of Uefa\u2019s FFP regulations.

Under FFP losses cannot be reduced by owners putting more millions in via excessive commercial partnerships with companies related to them. City were taken over by Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family in 2008 and he with his executives instantly transformed the club\u2019s finances and ambitions. City faced a severe challenge to comply with the \u20ac45m loss limit when the club\u2019s spending was escalating dramatically, with the multiple signings of star players; City\u2019s sponsorships with the Abu Dhabi entities were examined closely by the CFCB.

Just a few weeks ago (around 12 December, to be precise) they were in second place, six points ahead of Manchester City and a potentially recoverable eight adrift of Liverpool having played the same number of games, the title challenge very much on. But then, the wheels came off. Over their last six games they have won a mere seven points, just-about-relegation-dodging form, and suddenly they are 19 points behind Liverpool having played a game more, and six behind City having played one (this one, to be specific) less.<br></p> <p>A match at home to the 17th-best team in the division might look like an excellent opportunity to resume normal service, but that would ignore the disappointing results against Aston Villa, Burnley and Southampton over the last couple of weeks, the fact that since early-mid December West Ham have precisely as many points as them, and their recent record of two points from their last four home games. As for West Ham, their home defeat to Leicester last month was the death knell for Manuel Pellegrini, who got the boot that very evening. Since then, the Hammers have, er, beaten Bournemouth. Still, it\u2019s early days for David Moyes.</p> <p>The Scot insists that he has discerned an improvement in his players. \u201cIt\u2019s down to the players\u2019 attitudes, and their attitudes have been so good,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in their stats.\u201d Which is good, because he sure as hell hasn\u2019t seen it in the team\u2019s results. </p> <p>Last night there was all sorts of madness going on - ludicrous stoppage-time comebacks, ludicrous stoppage-time winners, teams that had completely forgotten how to win remembering how to win, teams only having two shots of any description in the entire game and scoring with both of them - and with any luck there\u2019ll be more of the same tonight.

      "bodyText": "And with that I\u2019m done. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! David Moyes does his post-match interview, and he really does get right to the heart of the matter: I think the big thing was Leicester played well, and we didn\u2019t play well. We can\u2019t dress it up in any other way. I was disappointed in the performance. We improved in the second half and gave ourselves a chance, but in the end, slightly chasing the game, a bit of bad defending for the third goal gave them the goal which put the game to bed. I felt as if we\u2019d got ourselves right back in it, and in a way we went chasing it a little bit when we should probably have just waited to try and get it. We got picked off once or twice. But as I said I thought Leicester played well. I\u2019d like to [bring some players in] and I think all managers would say the same. We do need players, we\u2019re short. We need some more energy, we need some fresh legs. If we can get it we will do, but I can\u2019t guarantee that. Rodgers continues to insist that he\u2019s not at all confident of securing Champions League football. This, though, was his conclusion: For me it was about the performance tonight. Could we get back to playing the game with authority, and movement, and speed in our game. And then the results will take care of themselves. Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s match report from the King Power Stadium: Leicester got back their mojo but lost their talisman, as Jamie Vardy limped off here with a suspected hamstring injury. That did not matter against a dishevelled West Ham, as Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side strutted to their first league win since New Year\u2019s Day thanks to two goals by Ayoze P\u00e9rez and one each by Harvey Barnes and Ricardo Pereira. Leicester\u2019s top-four credentials look good again. A successful penalty by Mark Noble gave West Ham fleeting hope of scrounging a point but ultimately the visitors left with what they deserved, which was nothing other than a reminder that they need to get their act together quickly if they are to avoid being overtaken by at least one of only three teams below them in the league. Much more here: Brendan Rodgers is happy. Leicester fans will be particularly pleased to hear the initial update on Jamie Vardy, which is that his injury \u201cdoesn\u2019t look too serious ... it\u2019s just in his glute, it wasn\u2019t his hamstring which is important\u201d: I think that the tempo in the team tonight was very, very good. i thought against Burnley we started to come back a bit but tonight we were outstanding. Dynamic. We were fast in our game, the passing was quick, we looked to dominate the ball and play with that authority. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve been for most of the season, with that personality. He\u2019s asked if he saw the recent blip coming: You\u2019ve got to remember where these guys have come from. This is a team that\u2019s been ninth in the table the last couple of seasons and now we\u2019re getting compared with Liverpool and Man City. So we\u2019ve got a long, long way to go. But these guys have been amazing. Tonight we talked about getting back to how we play, and I thought they were excellent. 90+5 mins: And that\u2019s it! Leicester deservedly win, but West Ham had an excellent half-hour after half-time. 90+4 mins: One last run down the left from Chilwell, but Rice gets in his way, and then Zabaleta ushers the ball out of play. A goal kick to end things. 90+3 mins: I would like to tell you about something interesting that has happened in stoppage time, but sadly I am unable. 90+1 mins: There will be four minutes of stoppage time, or thereabouts. And it ends with another goal! The ball comes in from the right, comes off Perez to Iheanacho, comes back off Iheanacho to Perez, and his snap-shot goes in off the far post! 87 mins: West Ham\u2019s second half effort was admirable, but the game has settled back into a first-halfian rhythm of Leicester control. 84 mins: Nearly another! Chilwell had a shooting chance very similar to Ricardo\u2019s in the first half, but not the finish to match. Randolph pushes clear. 83 mins: Harvey Barnes goes off, and Wes Morgan comes on. Randolph goes low to his left, Ayoze Perez goes high the other way, and this match is surely won! Ogbonna tries to stop Iheanacho inside the area, and gets man before ball. The referee would have pointed to the spot anyway, obviously, but I think he\u2019s got this right. 78 mins: Haller\u2019s dummy allows Antonio to run down the left and cut inside, but his pull-back deflects off a defender and behind. Lanzini\u2019s corner is overhit, goes over everybody and Leicester have a goal kick. 77 mins: Another Leicester free kick for nothing whatsoever. I\u2019m not normally one for referee-bashing, but this David Coote character needs a proper talking-to. 75 mins: Lovely shot from Maddison, dipping and curling goalwards from 25 yards, and Randolph flicks out a right hand to tip over the bar! 74 mins: Another soft free kick. Leicester\u2019s players have worked out that they only need to fall over to get the referee whistling, and so are doing quite a lot of it. 72 mins: The referee, having angered the home fans with the penalty and a couple of other decisions during that phase of the game, has spent the last 10 minutes giving the home side everything he possibly can. Chilwell goes down near Antonio, and he decides that\u2019s a free kick as well, ludicrously. 70 mins: Leicester run down the other end, slicing and dicing West Ham\u2019s rearguard along the way, and Perez has a shot that Randolph palms behind! 68 mins: Chance for West Ham! The corner leads to another corner, from which Ogbonna heads over! The referee gives Leicester a free-kick, though from the replays it\u2019s unclear whether this was because someone was pulling Ogbonna\u2019s shirt, or because two people were wrestling Haller. I couldn\u2019t see any West Ham player fouling anyone. 67 mins: Zabaleta surges down the right and wins a corner. That\u2019s right, he surges. 64 mins: This is a battle now. Instead of the often slow procession of half one there are lots of players running about, often into each other. 61 mins: Antonio wins the race to a ball lifted down the right flank and translates it into a corner, from which he very nearly backheels past Schmeichel! 57 mins: West Ham win a free-kick, just inside Leicester\u2019s half, which is floated into the Leicester area and leads to a corner. That alone is more than they accomplished in the first half. 55 mins: This half has been a complete contrast to the first, in that both teams are playing in it. 54 mins: Tielemans lashes a volley wide from 20 yards. Chilwell was probably fouled in the build-up, but Perez probably committed a foul, so that\u2019s honours evens. Goal kick. 52 mins: Haller and Soyuncu battle for the ball on the Leicester left. Soyuncu wins it, but Haller leaves a boot hooked around his opponent\u2019s leg, stopping him from running free. The assistant referee, barely two yards away, thinks this is fine, but the referee gives a foul. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d shout the home fans, presumably at the refereeing team as a unit. Schmeichel jumps out of the way, and Noble sends the ball down the middle! 49 mins: The VAR is giving this a good, long look. Ndidi does make contact with Haller\u2019s knee, but the player\u2019s fall looks fabricated. The VAR decides that there was a foul, though, and confirms the penalty. 48 mins: A free kick is pushed away by Schmeichel. Ndidi and Haller go for the loose ball, and the West Ham player gets there first and goes down! 46 mins: And Antonio has a shot within 15 seconds, flicking the ball on for Haller, getting it back and then slashing wide. 46 mins: West Ham start the second half, and have made a double substitution at the break, bringing Fornals and Antonio on for Snodgrass and Masuaku. The players are back out and ready for more. Hold on to your hats! \u201cHaving now lost three first-choice strikers to injury do you think this might be the season that England finally pulls its head out of its arse about the ridiculous number of games players are required to slog through in five winter weeks?\u201d asks Matthew Turner. Almost certainly not, would be my guess. They could move a couple of these midwinter midweek matchdays to other less full-on times of the year, though. This has really been embarrassingly one-sided. Harvey Barnes and Ricardo Pereira have a goal and an assist each and the former has been the best player so far, but it\u2019s been an excellent team performance. Really, though, they\u2019re not exactly being pushed. 45+6 mins: And that\u2019s it! Two goals and two injuries for Leicester, who have been entirely dominant. 45+5 mins: Barnes gets down the left, cuts inside and picks out a lovely pass to Ricardo Pereira, bursting into the right-hand corner of the penalty area, who thumps a shot back across goal and in! In the final seconds of the half, Leicester double their lead! 45+3 mins: Zabaleta makes Barnes look like a kind of turbocharged Usain Boult, but with the Leicester man box-bound Cresswell comes across to make a vital challenge. 45+2 mins: Masuaku beats Ricardo on the left, and then pauses for no obvious reason until Ricardo comes back to tackle him. 45+1 mins: There will be about four minutes of first-half stoppage time. There have, to be fair, been quite a lot of stoppages. 44 mins: Vardy has gone off, and Kelechi Iheanacho has come on. 43 mins: Nope, he\u2019s gone down again. 42 mins: The entire stadium seems to have fallen silent, as the physio gets to work on Vardy\u2019s left leg. After a while, he gets up and jogs to the touchline. Looks like we have witnessed a magic recovery. 40 mins: More injury issues for Leicester. Vardy boots the ball with his left foot and immediately clutches his left buttock and collapses. 38 mins: Another good Leicester move ends with another disappointing Leicester delivery. There has been a lot of home possession but only limited goal threat. Still, they\u2019re winning, so who\u2019s complaining? 35 mins: Leicester have another corner. This has been quite a cornerful match, so far. 34 mins: Mendy\u2019s match is over. Wilfred Ndidi comes on, just 13 days after knee surgery. 32 mins: Uncannily, Mendy has gone down off the ball, the physio has come on, and Mendy is grimacing and pointing to his left knee. 31 mins: West Ham win a corner. Snodgrass, who has miraculously recovered, hits it, and Schmeichel catches it. 29 mins: Play eventually restarts with a Leicester corner, which is crossed in by Maddison, cleared, crossed in by Maddison, cleared and crossed in by Maddison, Randolph eventually claiming. 27 mins: The physio is on, and Snodgrass is grimacing and pointing to his left knee. On the bench, Pablo Fornals strips off. 26 mins: Leicester pass the ball about inside West Ham\u2019s half, and while they do so Snodgrass slowly goes to ground, off the ball. 24 mins: The goal stands! Pereira bursts into the penalty area and hits a cross-shot that would have gone wide had Barnes not thundered in to smash it home from half a yard. Happily the six-yard line made it abundantly clear with a simple freeze-frame that Barnes was behind the ball when Pereira hit it, so all\u2019s good. Ye VAR will check this for offside, but it looks good on first viewing! 22 mins: Leicester\u2019s dominance has diminished somewhat. Their share of possession is down to just 75% now. 20 mins: Ricardo takes on Masuaku again, but the Congolese full-back wins the duel. 17 mins: Leicester raid down the right, but then Ricardo Pereira goes down ludicrously easily with Masuaku breathing in his vague vicinity, and the referee rightly ignores him. 15 mins: An awkward corner, which Schmeichel comes for and flaps unconvincingly onto the head of Cresswell, who lifts his header over the bar. 14 mins: West Ham have an attack! It ends with Snodgrass cutting onto his left foot and shooting straight into Barnes\u2019 calf. The ball deflects for a corner. 13 mins: Perez\u2019s shot deflects to Pereira, whose follow-up shot is rubbish. Goal kick. 13 mins: Leicester have had 84% of possession so far. Most of West Ham\u2019s 16% has presumably been the time the ball has spent in the air after goal-kicks. 12 mins: Another move down the left. This time Mendy\u2019s cross flies straight across the penalty area and out the other side. 9 mins: Vardy runs down the left, but there\u2019s only one player for him to aim his cross at and he doesn\u2019t find him, Ogbonna clearing. 7 mins: Leicester win a corner, but it\u2019s headed clear. The ball briefly enters Leicester\u2019s half. 6 mins: These have been six very one-sided minutes. 5 mins: Robbie Savage has just turned on his microphone, so there is now a two-man commentary team in play. Leicester get down the left again, but can\u2019t find the cross. 4 mins: Shot! Leicester maraud down the left, Maddison dummies the cut-back and it runs to Vardy, who can\u2019t bring it under control, starts falling over and spears a shot straight at Randolph as he does so. 1 min: Perez bursts forward, but plays his through-ball precisely into the part of West Ham\u2019s area that contained no Leicester players. 1 min: Peeeeeep! Leicester get the ball rolling. Interestingly (well, potentially) there appears to be no co-commentator on BT Sport duty tonight. I\u2019m not sure when I last heard a game with solo commentary. A reminder of the week\u2019s very best West Ham-related stat: they have used as many goalkeepers in their last six games as in the 15 years from 1973 to 1988. And out they come! Indeed, they\u2019re busy shaking hands as I type. The players are in the tunnel/carpeted lobby area! Brendan Rodgers has a quick chat with BT Sport. For me our assessment\u2019s at the end of the season. You always have to stay positive, and up until now the players have been brilliant but we\u2019ve got to ensure we\u2019re not going to play for half a season. We want to push on, and if we get three points tonight it takes us another step towards where we want to be. On leaving Praet and Choudhury out of tonight\u2019s squad entirely: I can only pick 18 players, and we\u2019ve got a squad of 25, which means that some players miss out. You\u2019re always looking at your team, you\u2019re looking at your bench, in order to keep that intensity in your team. We\u2019ve got a strong team tonight, but we\u2019ve got important games also after tonight. Tonight\u2019s big scoreline (so far) comes from the Copa del Rey, where a Barcelona side including Rakitic, Griezmann, De Jong, Lenglet and the highly-rated whippersnappers Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati is a goal down at Ibiza, having had only one shot in the first half. Two changes for Leicester, for whom Youri Tielemans and Ben Chilwell come in. West Ham make one change, bringing Arthur Masuaku in and dropping Pablo Fornals to the bench. Tonight\u2019s game will be played by humans with the following names: Leicester: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Chilwell, Mendy, Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Justin, Morgan, Gray, Albrighton, Ward, Iheanacho, Ndidi. West Ham: Randolph, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Zabaleta, Snodgrass, Rice, Noble, Masuaku, Lanzini, Haller. Subs: Reid, Balbuena, Sanchez, Fornals, Martin, Ajeti, Antonio. Referee: David Coote. Poor Leicester. Just a few weeks ago (around 12 December, to be precise) they were in second place, six points ahead of Manchester City and a potentially recoverable eight adrift of Liverpool having played the same number of games, the title challenge very much on. But then, the wheels came off. Over their last six games they have won a mere seven points, just-about-relegation-dodging form, and suddenly they are 19 points behind Liverpool having played a game more, and six behind City having played one (this one, to be specific) less. A match at home to the 17th-best team in the division might look like an excellent opportunity to resume normal service, but that would ignore the disappointing results against Aston Villa, Burnley and Southampton over the last couple of weeks, the fact that since early-mid December West Ham have precisely as many points as them, and their recent record of two points from their last four home games. As for West Ham, their home defeat to Leicester last month was the death knell for Manuel Pellegrini, who got the boot that very evening. Since then, the Hammers have, er, beaten Bournemouth. Still, it\u2019s early days for David Moyes. The Scot insists that he has discerned an improvement in his players. \u201cIt\u2019s down to the players\u2019 attitudes, and their attitudes have been so good,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in their stats.\u201d Which is good, because he sure as hell hasn\u2019t seen it in the team\u2019s results. Last night there was all sorts of madness going on - ludicrous stoppage-time comebacks, ludicrous stoppage-time winners, teams that had completely forgotten how to win remembering how to win, teams only having two shots of any description in the entire game and scoring with both of them - and with any luck there\u2019ll be more of the same tonight. Fingers crossed, eh?",

      "bodyText": "Tottenham are in surprise talks with Real Sociedad over the striker Willian Jos\u00e9, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho desperate for a recognised striker to replace the injured Harry Kane. Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura have been used at centre-forward but Willian Jos\u00e9\u2019s role as a target man is seen as vital for Mourinho\u2019s tactics. The Brazilian has a \u20ac70m (\u00a359m) release clause after signing a new contract in 2018, and although Tottenham are hoping to negotiate a lower fee for the 28-year-old, the striker will not come cheap as a transfer would leave Real Sociedad short of attacking options. Real Sociedad played Espanyol in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday, with the club announcing shortly before the cup tie that Willian Jos\u00e9 had withdrawn from the squad and that \u201cthe forward has asked to stay out until his situation is clarified\u201d. Before Tottenham\u2019s 2-1 win over Norwich, Spurs had not scored a Premier League goal in open play since Boxing Day, amounting to six hours and 18 minutes of football. Willian Jos\u00e9 has scored eight league goals in 20 appearances this season, having also played in La Liga with Zaragoza and Las Palmas.",

She implied he \u201cgroomed\u201d the women, negotiating them into situations in which he suddenly turned violent and attacked them unexpectedly.</p> <p>\u201cDifferent women, from different places, decades apart faced the same crimes,\u201d Hast said. \u201cAt the end of this trial the evidence will be clear that the man seated right there was not a titan in Hollywood, he was a rapist.\u201d</p> <p>Weinstein is facing five counts, including two counts of rape and one count that he performed oral sex on a woman without her consent. The two other charges are that he committed predatory sexual assault, accusing him of a pattern of non-consensual sex, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p> <p>Of the six state witnesses, two form the heart of the case. Hast ran the jury through the basic details of the accusations raised by both.</p> <p>The first was an English-born woman described as having had a tough childhood, leaving home to fend for herself in the early 1980s. She met Weinstein at a London film festival in 2004 having been introduced to him by another legendary film producer, Michael White.</p> <p>Two years later, the woman travelled to the Cannes film festival in the hope of securing work in production, where she met Weinstein again and asked him if he had any job openings. He invited her to his hotel suite where, after some business talk, he became sexually suggestive and asked for a massage, which she declined.</p> <p>Soon after, employees contacted the woman again and invited her to work for the TV show Weinstein was involved in, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/15/project-runway-fashion-as-day-job-christian-siriano-dom-streater-all-stars\">Project Runway</a>. When the woman agreed to take up the role, the prosecutor said: \u201cFor Harvey Weinstein she had passed the first test.\u201d</p> <p>Hast went on to describe an incident on 10 July 2006 in which Weinstein allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on her in his apartment in New York\u2019s SoHo neighbourhood. She had gone there expecting a business conversation but the tone suddenly changed, the court heard.</p> <p>Weinstein \u201cdramatically changed without warning\u201d, Hast said. \u201cThe defendant, who at this time is almost 300lb lunged towards the 115lb woman and began to grope her. She told him \u2018I\u2019m not interested\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But having forced her into the bedroom and on to his bed \u201che put his weight on top of her and held her down. She kept saying no, kept trying to get up \u2026 but the defendant put his mouth on her vagina. She told him she had a tampon in. He yanked it out and continued orally sexually assaulting her.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution also outlined the accusations of a woman whose identity was unknown until it was revealed in court on Wednesday. Hast described how the woman was allegedly raped by Weinstein in 2013.</p> <p>\u201cRealizing the danger of the situation, she relented and got undressed \u2026 He got on top of her and raped her, forcing his penis into her vagina.\u201d The alleged victim \u201cjust lay there\u201d. Later in the bathroom she found a needle and a vial of chemical which she Googled and discovered to be an erectile dysfunction medicine.</p> <p>In the aftermath, the woman was so racked by shame and fear that she \u201ccontemplated suicide\u201d, Hast said.</p> <p>At one point in the presentation, when Hast was describing Weinstein as a predator, he sat listening to her, chuckling dismissively and shaking his head. </p> <p>Damon Cheronic, a lawyer for Weinstein said: \u201cThis case doesn\u2019t hold water because it is not true. Harvey Weinstein was not a master manipulator, that\u2019s a line from a movie that you are not going to see.\u201d</p> <p>Cheronis put up on screen a number of emails and texts from the women testifying that implied warm relations with the defendant even after the alleged attacks. </p> <p>One reminisced fondly with Weinstein about their earlier encounters and asked whether he could meet her in London. But when New York Times and New Yorker articles about Weinstein were published in October 2017 she changed tack and employed the sex crimes attorney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/feb/16/gloria-allred-interview-netflix-seeing-allred\">Gloria Allred</a>, Cheronis said.</p> <p>Allred represents two of the accusers involved in the trial.</p> <p>The only successful actor among the trial accusers is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/28/annabella-sciorra-alleges-rape-harvey-weinstein\">Annabella Sciorra</a>, who starred in the Sopranos TV series. The prosecution related an alleged attack that happened at her New York home in the winter of 1993 to 94.</p> <p>Hast screened a photo of Weinstein smiling and smoking, from around that time. \u201cShe was 110lb. He was close to 6ft tall and almost 300lb. The defendant grabbed her and pushed her on to the bed. He pinned her arms under her head and continued to hold her down as he inserted his penis in her vagina and raped her.\u201d</p> <p>He proceeded to perform oral sex on her against her will. \u201cAnnabella remembers not having any fight in her. Her body wasn\u2019t able to endure any more and she began violently shaking. The defendant had finally had enough and he left her emotionally and physically destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>A few years later at the Cannes film festival Sciorra was allegedly accosted again in Weinstein\u2019s hotel room. To her horror, she found him in his underwear, with baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other.</p> <p>Outlining another\u2019s account, Hast said that in 2004 Weinstein lured the woman to a hotel room, where she went in hope of securing a movie role. When she entered he was naked.</p> <p>He pointed to three film scripts and suggested she could take her pick if she would \u201cbe kind\u201d to him . She tried to laugh it off, but Weinstein allegedly yelled: \u201cThis is how the industry works. How do you think other actresses got ahead?\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the day\u2019s proceedings, one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, Arthur Aidala, called for the trial to be scrapped. He argued that the prosecution\u2019s description of the defendant as a \u201cpredator\u201d and a \u201cmonster\u201d was inappropriate and had tainted the jury.</p> <p>Lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon retorted: \u201cTo call a person charged with sexual assault a predator, is like calling a person charged with robbery a robber.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at <a href=\"http://www.rainn.org/\">Rainn.org</a>.

In an opening statement lasting over an hour, New York prosecutor Meghan Hast delivered a devastating and at times shocking account of Weinstein\u2019s alleged attacks on six women who will testify at the fallen mogul\u2019s trial in Manhattan. Pointing at the defendant just feet away at the defense table, staring back at her, Hast proclaimed to the jury: \u201cThat man was a sexual predator and a rapist.\u201d She described in searing detail the allegations of the six women, many of whom harbored aspirations in the movies but only one of whom actually enjoyed success.

Harvey Weinstein was not a master manipulator, that\u2019s a line from a movie that you are not going to see.\u201d Cheronis put up on screen a number of emails and texts from the women testifying that implied warm relations with the defendant even after the alleged attacks. One reminisced fondly with Weinstein about their earlier encounters and asked whether he could meet her in London. But when New York Times and New Yorker articles about Weinstein were published in October 2017 she changed tack and employed the sex crimes attorney Gloria Allred, Cheronis said. Allred represents two of the accusers involved in the trial. The only successful actor among the trial accusers is Annabella Sciorra, who starred in the Sopranos TV series. The prosecution related an alleged attack that happened at her New York home in the winter of 1993 to 94. Hast screened a photo of Weinstein smiling and smoking, from around that time. \u201cShe was 110lb. He was close to 6ft tall and almost 300lb. The defendant grabbed her and pushed her on to the bed. He pinned her arms under her head and continued to hold her down as he inserted his penis in her vagina and raped her.\u201d He proceeded to perform oral sex on her against her will. \u201cAnnabella remembers not having any fight in her. Her body wasn\u2019t able to endure any more and she began violently shaking. The defendant had finally had enough and he left her emotionally and physically destroyed.\u201d A few years later at the Cannes film festival Sciorra was allegedly accosted again in Weinstein\u2019s hotel room. To her horror, she found him in his underwear, with baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other. Outlining another\u2019s account, Hast said that in 2004 Weinstein lured the woman to a hotel room, where she went in hope of securing a movie role. When she entered he was naked. He pointed to three film scripts and suggested she could take her pick if she would \u201cbe kind\u201d to him . She tried to laugh it off, but Weinstein allegedly yelled: \u201cThis is how the industry works. How do you think other actresses got ahead?\u201d At the end of the day\u2019s proceedings, one of Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, Arthur Aidala, called for the trial to be scrapped. He argued that the prosecution\u2019s description of the defendant as a \u201cpredator\u201d and a \u201cmonster\u201d was inappropriate and had tainted the jury. Lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon retorted: \u201cTo call a person charged with sexual assault a predator, is like calling a person charged with robbery a robber.\u201d In the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at Rainn.org. In the UK, the rape crisis national freephone helpline is at 0808-802-9999. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800-737-7328) or 1800respect.org.au.

About 15 to 20% of hospitalised cases are severe, requiring oxygen or ventilation.\u201d Experts say the spread of the coronavirus fulfils the criteria for the WHO to declare it of international concern. \u201cPersonally, I think this is a big event,\u201d said Horby. \u201cIs it extraordinary? Yes, it pretty much is. We haven\u2019t seen this large-scale spread since Sars.\u201d The Chinese authorities were criticised for failing to share information about the Sars epidemic which began in China in 2002 but spread globally. There have been around 2,500 cases of Mers, which is far less transmissible, mostly in Saudi Arabia. \u201cThis is a new and rapidly evolving situation where information on cases and the virus is being gathered and assessed daily. Based on the available evidence, the current risk to the UK is considered low. We are working with the WHO and other international partners, have issued advice to the NHS and are keeping the situation under constant review,\u201d said Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England. \u201cIndividuals should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK. They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city.\u201d Public Health England has shifted its risk assessment slightly from \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow\u201d, but, said the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, \u201cobviously we want to stay ahead of the issue so we are keeping a very close eye on it\u201d. The UK Foreign Office has updated its advice for Britons travelling to China, warning the virus had spread to other areas outside Hubei province.",

The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the government\u2019s proposed digital services tax discriminated against US multinationals and warned there would be retaliation \u2013 probably a tax on UK car exports to the US \u2013 if the 2% levy were imposed in April. Almost one in five vehicles manufactured in the UK are exported to the US, worth \u00a38.4bn, and it is a hugely important market to manufacturers including Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin. The two finance chiefs were speaking on a panel at the Davos meeting of political and business leaders. Javid said: \u201cWe plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in April. It is a proportionate tax, and a tax that is deliberately designed as a temporary tax.\u201d But Mnuchin warned: \u201cIf people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some private conversations about that and I\u2019m sure the president and Boris [Johnson] will be speaking on it as well.

He hopes to seal a deal with the EU at the same time. At a separate press conference in Davos, Donald Trump heaped praise on Johnson and insisted the prime minister\u2019s approach would result in a successful UK-EU trade deal after Brexit. But the US has expressed its displeasure over the government\u2019s digital tax plans which it views as a targeted attack on US tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.

Government sources said the digital services tax was included in the Conservative party\u2019s election manifesto and was one of the few taxes that was actually popular with voters. Earlier this month the US and China signed a Phase 1 trade in which the US secured greater market access to the world\u2019s second biggest economy in exchange for shelving or lowering tariffs on some Chinese goods.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 23 January. Top stories The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has referred Bridget McKenzie\u2019s handling of the controversial sports grants scheme to an internal investigation, following the auditor general\u2019s scathing report into the $100m community sport infrastructure grant program. It comes amid new revelations that sports clubs and councils in Tony Abbott\u2019s then seat of Warringah received more than $1m in grants under the controversial sports grants program, with another Coalition MP, Trent Zimmerman, failing to declare his role as patron to a rugby union club that received $500,000. The Queenscliff Surf Lifesaving Club, of which Abbott was a member, received $70,000, with nearby Mosman Rowing Club also being granted $500,000. Seventeen people have now died from the mysterious Sars-like coronavirus, Chinese authorities have said, as the government unveiled measures to rein in the spread of the disease and advised residents of Wuhan not to leave the city. Officials said China was now at the most critical stage of prevention and control, especially as the nation prepares to celebrate the lunar new year on 25 January and hundreds of millions will criss-cross the country. In Australia, medical staff from the New South Wales health department will be stationed alongside biosecurity staff at Sydney airport to meet the thrice-weekly direct flight from Wuhan, conduct an initial diagnosis of any people on the flight who are exhibiting flu-like symptoms, and if necessary send them to Westmead hospital for testing. The United Nations are demanding an investigation into allegations that the world\u2019s richest man, Jeff Bezos, had his phone hacked by Saudi Arabia, with special rapporteurs \u201cgravely concerned\u201d spyware deployed from a WhatsApp message from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was an attempt at surveillance of Bezos in order to silence the Washington Post\u2019s reporting on Saudi Arabia. The crown prince remains under ongoing scrutiny over his possible involvement in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Australia More than half of all Australians have been directly affected by the recent bushfire crisis, according to a survey by the Australia Institute. A third of those surveyed across Australia reported a change to their routine, with 26% reporting illness or health effects as a result of smoke haze. The My Health Record system has cost the federal government nearly $2bn over the past decade \u2013 but nearly half of the online medical entries remain empty. 90% of Australians have an e-record \u2013 but only 12.9m of these contain any data. A Services Australia crackdown on people flouting the single parents payment has failed to uncover the savings it had foreshadowed, finding that just over 1% of 75,598 recipients it reviewed had partners. The chief executive of Acoss has criticised the systematic reviews which it says presumes recipients are \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d. Arachnid experts are predicting a \u201cbonanza\u201d of funnel web sightings across Sydney, due to recent wet weather and heat creating conditions in which the world\u2019s most venomous spider thrive. The world Terry Jones, founding member of Monty Python and director of three of Python\u2019s feature films has died, aged 77. The behind-camera star of Life of Brian, Monty Python and the Holy Grain, and The Meaning of Life, also found success with the beloved TV series Ripping Yarns, as well as writing nearly 20 children\u2019s books. Donald Trump has downplayed the brain injuries suffered by US personnel in Iran\u2019s missile attacks on bases where they were stationed earlier this month. \u201cI heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things, but I would say and I can report it is not very serious,\u201d he said. Emmanuel Macron has been involved in a terse exchange with Israeli security, with the French president asking an officer to leave St Anne, a church in Jerusalem that has been considered French territory since 1896. Recommended reads \u201cIn a country bound by world-famous beaches, there is something incredibly calming about a swim at a waterhole.\u201d But how to find the most stunning and wild places for a dip? Caroline Clements and Dillon Seichik-Reardon have you covered. And for a historical stroll down memory lane, check out these stunning \u201cthen and now\u201d pictures of some of Australia\u2019s favourite ocean pools. At current rates of carbon emissions the world will hit its budget for a 1.5C rise in around 10 years. But with a prime minister more interested in \u201cblathering about adaptation\u201d and an opposition leader choosing his words carefully, how can Australia do its part? Greg Jericho punches the numbers on what kinds of cuts are necessary. Studies have shown that classical music can help sooth pets suffering separation anxiety. But with Amazon Prime now offering shows specifically for cats and dogs, and Spotify announcing playlists specifically for your pet, is animal entertainment actually a good idea? Kate Leaver takes a look. Listen As Harvey Weinstein goes on trial for charges of rape and sexual assault, for dozens of women their only recourse against the former film mogul is civil courts. On this episode of Today in Focus, Anushka Asthana speaks with class action participant Zo\u00eb Brock. Sport Run-outs are rarely as slapstick as the one between Aaron Finch and Steve Smith that cost Australia against India. But with both players in top form it\u2019s a timely reminder, writes Jonathan Howcroft, that much of sport is played between the ears. South Korea has cut strips through a timid Olyroos defence to seal a 2-0 victory in their AFC U-23 Championship semi-final and deny Australia their first chance to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. Australia can still qualify for the Olympics if they beat Uzbekistan on Saturday. Media roundup Tourism executives say the \u201cworst summer on record\u201d has cost Australia $2bn already and could hit the industry for $4.5bn more, the Australian reports. Malcolm Turnbull has accused prime minister Scott Morrison of \u201cmisleading\u201d the public over climate change, writes the Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Scott Morrison has acted the way he has \u2026 I\u2019ve known him for 20 years and I can\u2019t explain his conduct.\u201d NSW MP Andrew Constance came out swinging against the Red Cross, Salvation Army and St Vincent De Paul for taking too long to distribute bushfire donations, states the ABC. Coming up NSW fire crews are bracing for the return of severe fire conditions with hot and windy weather forecast across much of the state. Nick Kyrgios will play Gilles Simon in the second round of the Australian Open tonight. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 What\u2019s the secret to the perfect espresso? Well forget long conversations with your local barista, because mathematicians reckon they\u2019ve found the formula. \u201cThe key to making the shot reproducible is you want the particles just large enough that the flow is uniform and predictable, but as small as they can be to maximise the surface area,\u201d research co-author Dr Jamie Foster.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill has cleared its last hurdle after the government overturned five House of Lords amendments to it, including one that would have restored the right of unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families in the UK. The legislation is expected to gain royal assent within days after peers agreed to end the parliamentary \u201cping-pong\u201d phase where it moves between the two houses until agreement is reached. While the passage of the withdrawal agreement bill (Wab), which puts the deal into legislation, became a formality after Johnson won a significant majority in December\u2019s election, it is nonetheless a symbolically significant moment after Theresa May\u2019s plan was rejected by MPs three times. In a brief comment calling for an end to \u201crancour and division\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cAt times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we\u2019ve done it.\u201d There was, however, some final controversy, as opposition MPs condemned the government for ordering Conservative MPs to oppose an amendment drafted by Alf Dubs, the Labour peer and former child refugee, guaranteeing family reunion rights. Lord Dubs called the move \u201cbitterly disappointing\u201d. The amendment, passed in the Lords on Tuesday, was rejected in the Commons by 342 votes to 254. All those who voted against were Conservatives. \u201cWhat could be more humane than asking that unaccompanied child refugees stranded in Europe be able to join relatives in this country?\u201d Dubs said in a tweet. It was among five amendments to the EU withdrawal agreement bill passed by peers which have now been overturned. The bill puts the government\u2019s Brexit deal into law. There were also amendments on EU workers legally residing in the UK getting physical proof of their right to remain; a commitment to the UK parliament not legislating for devolved matters without the consent of the devolved legislature affected; and two relating to the power of courts to depart from European court of justice rulings. Labour\u2019s Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the government was \u201cattempting to shirk its moral and legal obligation to child refugees and their families\u201d. She said: \u201cThe Tory manifesto just a month ago claimed they would continue to support refugees, and even that they would increase that support. This is a shameful betrayal of those promises.\u201d Stuart McDonald, the SNP\u2019s immigration spokesperson, said: \u201cRather than stepping up and playing its role in addressing the refugee crisis, the toxic Tory government has instead lurched to the extremes and closed the door on some of the most vulnerable children in the world.\u201d Dubs, who came to the UK as a Kindertransport child refugee after fleeing Prague in 1939, has urged the government to enshrine, after Brexit, the principle of family reunion for child refugees fleeing conflict . Responding later in the Lords, Dubs said he noted government promises to make a statement on the issue in the next couple of months, saying ministers should explain how they would make sure the system was ready for the start of 2021, when the Brexit transition period ends. While the measure was originally in the bill, it was removed after December\u2019s election victory for Boris Johnson, with the government insisting it would stick to the commitment but did not see the need to put it into a Brexit bill. \u201cThe government\u2019s policy is unchanged. Delivering on it will not require legislation,\u201d the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told MPs as he explained to the Commons why ministers opposed the amendment. \u201cPrimary legislation cannot deliver the best outcomes for these children as it cannot guarantee that we will reach an agreement.

Diplomatic sources have told the Guardian that Iranian and British officials have exchanged lists of humanitarian goods that could be bought for the UK for Iran, a development that suggests the proposal is under serious consideration. Iranian officials are said to be exploring the seriousness of the proposal. The UK contends it cannot simply offset the debt through a direct financial payment since the Iranian defence ministry, to which the debt is owed, is subject to EU sanctions. The precise amount of the debt also remains in dispute. The meeting in Downing Street between the two men on Thursday will be the first since Johnson became prime minister. As foreign secretary, Johnson was accused by Ratcliffe of worsening his wife\u2019s plight by wrongly stating she had been in Tehran at the time of her arrest to train journalists. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in a Tehran jail since her arrest in 2016 and she has been sentenced to five years in prison. Ratcliffe has warned that unless the British government takes proactive steps other dual nationals will be arrested and it is likely the Iranian authorities will lay further charges against her. It is acknowledged privately on both sides that there is a perceived connection between Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s arrest and the UK\u2019s failure to pay the debt that goes back to 1979. A further court of appeal hearing in London on Wednesday saw Iranian government lawyers urging the court to strike down a previous high court ruling that the UK need not pay interest on the debt for the period since EU sanctions were applied to the Iranian defence ministry in 2008. The interest is worth more than \u00a320m. Ratcliffe, seated in the public gallery, was placed one seat away from five Iranian officials monitoring the progress of the hearing. Ahead of his meeting with Johnson, he told the Guardian he would press the prime minister to reveal whether he had a defined strategy to secure her release, and to argue that waiting for the crisis in relations to subside would only make the volatility of the crisis worse. \u201cThe UK government simply doing nothing will have consequences,\u201d he warned.

The letter sent by solicitors acting for the groups says: \u201cOur clients are non-violent organisations focused on lawful protest and engagement to pursue their legitimate aims. \u201cTheir inclusion in a Counter Terrorism Policing document, and the inference that they are involved in unlawful activities, and the targeting of their members and/or activists for referral \u2026 plainly amount to an unlawful interference with the rights of their members and/or activists.\u201d The groups, via their solicitors Bindmans, say they want the guidance withdrawn and an apology issued.

A fortnight ago, police said they were recalling a separate document that listed Extinction Rebellion (XR), the climate emergency activist group, as extremist alongside banned far-right groups and an Islamist group linked to violence. On Wednesday, the security minister told parliament the government does not consider Extinction Rebellion to be an extremist organisation. Brandon Lewis was forced to clarify the government\u2019s stance on XR and a wide range of non-violent protest groups in response to an urgent question tabled in the House of Commons. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, who was granted the urgent question, said the move to list XR was a \u201cvery serious error of judgment\u201d, while the Conservative MP and former secretary of state, David Davis, accused the agencies of acting like \u201cthought police\u201d.

We also consider calling for the death of our armed forces either in the UK or overseas to be extremism.\u201d Both anti-terror documents revealed by the Guardian encouraged anyone with concerns identified by the content to consider a referral to Prevent or report suspicious activity through the Action Counter Terrorism anonymous online form.

      "body": "<p>You can find anything on the internet, and these days, that includes crocheted tampons. Yes, tampons made of yarn are <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/search?q=crochet%20tampons\">being sold on Etsy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/01/21/why-you-should-never-ever-use-crochet-tampons/#1b7232e421f9\">news outlets are having to run pieces advising</a> on why vaginal chunky-knits really don\u2019t need to be a look this winter.</p> <p>Crocheted tampons, just like most things made and sold in an unregulated market such as the internet, do not have to pass the same safety regulations that store-bought tampons have to pass. That means that we don\u2019t know whether they work, what\u2019s in them, or even how they should be cleaned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/11/why-are-virginity-tests-still-legal-across-america-hymen\">Why are virginity tests still legal across America in 2020?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Online, it seems that a buyer\u2019s good intentions (in this case, a desire to be more environmentally friendly, thrifty and less wasteful) can be easily exploited, because Google is the place where people with a lack of information go to find things. It\u2019s not just Google: anyone who doesn\u2019t live under a rock will have also noticed the endless stream of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/13/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-selling-a-candle-that-smells-like-her-vagina-goop\">vaginal eggs, candles and other nonsense coming out of Gwyneth Paltrow lately</a>. So as a service to you, we are correcting the record on some of the worst vaginal products out there.</p> <h2>Vagina tightening sticks</h2> <p>Vaginal tightening sticks can be bought in online stores such as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Vaginal-Tightening-Rejuvenation-Results-Weights/dp/B07CGB8HGX\">Amazon</a>, where you can also buy fake hymens \u2013 so basically, don\u2019t use Amazon.</p> <p>These sticks promise to give you the perfect \u201ctoned, narrow, tight vagina\u201d. That\u2019s right, in 2020, focusing on what\u2019s <em>inside</em> means goodbye toned abs, hello slender vagina. Which is why vagina <a href=\"https://www.kegelbell.com/\">weight-training is also now a thing</a>.</p> <p>Vaginas come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and the tightness of one\u2019s vagina has nothing to do with how much pleasure can be derived from it. If you really want to tighten your vagina, kegel exercises are free.</p> <h2>Weed</h2> <p>There is an array of weed products for the vagina that can be found on the internet, including but not limited to: weed tampons, weed lube and weed vibrators. <br><br>People often say that smoking weed can help people to relax and eases pain, heck, it can even be fun, apparently.</p> <p>But in news that will shock the whole internet: just because something is nice doesn\u2019t mean you have to put it in your vagina. While the compound CBD that is found in weed has been shown to help with some chronic pain, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/well/can-cbd-prevent-pelvic-pain.html\">this does not automatically translate to working</a> when put in the vagina. So please, stop.</p> <h2>Bleach</h2> <p>People order at-home creams, go into spas, and get laser treatment to lighten the skin around their vaginas. Needless to say, it\u2019s bad for you: bleaching your vaginal area can result in irritation, inflammation and infections like thrush and bacterial vaginosis.</p> <h2>Oak galls</h2> <p>In case you didn\u2019t know, oak galls are a little ball of bark created when a wasp deposits its larvae into an oak tree. Which leads to the natural question: why shouldn\u2019t I put that in my vagina?

      "bodyText": "You can find anything on the internet, and these days, that includes crocheted tampons. Yes, tampons made of yarn are being sold on Etsy, and news outlets are having to run pieces advising on why vaginal chunky-knits really don\u2019t need to be a look this winter. Crocheted tampons, just like most things made and sold in an unregulated market such as the internet, do not have to pass the same safety regulations that store-bought tampons have to pass. That means that we don\u2019t know whether they work, what\u2019s in them, or even how they should be cleaned. Online, it seems that a buyer\u2019s good intentions (in this case, a desire to be more environmentally friendly, thrifty and less wasteful) can be easily exploited, because Google is the place where people with a lack of information go to find things. It\u2019s not just Google: anyone who doesn\u2019t live under a rock will have also noticed the endless stream of vaginal eggs, candles and other nonsense coming out of Gwyneth Paltrow lately. So as a service to you, we are correcting the record on some of the worst vaginal products out there. Vagina tightening sticks Vaginal tightening sticks can be bought in online stores such as Amazon, where you can also buy fake hymens \u2013 so basically, don\u2019t use Amazon. These sticks promise to give you the perfect \u201ctoned, narrow, tight vagina\u201d. That\u2019s right, in 2020, focusing on what\u2019s inside means goodbye toned abs, hello slender vagina. Which is why vagina weight-training is also now a thing. Vaginas come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and the tightness of one\u2019s vagina has nothing to do with how much pleasure can be derived from it. If you really want to tighten your vagina, kegel exercises are free. Weed There is an array of weed products for the vagina that can be found on the internet, including but not limited to: weed tampons, weed lube and weed vibrators. People often say that smoking weed can help people to relax and eases pain, heck, it can even be fun, apparently. But in news that will shock the whole internet: just because something is nice doesn\u2019t mean you have to put it in your vagina. While the compound CBD that is found in weed has been shown to help with some chronic pain, this does not automatically translate to working when put in the vagina. So please, stop. Bleach People order at-home creams, go into spas, and get laser treatment to lighten the skin around their vaginas. Needless to say, it\u2019s bad for you: bleaching your vaginal area can result in irritation, inflammation and infections like thrush and bacterial vaginosis. Oak galls In case you didn\u2019t know, oak galls are a little ball of bark created when a wasp deposits its larvae into an oak tree. Which leads to the natural question: why shouldn\u2019t I put that in my vagina? Some con artists online have taken to convincing women to boil up oak gall into a paste and insert it, causing it to dry and tighten. According to gynecologist Dr Jen Gunter, drying out the vagina increases your chance of getting abrasions during sex, destroys the protective mucous layer in your vagina, and can cause havoc with its good bacteria. In a blogpost on oak galls, she writes: \u201cThis is a dangerous practice with real potential to harm. Here\u2019s a pro-tip, if something burns when you apply it to the vagina it is generally bad for the vagina.\u201d Not just that, but the idea that a dry, tight vagina is desirable is a frankly depressing sexual idea, and misinformation of the worst, most misogynistic kind. Douching products Most experts will tell you to avoid washing your vagina with soap, and yet there are rows of shelves in stores stacked with vaginal douching products. The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, and soap often disturbs its natural balance. \u201cVaginal pH is maintained by lactobacilli. Soaps, cleansers and douches will only hurt this bacteria, so they are all bad pH-wise,\u201d Gunter wrote in a recent New York Times piece. Not only that, this disruption can result in bacterial infections such as bacterial vaginosis. Among other things, bacterial vaginosis can result in an unpleasant smell \u2013 probably the last thing that someone buying a vaginal cleaning product is hoping for.",

The failed bid for Asda was so juddering for the company that it wasn\u2019t even mentioned in the soapy farewell messages. Reinvigoration tends to be easier under a new boss and, since Coupe has had almost six years at the helm, retiring in May to spend more time with his guitar should suit all parties. The chairman, Martin Scicluna, described Coupe as \u201cbold and ambitious on behalf of our shareholders\u201d, which came closest to a hint at the Asda debacle. It points to a defence of the \u00a37bn proposed deal as a punt worth taking. If the competition authorities could have been squared, runs the theory, Sainsbury\u2019s would have been sitting pretty as an equal rival to Tesco in the UK. It\u2019s a point of view, but the proposal struck many of us as grossly anti-competitive from day one. The authorities ultimately took the same line, so don\u2019t expect sympathy.

      "body": "<p>Rebecca Long-Bailey has said Labour must stop promising to save working-class voters and offer a more optimistic picture of the future, as she seeks to underline how her leadership would differ from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s.</p> \n<p>The shadow business secretary, who is widely assumed to be Corbyn\u2019s chosen successor, cited a couple she met while canvassing in her home seat of Salford who told her they thought Labour just offered handouts.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were working class but they\u2019d bought their own house, they\u2019d worked hard, they felt they should be rewarded for working hard, they didn\u2019t want to think that other people were getting handouts,\u201d she told the Guardian as the leadership race kicks off in earnest.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhatever people\u2019s incomes are, a lot of the time people don\u2019t see themselves as destitute and struggling, and they don\u2019t want someone to come along and say: \u2018I\u2019m going to remove the scales from your eyes, and save you from yourself\u2019. It\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ve got a job, I don\u2019t need saving from myself, I just want to do a little bit better, thanks!\u2019\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s that hopeful vision, rather than a vision that says we\u2019re going to save you,\u201d she adds, repeatedly using the word \u201caspirational\u201d to describe what Labour\u2019s message should be.</p> \n<p>Long-Bailey has struggled to shrug off the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d tag, after saying in an interview earlier in the campaign that she would award <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/07/rebecca-long-bailey-defends-corbyns-legacy-as-she-launches-labour-leadership-bid\">the outgoing leader a score of 10/10</a>, despite last month\u2019s crushing general election defeat.</p> \n<p>As well as promising to strike a more upbeat tone, Long-Bailey said she would lay more stress on national security than Corbyn.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy approach to things would be very different. For example, talking about security, I think it\u2019s important to make sure that people know that you\u2019re going to keep them safe. Now that\u2019s what Jeremy was going to do but sometimes that message didn\u2019t come across,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>And she promised to shake up the shadow cabinet, to ensure all strands of Labour tradition are represented, and end the factional in-fighting that dogged Corbyn\u2019s five years at the top of the party.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we do need to have that diversity, because we\u2019ve got some really experienced, amazing people right across the [parliamentary Labour party], as well as those who\u2019ve been in the shadow cabinet up to now and we\u2019ve got to have that good mix of talent in there.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a packed rally for Long-Bailey in a Hackney bar on Tuesday evening, some of the loudest applause came when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/03/momentum-calls-for-more-open-labour-selection-process\">she backed open selections for MPs</a> \u2013 with one enthusiastic audience member shouting, \u201cbanish the Blairites!\u201d</p> \n<p>Confronted with the comment, Long-Bailey insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of that \u2026 this goes right to the heart of what the party is supposed to be about, and this is what upsets me so much.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only way we ever win, is where we represent those elements of the centre-left. That\u2019s why we were created: to bring together all those left groups,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>Long-Bailey\u2019s anecdote about canvassing the aspirational couple in Salford was reminiscent of one told by Blair in his 1996 conference speech, when he said that while campaigning, he had met, \u201ca man polishing his Ford Sierra, a self-employed electrician,\u201d who had told him, \u201cas far as he was concerned, being better off meant being Tory too\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d63977e-7c74-49ae-9fe0-e262bc9c6b17\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kC3vgUBCl00?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Blair said: \u201cThat man polishing his car was clear: his instincts were to get on in life, and he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.\u201d</p> \n<p>Long-Bailey praised Labour\u2019s manifesto, which Ian Lavery \u2013 the Labour chair and one of her key supporters \u2013 called a \u201cbook of hope\u201d as he introduced her at the rally.</p> \n<p>But she said the party had failed to be clear enough about its message \u2013 and even its purpose. \u201cWhat does Labour stand for?

      "bodyText": "Rebecca Long-Bailey has said Labour must stop promising to save working-class voters and offer a more optimistic picture of the future, as she seeks to underline how her leadership would differ from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. The shadow business secretary, who is widely assumed to be Corbyn\u2019s chosen successor, cited a couple she met while canvassing in her home seat of Salford who told her they thought Labour just offered handouts. \u201cThey were working class but they\u2019d bought their own house, they\u2019d worked hard, they felt they should be rewarded for working hard, they didn\u2019t want to think that other people were getting handouts,\u201d she told the Guardian as the leadership race kicks off in earnest. \u201cWhatever people\u2019s incomes are, a lot of the time people don\u2019t see themselves as destitute and struggling, and they don\u2019t want someone to come along and say: \u2018I\u2019m going to remove the scales from your eyes, and save you from yourself\u2019. It\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ve got a job, I don\u2019t need saving from myself, I just want to do a little bit better, thanks!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s that hopeful vision, rather than a vision that says we\u2019re going to save you,\u201d she adds, repeatedly using the word \u201caspirational\u201d to describe what Labour\u2019s message should be. Long-Bailey has struggled to shrug off the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d tag, after saying in an interview earlier in the campaign that she would award the outgoing leader a score of 10/10, despite last month\u2019s crushing general election defeat. As well as promising to strike a more upbeat tone, Long-Bailey said she would lay more stress on national security than Corbyn. \u201cMy approach to things would be very different. For example, talking about security, I think it\u2019s important to make sure that people know that you\u2019re going to keep them safe. Now that\u2019s what Jeremy was going to do but sometimes that message didn\u2019t come across,\u201d she said. And she promised to shake up the shadow cabinet, to ensure all strands of Labour tradition are represented, and end the factional in-fighting that dogged Corbyn\u2019s five years at the top of the party. \u201cI think we do need to have that diversity, because we\u2019ve got some really experienced, amazing people right across the [parliamentary Labour party], as well as those who\u2019ve been in the shadow cabinet up to now and we\u2019ve got to have that good mix of talent in there.\u201d At a packed rally for Long-Bailey in a Hackney bar on Tuesday evening, some of the loudest applause came when she backed open selections for MPs \u2013 with one enthusiastic audience member shouting, \u201cbanish the Blairites!\u201d Confronted with the comment, Long-Bailey insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of that \u2026 this goes right to the heart of what the party is supposed to be about, and this is what upsets me so much. \u201cThe only way we ever win, is where we represent those elements of the centre-left. That\u2019s why we were created: to bring together all those left groups,\u201d she added. Long-Bailey\u2019s anecdote about canvassing the aspirational couple in Salford was reminiscent of one told by Blair in his 1996 conference speech, when he said that while campaigning, he had met, \u201ca man polishing his Ford Sierra, a self-employed electrician,\u201d who had told him, \u201cas far as he was concerned, being better off meant being Tory too\u201d. Blair said: \u201cThat man polishing his car was clear: his instincts were to get on in life, and he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.\u201d Long-Bailey praised Labour\u2019s manifesto, which Ian Lavery \u2013 the Labour chair and one of her key supporters \u2013 called a \u201cbook of hope\u201d as he introduced her at the rally. But she said the party had failed to be clear enough about its message \u2013 and even its purpose. \u201cWhat does Labour stand for? People said: \u2018I\u2019m not really sure\u2019. There were so many great policies but there was nothing to really pull them all together, and say \u2018look, this is what Labour will do \u2013 the end result will be this, it will be realising your aspirations,\u2019\u201d she said. By contrast, she said that Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d slogan \u201cwent through into people\u2019s psyches\u201d \u2013 so much so, that her own seven-year-old son had shouted it out in the supermarket during the campaign. That appeared to bode ill, if Long-Bailey wins, for the future of senior figures around Corbyn who were meant to be responsible for shaping Labour\u2019s message. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to have my own team,\u201d she stressed. \u201cOf course you want people who share your own political vision around you, but you also want to have people around you who are experienced, and are capable for the job in hand.\u201d She said she envisaged, \u201ca very robust press operation that develops our messaging and narrative,\u201d which \u201cwill be structurally different from what we see at the moment\u201d. Amid reports of chaotic organisation during the campaign, she added: \u201cI come from quite an efficient background, so I expect to see an office environment that\u2019s run efficiently.\u201d Before December\u2019s crushing defeat, it was widely assumed at Westminster that many Labour members would follow Corbyn\u2019s lead in choosing his successor. But early polls have suggested the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, is the frontrunner and he has won the support of two of the big five unions, including Unison and Usdaw. Lisa Nandy will also be on the ballot paper after receiving the backing of Chinese for Labour, following support from trade unions the GMB and NUM. Long-Bailey is also expected to secure the backing of Unite, Labour\u2019s largest donor, on Friday. She has generally been regarded by colleagues as one of the more self-effacing members of the shadow cabinet, but she says that following a period of reflection after the election defeat she had decided: \u201cI am the only person to do it.\u201d She adds: \u201cI\u2019ve always been a grafter in the background; and sometimes it\u2019s the grafter in the background that is the one with the ideas and the vision.\u201d Long-Bailey and her close friend Angela Rayner are supporting each other\u2019s campaigns: Rayner\u2019s for deputy leader. The pair share a flat when they are in London and Long-Bailey reveals that they first discussed running for the party leadership in a \u201cjokey\u201d conversation several months ago. \u201cAngela said, \u2018If it all goes tits up, you and me will have to sort it out you know: there\u2019s only me and you\u2019 and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t be stupid!\u2019 \u201cAnyway, fast forward to the election defeat, and we rang each other up and I said: \u2018You know that conversation we had, we probably should have a chat, because you\u2019re probably right\u201d.",

He also owns the Washington Post, the newspaper Saudi critic&nbsp;Jamal Khashoggi wrote for.&nbsp;In February last year, Bezos&nbsp;described an alleged extortion campaign by AMI, owner of the National Enquirer, which the previous month had published details of his extra-marital affair,&nbsp;including his private text messages. He said AMI had threatened to publish 'more of my text messages and photos' unless he ceased his investigation into how the National Enquirer obtained his messages.

The tabloid&nbsp;insisted it had not been 'instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or&nbsp;otherwise' and&nbsp;AMI briefed reporters the story came from a tip-off about the affair by the estranged brother of Bezos\u2019s girlfriend.&nbsp;A close friend of president Donald Trump, Pecker and AMI were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/12/national-enquirer-trump-payments-david-pecker-catch-and-kill\">implicated in the so-called 'catch and kill'</a>&nbsp;scandal&nbsp;that the tabloid bought the exclusive rights to negative stories about Trump during the 2015 presidential election and then buried them.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Agn\u00e8s Callamard</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;UN special rapporteur who found&nbsp;Khashoggi was the victim of a 'deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international human rights law'. On Tuesday, she was due to release a statement into the alleged hacking of Bezos's phone.&nbsp;Callamard&nbsp;confirmed to the Guardian she was still pursuing 'several leads' into the murder, but declined to comment on the alleged Bezos link.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>An annexe to their report provided further details of an alleged incident in November 2018 when a single photograph was texted to Bezos from the crown prince\u2019s WhatsApp account \u201calong with a sardonic caption\u201d. The image, according to the UN rapporteurs, was of \u201ca woman resembling the woman with whom Bezos is having an affair, months before the Bezos affair was known publicly\u201d.</p> \n<p>Two months later, in January 2019, the National Enquirer published a special edition that exposed the affair. AMI, which owns the US supermarket tabloid, has denied any \u201cthird party\u201d was involved in influencing its reporting.</p> \n<p>In a day of dramatic developments that threatened to deepen the crisis for Saudi Arabia, the UN rapporteurs:</p> \n<p>\u2022 Released details of advanced technical analysis that established \u201cgrounds for a reasonable belief\u201d that Bezos was the victim of \u201cintrusive surveillance via hacking of his phone as a result of actions attributable to the WhatsApp account used by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Said Bezos\u2019s iPhone was believed to have been infected by malware on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from the crown prince. Within hours of receipt of the MP4 video file, a huge \u201cexfiltration\u201d of data began. The amount of data leaving the phone increased enormously and continued undetected for several months.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Alleged that the \u201cmost likely explanation\u201d for the huge amount of data exiting the phone was that it had been infiltrated by spyware such as that developed by NSO Group, a private Israeli surveillance company. The assessment was attributed to \u201cexpert analysis of likelihood of cyberweapons\u201d. NSO immediately denied involvement, saying: \u201cWe can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Issued a stark warning to prominent attendees of the World Economic Forum at Davos, several of whom are known to have recently met with the crown prince. Callamard said she wanted to \u201craise the alarm\u201d for people around the world who have had dealings with Saudi Arabia about the \u201cfragility of their electronic systems\u201d.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian about the Davos agenda, Callamard said: \u201cI am disappointed the organisers did not put any emphasis on the question of surveillance on their agenda.\u201d She added: \u201cThey are all extremely vulnerable.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said the revelation that the future king of Saudi Arabia might have had a personal involvement in the targeting of the billionaire owner of the Washington Post should put a renewed spotlight on the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Khashoggi</a>, a Washington Post journalist, was killed in October 2018, five months after the alleged \u201chack\u201d of Bezos\u2019s iPhone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"442a997b-5d5a-4ea6-b4f7-5941e95a04be\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(June 21, 2017)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS, becomes crown prince of Saudi Arabia, designated heir to the king.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(July 17, 2017)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Donald Trump hosts a private White House dinner for a western adviser to MBS and&nbsp;David Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc (AMI), which&nbsp;publishes the National Enquirer.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(September 28, 2017)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mohammed bin Salman meets with David Pecker and the western adviser to the crown prince, in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(September 22, 2017)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mohammed bin Salman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman.html\">reportedly tells a top aide</a>&nbsp;he wants to use a 'bullet' on Jamal Khashoggi, who is writing critical columns in the Washington Post.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(March 19, 2018)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mohammed bin Salman arrives in the US for a tour to boost Saudi Arabia's reputation with America's most senior VIPs, business leaders and government officials.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(March 20, 2018)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump hosts Mohammed bin Salman at a meeting in the White House, where the US president calls them 'good friends'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(March 26, 2018)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>AMI publishes nearly-100-page glossy magazine praising Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin Salman.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(April 4, 2018)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Mohammed bin Salman is guest of honour at Hollywood dinner.

      "bodyText": "UN experts are demanding an immediate investigation by the US into evidence indicating that Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Washington Post, was hacked with spyware deployed in a WhatsApp message sent from the personal account of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The special rapporteurs \u2013 Agn\u00e8s Callamard and David Kaye \u2013 said in a joint statement they were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by evidence they had reviewed about the apparent surveillance of Bezos in what they described as a possible \u201ceffort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post\u2019s reporting on Saudi Arabia\u201d. The statement was released after the Guardian revealed on Tuesday that Bezos, who is chief executive of Amazon and the world\u2019s richest man, appeared to have had his mobile phone \u201chacked\u201d in 2018 after receiving a message apparently sent from the personal WhatsApp account of Prince Mohammed. In one of the most extraordinary disclosures, the UN rapporteurs said that, according to forensic analysis, the \u201ccrown prince sent WhatsApp messages\u201d to Bezos, in November 2018 and February 2019, \u201cin which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos\u2019 personal life that was not available from public sources\u201d. An annexe to their report provided further details of an alleged incident in November 2018 when a single photograph was texted to Bezos from the crown prince\u2019s WhatsApp account \u201calong with a sardonic caption\u201d. The image, according to the UN rapporteurs, was of \u201ca woman resembling the woman with whom Bezos is having an affair, months before the Bezos affair was known publicly\u201d. Two months later, in January 2019, the National Enquirer published a special edition that exposed the affair. AMI, which owns the US supermarket tabloid, has denied any \u201cthird party\u201d was involved in influencing its reporting. In a day of dramatic developments that threatened to deepen the crisis for Saudi Arabia, the UN rapporteurs: \u2022 Released details of advanced technical analysis that established \u201cgrounds for a reasonable belief\u201d that Bezos was the victim of \u201cintrusive surveillance via hacking of his phone as a result of actions attributable to the WhatsApp account used by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u201d. \u2022 Said Bezos\u2019s iPhone was believed to have been infected by malware on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from the crown prince. Within hours of receipt of the MP4 video file, a huge \u201cexfiltration\u201d of data began. The amount of data leaving the phone increased enormously and continued undetected for several months. \u2022 Alleged that the \u201cmost likely explanation\u201d for the huge amount of data exiting the phone was that it had been infiltrated by spyware such as that developed by NSO Group, a private Israeli surveillance company. The assessment was attributed to \u201cexpert analysis of likelihood of cyberweapons\u201d. NSO immediately denied involvement, saying: \u201cWe can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance.\u201d \u2022 Issued a stark warning to prominent attendees of the World Economic Forum at Davos, several of whom are known to have recently met with the crown prince. Callamard said she wanted to \u201craise the alarm\u201d for people around the world who have had dealings with Saudi Arabia about the \u201cfragility of their electronic systems\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian about the Davos agenda, Callamard said: \u201cI am disappointed the organisers did not put any emphasis on the question of surveillance on their agenda.\u201d She added: \u201cThey are all extremely vulnerable.\u201d She said the revelation that the future king of Saudi Arabia might have had a personal involvement in the targeting of the billionaire owner of the Washington Post should put a renewed spotlight on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist, was killed in October 2018, five months after the alleged \u201chack\u201d of Bezos\u2019s iPhone. Callamard is UN special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and the author of a previous report that detailed credible evidence for Saudi Arabia\u2019s involvement in the premeditated murder of Khashoggi in its consulate in Istanbul. The crown prince denies any involvement in the killing. Callamard said she had previously stopped short of making determinations about the precise nature of Prince Mohammed\u2019s involvement in the Khashoggi murder. But the latest information, if correct, placed \u201cthe crown prince at the heart of a campaign of surveillance and hacking\u201d, she said. Prior to the release of the UN statement on the suspected hacking, Saudi Arabia had dismissed the Guardian\u2019s reports about the apparent involvement of the kingdom\u2019s heir as \u201cabsurd\u201d. The kingdom\u2019s embassy in Washington said: \u201cWe call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out.\u201d Callamard and Kaye, who is the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, also provided more information about the apparent nature of the surveillance of Bezos\u2019s iPhone, saying technical experts had assessed with \u201cmedium to high confidence\u201d that it was infiltrated via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account used by the crown prince. According to a detailed timeline provided by the UN rapporteurs, Bezos met with Prince Mohammed at a \u201csmall dinner\u201d in Los Angeles on 4 April 2018. The pair exchanged phone numbers \u201cthat correspond to their WhatsApp accounts\u201d, the UN experts said. Weeks later, on 1 May, a message was sent from the crown prince\u2019s WhatsApp account to Bezos, the UN explained. \u201cThe message is an encrypted video file,\u201d the UN timeline states. \u201cIt is later established, with reasonable certainty, that the video\u2019s downloader infects Mr Bezos\u2019 phone with malicious code.\u201d Within hours of receipt of the malicious file, the technical analysis indicated a \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d exfiltration of data from the billionaire\u2019s phone which continued for several more months. In their statement, the UN rapporteurs said: \u201cThe circumstances and timing of the hacking and surveillance of Bezos also strengthen support for further investigation by US and other relevant authorities of the allegations that the crown prince ordered, incited, or, at a minimum, was aware of planning for but failed to stop the mission that fatally targeted Mr Khashoggi in Istanbul. \u201cAt a time when Saudi Arabia was supposedly investigating the killing of Mr Khashoggi, and prosecuting those it deemed responsible, it was clandestinely waging a massive online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post.\u201d WhatsApp is currently suing NSO.

In a statement released on Wednesday the company said it was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the report of the hacking of Bezos\u2019s phone but insisted \u201cour technology was not used\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A CIA contract psychologist who helped draft the US programme of \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d of suspected terrorists has told a military tribunal he was unable to stop cases of \u201cabusive drift\u201d by an unnamed senior agency official. Giving evidence at a military commission on Guant\u00e1namo Bay, James Mitchell gave a detailed account of the 2002 decision to interrogate suspected al-Qaida leaders using waterboarding and other techniques which the US later admitted constituted torture. On Wednesday, the court was also showed cables from August 2002 between a CIA black site in Thailand and the agency headquarters outside Washington, in which Mitchell and his colleague said they wanted to stop waterboarding an al-Qaida suspect, Abu Zubaydah, because he was being cooperative and it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d he would produce more intelligence. The CIA staff at the site also said in a 10 August memo that the physical pressure applied on Abu Zubaydah until then \u201capproaches the legal limit\u201d and that his health was \u201clikely to deteriorate to unacceptable levels\u201d. But the next day, CIA headquarters replied, telling the interrogators to \u201cstay the course\u201d. \u201cThey said we were pussies, that we had lost our spine,\u201d Mitchell said, who claimed he threatened to quit. But Abu Zubaydah was subjected to further waterboarding the same month, at a demonstration for CIA officials, despite the prisoner having \u201cinvoluntary stomach and leg spasms\u201d and he was \u201cdistressed to the level that he was unable to effectively communicate or engage with the team\u201d, according to an August 2002 memo. At this week\u2019s 40th pre-trial hearing of the 9/11 case in a specially built courtroom at the US naval base, Mitchell was watched with close attention by the five defendants. On the front row closest to the witness box was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 2001 commercial plane attacks on New York and Washington, who was waterboarded 183 times. In testimony which veered from the gruff to jokey to tearful, Mitchell said the methods he had recommended were based on a course given to US armed services to help them withstand enemy interrogation, known as Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (Sere). The measures, which included slamming detainees repeatedly against a wooden wall, cramming them in a small box sometimes with insects, and waterboarding, simulated drowning, had been approved by the justice department in July 2002 under the George W Bush administration. Mitchell claimed those measures were within the limits of what was legal, and were designed to force detainees to give up information rapidly that could help prevent a further attack, possibly involving a nuclear weapon. \u201cThe CIA was never interested in prosecution,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were going to go right up to the line of what was legal, put their toes on it, and lean forward.\u201d However, within the official limits, Mitchell and up to two others subjected Abu Zubaydah to waterboarding 83 times and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times. Mitchell, his friend and future business partner, Bruce Jessen, and a veteran CIA officer known as the Preacher, were permitted to carry out waterboarding. As a private contractor working abroad, Mitchell was paid $1,800 a day. He told the court that when he was recruited by the CIA in 2002 to first observe and then apply coercive measures, said the agency was determined to \u201cget tough\u201d and he wanted to make sure it was done within limits. \u201cWhat I was told was: \u2018The gloves were off\u2019,\u201d Mitchell, now aged 68, a tall, thin man with a trimmed white beard, dressed in a charcoal suit and red tie. \u201cThey were going to use some form of physical coercion \u2026 My concern was that they were going to make it up on the fly.\u201d Mitchell has accused other CIA interrogators of using waterboarding far in excess of guidelines as well as other unauthorised interrogation techniques. In court on Tuesday he described these excesses as \u201cabusive drift\u201d. \u201cWhen people are left to make up coercive measures, it tends to escalate over time,\u201d Mitchell said. He said he had tried to stop several interrogations that had got out of hand, in particular by the head of interrogations of the CIA\u2019s newly formed rendition, detention and interrogation group, an unnamed officer he referred to by the nickname, the \u201cnew sheriff\u201d. The head of interrogations has elsewhere been identified as Charlie Wise, who died of a heart attack soon after retiring in 2003. Before he left the CIA, Wise had a similarly dim view of what was going on, describing the interrogation programme as a train wreck \u201cwaiting to happen\u201d. \u201cI intend to get the hell off the train before it happens,\u201d Wise said in a declassified CIA memo. In his evidence on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Tennessee-born Mitchell gave his version of events in a strong southern accent, pointing out he had voluntarily flown to Guant\u00e1namo Bay to give evidence. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you,\u201d he told James Connell, the defence lawyer questioning him on Tuesday. \u201cI did it for the victims and families\u201d of the 9/11 attacks. On entering the plain square courtroom lined with military police guards, Mitchell appeared to make eye contact with Mohammed who he had subjected to multiple waterboarding sessions and with whom he claimed to have had long discussions about Islam. Mohammed came to court in his customary outfit of a camouflage jacket over a white robe and a woollen Afghan cap. His dyed orange beard provided the brightest colour in the courtroom. His fellow defendants, Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi, sat in successive rows behind him, each with their own bench of lawyers. The pre-trial hearing have been underway since May 2012 and the trial itself is not expected to start until 2021 at the earliest. Mitchell described how he was called to the CIA\u2019s counter-terrorism centre in early April 2002 to attend a meeting where it was announced that a leading al-Qaida suspect, Abu Zubaydah, had been captured in Pakistan. Mitchell, who had previously worked as a psychologist for the US air force was told to get on a flight the same night to a secret CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in what was called \u201clocation 3\u201d, now widely believed to be Thailand. He was initially asked to observe Abu Zubaydah\u2019s interrogation by CIA officers and FBI agents and make suggestions. But when he returned to CIA headquarters at the beginning of July, he was asked to carry out the \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogations himself. He said he was highly reluctant but there was a prevalent fear of an imminent second wave of attacks, possibly including a nuclear weapon. Choking his words and tearing up as he defended his actions, he told the court: \u201cI felt my moral obligation to protect American lives outweighed the temporary discomfort of terrorists who had taken up arms against America.\u201d",

Business people may look again at their balance sheets in light of the Guardian\u2019s revelation that an investigation found the Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone hacked after receiving a WhatsApp message apparently sent from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\u2019s account. For a long time, the kingdom\u2019s piles of cash and strategic importance ensured that commercial and diplomatic partners played down its catastrophic role in the war in Yemen \u2013 spearheaded by Mohammed bin Salman himself \u2013 and human rights abuses including the arrest and alleged torture of women\u2019s rights activists. Then, in October 2018, Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Within minutes, the journalist was dead. After unconvincing denials that he had been murdered, Riyadh described his killing as an unplanned rogue operation, later sentencing a number of lower-level officials to death. Suddenly people felt the need to put some distance between themselves and the kingdom, pulling out of the grand investment summit overseen by the crown prince.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the things we\u2019re doing that has already been announced is we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody, so that will disproportionately benefit, of course, people on lower incomes. And that\u2019s the way we should do it. Where you have the ability to cut taxes, I want to do it to help working people on lower incomes.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is not true. This is what the<strong> Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> said <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/election/2019/article/conservative-manifesto-an-initial-reaction-from-ifs-researchers\">in an analysis it published during the election campaign</a> covering the proposed Tory national insurance cut. It said (bold type added by me):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Conservatives propose to raise the point at which employees and the self-employed pay NICs to \u00a39,500 in 2020\u201321. This compares to the currently planned level of \u00a38,788. The reform would cost a little over \u00a32 billion a year and would mean that, at any point in time, around 430,000 fewer people would pay NICs, and those still paying it would be paying \u00a385 per year less. (Liability would be \u00a3104 lower than this year, as highlighted in some of the Conservatives\u2019 pronouncements, but \u00a319 of that reduction would have happened anyway because of the normal uprating of the threshold with inflation.)</p> <p>16 million households would gain by \u00a3120 a year on average, since many households have more than one earner.</p> <p>Cutting NICs is about as well targeted as a direct tax cut can be on low earners. On the other hand the biggest average gains still go to the middle and upper-middle of the household income distribution. Only 8% of the giveaway goes to the lowest-income fifth of working households. That number would be 64% if the same money were allocated to increasing work allowances in universal credit \u2013 though that would come at the cost of bringing many more families into means-testing.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is the IFS chart showing the distributional impact of Johnson\u2019s tax plan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b133fb7636c81f8309fdc203af06b8823f014adf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b133fb7636c81f8309fdc203af06b8823f014adf/0_0_760_438/500.jpg\" alt=\"Distributional impact of PM\u2019s planned cut in national insurance\" width=\"500\" height=\"288\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distributional impact of PM\u2019s planned cut in national insurance</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2886cb8f0879d539efd192\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-22T17:44:29.422Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Long-Bailey discovers her own version of Blair's 'Mondeo man'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey</strong>, the Labour leadership candidate, has given a lengthy interview to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Long-Bailey is seen as the Corbynite candidate in the contest (although she is trying to play down the idea that she would be continuity Corbyn - see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/22/labour-leadership-pmqs-johnson-corbyn-nandy-criticises-blairbrown-governments-for-keeping-elements-of-thatcherism-live-news?page=with:block-5e2828728f0879d539efcc61#block-5e2828728f0879d539efcc61\">11.02am)</a>, but she has also talked about aspiration and at one point she ended up sounding uncannily like Tony Blair.</p> <p>It came when she was talking about why she thought Labour should have done more at the election to tell people that it wanted to help them improve their lives. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One example that I\u2019ll give of how I was crushed in the election campaign was one of my constituents was on a driveway and we were having a chat about whether she was going to vote Labour - her and her husband - and they worked hard, they bought their own home. </p> <p>And they wanted to have that recognised and they felt that we were a party that was giving handouts and not helping people like them. </p> <p>And I tried to explain, because I was crushed at that point, because I thought we are the party that\u2019s for you, we\u2019re there to pick you up if you fall on hard times and you lose your job. We want you to do well, we want you to work hard and get paid well and have a decent life, be able to buy your own home, if that\u2019s what you want, be able to go on holiday, and for your children to be given the best possible education so that they can climb whatever ladder they want to, and reach their aspirational goals. </p> <p>But they didn\u2019t believe we were doing that, despite that being the fundamental principles that drives every single one of us as Labour party members.</p> </blockquote> <p>Does that sound familiar? In 1996, <a href=\"http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=202\">in his last speech to Labour conference</a> before the election that made him prime minister, Blair said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can vividly recall the exact moment that I knew the last election was lost. I was canvassing in the Midlands on an ordinary suburban estate. I met a man polishing his Ford Sierra, self-employed electrician, Dad always voted Labour. He used to vote Labour, he said, but he bought his own home, he had set up his own business, he was doing quite nicely, so he said I\u2019ve become a Tory. He was not rich but he was doing better than he did, and as far as he was concerned, being better off meant being Tory too.</p> <p>In that moment the basis of our failure - the reason why a whole generation has grown up under the Tories - became plain to me. You see, people judge us on their instincts about what they believe our instincts to be. And that man polishing his car was clear: his instincts were to get on in life, and he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even though Blair did not use the phrase, that 1992 voter became known as \u201cMondeo man\u201d and finding a message, and polices, that appealed to Mondeo man became key to New Labour\u2019s success. It sounds as if Long-Bailey has met him too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2ed9d656910078348ad57c29a9d6bd3d3788dd3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2ed9d656910078348ad57c29a9d6bd3d3788dd3/0_94_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Long-Bailey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Long-Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2884d08f0879d539efd173\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-22T17:23:14.042Z\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is this week\u2019s Guardian Politics Weekly podcast.

He said: \u201cThey should be cautious about ditching the \u00a330,000 threshold.

It is not clear yet whether Purnell is a candidate to succeed Hall.</p> <p>And what is more, [Dominic] Cummings and his colleagues are actively searching for possible director general candidates they regard as sympathetic to their aims for the corporation.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is not unusual for governments, or anyone else in politics, to brief on an unattributable basis, but since Boris Johnson became PM there has been an increase in the number of unattributable briefings coming out of No 10, often involving threats to Johnson\u2019s opponents. Quite often what is being threatened never actually happens. For example, we were told that Johnson would do anything to avoid having to request a Brexit extension from the EU in the autumn, but in the end he meekly complied with the legislation saying he had to.</p> <p>That might mean that the threat was bogus in the first place.

It did not matter very much, because his MPs were hugely supportive, and the nation as a whole, like the Commons, is not paying much attention to Jeremy Corbyn at the moment, but under a different Labour leader the prime minister\u2019s glib complacency and lack of attention to detail when supposed to be defending the record of his government could - in fact, should - become a liability.</p> <p>Corbyn started by asking about the way bonuses are clawed back for people on universal credit, prompted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/13/bonus-blow-for-greggs-staff-prompts-call-for-benefit-and-tax-rethink\">the story about this happening to Greggs staff.</a> Johnson clearly did not have a clue what Corbyn was talking about, but he would not say so, and instead blamed Corbyn for the way he framed the question. When Corbyn used his second question to explain, Johnson still failed to address the point. Then Corbyn branched out and asked various questions about universal credit, and poverty generally. It is hard to imagine Theresa May not having an answer about Greggs in her folder somewhere (she was never brilliant at PMQs, but she was always prepared), and when asked about UC, she was able to engage in discussion about the detail. Johnson was reduced to firing out headline bullet points about the government\u2019s record on employment and poverty. He had a reasonably good joke up his sleeve about Tory MPs being happy to endorse Corbyn as the best Labour leader, but overall he was very poor, and only lifted by the fact that Tory MPs are still willing to cheer him unconditionally.</p> <p>At some point Conservative backbenchers will start to assert their independence. But there is not much evidence of that yet, and some of the sycophancy on display this afternoon (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/22/labour-leadership-pmqs-johnson-corbyn-nandy-criticises-blairbrown-governments-for-keeping-elements-of-thatcherism-live-news?page=with:block-5e2839758f0879d539efcd2f#block-5e2839758f0879d539efcd2f\">12.02pm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/22/labour-leadership-pmqs-johnson-corbyn-nandy-criticises-blairbrown-governments-for-keeping-elements-of-thatcherism-live-news?page=with:block-5e283d8a8f0879d539efcd66#block-5e283d8a8f0879d539efcd66\">12.19pm)</a> was gruesome.</p> <p>One other point was interesting. Immediately after the general election, Johnson was keen to assert that he was leading a brand new government.

Some of the arguments in the speech were ones she deployed in her Today interview this morning. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/22/labour-leadership-pmqs-johnson-corbyn-nandy-criticises-blairbrown-governments-for-keeping-elements-of-thatcherism-live-news?page=with:block-5e281a468f0879d539efcbd6#block-5e281a468f0879d539efcbd6\"> 10.26am.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Nandy said Labour should be making the case for tax as a public good.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to change the debate. Tax is not an evil. Tax is how we contribute to something bigger, better than ourselves. When we labelled one of the cruellest reforms \u201cthe Bedroom Tax\u201d it caught the public\u2019s imagination. But we reinforced the idea that tax is bad. We won the battle, but lost the war. To win the argument, tax must first be based on principles of fairness \u2013 every time a company avoids corporation tax, or we allow a cut to the well-off at the expense of those in greater need, we chip away at the system and people\u2019s trust in it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that employers who do not pay the living wage should be penalised.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, the position couldn\u2019t be starker. Insecure, zero-hours contracts and too many employers who don\u2019t pay their taxes or pay their staff a living wage. Which is why, for big employers who turn a profit and don\u2019t pay the living wage, we should ensure they settle their balance with DWP every year, before we consider anything else. Equally, we should champion those employers who pay their taxes, invest in their staff and engage meaningfully in their community. This is not just about financial sustainability. It\u2019s about making your contribution.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the cuts to universal credit should be reversed.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It cannot be right that the poorest can find themselves paying the highest marginal effective rate of tax \u2013 that baker\u2019s bonuses are taxed more than bankers. The root is universal credit, and the cuts made in 2012. I would immediately reverse these, paid for by cancelling the Tories proposed changes to the NICS threshold, while we design a progressive tax system that works for the least well off.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cancelling <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14591\">the Tory proposal to raise the national insurance threshold to \u00a39,500 </a>(an effective tax cut) would save about \u00a32bn. But this not would be be enough to restore all the cuts to benefits announced by the coalition. <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7541\">One IFS analysis said those cuts were worth \u00a316.7bn.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Labour should create a \u201cmodern, empowering welfare state for the 21st century\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She criticised the way the welfare state currently works, saying it \u201cpresumes the very worst of people in need\u201d.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The narrative on social security is so well established, we barely question it. It presumes the very worst of people in need, before they even walk through the door or pick up the phone. And for all our pride in the professionals who do their best, often butting against the system they work within, the phrase frontline professionals suggests those tasked with helping are at war with those they support. It reinforces everything that is wrong. The demonisation of people at the most difficult times in their lives.The idea we are problems to be dealt with, not incredible human beings with potential to be realised.</p> <p>This all serves to pit people against one another, to corrode the sense of common purpose and allow the system to be dismantled bit by bit. But it takes all the wrong cues from the British public. We believe they want draconian welfare rules, when in fact they want the worst off to be cared for. Our job is to convince people it isn\u2019t a zero-sum game.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said everyone accessing a public service should have access to personal help.</strong> She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Never again should we lose sight of the human being in front of us. Managing the conflicting, messy, complex, disastrous bureaucracy is bad enough for those who work in the the system. For those who need it, it is often as much the problem as the reason they sought help in the first place. Every single person accessing a public service should be given the right to have one person who gets them to where they need to go. It\u2019s based on a simple but radical idea: that services should be built around people, not the other way round.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3a494f85f7759f9ba6e4490528a27db08343a62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3a494f85f7759f9ba6e4490528a27db08343a62/0_74_5057_3034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Nandy giving a speech at Centrepoint this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Nandy giving a speech at Centrepoint this morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-22T14:34:40.328Z\">at 2.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2828728f0879d539efcc61\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-22T11:02:48.471Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey</strong>, another Labour leadership candidate, has given <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labours-rebecca-long-bailey-says-21330820\">a substantial interview to the Daily Mirror </a>this morning.

It\u2019s about saying to an 18 year-old Rebecca that the Labour party will make sure you fulfill your dreams and that your childrens\u2019 lives would be better than yours.</p> <p>No matter your postcode, no matter where you work, you will be guaranteed that better quality of life. And we didn\u2019t say that in this election. That message really didn\u2019t cut through.</p> <p>That drew many people to the conclusion that we were there to provide handouts rather than to fulfil people\u2019s needs for aspiration.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She rejected claims that she was not tough enough to be Labour leader. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m from Salford, no-one messes with me.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She rejected claims she was shy. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not shy, I was too busy working.

She said that she had known him since she was 21, that she \u201cprofoundly disagreed\u201d with him on some things, but that agreed with him on the need for society to be more compassionate. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the issue of whether we\u2019re a more compassionate society, and whether Labour needs to be clearer about that, I couldn\u2019t agree with more.</p> </blockquote> <p>Robinson\u2019s question was prompted by <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/01/21/five-more-things-we-discovered-about-labour-member\">YouGov polling this week </a>that suggests Corbyn is the most popular Labour leader of the last 100 years amongst Labour members. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66cb891a081661e891ebc9db6860335ae9e525a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66cb891a081661e891ebc9db6860335ae9e525a1/0_0_658_601/500.jpg\" alt=\"Polling of Labour members\" width=\"500\" height=\"457\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling of Labour members</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polling of Labour members/YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>She claimed that Labour need to be more ambitious in its goals. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I\u2019m saying today is that we need to go out and recover our ambition; we don\u2019t just tinker at the edges of the systems that we have, we need to get on the front foot and think about what the future of the welfare state will look like, what the future of this country will look like.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a surprising claim because the one criticism that could not be levelled against Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto was lack of ambition. When this point was put to Nandy, she said the problem was that the manifesto promised so much that people did not trust the party to deliver.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Labour had become too paternalistic and that it needed to promote a welfare system that empowered people. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So it\u2019s not just a question of do we raise universal credit rates. It\u2019s a question of do we overhaul the entire system so that it genuinely empowers people. That\u2019s something that Labour used to believe in. When the Beveridge report was published, when the welfare state was founded, we used to believe that our job was to empower people to change their own lives.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s EU (withdrawal agreement) bill has now cleared parliament. MPs voted this afternoon to remove the five amendments to the bill made when it was in the House of Lords, and peers have just voted to accept these changes. They did not try for a second time to insist on any of their amendments, mindful that the government won every vote with a large majority. This is the legislation that will implement the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the UK and the EU. Theresa May\u2019s failure to get this deal through parliament led to her resignation, and Boris Johnson was only able to get it onto the statute book after performing a significant U-turn on Ireland (effectively, he has now accepted a customs border down the Irish Sea) and fighting a general election. The bill will get royal assent before the end of the week, paving the way for the UK to leave the EU next Friday, after nearly half a century of membership. Lisa Nandy has become the second candidate to make it on to the final ballot in the Labour leadership contest, after picking up a nomination from Chinese for Labour, on top of the endorsements she has already received from the NUM and GMB unions. Nandy has defended the Duchess of Sussex against Piers Morgan\u2019s claims that she has not suffered racism, asking the TV presenter \u201chow on earth\u201d he would know about the prejudice experienced by people of colour. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has insisted that the UK will go ahead with plans for a tax on giant tech companies this spring despite intensifying pressure from the US to drop the idea. Boris Johnson\u2019s new post-Brexit immigration regime is likely to mean an end to the controversial \u00a330,000 salary floor for skilled workers, government sources have confirmed. Nicola Sturgeon has said it is \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d to focus purely on growth as the measure of a nation\u2019s success, arguing: \u201cSome of the measures that create that growth in the short term are doing lasting and arguably irreversible damage to our planet in the longer term.\u201d The government does not consider Extinction Rebellion to be an extremist organisation, the security minister has said, after counter-terrorism documents featuring the climate emergency activists were revealed in the Guardian. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Peers have now voted to accept the Commons\u2019 changes to the bill. That means that the bill has cleared parliament. It will get royal assent, and become law, very soon. In the House of Lords peers are currently debating the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill again, and the government\u2019s decision to reject all five amendments to the bill passed when it was in the Lords. Peers are expressing disappointment about the government\u2019s decision, and particularly its refusal to accept the Dubs amendment offering a safeguard for unaccompanied child refugees, but they are not planning to pass new amendments to try to get the government to think again. Earlier Lord Dubs posted this on Twitter. In his \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook Boris Johnson falsely claimed that the proposed cut in national insurance contributions would disproportionately benefit people on lower incomes. He said: One of the things we\u2019re doing that has already been announced is we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody, so that will disproportionately benefit, of course, people on lower incomes. And that\u2019s the way we should do it. Where you have the ability to cut taxes, I want to do it to help working people on lower incomes. This is not true. This is what the Institute for Fiscal Studies said in an analysis it published during the election campaign covering the proposed Tory national insurance cut. It said (bold type added by me): The Conservatives propose to raise the point at which employees and the self-employed pay NICs to \u00a39,500 in 2020\u201321. This compares to the currently planned level of \u00a38,788. The reform would cost a little over \u00a32 billion a year and would mean that, at any point in time, around 430,000 fewer people would pay NICs, and those still paying it would be paying \u00a385 per year less. (Liability would be \u00a3104 lower than this year, as highlighted in some of the Conservatives\u2019 pronouncements, but \u00a319 of that reduction would have happened anyway because of the normal uprating of the threshold with inflation.) 16 million households would gain by \u00a3120 a year on average, since many households have more than one earner. Cutting NICs is about as well targeted as a direct tax cut can be on low earners. On the other hand the biggest average gains still go to the middle and upper-middle of the household income distribution. Only 8% of the giveaway goes to the lowest-income fifth of working households. That number would be 64% if the same money were allocated to increasing work allowances in universal credit \u2013 though that would come at the cost of bringing many more families into means-testing. And here is the IFS chart showing the distributional impact of Johnson\u2019s tax plan. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate, has given a lengthy interview to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Long-Bailey is seen as the Corbynite candidate in the contest (although she is trying to play down the idea that she would be continuity Corbyn - see 11.02am), but she has also talked about aspiration and at one point she ended up sounding uncannily like Tony Blair. It came when she was talking about why she thought Labour should have done more at the election to tell people that it wanted to help them improve their lives. She said: One example that I\u2019ll give of how I was crushed in the election campaign was one of my constituents was on a driveway and we were having a chat about whether she was going to vote Labour - her and her husband - and they worked hard, they bought their own home. And they wanted to have that recognised and they felt that we were a party that was giving handouts and not helping people like them. And I tried to explain, because I was crushed at that point, because I thought we are the party that\u2019s for you, we\u2019re there to pick you up if you fall on hard times and you lose your job. We want you to do well, we want you to work hard and get paid well and have a decent life, be able to buy your own home, if that\u2019s what you want, be able to go on holiday, and for your children to be given the best possible education so that they can climb whatever ladder they want to, and reach their aspirational goals. But they didn\u2019t believe we were doing that, despite that being the fundamental principles that drives every single one of us as Labour party members. Does that sound familiar? In 1996, in his last speech to Labour conference before the election that made him prime minister, Blair said: I can vividly recall the exact moment that I knew the last election was lost. I was canvassing in the Midlands on an ordinary suburban estate. I met a man polishing his Ford Sierra, self-employed electrician, Dad always voted Labour. He used to vote Labour, he said, but he bought his own home, he had set up his own business, he was doing quite nicely, so he said I\u2019ve become a Tory. He was not rich but he was doing better than he did, and as far as he was concerned, being better off meant being Tory too. In that moment the basis of our failure - the reason why a whole generation has grown up under the Tories - became plain to me. You see, people judge us on their instincts about what they believe our instincts to be. And that man polishing his car was clear: his instincts were to get on in life, and he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose. Even though Blair did not use the phrase, that 1992 voter became known as \u201cMondeo man\u201d and finding a message, and polices, that appealed to Mondeo man became key to New Labour\u2019s success. It sounds as if Long-Bailey has met him too. Here is this week\u2019s Guardian Politics Weekly podcast. My colleague Rowena Mason is joined by Katy Balls, Stewart Wood and Lisa O\u2019Carroll to discuss the latest on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit withdrawal bill, and Jess Phillips\u2019s decision to drop out of the Labour leadership race. Plus Larry Elliott rings in from Davos, and Kate Proctor sits down with Gina Miller. Q: Do you prefer tea or coffee? Johnson says he is drinking tea. But he has nothing against coffee. Q: Will five year be enough? Johnson says he wants to crack on. He says he has to go now to a meeting. But he will do this again next week, he says. And that\u2019s it. Q: What will you do to fix potholes? Johnson says the government is spending \u00a32nb on potholes. Q: How will you keep police on the streets? Johnson says he wants to keep police numbers on the streets high. Johnson says he wants to improve mental health services. Q: Why won\u2019t you give the NHS the funding it needs? Johnson says he is giving record sums to the NHS. It is getting the biggest ever cash boost it has had. (That is misleading. In real terms, the NHS spending increase is only the biggest since the mid-200s.) And he is building 40 new hospitals, and upgrading another 20, he says. Q: Do you support lower tax for working people? Yes, says Johnson. He says he will cut national insurance for everybody. He says that will disproportionately cut tax for people on lower incomes. (That is not true. Average and higher earners gain the most. I will post the data later.) Q: Will the next budget cut VAT on tampons? Johnson says he cannot say what will be in the budget. But he appreciates the importance of keeping period products low. He says an MP asked about this in the Commons today. When the UK leaves the EU, it will be able to cut VAT on tampons. That is one of the advantages of Brexit, he says. Q: Can you commit fully to the union? Yes, says Johnson. He says he commits to it 1,000%. He says when he criticises the SNP, he is not criticising Scotland. He says Scottish education is legendary. It produced Michael Gove, he says. It is a fantastic system. But recently Scotland has been slipping down the Pisa rankings, he says. The SNP should focus on the priorities of the people of Scotland. He says the SNP have got no really clear idea of how breaking up the union would work. (Some might say that criticism could be applied to other breaking up long-standing political unions.) He says people were told that the 2014 referendum was a once in a generation event. He says five years does not constitute a generation. Nor does 10 years, he says. Q: What shampoo do you use? Johnson says he does not know. But it is blue. And it comes in a plastic tube. Johnson is reading out his own questions. Q: Will we take back control of fishing? Yes, says Johnson. He says the UK will not trade away its fishing rights. Johnson says he does not accept that he won\u2019t be able to get a good trade deal from the EU. Boris Johnson is now hosting his People\u2019s PMQs on Facebook from Downing Street. Here is a question from below the line (BTL) prompted by MPs rejecting the Lords amendment to the Brexit bill saying EU nationals staying in the UK should be given a physical document proving their right to residence. I\u2019ve asked my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, who knows more about this than I do, and she has sent me this. EU member states have not yet said how they are going to deal with British citizens who want to remain after Brexit. Under the legally binding withdrawal agreement they will be entitled to stay but some issues are outstanding, such as freedom of movement. British in Europe only yesterday told me they still don\u2019t know which countries favour a \u201cdeclaratory\u201d system and which favour a \u201cconstitutive\u201d system, like the UK\u2019s. (This briefing [pdf] explains the difference.) But it may be worth pointing out that the majority of EU countries already require non-nationals to register in some way. And in some countries like France citizens, including French ones, have to carry ID on their person at all times. The problem facing the government in relation to EU citizens arises because there was no registration system in the first place, partly because of concerns over ID cards and civil liberties. These are from the BBC\u2019s economics editor, Faisal Islam. In the Times today (paywall) Steven Swinford says Boris Johnson is going to scrap the \u00a330,000 minimum salary threshold for migrants coming to the UK after Brexit. He says: Under Mr Johnson\u2019s plan migrants\u2019 earnings will be taken into account as part of their application to enter the UK. Other criteria could include English proficiency, educational qualifications, occupation and willingness to work in particular areas of Britain. While the prime minister is understood to have the support of his cabinet, ditching the \u00a330,000 criteria will still be controversial in the Tory party. Iain Duncan Smith, the Eurosceptic MP and former Conservative leader, warned that it could make it more difficult for the prime minister to fulfil his pledge to cut migration. He said: \u201cThey should be cautious about ditching the \u00a330,000 threshold. They will need to have very strong checks in place to ensure that they deliver on their pledge to control immigration.\u201d Responding to the story, which has not been denied by Downing Street, the SNP\u2019s immigration spokesperson in the Commons, Stuart McDonald, said: This climb down by the Tories, while welcome, is little more than a distraction - Boris Johnson\u2019s one-size-fits-no-one approach to immigration not only poses a very real threat to Scotland\u2019s businesses and economy by ending freedom of movement but puts the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of EU citizens in jeopardy. The \u00a330,000 salary threshold was just one of a million problems with the previous Tory immigration bill. Their next bill is certain to create an immigration system based on crushing bureaucracy and dreadful expense and leave key sectors, such as health, agriculture and tourism, unable to access the workers they need. From my colleague Josh Halliday Lisa Nandy has posted a copy of her welfare speech from this morning on Medium. The veteran BBC journalist John Ware has launched legal action against the Labour party over his controversial Panorama investigation into allegations of antisemitism last year, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. The chief executive of the Civil Service, Sir John Manzoni, is to step down \u201cat some point\u201d this year, the Cabinet Office has said. As the Press Office reports, a spokesman said that the departure of Manzoni, who is also the permanent secretary at the Cabinet, had been planned for \u201csome time\u201d. Manzoni\u2019s five-year tenure in the post had been due to end in October last year, although such senior appointments can be extended for a short period. When the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill returns to the Lords this afternoon, peers are not expected to insist on any of their amendments (ie, to vote to put them back into the bill). They are expected to accept the bill as it is, meaning it should be able to become law very soon. Sometimes the Lords does sent a bill back to the Commons again with an anti-government amendment included, but after a round or two of \u201cping pong\u201d it almost always backs down, letting the elected house have its way. On this bill the pressure to give in is particularly acute because Boris Johnson has just won a near-landslide on a manifesto committing him to passing this bill. The fifth and final Lords amendment to the Brexit bill has been defeated by the government by 349 votes to 246 - a majority of 103. The bill will now returns to the Lords where peers can either accept the bill as it is, or else try again to insert some or all of their amendments. The Home Office has announced police funding for 2020 to 2021 in England. It says funding \u201cwill increase by more than \u00a31.1bn, totalling \u00a315.2bn, if police and crime commissioners (PCCs) take full advantage of flexibility to set the police precept\u201d. We have just has the result of the fourth Commons vote. MPs rejected the Dubs amendment which put the government under a duty to negotiate with the EU for unaccompanied child migrant refugees to be admitted to the UK by 342 votes to 254 - a majority of 88. Earlier, in the third vote, MPs rejected Lords amendment three by a majority of 103. The government won the second vote on reversing a Lords amendment to the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill by 348 votes to 246 - a majority of 102. This was an amendment about the ability of the British courts to depart from European Court of Justice judgments. They are voting on the third Lords amendment now. Jess Phillips, who withdrew from the Labour leadership contest yesterday, has said she is backing Ian Murray for deputy leader. In a statement she said: Labour must be a party for every region and nation of the UK, standing up for our values of solidarity and working together, and Ian is the candidate who best understands that. Ian has put forward a positive vision not only for our party, but also for the country. He recognises that we can\u2019t just talk to ourselves - we must listen to voters in seats we held, seats we lost and seats we have never held. People didn\u2019t trust Labour in the last election because they weren\u2019t sure where we stood on the big issues of the day, and Ian is right that this can never happen again. Phillips is also backing Lisa Nandy for leader. See 10.47am. The government has won the vote by 338 votes to 252 - a majority of 86. Lords amendment 1, on citizens\u2019 rights, has been taken out. MPs are now voting to reverse the next Lords amendment. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has told ITV Border that she still intends to hold a referendum on independence this year. Sturgeon intends to set out more details of her plans next week. Boris Johnson has said he will not give the Scottish government the permission it needs to hold a referendum that would be legally valid. One option would be to hold a referendum anyway, despite it not having any legislative standing, but in the past Sturgeon has dismissed this as an option. MPs are now voting on the first Lords amendment to the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. Just before the debate ended the SNP\u2019s Phillipa Whitford challenged a point made by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, earlier. Barclay said EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit could always print out the Home Office email saying they had settled status. (One of the Lords amendments said they should be given a physical document proving they have the right to be in the country.) But Whitford told MPs that the email specifically says it is not proof of someone\u2019s status. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. According to ITV\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, senior figures in Downing Street are strongly opposed to the former Labour cabinet minister James Purnell, who is now head of radio and education at the BBC, or anyone like him becoming the corporation\u2019s next director general. In a blog Peston says: According to a well placed Downing Street source, if the BBC\u2019s board and [BBC chairman David] Clementi \u201ctry to put someone like Purnell in [as DG], we will put in a chairman whose first job is to fire him...The likes of Purnell [would be] \u2018dead on arrival\u2019\u201d. This is a reference to the former Labour minister, James Purnell, who is the BBC\u2019s director of radio. It is not clear yet whether Purnell is a candidate to succeed Hall. And what is more, [Dominic] Cummings and his colleagues are actively searching for possible director general candidates they regard as sympathetic to their aims for the corporation. It is not unusual for governments, or anyone else in politics, to brief on an unattributable basis, but since Boris Johnson became PM there has been an increase in the number of unattributable briefings coming out of No 10, often involving threats to Johnson\u2019s opponents. Quite often what is being threatened never actually happens. For example, we were told that Johnson would do anything to avoid having to request a Brexit extension from the EU in the autumn, but in the end he meekly complied with the legislation saying he had to. That might mean that the threat was bogus in the first place. Or it might meant senior source making the threat subsequently got over-ruled by Johnson himself. Some people think journalists should not be reporting this stuff. But if this is what someone important is saying in private, and the journalist who hears it to be at least half serious, then it does seem as if there is quite a good case for letting the public know. Anyone who doesn\u2019t realise that there are some in No 10 who harbour deep hostility towards the BBC should read my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s scoop about Dominic Cummings. Lisa Nandy has welcomed the nomination she has received from Chinese for Labour. (See 1.14pm.) Boris Johnson is doing another of his Facebook People\u2019s PMQs this afternoon. He has done at least two of these before. I missed the August one, but I did watch the September one. It was dire. It was also a very poor guide to what Boris Johnson was doing to do next. \u201cWe will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop,\u201d Johnson told his Facebook audience in September. But in the end he did end up proposing a Northern Ireland-only Brexit arrangement that, while not technically a \u201cbackstop\u201d, is as good as. In the Commons MPs are now debating Lords amendments to the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, is speaking for the government. He confirms that the government wants to overturn the defeats inflicted on the government when the bill was on the Lords. He insists the government remains committed to maintaining protections for unaccompanied child migrants who want to come to the UK to join family members. But he says there is no need for the amendment from the Labour peer Lords Dubs that was passed in the Lords committing the government to maintaining these arrangements. The government has a proud record on supporting the most vulnerable children. The UK has granted protection to over 41,000 children since the start of 2010. In 2018 the UK received over 3,000 asylum applications from unaccompanied children and the UK deals with 15% of all claims in the EU, making us the third highest intake country in Europe. Indeed the intake in the year ending to September 2019 rose to over 3,500. Primary legislation cannot deliver the best outcomes for these children as it cannot guarantee that we reach an agreement and that is why this is ultimately a matter which must be negotiated with the EU and the government is committed to seeking the best possible outcome in those negotiations. Lisa Nandy will now definitely be on the ballot for the Labour leadership, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports. Nandy already had the backing of two unions this morning, the GMB and the NUM, but now a tiny socialist society affiliated to Labour, Chinese for Labour, has backed her. That means that she has the three affiliates she needs, accounting for at least 5% of the affilates vote, to be on the final ballot. Boris Johnson was remarkably bad. It did not matter very much, because his MPs were hugely supportive, and the nation as a whole, like the Commons, is not paying much attention to Jeremy Corbyn at the moment, but under a different Labour leader the prime minister\u2019s glib complacency and lack of attention to detail when supposed to be defending the record of his government could - in fact, should - become a liability. Corbyn started by asking about the way bonuses are clawed back for people on universal credit, prompted by the story about this happening to Greggs staff. Johnson clearly did not have a clue what Corbyn was talking about, but he would not say so, and instead blamed Corbyn for the way he framed the question. When Corbyn used his second question to explain, Johnson still failed to address the point. Then Corbyn branched out and asked various questions about universal credit, and poverty generally. It is hard to imagine Theresa May not having an answer about Greggs in her folder somewhere (she was never brilliant at PMQs, but she was always prepared), and when asked about UC, she was able to engage in discussion about the detail. Johnson was reduced to firing out headline bullet points about the government\u2019s record on employment and poverty. He had a reasonably good joke up his sleeve about Tory MPs being happy to endorse Corbyn as the best Labour leader, but overall he was very poor, and only lifted by the fact that Tory MPs are still willing to cheer him unconditionally. At some point Conservative backbenchers will start to assert their independence. But there is not much evidence of that yet, and some of the sycophancy on display this afternoon (see 12.02pm and 12.19pm) was gruesome. One other point was interesting. Immediately after the general election, Johnson was keen to assert that he was leading a brand new government. Yet today, when challenged about the Tory record over the last 10 years, Johnson was happy to defend it with claims (some questionable - see below) about employment and poverty. He was back to sounding like a continuity PM, not a fresh start one. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader at Westminster, asks if the commitment to allow \u201cunfettered access\u201d for goods going from Northern Ireland to Britain after Brexit also applies to goods going the other way. It does, says Johnson. Amanda Solloway, a Conservative, asks about period poverty. She says she remembers the embarrassment of not being able to afford tampons when she was a teenager. Johnson says free period products are being made available at schools now. She says, when the UK leaves the EU, the government will be able to cut VAT on period products. Labour\u2019s Alex Cunningham says Teesside men have the same life expectancy as people in Ethiopia. Johnson says this is a good point. He says the inequality in life expectance in the UK is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson says Johnson wants to be known as Brexity Hezza. So will he support the Humber docks in the way that Michael Heseltine supported the development of docklands in London. Johnson says this project is being considered. And he says a free port might help too. Labour\u2019s Marsha de Cordova asks about Wandsworth council\u2019s special educational needs provision. Does Johnson agree every child with special educational needs deserves a good education? Johnson says more money is going into SEND. Ofsted is the guarantor of SEND education, he says. But Labour wants to abolish Ofsted, he says. Labour\u2019s Holly Lynch says the north needs HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail. Will the HS2 review be published this week? Johnson says it is right to look at the value the country could get from HS2. He says the Oakervee review will be published in due course. UPDATE: This post has been corrected because it was Holly Lynch who asked the question, not Cat Smith as originally stated. Sorry for the mistake. Caroline Nokes, a Conservative, asks about algae in the Solent, and its effect on house planning in her constituency. Johnson says he will use a \u201cministerial dyno rod\u201d to sort out this problem. Alex Chalk, a Conservative, asks about a renewable energy firm in his Cheltenham constituency. Johnson says the government is looking to a replacement for the renewable heat incentive. Sarah Dines, a Conservative, asks about quarrying in Derbyshire. She says the Tories are the party of working people. Johnson says he hopes to visit Dines\u2019 constituency as soon as possible. He says it was sad that the president of the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala said this week that Tories were not welcome at it. Labour\u2019s Mary Glindon says power cables over the Tyne are an obstacle to firms trying to get work to build large renewable energy structures. Johnson says he appreciates the problem, and will do what he can to sort it out. Blackford says last night the House of Lords voted to reinstate the Sewel convention. There is no respect from Westminster for the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland. And yesterday the Welsh assembly became the third devolved body to reject the Brexit bill. Johnson says the Sewel convention does not support breaking up the UK. Blackford says Johnson does not get it. This is an unprecedented attack, he says. He says Scotland said no to the Brexit legislation and it meant it. The Scottish parliament speaks for the Scottish people. He asks Johnson to stop his attack on devolution. Johnson says he agrees with Blackford. Scotland said no and it meant it. It said no to independence in 2014, he says. He says the Tories support manufacturing in Scotland. The SNP support nothing but \u201cmanufacturing grievance\u201d. Ben Bradley, a Conservative, asks about schools. Johnson says school standards are rising. He says in Scotland school performance in maths and science are at a record low. He challenges the SNP leader, Ian Blackford, to say why the SNP is so obsessed with independence when its performance is so bad. Corbyn says Johnson should answer the question. He turns to the two-child limit. Why won\u2019t the PM admit there is a link between poverty and the two-child limit. Johnson says there has been a substantial reduction in child poverty. The Labour party should change its tune, he says. He says the Labour party voted Corbyn the best Labour leaders since records began. He says those sentiments are shared by many Tories. Corbyn says levels of poverty are a national scandal. He says UC is a system of mind-numbing complexity. It is driving people to food banks. Johnson can\u2019t answer questions on it. It should go, he says. Johnson says Corbyn just wants to keep people in the welfare trap. He says Corbyn should pay tribute to the way the economy has grown. He says there will be 40 new hospitals and 20,000 more police officers. Labour still can\u2019t make up its mind about whether or not to leave the EU, he says. Corbyn says Johnson fought for bankers to be allowed to keep their bonuses. He asks if universal credit is making the social security system simpler. Johnson claims it is, because unemployment has been reduced. (That\u2019s a non-sequitur.) He returns to Greggs, and says just one person has complained about the bonus system. He says the IMF says the UK will grow faster than the Eurozone. When will Corbyn stop talking the UK down? Corbyn says the reality is that many people in work are in poverty. Universal credit was meant to reduce poverty, he says. But more and more people are using food banks. Why won\u2019t the PM end the punitive five-week wait for benefits under UC? Johnson says the number of people in poverty has fallen by 400,000 under this government. He says Labour is proposing \u201ceven more Corbynism\u201d. He says Corbyn should listen to the verdict of the British people four weeks ago. Jeremy Corbyn mentions Holocaust memorial day, and says all forms of racism must be opposed. If a worker receives a \u00a3300 bonus, how much of it should he be allowed to keep. That is a reference to this story. Johnson says the living wage will ensure that some people get an extra \u00a31,000 a year. He says if Corbyn wants a better answer, he should ask a clearer question. Corbyn refers to the Greggs story, and says people on low pay might keep just a quarter of their \u00a3300 bonus. Johnson (who clearly has not been briefed on this story at all) returns to his point about the living wage. He ignores the point about bonuses. Bim Afolami, a Conservative, says he welcomes the government\u2019s announcement this week about tougher sentencing, particularly for terrorism offences. Does the PM agree that we need to do whatever we can to stop terrorism? Boris Johnson welcomes the question, and claim his proposals amount to a \u201cmajor shift\u201d in the sentencing of terrorists. PMQs is starting now. Private landlords have backed calls for the government to issue physical cards to EU citizens to prove they have the right to be in the country post Brexit. The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) has previously cautioned that EU citizens risk discrimination if do not have a card showing their status when looking to rent properties. The group, in a joint statement with the EU citizens campaign group the3million and the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said: MPs should back what is a pragmatic and common sense proposal. It should not be controversial that EU citizens who have played such a positive role to the life of the UK should be able to easily prove their rights with a physical document. The House of Lords voted on Monday for EU nationals to be given a physical document proving their right to be in the UK after Brexit, but the government is set to reverse that defeat when MPs debate the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill again this afternoon. And here are the main points from Lisa Nandy\u2019s speech on welfare at Centrepoint this morning. Some of the arguments in the speech were ones she deployed in her Today interview this morning. (See 10.26am.) Nandy said Labour should be making the case for tax as a public good. She said: We need to change the debate. Tax is not an evil. Tax is how we contribute to something bigger, better than ourselves. When we labelled one of the cruellest reforms \u201cthe Bedroom Tax\u201d it caught the public\u2019s imagination. But we reinforced the idea that tax is bad. We won the battle, but lost the war. To win the argument, tax must first be based on principles of fairness \u2013 every time a company avoids corporation tax, or we allow a cut to the well-off at the expense of those in greater need, we chip away at the system and people\u2019s trust in it. She said that employers who do not pay the living wage should be penalised. She said: Today, the position couldn\u2019t be starker. Insecure, zero-hours contracts and too many employers who don\u2019t pay their taxes or pay their staff a living wage. Which is why, for big employers who turn a profit and don\u2019t pay the living wage, we should ensure they settle their balance with DWP every year, before we consider anything else. Equally, we should champion those employers who pay their taxes, invest in their staff and engage meaningfully in their community. This is not just about financial sustainability. It\u2019s about making your contribution. She said the cuts to universal credit should be reversed. She said: It cannot be right that the poorest can find themselves paying the highest marginal effective rate of tax \u2013 that baker\u2019s bonuses are taxed more than bankers. The root is universal credit, and the cuts made in 2012. I would immediately reverse these, paid for by cancelling the Tories proposed changes to the NICS threshold, while we design a progressive tax system that works for the least well off. Cancelling the Tory proposal to raise the national insurance threshold to \u00a39,500 (an effective tax cut) would save about \u00a32bn. But this not would be be enough to restore all the cuts to benefits announced by the coalition. One IFS analysis said those cuts were worth \u00a316.7bn. She said Labour should create a \u201cmodern, empowering welfare state for the 21st century\u201d. She criticised the way the welfare state currently works, saying it \u201cpresumes the very worst of people in need\u201d. She said: The narrative on social security is so well established, we barely question it. It presumes the very worst of people in need, before they even walk through the door or pick up the phone. And for all our pride in the professionals who do their best, often butting against the system they work within, the phrase frontline professionals suggests those tasked with helping are at war with those they support. It reinforces everything that is wrong. The demonisation of people at the most difficult times in their lives.The idea we are problems to be dealt with, not incredible human beings with potential to be realised. This all serves to pit people against one another, to corrode the sense of common purpose and allow the system to be dismantled bit by bit. But it takes all the wrong cues from the British public. We believe they want draconian welfare rules, when in fact they want the worst off to be cared for. Our job is to convince people it isn\u2019t a zero-sum game. She said everyone accessing a public service should have access to personal help. She said: Never again should we lose sight of the human being in front of us. Managing the conflicting, messy, complex, disastrous bureaucracy is bad enough for those who work in the the system. For those who need it, it is often as much the problem as the reason they sought help in the first place. Every single person accessing a public service should be given the right to have one person who gets them to where they need to go. It\u2019s based on a simple but radical idea: that services should be built around people, not the other way round. Rebecca Long-Bailey, another Labour leadership candidate, has given a substantial interview to the Daily Mirror this morning. Here are some of the key lines. Long-Bailey sought to quash claims she was a continuity Corbyn candidate by saying that she would take the party in \u201ccompletely different directions\u201d. She said: Insinuations have been made: \u2018Oh these men have been pulling strings in the background\u2019. I\u2019ve been proud to stand on the policy platform that we\u2019ve had. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not a completely different person from Jeremy because I am and I\u2019ll be taking the party in completely different directions. She said Labour should show it was \u201cthe party of aspiration\u201d. She said: The Tories talk about being the party of aspiration and they\u2019re nowhere near delivering anybody\u2019s aspirations, apart from a select group of people that they\u2019ve always tried to protect. We need to show that what we believe is about fulfilling aspiration. It\u2019s about saying to an 18 year-old Rebecca that the Labour party will make sure you fulfill your dreams and that your childrens\u2019 lives would be better than yours. No matter your postcode, no matter where you work, you will be guaranteed that better quality of life. And we didn\u2019t say that in this election. That message really didn\u2019t cut through. That drew many people to the conclusion that we were there to provide handouts rather than to fulfil people\u2019s needs for aspiration. She rejected claims that she was not tough enough to be Labour leader. She said: I\u2019m from Salford, no-one messes with me. She rejected claims she was shy. She said: I\u2019m not shy, I was too busy working. I was locked in a room for four years developing a lot of the policies that were in the manifesto, rather than going around wining and dining. Jess Phillips, who withdrew from the Labour leadership contest yesterday, is backing Lisa Nandy for leader, the Daily Mirror reports. Here is some comment from journalists and commentators on Lisa Nandy\u2019s Today interview. From my colleague Gaby Hinsliff From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood Labour\u2019s Tees Valley mayoral candidate, Jessie Joe Jacobs, vowed to tackle the area\u2019s mental health crisis and build vocational centres for young people as she launched her campaign in Hartlepool this morning. Joined by Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool mayor Steve Rotheram, she also pledged \u00a31m for a Tech For Good charity to encourage companies to invest in green and healthcare technology in the area. Jacobs would be the first woman metro mayor if elected, and the first Labour mayor in Tees Valley since the role was first elected in 2017. She vowed to end loneliness in Teesside with investment for community centres, and build a vocational centre in each of the area\u2019s boroughs to prepare young people for new opportunities. Jacobs, a charity leader from Stockon-on-Tees, was the only Labour candidate shortlisted by regional party leaders, meaning local members did not get a vote on their preferred choice. She\u2019s up against Tory incumbent Ben Houchen, who brought Durham Tees Valley airport back into public ownership during his time in office. Launching his re-election campaign earlier this month, he set out plans to bring steelmaking back to Teesside and install free parking in town centres. Speaking of her opponent, Jacobs said: Our future will not be found in our past. My opponent makes populist promises ... and offers simplistic answers and soundbites to complex issues. Here are the main points from Lisa Nandy\u2019s interviews on Today and ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning. Nandy, a Labour leadership candidate, criticised New Labour for keeping elements of Thatcherism. (See 9.23am.) She refused to say who was her favourite leader. When asked this question by Nick Robinson on Today, Nandy replied: I think there are different leaders who\u2019ve done different things for the party at different times. When Robinson put it to her that she was avoiding the question, she replied: Well, it\u2019s a bit of a daft question because people are complex and it is perfectly possible to believe that people do both good and bad things. But she went on to talk about her view of Jeremy Corbyn. She said that she had known him since she was 21, that she \u201cprofoundly disagreed\u201d with him on some things, but that agreed with him on the need for society to be more compassionate. She said: On the issue of whether we\u2019re a more compassionate society, and whether Labour needs to be clearer about that, I couldn\u2019t agree with more. Robinson\u2019s question was prompted by YouGov polling this week that suggests Corbyn is the most popular Labour leader of the last 100 years amongst Labour members. She claimed that Labour need to be more ambitious in its goals. She said: What I\u2019m saying today is that we need to go out and recover our ambition; we don\u2019t just tinker at the edges of the systems that we have, we need to get on the front foot and think about what the future of the welfare state will look like, what the future of this country will look like. This is a surprising claim because the one criticism that could not be levelled against Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto was lack of ambition. When this point was put to Nandy, she said the problem was that the manifesto promised so much that people did not trust the party to deliver. She said Labour had become too paternalistic and that it needed to promote a welfare system that empowered people. She said: So it\u2019s not just a question of do we raise universal credit rates. It\u2019s a question of do we overhaul the entire system so that it genuinely empowers people. That\u2019s something that Labour used to believe in. When the Beveridge report was published, when the welfare state was founded, we used to believe that our job was to empower people to change their own lives. In recent years we\u2019ve become far more paternalistic. We think that by sitting behind desks in central London commissioning thinktank reports and focus groups we can fix it for people. We can\u2019t. This analysis is highly questionable. The minister credited with saying that the gentleman in Whitehall really does know best, the epitome of paternalism (although what he really said was \u201cin the case of nutrition and health, just as in the case of education, the gentleman in Whitehall really does know better what is good for people than the people know themselves\u201d), was Douglas Jay, a minister in the Attlee government that implemented the Beveridge report. She said that Ian Lavery, the Labour chair, was wrong to suggest at a rally last night that Sir Keir Starmer should stand aside to allow a woman to win the leadership contest. She criticised the Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan for dismissing claims that Meghan Markle has been subject to racism. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. Lisa Nandy has just started delivering her welfare speech at Centrepoint in London. I will post a summary when I\u2019ve read the full text. From the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp Government ministers are still boycotting the Today programme, but former ministers are happy to appear and this morning George Osborne, the former chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, made an appearance. He had two interesting arguments. Osborne predicted that the government would shelve its plans to impose a tax on tech giants like Google and Facebook. He said: It would certainly be a very brave British government that walks into a trade war with the United States at the very moment as the centre point of its economic policy is to strike a trade deal with the US. I suspect they will use what the OECD is saying as a reason to delay implementation. He said the government should allow the Chinese firm Huawei to supply parts of the 5G network, despite opposition to this from the US. He said: You can keep Huawei out of your most sensitive core bits of your national security infrastructure, but frankly if you want Britain to have 5G technology, Huawei is a massive supplier of that 5G technology. Some of its products are frankly much cheaper and better than its competitors at the moment. If our choice is to allow Huawei in and have a competitive playing field or delay 5G and fall behind other European nations, then I think we need to work of course with companies like Huawei. Yesterday Lisa Nandy secured the GMB nomination which means she is now almost certain to be on the final ballot for the Labour leadership. And this morning she has been giving a series of interviews ahead of a speech on welfare she is delivering at 10am. On the Today programme she was burnishing her Corbynite credentials by praising the outgoing Labour leader for breaking the consensus that \u201ceconomic conservatism was a bigger priority than people\u201d. She also criticised New Labour for continuing with elements of Thatcherism, telling the programme: I\u2019m not going to trash the legacy of the last Labour government because things like the minimum wage were complete game-changers in towns like Wigan, and the investment that went into health and education was really important. But it is certainly true to say that the consensus that Thatcher built lasted all the way through the New Labour years. I came into politics after 10 years working in the voluntary sector with homeless teenagers, first of all, and then with child refugees. And the reason I did was out of frustration with a system under the last Labour government that took small amounts from people at the very top of the system and handed it with conditions to those at the bottom. Nandy has also come out well from a focus group of ex-Labour voters commissioned for an item on Channel 4 News last night. There is a link to the film here. And here is a Times article (paywall) by James Johnson, the pollster (and former Tory aide) who organised the focus group, which was held in Birmingham. He writes: Lisa Nandy went down well with the younger group aged 25 to 40. No one in this session was aware of her beforehand, but almost all left saying they thought she would be the candidate most likely to win back their vote. They were most impressed by her honesty and candour in a clip of her being interviewed by Andrew Neil \u2014 a rare sight from a politician for these disenchanted voters ... Reflecting on the experience, I wondered how the Conservative party might feel about this research. They should be worried by Nandy. And they would have had reason to be spooked by [Jess] Phillips. Her departure spells out the reality: that the preferences of the voters Labour needs to win back to do not match those of the members. Instead, the favourites in this contest are [Keir] Starmer and [Rebecca] Long Bailey. When I told respondents that these two were the frontrunners, despairing laughter echoed around the room. I was left with one conclusion: in Number 10, they will be rubbing their hands in glee. I will post more from Nandy\u2019s two morning interviews soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Lisa Nandy, the Labour leadership candidate, gives a speech on welfare policy. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 12.30pm: MPs debate the EU (withdrawal agreement) bill on its return from the Lords. They are expected to vote to overturn the five government defeats the bill suffered in the Lords. 2.30pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, speaks about the Scottish economy at an IPPR event. Afternoon: The EU (withdrawal agreement) bill returns to the Lords, where peers will have to either accept the Commons version or vote again to amend it. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

External examiners are experienced academics such as professors or senior lecturers, who give independent assurance that a university\u2019s assessment system is fair and help to maintain rigorous academic standards. The external examination boycott comes during industrial disputes at many British universities, with the University and College Union leading a strike at 60 institutions last year and more strike ballots being held this month. \u201cExternal examiners resigning their positions, and refusing to take up new ones, are very serious steps and demonstrate the huge levels of frustration that exist,\u201d said Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary. \u201cExternal examiners are vitally important both to protecting educational standards and to the sector\u2019s academic reputation but they want to support colleagues who face pension cuts, insecure contracts, spiralling workloads and pay inequality. \u201cUniversities must now recognise the strength of feeling that exists across the workforce and make substantial changes in the way they treat staff or they will undoubtedly face not just further industrial action, but also more withdrawals of cooperation.\u201d A spokesperson for the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the protest \u201cdoes not seem to reflect accurately the issues\u201d in the current industrial disputes. \u201cMany universities have also been in dialogue with their unions over the wider employment issues that have been packaged in to one of these disputes and it is wrong to assert that there is any unwillingness within universities to discuss and address these issues,\u201d the association said.

      "bodyText": "The UN\u2019s demand for law enforcement authorities to conduct a proper investigation into the alleged hacking of Jeff Bezos\u2019s mobile phone came after it reviewed the findings of a cybersecurity firm, FTI. The firm carried out a forensic analysis of Bezos\u2019 phone last year and concluded with \u201cmedium to high confidence\u201d that it had been compromised because of actions attributable to a WhatsApp account used by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. As a result of this study, the UN said that Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, had probably been hit by a piece of sophisticated malware, and it cited two firms \u2013 NSO and Hacking Team \u2013 as potential sources for this technology. The UN was careful not to be definitive. Instead of pointing the finger, its statement said the apparent hack had been achieved using software \u201csuch as NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus or, less likely, Hacking Team\u2019s Galileo, that can hook into legitimate applications to bypass detection and obfuscate activity\u201d. The NSO Group, an Israeli cyber-surveillance firm, strongly denied that its surveillance tools were responsible. \u201cNSO is shocked and appalled by the story that has been published with respect to alleged hacking of the phone of Mr Jeff Bezos,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThese types of abuses of surveillance systems blacken the eye of the cyber-intelligence community and put a strain on the ability to use legitimate tools to fight serious crime and terror. We expect that all actors in this arena put in place stringent procedures and technological controls, such as those that we have put in place, to assure that their systems are not used in an abusive manner.\u201d The FTI report cited by the UN special rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, noted that both NSO and Hacking Team, an Italian company, offered tools that could theoretically have performed the attack. The report also highlighted that Saudi Arabia\u2019s chief cybersecurity specialist, a close friend of Prince Mohammed named Saud al-Qahtani, \u201chad long worked with\u201d Hacking Team, and \u201ceventually purchased 20% ownership\u201d of the company, \u201capparently acquired on behalf of the Saudi government\u201d. Whatever spyware was used, descriptions of the attack point to the use of a sophisticated piece of software, which was delivered through a video file, received from Mohammed\u2019s personal phone number. The video appeared to describe the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Sweden, with closely cropped Arabic captions. It is unclear whether Bezos clicked on the video. He may not have had to. It appears the malware was not actually in the video itself but in the encrypted \u201cenvelope\u201d in which it was contained. When the message reached Bezos\u2019s phone, and it decrypted to reveal the video, the malicious code was released. \u201cThe downloader that delivered the 4.22MB video was encrypted, delaying or preventing further study of the code delivered along with the video,\u201d the FTI analysis said. \u201cIt should be noted that the encrypted WhatsApp file sent from [Prince Mohammed\u2019s] account was slightly larger than the video itself.\u201d Within hours of receipt of the video, data usage on Bezos\u2019s phone began to spike, rising 30-fold over the day, and eventually peaking at multiple gigabytes of data sent in a single day. That spike, FTI says, is the best evidence of a hack. \u201cAnomalous spikes in egress data can often be attributed to malware activity such as spyware and backdoor trojans.\u201d The firm ruled out other explanations. But while investigators identified the suspicious video that seems to have caused the hack, and the massive spike in data usage, the FTI report found no hard evidence of an actual hack. After cloning the device and examining its file system they found \u201cno matches against known \u2026 malicious software\u201d. They \u201cdid not identify any malware on the device\u201d when they scanned it with one of their forensic tools.

Obviously the first task of any new chairman would be to remove an unsuitable director general immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Later, ITV described a \u201cwell-placed Downing Street source\u201d saying that if the BBC\u2019s board \u201ctry to put someone like Purnell in [as director general], we will put in a chairman whose first job is to fire him ... The likes of Purnell [would be] \u2018dead on arrival\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>No 10 declined to comment on the briefing by the anonymous source or sources. Similar unattributed briefings caused huge controversy in the autumn as many of the threats they made turned out to be heavily exaggerated or untrue, such as the idea that a Brexit deal was \u201cessentially impossible\u201d and that the prime minister had a secret ruse to ensure the UK would leave on 31 October.</p> <p>It comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/dominic-cummings-thinktank-called-for-end-of-bbc-in-current-form\">after the Guardian revealed</a> that Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, ran a thinktank that called in 2004 for the \u201cend of the BBC in its current form\u201d and a campaign to undermine its credibility.</p> <p>The thinktank\u2019s blog branded the BBC the \u201cmortal enemy\u201d of the Conservatives and called for the end of the licence fee, a new Fox News-style channel unconstrained by impartiality rules, and the end of the ban on political advertising on television.</p> <p>Hall had wanted to stay at the BBC until its centenary in 2022 and his earlier than expected departure appears to be a strategic move to ensure the BBC board \u2013 not the government \u2013 has control over who is appointed as his successor.</p> <p>The government appoints the chairman of the BBC board and the incumbent, David Clementi, who is responsible for running the director general recruitment process, comes to the end of his tenure in early 2021.</p> <p>Given the open hostility of Johnson\u2019s government, Clementi\u2019s replacement is unlikely to be as sympathetic to the BBC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/mortal-enemy-what-cummings-thinktank-said-about-bbc\">'Mortal enemy': what Cummings' thinktank said about BBC</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And at least one person in No 10 appears to be suggesting that the government could simply replace Clementi before his term ends with somebody willing to pick another director general, in what would be an unprecedented intervention in the broadcaster\u2019s governance.</p> <p>While the government may be looking to influence the appointment of Hall\u2019s successor, the BBC charter is clear on the responsibilities of the 14-strong board. It says: \u201cEach member of the board must at all times uphold and protect the independence of the BBC including by acting in the public interest, exercising independent judgment and neither seeking nor taking instructions from government ministers or any other person.\u201d<br><br>This has not stopped the government from trying to exert some control over the running of the BBC in the past. In 2016, when the BBC Trust was scrapped and replaced with the new unitary board it has today, the then culture secretary, John Whittingdale, attempted to load it with government appointees. In an interview he said that he wanted all but two or three of the 14 to be government appointees.</p> <p>Labour accused the government of trying to \u201cbend [the BBC] to its political will\u201d. A subsequent change to the proposals now means the government has the direct power to elect the chair and four non-executive directors representing the devolved nations.<br><br>The hunt for Hall\u2019s replacement will initially be led by the board\u2019s nominations committee, also headed by Clementi, which will appoint headhunters and sound out potential candidates who have not put themselves forward. The BBC board will then draw up a long and shortlist of interviewees and make a final decision.<br></p> <p><br></p>",

Obviously the first task of any new chairman would be to remove an unsuitable director general immediately.\u201d Later, ITV described a \u201cwell-placed Downing Street source\u201d saying that if the BBC\u2019s board \u201ctry to put someone like Purnell in [as director general], we will put in a chairman whose first job is to fire him ... The likes of Purnell [would be] \u2018dead on arrival\u2019.\u201d No 10 declined to comment on the briefing by the anonymous source or sources. Similar unattributed briefings caused huge controversy in the autumn as many of the threats they made turned out to be heavily exaggerated or untrue, such as the idea that a Brexit deal was \u201cessentially impossible\u201d and that the prime minister had a secret ruse to ensure the UK would leave on 31 October. It comes after the Guardian revealed that Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, ran a thinktank that called in 2004 for the \u201cend of the BBC in its current form\u201d and a campaign to undermine its credibility. The thinktank\u2019s blog branded the BBC the \u201cmortal enemy\u201d of the Conservatives and called for the end of the licence fee, a new Fox News-style channel unconstrained by impartiality rules, and the end of the ban on political advertising on television. Hall had wanted to stay at the BBC until its centenary in 2022 and his earlier than expected departure appears to be a strategic move to ensure the BBC board \u2013 not the government \u2013 has control over who is appointed as his successor. The government appoints the chairman of the BBC board and the incumbent, David Clementi, who is responsible for running the director general recruitment process, comes to the end of his tenure in early 2021. Given the open hostility of Johnson\u2019s government, Clementi\u2019s replacement is unlikely to be as sympathetic to the BBC. And at least one person in No 10 appears to be suggesting that the government could simply replace Clementi before his term ends with somebody willing to pick another director general, in what would be an unprecedented intervention in the broadcaster\u2019s governance. While the government may be looking to influence the appointment of Hall\u2019s successor, the BBC charter is clear on the responsibilities of the 14-strong board. It says: \u201cEach member of the board must at all times uphold and protect the independence of the BBC including by acting in the public interest, exercising independent judgment and neither seeking nor taking instructions from government ministers or any other person.\u201d This has not stopped the government from trying to exert some control over the running of the BBC in the past. In 2016, when the BBC Trust was scrapped and replaced with the new unitary board it has today, the then culture secretary, John Whittingdale, attempted to load it with government appointees. In an interview he said that he wanted all but two or three of the 14 to be government appointees. Labour accused the government of trying to \u201cbend [the BBC] to its political will\u201d. A subsequent change to the proposals now means the government has the direct power to elect the chair and four non-executive directors representing the devolved nations. The hunt for Hall\u2019s replacement will initially be led by the board\u2019s nominations committee, also headed by Clementi, which will appoint headhunters and sound out potential candidates who have not put themselves forward. The BBC board will then draw up a long and shortlist of interviewees and make a final decision.",

      "bodyText": "Millions of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers will be charged overdraft interest rates of up to 49.9% from April and those with a poor credit history are likely to pay the most. Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 which owns all three brands and has 22 million current account customers \u2013 is the biggest bank so far to overhaul its overdraft costs in response to a ban on excessive fees demanded last year by the City regulator. It is the highest overdraft interest rate announced to date, and the consumer expert Martin Lewis\u2019s MoneySavingExpert website called it \u201ceye-watering\u201d. . The new industry rules have been brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority after it said the overdraft market was \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. The rules stop higher prices being charged for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised ones, banning fixed daily or monthly fees for borrowing in this way. Instead banks have to price overdrafts using a simple annual interest rate. But some commentators have warned that banks and building societies would attempt to make up their losses by imposing higher headline overdraft rates. Nationwide became the first major provider to respond by introducing a single 39.9% rate, and several others have announced the same rate, including HSBC and Santander. The Lloyds group said the majority of its customers would charged 39.9%, but some would receive a higher rate of 49.9%. The bank refused to say how many people that may be, saying: \u201cAs a result of these changes, 90% of customers with an overdraft will pay less than they do today.\u201d The group charges 1p a day on every \u00a36 borrowed up to \u00a31,250, 1p a day for every \u00a37 borrowed between \u00a31,250 and \u00a32,500, and 1p a day on every \u00a38 borrowed above that. Lloyds said it was adopting risk-based pricing on its overdrafts, where the rate an individual is offered will depend on their credit history and other details. Banks and building societies have until 6 April to follow the new rules.",

As Gabriel Martinelli gathered the ball in his own half on Tuesday night, he found himself all on his own, 80 yards from goal, with N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 blocking his path. And yet within a few seconds the ball was rolling past Kepa Arrizabalaga into the Chelsea net, the 18-year-old Martinelli having simply run the length of the field in a very fast straight line, dumping perhaps the world\u2019s best covering midfielder on his backside in the process. You know, as you do.</p> \n<p>Somehow, it feels pointless trying to piece together the sequence of events linking these two tableaux. Certainly you sense Arsenal fans will not be unduly troubling themselves with the finer details of Martinelli\u2019s equaliser against Chelsea: the sizeable slice of fortune by which a heavy touch leads to a clear run on goal by dint of a calamitous turn and slip from Kant\u00e9, who looks like a player desperately short of form and confidence.

All night there had been a sort of humming energy to Martinelli, a whirring of the gears, the beating of a restless heart. He pressed tirelessly. He tried to carve out openings. He berated teammates when they failed to put the ball where he wanted it. Even as the minutes began to tick away on a night that seemed destined to be the latest chapter in Arsenal\u2019s banter era \u2013 from the comedy dismissal of David Luiz to the sight of Mesut \u00d6zil playing holding midfield \u2013 Martinelli obstinately refused to follow the script.</p> \n<p>Adding to the sense of predestination was the fact that he wasn\u2019t even meant to be on the pitch.

Even so, it was possible to see in Arsenal\u2019s double comeback a faint outline of how the Arteta revolution might work in practice: a revolution not just of tactics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/mikel-arteta-spirit-fight-leadership-arsenal\" title=\"\">but of tone</a>, and one embodied by their brilliant, industrious Brazilian.</p> \n<p>In notching his 10th goal of the season, Martinelli became the first teenager to reach that mark for Arsenal since Nicolas Anelka more than two decades ago, and the parallels between the two are more than superficial. For all the goals Anelka contributed to the 1997-98 Double winners, his real impact was as a form of shock therapy: the pace and sophistication, the power and stubbornness, the clean break with the past, the freshness of youth and the boldness to trust it. More than any other player, it was Anelka who offered the clearest insight into Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s vision.

Eschewing the relative comforts of the Corinthians academy for the fourth-tier club Ituano at the age of 14, Martinelli\u2019s career has been plotted out with a draughtsman\u2019s precision: senior debut aged 16, first goal aged 17, the extra strength training, the private English lessons.

The women are calling for new social indicators to be considered beside GDP data, and will meet next at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow this November. With the Scottish government aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2045, five years before the UK target, the Holyrood parliament passed the final-stage legislation on Tuesday to set up a Scottish national investment bank, whose primary aim is to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. The speech was delivered on the same day as the first minister\u2019s National Advisory Council on Women and Girls published its second annual report, setting out an ambitious framework to bring gender equality into mainstream policymaking and ensure that it is properly resourced. Taking inspiration from Barack Obama\u2019s White House Council on Women and Girls, the council was established by Sturgeon in 2017. Its first annual report, presented by the council\u2019s independent chairwoman, Louise Macdonald, last year, included radical proposals intended to make Scotland a world leader in gender equality, offering 50 hours of free childcare a week for all children between six months and five years old, and establishing a world-leading process for complainants of sexual violence. Advocating a \u201cScottish approach to gender coherence\u201d across all spheres of government, public services and business in its second report, the council calls for this to be reflected in a significant increase in status and funding through the creation of a standalone equalities directorate to replace the current Equalities Unit. The report also calls for existing scrutiny bodies such as Audit Scotland and the Accounts Commission to be more proactive. It recommends that Scottish ministers deliver an annual statement, followed by a debate, on gender policy coherence to the Scottish parliament, to provide a focal point for others to work around.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Some stories from Davos today: Here\u2019s the moment Prince Charles shakes hands with Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg: One of the more surprising Davos attendees is Mary Beard, the Cambridge classics professor. She\u2019s been talking about the role and representation of women in antiquity, and cited parallels with Prince Charles\u2019s younger son: \u201cWe have absolutely no idea what has gone on with Harry and Meghan and we will never know. But our press is absolutely convinced that the explanatory tool here is the female interloper.\u201d (Thanks to WEF for the quote) Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community charity, says Prince Charles\u2019 speech highlights the \u201chuge\u201d gulf between words and actions over corporate responsibility. \u201cOur research shows that while nearly nine in 10 large companies have a purpose statement, which sets out their intentions to improve in areas such as health and wellbeing, the environment and corporate social responsibility, roughly eight in ten have not yet set clear targets about how to implement them. \u201cThe challenge for companies in the 2020s is to implement the positive policies they have signed up to, and not just internally but through their entire supply chains.\u201d Here\u2019s a clip of Charles\u2019 speech: The charge of hypocrisy is never far away when the global elite start to lecture us all. So here\u2019s the Daily Mail\u2019s take: Charles took a private jet to Davos - which will produce 6 tonnes of carbon per passenger compared to 0.19 tonnes on a commercial flight - Charles jumped in an electric Jaguar at St Gallen airport to drive the two hours to the World Economic Forum, shunning a fuel-guzzling helicopter used by most VIPs. I caught up with Jos Dijsselhof, the CEO of Swiss financial services company SIX, as Charles left the stage. Dijsselhof says the Prince of Wales is obviously \u201cpersonally very engaged\u201d on this issue. And this year, he might get a good reception: Now more than ever, people will listen. Q: But will people actually act on sustainability and climate? Dijsselhof says there\u2019s more to do: The truth is in the action, always, and I think we need to move a lot of things much faster. Well! Charles ends his speech by calling on the business leaders here in Davos to help. Channelling Greta Thunberg (who we hear he\u2019s meeting next), the Prince says: Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink? We need the private sector lead the world out of the calamity, he says, concluding: \u201cThe only limit is our willingness to act and the time to act is now\u201d. Nature is not a new asset class. It is the lifeblood of our markets, says Charles, as he tries to drum up support in the hall for his vision. We must change our economy to mimic nature\u2019s economy, and work with it, he says. The prince reminds us that he has cared about this issue for a very long time (he was an early advocate for organic food, and his Poundbury estate is designed on sustainable principles) Finally, we are ready to change our trajectory, Charles hopes. He says he is going to be convening round tables. A lot. Covering issues including aviation, water, carbon capture and storage , shipping, plastics, renewable energy, fishing, cement, steel, and agriculture (i missed a few, sorry). At the end of which I will probably be dead, Charles jokes. Charles has some suggestions for business leaders to help deliver the bio-economy, and create new markets. He says investors should heed the demand for green investments, which often outstrips supply, he says. On aviation, he suggests hydrogen-powered planes could come to market within a decade For shipping: greener engines could be introduced in a few years if manufacturers and regulators work together Charles has arrived at WEF with a 10-point plan to make the global economy more sustainable, and tackle the climate emergency. 1) We need to put nature and the protection of nature\u2019s capital at the heart of how we operate. 2) We need responsible pathways to decarbonise to reach net zero. It is time for governments and businesses to set a clear plan for how they will decarbonise, 3) reimagine industries through the lens of sustainable market, circular bio-economy 4) Identify gamechangers and barriers -- eg policies or regulations that need to change. Bringing the right people together to push change through -- Charles says his new initiative can play a role here 5) remove perverse subsidies that prevent the economy becoming more sustainable. The future King drifts close to fiscal policy here, calling for changes to \u201ctaxes, policies and regulations in a way that catalyses sustainable markets\u201d. Charles also cites the \u201cPolluter pays\u201d principle (under which companies which mess up the environment pick up the bill) 6) Invest in STEM and research and development, to help bring emerging technologies to market. 7) invest in nature as an economic driver. 8) Unified metrics to measure environmental, social and governance standards - to provide transparency to company\u2019s supply chains 9) Make it easier for consumers to see which products are ethical and sustainable 10) Realign investing, so that it can support sustainability. There are trillions of dollars in pension funds, sovereign wealth funds looking for projects with long-term value and rate of return, Charles says - so they should be directed towards sustainable initiatives. Prince Charles says that after discussing sustainability with experts for decades, he understands that we need a new economic model (that sounds a bit radical!). It\u2019s not a lack of capital holding us back, but it\u2019s how we deploy it, he says. That\u2019s why he\u2019s launching the Sustainable Markets Initiative and Council. Charles says new employment options, entirely new industries, will appear in future, and a sustainable approach will help us get there. It\u2019s time to hear from Prince Charles now.... nearly 30 years since he last addressed Davos. His Royal Highness takes the stage, saying he\u2019s \u201cMost touched\u201d to be here on the 50th anniversary of the World Economic . We are in the midst of a crisis which is now, he hopes, well understood. Global warming and species loss is the greatest crisis which mankind has faced, and one it has largely caused itself. Frankly it has been a bit of an uphill struggle pushing environmental issues and corporate responsibility, Charles says wryly. But now, it\u2019s time to push on to the next level. Al Gore also points out that \u201cpolitical will is itself a renewable resource\u201d. Former US vice-president Al Gore is urging Davos delegates to act on the climate emergency. The situation is much worse than people recognise, and getting worse much faster than people recognise, Gore warns. He calls it a \u201cchallenge to our moral imagination\u201d, comparing it to famous battles: This is Thermopylae. This is Agincourt. This is Dunkirk. This is the Battle of the Bulge. This is 9/11. Interesting... And with that, Donald Trump, his entourage, and the White House press pack, have left Davos...after making quite a stir. President Trump\u2019s press conference ended with more discussion about impeachment. He repeated laid into Adam Schiff, one of the impeachment managers, for \u2018lying\u2019 about the Ukraine phone call. Trump also argues that Bill Clinton shouldn\u2019t have been impeached. And when asked whether he\u2019ll attend the impeachment, Trump says he\u2019d love to sit in the front row and stare at the \u201ccorrupt faces\u201d conducting the probe (but doesn\u2019t actually appear to be planning a visit). But his highly critical comments about Europe may cause alarm.... Donald Trump then turns to the UK, and hails prime minister Johnson as a fellow sufferer of EU negotiations. The US president predicts that Boris Johnson is going to \u201ccome out great\u201d from the Brexit negotiations with the EU. Trump says: They [the EU] are actually more difficult to do business with than China. All you have to do is ask Boris. But I think Boris is going to be OK too. I think he\u2019s going to come out great. He\u2019s got a lot of guts. He\u2019s done a terrific job. They\u2019re in a good position, which they would never have been able to do before Boris. Ouch. Trump has taken a swipe at the EU. Asked about the prospects of a trade deal with Europe, Trump tells his press conference that the EU is actually harder to work with than China. He says he hoped to sort out China before turning to Europe, is unhappy that the EU imposes trade barriers that hurt US companies. This which makes a trade deal tough. But, Trump says he\u2019s still hoping to have a deal by the election. This is an astonishing reaction to being asked about the climate emergency.... Trump is also batting away questions about the impeachment hearing which began this week. We\u2019re going very well. The defence team are doing a good job, says Trump, insisting that there\u2019s nothing untoward in his call with the Ukrainian president. But he won\u2019t say whether he thinks abuse of power is an impeachable offence. Unexpectedly, Donald Trump is giving a press conference in Davos now. It\u2019s a wide-ranging event. Trump is criticising the WTO for treating the US unfairly, and hitting out at the impeachment trial as \u201cthe greatest witch hunt\u201d. Democrats have been driven crazy by record numbers on unemployment, the tremendous success in the economy, Trump insists (reminder: the US has actually grown fairly slowly in recent quarters, at around 2%) Q: You had to share the limelight yesterday with Greta Thunberg -- what did you think of her comments, and are you a climate change sceptic? Trump asks how old Greta is, and is told she\u2019s 17. She beat me to the front cover of Time Magazine, Trump replies (somewhat irrelevantly) He denies that he doesn\u2019t take the climate seriously, but criticises activists calling for dramatic change: Some people put it at a level that is unrealistic, to a point where you can\u2019t live your lives We want the cleanest water and air on earth, Trump continues. And he then points the finger towards other countries where pollution levels are rising. Greta ought to focus on those places, Trump says, hinting that China should do more on the environment. We have a beautiful Pacific Ocean, and refuse from other countries is floating towards us, Trump says. Elsewhere in Davos, Ivanka Trump has taken part in a press conference. The president\u2019s daughter (and special advisor) spoke about upskilling, and the need to help workers gain new skills. Steven Mnuchin\u2019s message was pretty clear -- impose a tax on US tech firms and we\u2019ll slap a tariff on your car makers. He wasn\u2019t explicit about the threat to the UK today, but we can imagine the tone of those \u201cprivate conversations\u201d that will be taking place . Here\u2019s some reaction: The chancellor may need that glass of champagne, despite Boris Johnson\u2019s ban on ministers quaffing fizz at Davos. The UK and US appear to be heading for a bust-up over this digital sales tax, I fear, unless there is a global agreement quickly. Sajid Javid\u2019s message was clear: the UK hasn\u2019t backed down (yet anyway), and will impose a 2% levy on tech giants from April. That\u2019s despite Steven Mnuchin\u2019s clear unhappiness, and his coded threat to slap tariffs on UK cars. Last night, the US treasury secretary warned that Britain and Italy should drop the plan, following France\u2019s lead. Menacingly, Mnuchin dropped this hand-grenade: \u201cIf not they\u2019ll find themselves faced with President Trump\u2019s tariffs. We\u2019ll be having similar conversations with them.\u201d There is still hope though. Intensive talks have been going on for days, involving the OECD, Paris and Washington. If that brings a multinational deal closer, peace could yet break out... Other key points: Javid is holding firm in the face of criticism from UK firms about Brexit divergence, insisting it made sense not to stick to EU rules. He insists that a comprehensive EU trade deal can be done by December -- having just taken the temperature of fellow finance minsters at the Ecofin meeting earlier this week. But the chancellor also got a taste of how tough the Brexit talks will be, when Mnuchin said he was \u2018a little disappointed\u2019 not to be first in line for a trade deal with the UK. It\u2019s never wise to disappoint the White House, even though it clearly makes sense to address trading relations with Europe ASAP. NEWSFLASH: Sajid Javid insists that the UK plans to introduce its digital sales tax in April. That\u2019s despite the rumblings of discontent from America, and the threat of painful new tariffs on UK exports. The UK chancellor says countries around the world need to work together and agree a plan for a fairer tax system \u201cThis year could be the year of change,\u201d Javid says optimistically. Q: So will you introduce it in April, as planned, even though the US might impose tariffs? Put on the spot, Javid says the government will press on with the plan (to impose a new 2% tax rate against the sales that large digital companies make in the UK.) But he also points out that the tax would \u201cfall away\u201d if there was an international deal. We plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in April. It is a proportionate tax, and a tax that is deliberately designed as a temporary tax. It will fall away when there is an international agreement. [Background: we reported last night that the US and France will hold talks today on whether Paris abandons its own digital tax, after Donald Trump threatened retaliatory tariffs on cars] Steven Mnuchin is asked whether the US would impose tariffs on UK car firms, if Boris Johnson introduces a digital tax on American tech firms. We are going to have some private conversations, Mnuchin replies, adding: This is an important issue that we\u2019ll deal with. There\u2019s then a show of hands in the audience -- showing that a majority don\u2019t support unilateral taxes (on tech firms such as Amazon and Facebook) IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva says tech firms need to pay a fair share of tax, but there needs to be a multinational agreement. Sajid Javid is now challenged about his recent warning that the UK won\u2019t be aligned with the EU after Brexit, despite what many businesses hoped. As we leave there is bound to be change, Javid insists. There is no point leaving the EU and keeping all its rules, he adds, talking about how the UK will become a more pro-business economy after Brexit. UBS\u2019s chairman Axel Weber wades in too, saying that the UK and EU can reach a deal in time. But.... It won\u2019t be a status-quo preserving agreement. It\u2019s a phasing out deal. Weber says he is very optimistic, as it\u2019s in the interests of both parties to reach a deal. But it may not tick the boxes for everyone, he warns. Q: But most senior politicians in the EU think you\u2019re living on another planet if you think you can get a comprehensive trade deal by the end of the year. Sajid Javid, who met fellow finance ministers in Brussels yesterday, insists it can \u201cabsolutely be done\u2019 before the transition period ends in December. He tells his audience in Davos that the UK is leaving the EU in nine days, and both sides are keen to strike a wide-ranging trade deal before 2021. Javid says: There is a strong belief on both sides that it can be done. Both sides recognise that it\u2019s a tight timetable, a lot needs to be done. It can be done, And it can be done for both goods where we want to see zero tariffs and zero quotas, and also services. Chancellor Sajid Javid says the UK is a passionate believer in free trade, and sees it as a way of lowering prices in the UK. The UK wants a comprehensive new free trade agreement with the EU, he states. The principles have been agreed, there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, but we\u2019re off to a good start. And on the US, we\u2019re working closely together. And it\u2019s a huge priority for us, Javid adds. A trade agreement between the 6th largest economy in the world and the largest economy in the world could benefit all consumers in terms of jobs and prices. It\u2019s hugely important. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva is very critical of the impact of trade wars on the global economy. Growth is \u2018anaemic\u2019, she says, forcing the IMF to cut its growth forecasts despite recent signs of peace in the trade war. The IMF will keep lobbying for trade, she insists. Historically we know trade is good for growth, good for jobs, and good for low-income people in all countries. Mnuchin hits back, saying we shouldn\u2019t use emotive language like \u201cpeace\u201d when talking about trade. For me, it\u2019s about free, fair and balanced trade, Mnuchin says. America is trying to break down trade barriers, he insists. It\u2019s not about putting up Berlin Walls....We want other people to take down their Berlin Walls. Mnuchin adds that Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on China have worked, leading to the Phase One trade deal signed this month. Tariffs may come off in future, if further trade deals are reached, Mnchin adds. But he\u2019s very relaxed about whether that happens before, or after, the November presidential election. Ouch! Steven Mnuchin tells Sajid Javid that US administration is \u2018disappointed\u2019 not to be first in line for a trade deal. The US treasury secretary says: I know we are very much looking forward to a new trade agreement with the UK. That is a big priority of ours for this year. But then, turning to Javid alongside him on the panel, Mnuchin adds: I was pleased to see that you said you\u2019d do us and Europe at the same time. I was a little disappointed, I thought we\u2019d go first. They might be a little harder to deal with then we are anyway. Sajid Javid\u2019s panel session at Davos is starting now. He\u2019s sitting with IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, and UBS chairmen Axxel Weber. CNBC\u2019s Geoff Cutmore, who is chairing the panel, starts by congratulating Javid on breaking Boris Johnson\u2019s ban on ministers attending Davos. Thank you very much for coming, and drinking champagne with billionaires here at the World Economic Forum. The panel is on the issue of financial markets, and how to make them more resilient in the face of systemic risks and technology changes. Javid has experience here, though his time as a managing director at Deutsche Bank before the financial crisis..... Across Davos, European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has been talking about the EU\u2019s new Green Deal. The EU hopes to become the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral continent by 2050, Gabriel calls this goal: The greatest challenge and opportunity of our time. But, echoing Greta Thunberg\u2019s speech yesterday, she warns progress isn\u2019t being made fast enough. The hope is here, the need to work very hard It\u2019s time for action, it\u2019s time to speed up. It\u2019s time to deliver, and its time to co-operate and build synergies. It\u2019s about our children, it\u2019s about our planet. As he arrived, Trump theatrically told reporters that \u201cwe have a great case\u201d when asked about the impeachment trial that began yesterday: US president Donald Trump has arrived back at the Davos congress centre for another day of meetings. Mark Carney seems to be on Greta Thunberg\u2019s side in her spat with Donald Trump over the climate emergency. Speaking at Bloomberg\u2019s green event at Davos, Carney says Thunberg is right to point out that the world is rapidly using up its remaining carbon budget and that the US stance makes tackling global heating more difficult. Asked whether a common understanding is more difficult without the US Carney says: \u201cIt is certainly more difficult. But, the Bank of England governor adds that some of the leading thinking on climate crisis is coming from US financial sector and tech companies. On Thunberg Carney says: There have been many positive contributions from Greta Thunberg. He points to Thunberg\u2019s argument that climate science shows that the world has only eight years of emitting carbon at its current rate if there is to be a 67% chance of limiting global temperatures increase to 1.5 degrees centigrade. \u201cThat\u2019s a legitimate point to make.\u201d Carney has been made Boris Johnson\u2019s special adviser for the crucial COP 26 climate conference in Glasgow in December. He tells his audience that Johnson understands the challenge: \u201cThe prime minister is very focused on this. The full weight of the Government will be engaged with it.\u201d Visiting the World Economic Forum is notoriously expensive, with hotels in very short supply. But even so, the cost of Donald Trump\u2019s visit is eye-watering, at over $4m according to Quartz. That includes more than $700,000 on car rentals (including $34,000 on vehicles for Ivanka Trump alone). No wonder the streets of Davos were chockablock last night, as the world\u2019s wealthy and important were (slowly) chauffeured home (we walked, of course). Quartz explains: The expenditure is posted to a publicly-accessible federal database under the heading, \u201cWEF2020 USSS MARVEL RENTAL OF VEHICLES,\u201d using Ivanka\u2019s Secret Service code name. All payments are being picked up by taxpayers through the State Department budget. Additional rental car expenses in Davos include $736,000 by the White House travel office, and two more hotel bookings for the president\u2019s entourage\u2014one for $286,000, and one for $29,000\u2014have now combined to make Team Trump\u2019s two-day jaunt to Davos the priciest yet. The total does not include security costs, salaries, or the estimated $2.2 million necessary to fly Air Force One round-trip between the US and Zurich and the Marine One helicopter flight from Zurich to Davos. There\u2019s a certain amount of confusion about Sajid Javid\u2019s movements in Davos, but we\u2019ve been told he\u2019s definitely here. Rebecca English of the Daily Mail has some details of Prince Charles\u2019s speech later today: An addition to the agenda: UK chancellor Sajid Javid is appearing on a panel about the future of financial markets. Details here. It\u2019s 10.30am in Davos (9.30am GMT), along with US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, and UBS\u2019s Axel Weber. Some early headlines from Mark Carney: Full details shortly... Here\u2019s what happened yesterday in Davos, from Greta Thunberg\u2019s call for action to Donald Trump\u2019s dinner with top CEOs. Good morning from Davos, where the second day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. The climate emergency is one of the big stories at Davos this year, even if the world\u2019s most powerful man hasn\u2019t grasped the issue. Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor, is discussing the issue in here in Davos shortly, on a Bloomberg panel. He\u2019s just been appointed as the UK government\u2019s advisor for the next climate change conference (COP26), so could have some valuable insights. Former US vice-president Al Gore is also in town, speaking with climate scientists about the urgent need to The British Royal Family will continue its relationship with Davos, when Prince Charles will launch his Sustainable Markets Council (SMC). It\u2019s a project to help financial markets become more sustainable. ITV News explains: Charles, who last attended Davos in 1992, created the SMC in June 2019, with the support of the World Economic Forum, to accelerate a transition to sustainable markets and a decarbonised global economy. The SMC will connect business and charity leaders with philanthropists and sustainability experts to encourage greener future investments. EC president Ursula von der Leyen is addressing delegates, as is Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez, Pakistan\u2019s Imran Khan and Iraq\u2019s Barham Salih. There could also be trade developments, with France close to dropping its plan to tax big US tech companies unilaterally. In return, we hear, they\u2019d like Washington help find a multilateral solution to the issue. Davos has also been rattled by the news that suspected Russian agents were caught here last year, pretending to be plumbers.... Basically there\u2019s masses going on at WEF today. Here\u2019s the programme, and here\u2019s what we\u2019ll be trying to cover The agenda: 8.40am Davos / 7.40am GMT: Mark Carney and Christiana Figueres on the climate emergency 10.15am Davos / 9.15am GMT: Google CEO Sunder Pichai on AI and quantum computing 11am Davos / 10.30am GMT: Special address by Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez 11.30am Davos / 10.30am GMT: Special address by EC president Ursula von der Leyen 2.40pm Davos / 1.40pm GMT: Prince Charles launches his Sustainable Markets Council 3.45pm Davos / 2.45pm GMT: Special address by Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan 4pm Davos / 3pm GMT: Protecting the Arctic, with Al Gore and Finland\u2019s PM Sanna Marin 6pm Davos / 5pm GMT: Special address by Iraq\u2019s president, Barham Salih",

      "bodyText": "Nine people have died and four are missing after Storm Gloria continued to batter eastern Spain with high winds, heavy rain, snowfall and huge waves. The storm, which had left 220,000 people in the Tarragona region without electricity on Tuesday, began to shift away on Wednesday, but some north-eastern and Balearic areas remained on orange alert. A man died of hypothermia in Carcaixent, Valencia on Wednesday, while a woman was killed in Alicante province when her home collapsed. A farmer in Almer\u00eda died after becoming trapped in a greenhouse during a hailstorm and another man was found dead in a flooded area a few miles inland from Benidorm. Gloria had claimed five other lives between Sunday and Tuesday with winds of up to 90 mph (144kmh) and waves up to 13.5 metres (44 feet) high. One man was run over as he put snowchains on his car tyres in Asturias on Sunday, while another man died after being hit by a roof tile in \u00c1vila the same day. Three other people are thought to have died of hypothermia in Valencia on Monday and Tuesday. Rescuers are still searching for four missing people, among them a 25-year-old Briton who disappeared while riding his motorbike in northern Ibiza. A spokesman for the emergency services said police were alerted by his colleague who had gone to search for him after the Briton \u2013 who was on a day off \u2013 failed to return from the trip. The colleague could only find his bike, the spokesman added. Dani Palacios, the head of beach services for Barcelona in the north-east, told the local broadcaster Betev\u00e9 that Gloria was the worst sea storm since 2003 and probably this century. The wild weather also brought seawater pouring into the Ebro delta, one of Spain\u2019s most important wetlands, inundating thousands of hectares of rice plants. \u201cWe can\u2019t remember anything similar ever happening,\u201d the local mayor, Lluis Soler, told Cadena SER radio. \u201cIt\u2019s dramatic to see how the river has overflowed and the sea has travelled kilometres inland.\u201d Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, offered his support and condolences to the families of those killed \u201cand to those who are suffering the fatal consequences of this stormy weather\u201d. He also thanked the country\u2019s emergency services for their efforts. Reuters and the Press Association contributed to this report",

As we leave the EU we will lose even the inadequate protection of EU regulation. Unless new and stronger measures are introduced soon, the situation could get much worse. And ironically the threat is looming during a great revival in open-water activity. The news about the River Wharfe coincides with an announcement by the City of London about rising demand for the swimming ponds it manages. Surely the answer to that demand is to improve conditions in the Thames and its tributaries, just as the solution to the polluted Wharfe is not to restrict swimming but to stop pollution and clean up other rivers.

The serial wildlife criminal has been arrested five times on three different continents, and in 2018 he was caught at Heathrow in possession of 19 eggs worth an estimated \u00a3100,000.

He was sentenced to three years and one month in UK prison. However, he now faces extradition to Brazil, where he was arrested in 2015 trying to board a flight from S\u0101o Paulo to Johannesburg with rare eggs. At Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday, Lendrum appeared via videolink from HMP Wandsworth for an extradition case management hearing. Outlining potential complications to the request, Florence Iveson, representing Lendrum, pointed out that Brazilian authorities planned to hold him in a cell with more than 20 other prisoners, with each having an average of around 2.25 sq metres of space. \u201cIn the history of Brazilian extradition matters, there has been a failure to ultimately provide suitable assurances,\u201d Iveson said. Lendrum skipped bail in Brazil in 2016 after a judge sentenced him to four years and six months for his attempt to smuggle peregrine falcons out of the country. He had previously been jailed at Warwick crown court for 30 months in 2010 after trying to export peregrine falcon eggs from Birmingham airport to Dubai. The main drivers of egg poaching are wealthy clients in the Middle East, where peregrine falcons are in great demand for traditional falconry and can sell for thousands of dollars, according to the wildlife trade specialists Traffic. After 35 years serving the illicit trade in rare eggs, \u201cLendrum is a well-known name to conservation charities working on illegal bird trade issues\u201d, said Richard Thomas, a spokesperson for Traffic. Lendrum, once a member of the Rhodesian army\u2019s special forces, once used a helicopter during a theft in northern Quebec, hanging from a rope to get close to the nest, according to Joshua Hammer, in The Falcon Thief, the book he wrote about Lendrum\u2019s exploits.

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron reprimanded an Israeli security officer who apparently attempted to enter a French-owned church during a tour of Jerusalem, mirroring a similarly testy exchange in 1996 involving his predecessor Jacques Chirac. The French president was on a visit to the walled Old City on Wednesday before a Holocaust memorial event hosted by Israel on Thursday. Stopping to visit the church of St Anne, he was seen by journalists shouting at a man in the doorway. \u201cOutside, please,\u201d he said in English, according to a film taken by a reporter from Le Parisien. As a gift for his help in the Crimean war, the Ottoman Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid handed the basilica to the French emperor Napoleon III in 1856. Its grounds are still considered French territory. Israel captured and occupied all of Jerusalem in a 1967 war and later annexed the city, to outcry from the Palestinians who live in its eastern districts. Despite repeated diplomatic appeals, France and most world powers never recognised Israel\u2019s claims. Meanwhile, Paris\u2019s claim to the church remains in place. \u201cPlease respect the rules. They [have been in place] for centuries. They will not change with me,\u201d Macron said. In 1996, Chirac also lost his cool, shouting that his treatment by Israeli security agents was a \u201cprovocation\u201d. Filmed squeezed in a crowd of people, the former president angrily questioned an officer. \u201cWhat do you want? Me to go back to my plane and go back to France? Is that what you want?\u201d he said. Chirac later refused to enter St Anne until Israel security left. Israeli police and the domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, said in a joint statement on Wednesday it had been agreed in advance that a police officer and Shin Bet guard would escort Macron inside the church. The statement said that after Macron finished the visit \u201che apologised about the incident and shook hands with the security personnel\u201d.",

Aston Villa Women have appointed Big Website\u2019s Eni Aluko as their sporting director. \u201cI\u2019ve always been passionate about the women\u2019s game, its development and setting cultures that drive excellence,\u201d she said. North-west vibes man Marcus Rashford is rattling out optimistic chatter like no one\u2019s business. Not only does he think he\u2019ll be back from back-knack before the season is over, but he also believes Manchester United can qualify for Big Cup. Pep Guardiola is still drooling over the returning Aymeric Laporte\u2019s performance in Manchester City\u2019s 1-0 win over Sheffield United. \u201cFor me he\u2019s the best left-central defender in the world,\u201d parped Pep, conveniently ignoring Jack O\u2019Connell. Edinson Cavani will snub a move to Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea for a chance to impress serial stones-based gesticulator Diego Simeone at Atl\u00e9tico, if PSG ever let him leave. Ballymena United did \u201can Everton\u201d by conceding two goals in 85 knack-time seconds and gift the County Antrim Shield to Cliftonville in the final at Windsor Park. \u201cThat is as cruel a night as I have experienced,\u201d sobbed Ballymena boss David Jeffrey. And in what is definitely not a publicity stunt that we\u2019ve ended up participating in, third-tier Egyptian club 6 October have signed 74-year-old Eez Eldin Bahder and invited the Guinness Book of Records to come and watch him play in a league game. Presumably because he\u2019s obviously going to be a box-to-box midfield menace. STILL WANT MORE? Managers sacked when they were top of the league: it\u2019s this week\u2019s Knowledge. Is no David Luiz a more effective defensive tool than David Luiz? Barney Ronay gets philosophical. With no league goals in 2020, Spurs need a striker \u2026 and quick, writes Ben McAleer. Check out the latest European deals on our transfer window interactive. Oh, and if it\u2019s your thing \u2026 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace. And INSTACHAT, TOO! BOWLS!",

Many will attest to his humour, courtesy, wise counsel, urbane charm and friendship, despite having to cope with periods of ill health. He is survived by his wife, Stancee (nee Gill), whom he married in 1999.",

The biggest problem with the prime minister\u2019s shift towards blaming the states and doing all he can to avoid actual emissions cuts is he continues to make it even harder for future governments to undo his damage.</p> <p>Let us never again suggest this government might be about to take climate change seriously. Scott Morrison has taken the view that saying he believes in climate change is enough to avoid any suggestion that he is in fact a climate change denier.</p> <p>In reality he is like a bloke who says he is against drink-driving, but then tells his mates the way to drive home from the pub without getting caught by the cops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/22/scott-morrisons-senior-ministers-discuss-how-to-reposition-climate-policies\">Scott Morrison's senior ministers discuss how to reposition climate policies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one who believes in climate change would continue to boast of Australia\u2019s record on emissions reductions. And no one would also say, as he did on Tuesday on Sky News, \u201chazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so\u201d.</p> <p>And remember, he is not just talking about hazard reduction burning, but actual land clearing.</p> <p>I guess you can\u2019t have bushfires if you have no bush.</p> <p>The problem however is that the government\u2019s intransigence on climate change is not something that can just be forgotten should they lose the next election.</p> <p>C02 emitted in one year doesn\u2019t vanish when the calendar flips to 1 January \u2013 it remains in the atmosphere, and at a certain point the total amount will have us at a point of no return.</p> <p>All the talk about needing to cut emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 in order to keep temperatures from rising 1.5C over pre-industrial levels is based on the view of the world\u2019s \u201ccarbon budget\u201d and how much we have remaining.</p> <p>Think of it like having $1,500 to spend in a month. If you spend $50 a day, you\u2019ll be fine, but if you spend $75 a day, you will have to live on nothing for the last 10 days.</p> <p>The world is estimated to be able to emit a certain amount of cumulative emissions before we reach a point where hitting 1.5C and then 2C is inevitable.</p> <p>Given the amount the world has emitted since the industrial revolution, <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c\">the IPCC estimates</a> if we keep going at our current levels we will hit our budget limit for 1.5C in about 10 years.</p> <p>The recommendation for 45% cuts by 2030 and to 0% by 2050 are all based around keeping within the carbon budget.</p> <p>This means that the important thing is not being 45% below 2010 levels in 2030, but that a 45% cut by then should be enough \u2013 but only if we start now.</p> <p>If we start later, we will need deeper cuts, otherwise we will go over our carbon budget.</p> <p>It\u2019s also why Anthony Albanese\u2019s statement about future targets is a bit troubling.</p> <p>In his interview on <a href=\"https://anthonyalbanese.com.au/transcript-television-interview-sky-news-with-andrew-clennell-sunday-19-january-2020\">Sunday with Sky News\u2019s Andrew Clennell</a> he very much hedged about what the ALP\u2019s target for emissions cuts would be, and suggested \u201cI think it was a mistake in 2019 to continue to say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll do exactly what we\u2019re doing in 2015\u2019, as if it hadn\u2019t changed\u201d.</p> <p>He is right, but the problem is he does not seem to be indicating that what has changed means the cuts will have to be greater.</p> <p>The government currently is estimating the path to a 26% cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 will start from a level of 509 Mt C02e in 2020 and reduce emissions by 5.6Mt each year until hitting 452Mt in 2030.</p> <p>So in effect the government has stated its carbon budget for this decade is 5,286Mt.</p> <p>But the current projection is for us to emit 534Mt this year. So, straight off the bat we are 25Mt over budget. That necessarily means (assuming we want a nice linear path) if we are to keep within our budget we will have to end in 2030 at a level lower than 452Mt.</p> <p>In fact it would be 427Mt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Path of emissions (Mt C02-e) to 2030 to keep the same carbon budget if current projections remain\">  <iframe title=\"Path of emissions (Mt C02-e) to 2030 to keep the same carbon budget if current projections remain\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/j5fbU/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/19/anthony-albanese-says-labors-45-emissions-reduction-target-a-mistake\">Anthony Albanese flags 'ambitious' emissions target but won't recommit to 45% reduction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just how much deeper the cuts that are needed, the longer we go on our current projected path, is highlighted by comparing what is required if we keep going on our current projections to 2023 to the current path:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Keeping within the carbon budget and cutting to 26% of 2005\">  <iframe title=\"Keeping within the carbon budget and cutting to 26% of 2005\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/e4613/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>By 2023 on current projections, we will be 98Mt over budget and would need to target a path to 405Mt by 2030 just to keep within our 10-year budget.</p> <p>The problem for the ALP is this makes getting to 45% even tougher.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say they win in 2022. It would be difficult to make any great changes that come into effect before the end of 2023, so let\u2019s lock in the projections until then.</p> <p>Given a 45% cut means a smaller 10-year budget (just 4,675Mt), this would mean to keep within that budget we would need to have a 2030 target of just 252Mt \u2013 some 59% below 2005 levels:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Keeping within the carbon budget and cutting to 45% of 2005\">  <iframe title=\"Keeping within the carbon budget and cutting to 45% of 2005\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4BEXJ/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the problem of course is that all includes land use. If we remove that dodgy accounting and keep our 45% target, it reduces our budget for this decade to just 4,487Mt.</p> <p>If the current projections stay in place till 2023, that means to keep within that budget we would need a target of around 180Mt in 2030 \u2013 or some 65% below 2005 levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Keeping within the carbon budget and cutting to 45% of 2005 (excl land use)\">  <iframe title=\"Keeping within the carbon budget and cutting to 45% of 2005 (excl land use)\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gIVP3/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The need for emissions cuts is urgent.

      "bodyText": "We are quickly running out of time to act on climate change because governments across the world, led by our own intransigent, denying government are failing to focus on cutting emissions. The biggest problem with the prime minister\u2019s shift towards blaming the states and doing all he can to avoid actual emissions cuts is he continues to make it even harder for future governments to undo his damage. Let us never again suggest this government might be about to take climate change seriously. Scott Morrison has taken the view that saying he believes in climate change is enough to avoid any suggestion that he is in fact a climate change denier. In reality he is like a bloke who says he is against drink-driving, but then tells his mates the way to drive home from the pub without getting caught by the cops. No one who believes in climate change would continue to boast of Australia\u2019s record on emissions reductions. And no one would also say, as he did on Tuesday on Sky News, \u201chazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so\u201d. And remember, he is not just talking about hazard reduction burning, but actual land clearing. I guess you can\u2019t have bushfires if you have no bush. The problem however is that the government\u2019s intransigence on climate change is not something that can just be forgotten should they lose the next election. C02 emitted in one year doesn\u2019t vanish when the calendar flips to 1 January \u2013 it remains in the atmosphere, and at a certain point the total amount will have us at a point of no return. All the talk about needing to cut emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 in order to keep temperatures from rising 1.5C over pre-industrial levels is based on the view of the world\u2019s \u201ccarbon budget\u201d and how much we have remaining. Think of it like having $1,500 to spend in a month. If you spend $50 a day, you\u2019ll be fine, but if you spend $75 a day, you will have to live on nothing for the last 10 days. The world is estimated to be able to emit a certain amount of cumulative emissions before we reach a point where hitting 1.5C and then 2C is inevitable. Given the amount the world has emitted since the industrial revolution, the IPCC estimates if we keep going at our current levels we will hit our budget limit for 1.5C in about 10 years. The recommendation for 45% cuts by 2030 and to 0% by 2050 are all based around keeping within the carbon budget. This means that the important thing is not being 45% below 2010 levels in 2030, but that a 45% cut by then should be enough \u2013 but only if we start now. If we start later, we will need deeper cuts, otherwise we will go over our carbon budget. It\u2019s also why Anthony Albanese\u2019s statement about future targets is a bit troubling. In his interview on Sunday with Sky News\u2019s Andrew Clennell he very much hedged about what the ALP\u2019s target for emissions cuts would be, and suggested \u201cI think it was a mistake in 2019 to continue to say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll do exactly what we\u2019re doing in 2015\u2019, as if it hadn\u2019t changed\u201d. He is right, but the problem is he does not seem to be indicating that what has changed means the cuts will have to be greater. The government currently is estimating the path to a 26% cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 will start from a level of 509 Mt C02e in 2020 and reduce emissions by 5.6Mt each year until hitting 452Mt in 2030. So in effect the government has stated its carbon budget for this decade is 5,286Mt. But the current projection is for us to emit 534Mt this year. So, straight off the bat we are 25Mt over budget. That necessarily means (assuming we want a nice linear path) if we are to keep within our budget we will have to end in 2030 at a level lower than 452Mt. In fact it would be 427Mt. Just how much deeper the cuts that are needed, the longer we go on our current projected path, is highlighted by comparing what is required if we keep going on our current projections to 2023 to the current path: By 2023 on current projections, we will be 98Mt over budget and would need to target a path to 405Mt by 2030 just to keep within our 10-year budget. The problem for the ALP is this makes getting to 45% even tougher. Let\u2019s say they win in 2022. It would be difficult to make any great changes that come into effect before the end of 2023, so let\u2019s lock in the projections until then. Given a 45% cut means a smaller 10-year budget (just 4,675Mt), this would mean to keep within that budget we would need to have a 2030 target of just 252Mt \u2013 some 59% below 2005 levels: But the problem of course is that all includes land use. If we remove that dodgy accounting and keep our 45% target, it reduces our budget for this decade to just 4,487Mt. If the current projections stay in place till 2023, that means to keep within that budget we would need a target of around 180Mt in 2030 \u2013 or some 65% below 2005 levels. The need for emissions cuts is urgent. We cannot wait until 2030, and the longer we wait, the more of our carbon budget we use and the faster and deeper the cuts will be needed to make. For all his blather about adaptation, as Morrison ignores the need for emissions cuts, he is not only letting down people now, he is ensuring it will be harder to adapt to a low carbon economy in the future. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

He is originally from the north of Italy, while his wife hails from the south.

(Yes, hers is the ultimate kitchen background music. There shall be no further debate here.) At worst, it is the road to realising you are the sort of person who cares about how others crush garlic. My boyfriend is regularly enraged by what he brands as my woeful inability to dice vegetables into perfectly even cubes, and what I call having a life. Meanwhile, Dusi is driven \u201cnuts\u201d by his wife\u2019s meticulous approach to quantities. \u201cWhen I open the fridge and I see, like, a fifth of an onion being carefully wrapped in clingfilm, I say: \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 and she says, \u2018Well, you know, I used enough for the recipe.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Try to remember that working as a team means you can make up for one another\u2019s weak points \u2013 along with maximising your skillset. After a \u201cvery competitive\u201d joint attempt at making an Ottolenghi sponge for a street bake-off, teacher Avi Leigh Bader realised that blending her presentation skills with her husband\u2019s command of flavours gave them an edge. (They came second.) If that is impossible, enlist company, says PR Rebecca Levy. She and her boyfriend have an open-plan kitchen and living space, \u201cso we can\u2019t bicker in front of our guests\u201d. You can also try to look the other way, she adds. \u201cMy trick is not to watch what he\u2019s doing. Then there will be less chance of me criticising the way he\u2019s chopping a carrot.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is it ever acceptable to criticise someone\u2019s shoddy techniques?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, but do it in a nice way, says Peter Beecham, a retired electrician. He has only got into making food in the past decade or so. Before that, his partner \u201chad spent years cooking and getting no thanks for it\u201d. Did she take revenge by pointing out his mistakes? \u201cShe\u2019d never say: \u2018You\u2019ve made a complete pig\u2019s ear of this.\u2019 She\u2019d just say: \u2018Ooh, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have cooked that quite so long; it would be better if you did it a bit less.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>However, McNicholas tries to bite her tongue before offering unsolicited advice, believing it is \u201cintensely annoying and often rude\u201d. Srulovich is of a similar mind: \u201cThe deal is this: if you criticise someone\u2019s cooking or cooking habits, you may as well do it yourself. When this is your outlook, you find yourself a lot less critical.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Does it help to nominate a head chef and a sous chef?</strong></h2> <p>Often, this happens naturally, says Beecham, who frequently acts as his partner\u2019s dogsbody, \u201cso when the meal is ready, there\u2019s not thousands of dirty bowls all over the place. I\u2019ve cleaned them all.\u201d Seeing as he is retired and his partner is not, he reckons it is fair that he gets the less glamorous tasks: \u201cThat\u2019s my job, in a way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/09/roast-kohlrabi-confit-duck-leg-pandan-coffee-pudding-recipe-yotam-ottolenghi-valentines-day\">Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day recipes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But what about when neither of you is willing to take a back seat? \u201cWe both try to be in control,\u201d says Dusi; he and his wife have fallen out \u201cmany times\u201d in the kitchen. McNicholas is also aware of the peril of combining two alpha cooks. \u201cThe worst cooking tiffs I\u2019ve had, and I\u2019ve had many, are probably with my dad. We have exactly the same nature when it comes to cooking: passionate and pedantic, which is an absolute recipe for disaster.\u201d</p> <p>No matter how hard you find it, most people seem to agree that it is best to establish some sort of hierarchy \u2013 or at least to define who is doing which tasks. \u201cSadly, the kitchen is not a democracy. Someone needs to be in charge or all hell will break loose,\u201d says Srulovich. \u201cHave a clear understanding of what\u2019s cooking, allocate the jobs well and make sure everyone knows what they are working towards.\u201d</p> <p>If all else fails, solicitor Kate Ashworth has a handy rule of thumb: \u201cYou are head chef in your own kitchen, sous chef in anyone else\u2019s kitchen.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Which dishes work best?</strong></h2> <p>Anything that benefits from a spare pair of hands. Ashworth suggests homemade pasta, while Srulovich points out: \u201cThings that need constant stirring, like polenta, can become less painful when someone is there to tag-team you.\u201d</p> <p>Lasagne is a popular suggestion. It is the cheat\u2019s version of group cooking, says Dusi. People can work on the white sauce, ragu and pasta individually \u201cand then at the end you can add the three things together and create this beautiful dish\u201d. Frankie Lewis backs it for a different reason. \u201cGrating the cheese is the best activity,\u201d she says. \u201cYou get to shove handfuls of it into your mouth while the other person is focused on the bechamel.\u201d</p>",

Meanwhile, Dusi is driven \u201cnuts\u201d by his wife\u2019s meticulous approach to quantities. \u201cWhen I open the fridge and I see, like, a fifth of an onion being carefully wrapped in clingfilm, I say: \u2018What the hell is this?\u2019 and she says, \u2018Well, you know, I used enough for the recipe.\u2019\u201d Try to remember that working as a team means you can make up for one another\u2019s weak points \u2013 along with maximising your skillset. After a \u201cvery competitive\u201d joint attempt at making an Ottolenghi sponge for a street bake-off, teacher Avi Leigh Bader realised that blending her presentation skills with her husband\u2019s command of flavours gave them an edge. (They came second.) If that is impossible, enlist company, says PR Rebecca Levy. She and her boyfriend have an open-plan kitchen and living space, \u201cso we can\u2019t bicker in front of our guests\u201d. You can also try to look the other way, she adds. \u201cMy trick is not to watch what he\u2019s doing. Then there will be less chance of me criticising the way he\u2019s chopping a carrot.\u201d Is it ever acceptable to criticise someone\u2019s shoddy techniques? Yes, but do it in a nice way, says Peter Beecham, a retired electrician. He has only got into making food in the past decade or so. Before that, his partner \u201chad spent years cooking and getting no thanks for it\u201d. Did she take revenge by pointing out his mistakes? \u201cShe\u2019d never say: \u2018You\u2019ve made a complete pig\u2019s ear of this.\u2019 She\u2019d just say: \u2018Ooh, maybe you shouldn\u2019t have cooked that quite so long; it would be better if you did it a bit less.\u2019\u201d However, McNicholas tries to bite her tongue before offering unsolicited advice, believing it is \u201cintensely annoying and often rude\u201d. Srulovich is of a similar mind: \u201cThe deal is this: if you criticise someone\u2019s cooking or cooking habits, you may as well do it yourself. When this is your outlook, you find yourself a lot less critical.\u201d Does it help to nominate a head chef and a sous chef? Often, this happens naturally, says Beecham, who frequently acts as his partner\u2019s dogsbody, \u201cso when the meal is ready, there\u2019s not thousands of dirty bowls all over the place. I\u2019ve cleaned them all.\u201d Seeing as he is retired and his partner is not, he reckons it is fair that he gets the less glamorous tasks: \u201cThat\u2019s my job, in a way.\u201d But what about when neither of you is willing to take a back seat? \u201cWe both try to be in control,\u201d says Dusi; he and his wife have fallen out \u201cmany times\u201d in the kitchen. McNicholas is also aware of the peril of combining two alpha cooks. \u201cThe worst cooking tiffs I\u2019ve had, and I\u2019ve had many, are probably with my dad. We have exactly the same nature when it comes to cooking: passionate and pedantic, which is an absolute recipe for disaster.\u201d No matter how hard you find it, most people seem to agree that it is best to establish some sort of hierarchy \u2013 or at least to define who is doing which tasks. \u201cSadly, the kitchen is not a democracy. Someone needs to be in charge or all hell will break loose,\u201d says Srulovich. \u201cHave a clear understanding of what\u2019s cooking, allocate the jobs well and make sure everyone knows what they are working towards.\u201d If all else fails, solicitor Kate Ashworth has a handy rule of thumb: \u201cYou are head chef in your own kitchen, sous chef in anyone else\u2019s kitchen.\u201d Which dishes work best? Anything that benefits from a spare pair of hands. Ashworth suggests homemade pasta, while Srulovich points out: \u201cThings that need constant stirring, like polenta, can become less painful when someone is there to tag-team you.\u201d Lasagne is a popular suggestion. It is the cheat\u2019s version of group cooking, says Dusi. People can work on the white sauce, ragu and pasta individually \u201cand then at the end you can add the three things together and create this beautiful dish\u201d. Frankie Lewis backs it for a different reason. \u201cGrating the cheese is the best activity,\u201d she says. \u201cYou get to shove handfuls of it into your mouth while the other person is focused on the bechamel.\u201d",

They\u2019re not a promise of solutions. Morrison has not said that temperatures will stabilise and the climate emergency will be averted. How could he? The only international mechanism currently in place stems from the Paris accords, the agreement by which the nations of the world pledged to keep global temperature rises below 2C. But Paris is palpably failing. None of the major powers will meet their targets \u2013 and no other plan exists. In democratic theory, the modern state legitimates itself through a simple bargain: we pay its taxes and obey its law. In return, it protects us and keeps us safe. The increasing inability of states to keep that pact in respect of climate will only become more obvious, exacerbating an already widespread cynicism about the political class. Paradoxically, a growing perception of state impotence will almost certainly be accompanied by ever more aggressive demonstrations of state power. In Australia, Morrison\u2019s supporters talk about fuel loads and arson. In part, the pivot away from climate represents a simple bait and switch. After the world recorded its second-hottest year ever, conversations about hazard reduction help drown out conversations about climate. But the new focus also shifts the debate in a direction the government likes. If environmental bureaucracy had prevented hazard reduction (it didn\u2019t), the answer lies in slashing green tape, an easy extension of an already existing ideological commitment to deregulation. More importantly, the identification of (a largely bogus) arson outbreak transforms an ecological crisis into a law and order problem, paving the way for new legislation and fresh penalties. And that\u2019s something the state can deliver. Think of Morrison\u2019s almost instant response to the needles-in-the-strawberry affair. Decrying fruit saboteurs as \u201ccowards\u201d and \u201cgrubs\u201d, the prime minister introduced harsh new laws that would send them to jail for as long as 15 years. More police powers and increased sentences play to the strengths of what Nietzsche called \u201cthe cold monster\u201d, allowing the leaders who announce them to sound stern and authoritative. Accordingly, in Australia in 2019, politicians spent more time discussing how best to punish environmental protesters than they did devising legislation that might protect the climate. Peter Dutton, for instance, called for activists to be \u201cshamed\u201d, jailed and cut off welfare. \u201cThese people are anarchists and fringe-dwellers and they should face the full force of the law,\u201d he said. No government minister used similar rhetoric about carbon polluters. Similarly, in Queensland, the Labor premier Annastacia Palaszczuk almost certainly can\u2019t deliver the jobs that rural supporters of Adani think the Carmichael coalmine will bring them (the employment promises keep shifting) and nor can she save the Great Barrier Reef (since that would entail stopping climate change). She can, however, rush through Joh-era style laws to jail Extinction Rebellion members. The state, by definition, possesses a monopoly on coercion. As a result, politicians incapable of any real policy agenda know they still unleash force. As Morrison himself says, the core responsibility of a prime minister is to \u201ckeep Australians safe\u201d. If the 2019-2020 fire season really does foreshadow the new normal on a warming planet, governments face a looming crisis of legitimacy, precisely because there\u2019s nothing safe about a country in flames. We\u2019re likely, then, to see politicians asserting authority in an all too traditional way, with an increasing resort to the rhetoric of national security. As I have argued previously, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine what Morrison\u2019s slogans of \u201cresilience and adaption\u201d might mean in the context of, say, climate refugees. For decades, we\u2019ve seen asylum seekers used as targets whenever a weak leader wants to look tough. Global heating will make future governments seem extraordinarily weak \u2013 even as a huge new wave of refugees arrives. In the midst of a genuine emergency, with the army already on the streets, the likely conjunction of climate and border politics does not bear thinking about. \u2022 Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Roger Federer arrived at the Australian Open without having played a match this year. He would have to play himself into form at the first grand slam of the season and he continued on the right track when he moved into the third round with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Filip Krajinovic. Any rust still clinging to Federer\u2019s game was not visible under the lights of Rod Laver Arena as he raced to a 5-0 lead in 15 minutes and maintained his level for three sets. Perhaps most importantly, he overcame a challenging second set. \u201cI\u2019m very happy, it\u2019s a great start to the season,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really relaxed out on court. You train hard and you hope it pays off and not that it was all for nothing this week. I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m still going.\u201d Novak Djokovic, after leading Serbia to the ATP Cup title in the second week of the year, is certainly not undercooked. The defending champion eased past Japan\u2019s Tatsuma Ito 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. Djokovic\u2019s display highlighted one of his most underrated improvements in recent years: his serve. The defending champion won 93% of points on his first serve and his second serve speed has also increased significantly. Last year he averaged around 96mph compared to 105mph on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s something I worked on in the off-season,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the priorities I guess of the training sessions, trying to get that advantage of winning a lot of easy points on the first serve.\u201d The eighth seed Matteo Berrettini lost 7-6 (7), 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 7-5 against Tennys Sandgren of the United States and the 18th seed Grigor Dimitrov was beaten 6-4, 7-6 (6), 3-6, 6-7 (3), 7-6 (10-3) by the 22-year-old American Tommy Paul. Alexander Zverev, who has been struggling on and off the court lately, said donating the $A4.12m winner\u2019s cheque from the Australian Open would make him the \u201chappiest person on the planet\u201d. The 23-year-old German said after making it through to the second round, \u201cI\u2019ve said it a lot of times, I\u2019m not a money-driven person. I play the sport because I absolutely love it. I play the sport because I enjoy playing on big stadium courts, I enjoy playing the toughest matches in front of an amazing crowd. \u201cIf I win the Australian Open I will be the happiest person on the planet. I think that the $4m will be in much better use in the hands that know what to do with it, and know how to help others.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>One morning Brian Cohen, completely naked, flung open the shutters at his bedroom window to find a mob below hailing him as the Messiah. Mrs Cohen, played by Terry Jones, who has died aged 77, had something to say about that. \u201cHe\u2019s not the Messiah. He\u2019s a very naughty boy,\u201d she told the disappointed crowd. It became a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_kKAeh6qyc\" title=\"\">classic cinema moment</a>.</p> \n<p>The 1979 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/monty-python-s-life-of-brian\" title=\"\">Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian</a>, a satire about an ordinary Jewish boy mistaken for the Messiah, which Jones directed and co-wrote with his fellow Pythons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/01/graham-chapman-monty-python-star-and-me\" title=\"\">Graham Chapman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/john-cleese\" title=\"\">John Cleese</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terry-gilliam\" title=\"\">Terry Gilliam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/nov/20/eric-idle-portrait-of-the-artist\" title=\"\">Eric Idle</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/michael-palin\" title=\"\">Michael Palin,</a> was banned by 39 British local authorities, and by Ireland and Norway. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/16/how-we-made-monty-python-life-of-brian-michael-palin-terry-gilliam\" title=\"\">Jones and his chums</a> were unrepentant: they even launched a Swedish poster campaign with the slogan: \u201cSo funny it was banned in Norway.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for Jones\u2019s performance as Mandy Cohen, it united two leading facets of the funnyman\u2019s repertoire: his fondness for female impersonation, and his passion for historical revisionism. The latter was evident not just in his work for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/04/monty-python-at-50-a-half-century-of-silly-walks-edible-props-and-dead-parrots\" title=\"\">Monty Python</a> \u2013 in which his historian\u2019s sensibility proved essential to the satire of Arthurian England in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/15/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-review-rerelease\" title=\"\">Monty Python and the Holy Grail </a>(1975), which he co-directed and co-wrote \u2013 but also in several documentaries and books in which he stood up for what he took to be the misrepresented Middle Ages.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe think of medieval England as being a place of unbelievable cruelty and darkness and superstition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think of it as all being about fair maidens in castles, and witch-burning, and a belief that the world was flat. Yet all these things are wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Arguably, without Jones, Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus (1969-74) would not have revolutionised British TV comedy. He was key in developing the show\u2019s distinctively trippy, stream-of-consciousness format, where each surreal set-up (the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FshU58nI0Ts\" title=\"\">Lumberjack Song</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1FfrnOXGHg\" title=\"\">upper-class twit of the year</a> show, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo\" title=\"\">the dead parrot</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XeDvKqI4E\" title=\"\">fish-slapping dance</a>) flowed into the next, unpunctuated by punchlines.</p> \n<p>For all his directorial flair, though, Jones may well be best remembered for creating such characters as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA8xTGP_M8g\" title=\"\">Arthur \u201cTwo Sheds\u201d Jackson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAxkcPoLYcQ\" title=\"\">Cardinal Biggles of the Spanish Inquisition</a>, the Scottish poet <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R62giN_56z0\" title=\"\">Ewan McTeagle</a> and the monstrous musician rodent beater in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saY10AWXLIY\" title=\"\">mouse organ sketch</a> who hits specially tuned mice with mallets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2506868ea8ba05494070c69ac13d72efdbc740eb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2506868ea8ba05494070c69ac13d72efdbc740eb/0_50_1828_1097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Jones and John Cleese in The Meaning of Life (1983).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Jones, left, and John Cleese in The Meaning of Life (1983), in which he made, perhaps, his most disgusting appearance, as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxRnenQYG7I\">Mr Creosote</a>.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Thanks to the show\u2019s success, Jones was able to diversify into working as a writer, poet, librettist, film director, comedian, actor and historian. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky to have been able to act, write and direct and not have to choose just the one thing,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>Jones was a second world war baby, born in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, and brought up by his mother, Dilys (nee Newnes), and grandmother, while his father, Alick Jones, was stationed with the RAF in India. He recalled meeting his father for the first time when he returned from war service: \u201cThrough plumes of steam at the end of the platform, he appeared \u2013 this lone figure in a forage cap and holding a kit bag. He ran over and kissed my mum, then my brother, then bent down and picked me up and planted one right on me. I\u2019d only ever been kissed by the smooth lips of a lady up until that point, so his bristly moustache was quite disturbing.\u201d</p> \n<p>When he was four, the family moved to Surrey so his father could take up an appointment as a bank clerk. Terry attended primary school in Esher and the Royal Grammar school in Guildford. He studied English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and developed a lifelong interest in medieval history as a result of reading Chaucer.</p> \n<p>At Oxford, he started the Experimental Theatre Company with his friend and contemporary Michael Rudman, performing everything from Brecht to cabaret. He also met Palin and the historian Robert Hewson, and collaborated with them on a satire on the death penalty called Hang Down Your Head and Die. It was set in a circus ring, with Jones playing the condemned man. He and Palin then worked together on the Oxford Revue, a satirical sketch show they performed at the 1964 Edinburgh festival, where he met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\" title=\"\">David Frost</a> as well as Chapman, Idle and Cleese.</p> \n<p>After graduation, he was hired as a copywriter for Anglia Television and then taken on as a script editor at the BBC, where he worked as joke writer for BBC2\u2019s Late Night Line-Up (1964-72). Jones and Palin became fixtures on the booming TV satire scene, writing for, among other BBC shows, The Frost Report (1966-67) and The Kathy Kirby Show (1964), as well as the ITV comedy sketch series Do Not Adjust Your Set (1967-69).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a8c82c86605fe4621bfbc5d60d5f2d5d8f4d5fb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a8c82c86605fe4621bfbc5d60d5f2d5d8f4d5fb/0_57_1804_1082/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Jones and Graham Chapman in Monty Python\u2019s Life Of Brian (UK 1979)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Jones, right, and Graham Chapman in Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian (1979), which was banned by 39 British local authorities, Ireland and Norway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Python/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1967, he and Palin were invited to write and perform for Twice a Fortnight, a BBC sketch show that provided a training ground not only for a third of the Pythons (Jones and Palin), but two-thirds of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/mar/01/comedy.television\" title=\"\">the Goodies</a> (Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie) and the co-creator of the 1980s political sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/18/yes-minister-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Yes Minister</a>, Jonathan Lynn.</p> \n<p>Jones and Palin wrote and starred in The Complete and Utter History of Britain (1969) for LWT. Its conceit was to relate historical incidents as if TV had existed at the time. In one sketch, Samuel Pepys was a chat show host; in another, a young couple of ancient Britons looking for their first home were shown around the brand-new Stonehenge. \u201cIt\u2019s got character, charm \u2013 and a slab in the middle,\u201d said the estate agent.</p> \n<p>In the same year, he became one of the six founders of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. They expected the show to be quickly decommissioned by BBC bosses. \u201cEvery episode we\u2019d be there biting our nails hoping someone might find it funny. Right up until the middle of the second series John Cleese\u2019s mum was still sending him job adverts for supermarket managers cut out from her local newspaper,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cIt was only when they started receiving sackfuls of correspondence from school kids saying they loved it that we knew we were saved.\u201d</p> \n<p>After Python finished its run on TV, Jones went on to direct several films with the troupe. The first, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, was, he recalled, \u201ca disaster when we first showed it. The audiences would laugh for the first five minutes and then silence, nothing. So we re-cut it. Then we\u2019d show it in different cities, saying, \u2018We\u2019re worried about our film, would you come and look at it?\u2019 And as a result people would come and they\u2019d all be terribly worried about it too, so it was a nightmare.\u201d</p> \n<p>He had more fun co-writing and directing two series for the BBC called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/29/ripping-yarns-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Ripping Yarns</a> (1976-79) in which Palin starred as a series of heroic characters in mock-adventure stories, among them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX-sUg_QQuE\" title=\"\">Across the Andes by Frog</a>, and Roger of the Raj, sending up interwar literature aimed at schoolboys.</p> \n<p>Jones directed and starred in Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian, which some religious groups denounced for supposedly mocking Christianity.

      "bodyText": "One morning Brian Cohen, completely naked, flung open the shutters at his bedroom window to find a mob below hailing him as the Messiah. Mrs Cohen, played by Terry Jones, who has died aged 77, had something to say about that. \u201cHe\u2019s not the Messiah. He\u2019s a very naughty boy,\u201d she told the disappointed crowd. It became a classic cinema moment. The 1979 film Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian, a satire about an ordinary Jewish boy mistaken for the Messiah, which Jones directed and co-wrote with his fellow Pythons Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle and Michael Palin, was banned by 39 British local authorities, and by Ireland and Norway. Jones and his chums were unrepentant: they even launched a Swedish poster campaign with the slogan: \u201cSo funny it was banned in Norway.\u201d As for Jones\u2019s performance as Mandy Cohen, it united two leading facets of the funnyman\u2019s repertoire: his fondness for female impersonation, and his passion for historical revisionism. The latter was evident not just in his work for Monty Python \u2013 in which his historian\u2019s sensibility proved essential to the satire of Arthurian England in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), which he co-directed and co-wrote \u2013 but also in several documentaries and books in which he stood up for what he took to be the misrepresented Middle Ages. \u201cWe think of medieval England as being a place of unbelievable cruelty and darkness and superstition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think of it as all being about fair maidens in castles, and witch-burning, and a belief that the world was flat. Yet all these things are wrong.\u201d Arguably, without Jones, Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus (1969-74) would not have revolutionised British TV comedy. He was key in developing the show\u2019s distinctively trippy, stream-of-consciousness format, where each surreal set-up (the Lumberjack Song, the upper-class twit of the year show, the dead parrot, or the fish-slapping dance) flowed into the next, unpunctuated by punchlines. For all his directorial flair, though, Jones may well be best remembered for creating such characters as Arthur \u201cTwo Sheds\u201d Jackson, Cardinal Biggles of the Spanish Inquisition, the Scottish poet Ewan McTeagle and the monstrous musician rodent beater in the mouse organ sketch who hits specially tuned mice with mallets. Thanks to the show\u2019s success, Jones was able to diversify into working as a writer, poet, librettist, film director, comedian, actor and historian. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky to have been able to act, write and direct and not have to choose just the one thing,\u201d he said. Jones was a second world war baby, born in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, and brought up by his mother, Dilys (nee Newnes), and grandmother, while his father, Alick Jones, was stationed with the RAF in India. He recalled meeting his father for the first time when he returned from war service: \u201cThrough plumes of steam at the end of the platform, he appeared \u2013 this lone figure in a forage cap and holding a kit bag. He ran over and kissed my mum, then my brother, then bent down and picked me up and planted one right on me. I\u2019d only ever been kissed by the smooth lips of a lady up until that point, so his bristly moustache was quite disturbing.\u201d When he was four, the family moved to Surrey so his father could take up an appointment as a bank clerk. Terry attended primary school in Esher and the Royal Grammar school in Guildford. He studied English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and developed a lifelong interest in medieval history as a result of reading Chaucer. At Oxford, he started the Experimental Theatre Company with his friend and contemporary Michael Rudman, performing everything from Brecht to cabaret. He also met Palin and the historian Robert Hewson, and collaborated with them on a satire on the death penalty called Hang Down Your Head and Die. It was set in a circus ring, with Jones playing the condemned man. He and Palin then worked together on the Oxford Revue, a satirical sketch show they performed at the 1964 Edinburgh festival, where he met David Frost as well as Chapman, Idle and Cleese. After graduation, he was hired as a copywriter for Anglia Television and then taken on as a script editor at the BBC, where he worked as joke writer for BBC2\u2019s Late Night Line-Up (1964-72). Jones and Palin became fixtures on the booming TV satire scene, writing for, among other BBC shows, The Frost Report (1966-67) and The Kathy Kirby Show (1964), as well as the ITV comedy sketch series Do Not Adjust Your Set (1967-69). In 1967, he and Palin were invited to write and perform for Twice a Fortnight, a BBC sketch show that provided a training ground not only for a third of the Pythons (Jones and Palin), but two-thirds of the Goodies (Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie) and the co-creator of the 1980s political sitcom Yes Minister, Jonathan Lynn. Jones and Palin wrote and starred in The Complete and Utter History of Britain (1969) for LWT. Its conceit was to relate historical incidents as if TV had existed at the time. In one sketch, Samuel Pepys was a chat show host; in another, a young couple of ancient Britons looking for their first home were shown around the brand-new Stonehenge. \u201cIt\u2019s got character, charm \u2013 and a slab in the middle,\u201d said the estate agent. In the same year, he became one of the six founders of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. They expected the show to be quickly decommissioned by BBC bosses. \u201cEvery episode we\u2019d be there biting our nails hoping someone might find it funny. Right up until the middle of the second series John Cleese\u2019s mum was still sending him job adverts for supermarket managers cut out from her local newspaper,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cIt was only when they started receiving sackfuls of correspondence from school kids saying they loved it that we knew we were saved.\u201d After Python finished its run on TV, Jones went on to direct several films with the troupe. The first, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, was, he recalled, \u201ca disaster when we first showed it. The audiences would laugh for the first five minutes and then silence, nothing. So we re-cut it. Then we\u2019d show it in different cities, saying, \u2018We\u2019re worried about our film, would you come and look at it?\u2019 And as a result people would come and they\u2019d all be terribly worried about it too, so it was a nightmare.\u201d He had more fun co-writing and directing two series for the BBC called Ripping Yarns (1976-79) in which Palin starred as a series of heroic characters in mock-adventure stories, among them Across the Andes by Frog, and Roger of the Raj, sending up interwar literature aimed at schoolboys. Jones directed and starred in Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian, which some religious groups denounced for supposedly mocking Christianity. Jones defended the film: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about what Christ was saying, but about the people who followed him \u2013 the ones who for the next 2,000 years would torture and kill each other because they couldn\u2019t agree on what he was saying about peace and love.\u201d In 1983 he directed Monty Python\u2019s The Meaning of Life, in which he made, perhaps, his most disgusting appearance, as Mr Creosote, a ludicrously obese diner, who is served dishes while vomiting repeatedly. During this decade Jones diversified, proving there was life after Python. In 1980, he published Chaucer\u2019s Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary, arguing that the supposed paragon of Christian virtue could be demonstrated to be, if one studied the battles Chaucer claimed he was involved in, a typical, perhaps even vicious, mercenary. He also set out to overturn the idea of Richard II presented in the work of Shakespeare \u201cwho paints him more like sort of a weak \u2026 unmanly character\u201d.

He was not a member of the club. \u201cI am proud to be a patron of a number of local community organisations like most active local MPs, including Hunters Hill Rugby,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are honorary roles. I am not a member of the rugby club.\u201d Other MPs have declared their patronage of sporting clubs on their register of interests. In a statement on Wednesday, Morrison revealed that on Friday he referred the auditor general\u2019s report into the $100m sports grant program to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet \u201cfor advice in relation to any actions in the application of the statement of ministerial standard\u201d. Before the latest revelation, McKenzie\u2019s position had been backed by the attorney general, Christian Porter, and the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack. Porter said on Wednesday that he had not seen anything \u201cthat requires some further level of attention in terms of probity\u201d. McCormack told Guardian Australia: \u201cMinister McKenzie was administering the community sport infrastructure program \u2026 in line with what was advertised on the Sports Australia website. \u201cAll projects the minister approved and announced were eligible for funding. \u201cI remain supportive of Minister McKenzie and her efforts to deliver on what communities expect from their governments.\u201d Guardian Australia contacted Abbott and Zimmerman for comment.",

If that was the case, the folly of such an approach was reinforced when Jadeja\u2019s throw to the danger end missed (for all the advancement in fielding technique, direct run-outs remain a rarity). An extra few precious seconds were offered to any scrambling batsman eager to retrace his steps. But Finch was now in purgatory, allowing the fielder backing up, Shreyas Iyer, ample opportunity to lob the ball calmly back to Shami to complete the dismissal. It was not an amicable end to the partnership, it was an annulment. Finch\u2019s fury was obvious as he incanted invective behind his grille on his stomp back to the pavilion, his natural disappointment magnified by his anger at the breakdown in process. \u201cCricket is strange in that it\u2019s a team game with 11 individual performances,\u201d writes former England batsman Robin Smith in his recently published autobiography. The Judge does so in the context of explaining how his four ODI centuries all occurred in matches in which he ended up on the losing side. After safeguarding his presence at the crease, Smith went on to strike 131 in a lost cause. The thrilling trailer for a new official behind-the-scenes documentary reveals how utterly distraught Smith was on losing his wicket at Lord\u2019s during the 2019 Ashes, despite his heroic attempts to advance his side\u2019s cause. It seems unlikely it would have taken him long to make amends to his captain. Finch, an inveterate gum-chewer closer to the larrikin tradition of Australian cricketing lore, suggested they would resolve any differences over a drink. After such a fraught contest, the response from both men to the offer of a beer must have been two resounding yeses. If only they were in such furious agreement a few hours earlier.",

The plan, labelled \u201cintrusive, offensive and demeaning\u201d by critics, was to review the relationship statuses of people claiming the single parent rate of payments and was slated to save the budget $93.7m over five years. At the time, the government insisted 7,400 recipients would have their payments reduced and another 7,400 would be have their income support cancelled. Overall, it estimated that 4% of the 370,000 single parents were flouting the rules. Figures provided to a Senate estimates committee, however, reveal the policy is falling well short of those estimates and is also therefore seems likely to fall short of the projected savings. In response to questions from the Greens senator Rachel Siewert, Services Australia said it had finalised 75,598 reviews between 1 January 2018 and 1 November 2019. Only 950 people (or 1.3%) of those subjected to a review were found to be partnered. Services Australia said it would continue the policy but would not say how much the policy had cost or recouped. Single people who receive parenting payment get $138 a week more than those who are in a couple, while the difference for Newstart recipients is about $50 a week. People claiming single parent benefits are required to ask a third-party, who cannot be a family member, to provide a statement on the welfare recipient\u2019s relationship status.

Asked how much the policy had cost and how much it had recouped, the spokesman said: \u201cAs this measure was announced under the \u2018Better targeting of assistance to support jobseekers\u2019 package in the 2017/18 budget, individual costs are not available.\u201d \u201cThird-party verification reviews aim to ensure single parents receive the right payment at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder the review process, the department contacts single parents with dependent children, who are in receipt of parenting payment or Newstart allowance, to confirm their relationship status. \u201cParents are asked to complete a form with a third party referee and return to the department within 28 days.

More often than not they mentioned Lawn Hill Gorge in Boodjamulla national park. Located in the remote north-west corner of Queensland, near the Northern Territory border, Lawn Hill is a dusty trek from anywhere. Hike up rocky, red plateaus through palm-fringed gorges to lookout points (Indarri and Duwadarri) and gaze down on to the spring-fed, emerald-green water below, which bubbles up from the Georgina basin. Then make your way back down to the water to cool off. This is a true oasis.</p> <h2><strong>Maguk Gorge, Kakadu</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f46ed6627dac333cb5795c1739865569b118283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f46ed6627dac333cb5795c1739865569b118283/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maguk Gorge in Kakadu national park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maguk Gorge in Kakadu national park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like pulling back a veil, scrubby brush and spiral pandanus abruptly end at the water\u2019s edge to reveal the dramatic Maguk Gorge.

The water\u2019s edge is shallow at first but quickly drops into a dark abyss. People perch on the rocky ledges that fringe the pool, soaking up the morning sunlight that bathes the western cliff face. Others float on the surface around the gorge, some diving deep in search of the bottom.</p> <h2><strong>Bitter Springs, </strong><strong>Northern Territory</strong></h2> <p>After days of never-ending horizons and flat, dry desert dotted with termite mounts, the Never Never \u2013 a name for the vast, remote area of outback Australia \u2013 never felt more apt. Mataranka in central NT is home to some oasis-like swimming spots, in particular this natural, palm-fringed artesian hot spring, which sits at a luxuriant 33C year-round. Immersed in a setting of mossy green banks and river pandanus, the pool has a swamp-like feel (in a good way). Tall palms rise above the sun-flecked water as swimmers of all ages enjoy the warm temperature.</p> <h2><strong>Dalhousie Springs, South Australia</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c52e2c4f9c329d42a0ef5de0966cf1cb3b86ba12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c52e2c4f9c329d42a0ef5de0966cf1cb3b86ba12/434_0_3131_1879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dalhousie Springs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dalhousie Springs in the Witjira national park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Located in Witjira national park on the western fringe of the Simpson Desert, Dalhousie Springs is probably one of the most remote places that any of us will ever swim (or drive to). Water at this location has probably travelled thousands of kilometres, over something like a million years, to reach the surface, which certainly puts any road trip into perspective. The main pool is a large, thermal spring and the only designated swimming hole in the area. Surrounded by dense, wetland vegetation, it can be easily accessed via stairs on the water\u2019s edge. The temperature sits at a reliable 38C year-round, making it hospitable for all and a welcome respite from days driving through hot, dry desert.</p> <h2><strong>Leliyn Falls, Northern Territory</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16218a18527e7fd1293e8027b798c144a429a9cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16218a18527e7fd1293e8027b798c144a429a9cd/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edith Falls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edith Falls, north of Katherine</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dillon Seitchik-Reardon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leliyn is a series of cascading waterfalls and deep pristine pools along the Edith River, just north of Katherine on the west side of Nitmiluk national park.

The top pools are the feature, accessed via a steep, 1.2km walk up the escarpment through long grass. You\u2019ll be relieved to find the water when you do. The pools couldn\u2019t be more refreshing in the heat of a NT winter (still over 30C most days), which is the best time to visit.</p> <p>\u2022 Caroline Clements and Dillon Seitchik-Reardon are the authors of Places We Swim, available <a href=\"https://www.placesweswim.com/\">online</a> and at bookstores nationally.

As fire crews in New South Wales and Victoria prepare for the return of severe fire conditions later this week, the survey of more than 1,000 people found 57% of Australians were directly affected in some way by the fires over the past three months. About a quarter of those surveyed (26%) reported illness or health effects as a result of smoke haze, while a third (33%) reported a change to routine \u2013 such as not jogging outside \u2013 as a result of the conditions. About 15% said they had been forced to change or cancel holiday or travel plans, while 12% said regular places of business or leisure were closed as a result of the disruption. The number of people reporting negative health impacts has been extrapolated in the nationally representative survey to represent about 5.1 million Australian adults. The number of people reporting poor health as a result of the fires was highest in NSW, where 35% of those surveyed saying they had suffered illness such as breathing or respiratory problems because of the smoke. In Victoria, the figure was 29%, but the survey was taken from 8-12 January, before the hazardous levels of smoke haze hit Melbourne the following week.

Using Australian Bureau of Statistics labour figures, the survey estimated disruption of the workforce to have cost more than $1.3bn in lost economic production, which it says is a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate. \u201cIn many areas, including in large cities, workplaces closed for many days and in some cases for a week or more,\u201d the survey said. \u201cIf we assume an average of two days of lost production on average, the estimate of lost production doubles to $2.6bn.\u201d The research also showed a correlation between those directly affected by the fires and concern about the impacts of climate change. People who had been impacted by the fires were much more likely to be \u201cvery concerned\u201d about climate change (58%) than those not impacted (32%). Those directly affected were also more likely (68%) to say Australia is experiencing \u201ca lot\u201d of climate change impacts, compared with those not affected (42%). The findings also showed greater concern for Australia\u2019s forests and wildlife and government inaction among this group. Only about a third of all surveyed said they believed the federal Coalition had done a \u201cgood job managing the crisis\u201d. Tom Swann, senior researcher at the Australia Institute, said the findings underscored the extent of the \u201cvast\u201d social, economic and medical impacts of Australia\u2019s \u201cnational climate disaster\u201d. \u201cThis research suggests that, as Australians face the escalating impacts of climate change in their own lives, calls for policies that reduce carbon emissions will continue to grow,\u201d Swann said. \u201cEven looking simply at lost work days, the bill is in the billions of dollars. The broader impacts and recovery efforts will cost many billions more and take many years. \u201cThat is why it is so concerning that rising emissions threaten to make events like this even more common in the future.\u201d Swann said the findings should give extra impetus to the organisation\u2019s call for a levy on fossil fuel producers to help pay for the escalating cost of natural disasters. \u201cEstablishing a National Climate Disaster Fund would move some of the financial burden of these events from the households, businesses and taxpayers that are currently forced to pick up the tab,\u201d he said.",

My friend Mathew and I, both 11, took the suburban train into \u2018town\u2019 to watch a matinee of \u2018And Now For Something Completely Different\u2019. Cliche, but no other way of putting it: changed my life. Amidst the transformative laughter, I recall being amazed that adults could be this silly and at the same time make so much sense. Saw that show multiple times, and have pursued everything else since. Small part of my psyche is forever Pythonesque. I am deeply grateful. Much love, and immense thanks, to you Terry Jones. RIP. Dysconnected \u2018I got a lovely letter from Terry Jones with some notes on my sketches\u2019 I was fifteen, writing scripts, and not knowing what to do with them (at my school there wasn\u2019t so much a lack of interest, but a lack of anyone to even offer interest in, in my grim 80s comprehensive) so I sent them to Monty Python as they seemed like gods. I had never written to anyone like that, and never did again. A few weeks later I got a lovely letter from Terry Jones, some notes on my sketches, some annotated Python scripts and a recommendation to speak to Paul Jackson, which led to me going to the BBC and spending a day with Rik [Mayall] &amp; Ade [Edmondson]. I was literally no one, and that act of kindness has always stayed with me. RIP Terry.

      "bodyText": "A 74-year-old carer suffered horrific injuries when he was shot with a crossbow at his remote island home by an attacker hiding in the dark, a murder jury has heard. Gerry Corrigan, a retired lecturer, was trying to fix a satellite dish when the assault took place at his home near the coastal path in Anglesey, the jury at Mold crown court in north Wales was told. Terence Michael Whall, 39, a sports therapist, of the village of Bryngwran in Anglesey, denies murder. Peter Rouch QC, prosecuting, told the jury the attacker must have carried out reconnaissance of the spot and undertaken target practice before the assault. He said: \u201cThe shooter would have been about 10 metres away, probably in the field in front of the house, hiding behind a garden wall or fence. \u201cOnly one bolt was fired \u2013 which was accurate and hit its mark. You may think that the shooter was proficient in the use of a crossbow and must have undertaken target practice before killing Mr Corrigan. \u201cYou may also think that the killing would have required planning, and a reconnaissance of the place where the killing was to be done.

Corrigan lived with his partner, Marie Bailey, 64, who was disabled with multiple sclerosis. In effect, he was her carer, the court was told. They lived at Gof Du, set in 30 acres of land and close to the coastal path. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a place that you could simply pass by \u2013 to go there, you had to intend to go there,\u201d the prosecutor said. At about midnight on Good Friday last year, Corrigan\u2019s Sky signal was interrupted and he went outside to look at the dish. The prosecutor said: \u201cHe felt a terrible pain to his body and thought that somehow he had been electrocuted. But he hadn\u2019t been electrocuted. When he left his home to look at the Sky dish, someone was waiting outside, in the dark, armed with a high-powered crossbow.\u201d Rouch said: \u201cSo silent and quick is a crossbow that Mr Corrigan had no idea what had happened to him. All he knew was that he was in terrible pain.\u201d An ambulance was called and paramedics noticed a crossbow bolt covered in blood on the grass. He was airlifted to hospital in Staffordshire. Corrigan suffered sepsis and gangrene and died on 11 May. Police found two small pieces of metal from the head of the crossbow bolt outside his home. The court heard that a Land Rover Discovery belonging to Whall\u2019s partner, Emma Roberts, was found burnt out on 3 June, two weeks after he was questioned by police about his possession of crossbows. The GPS in the car was destroyed by the fire but information retained by Jaguar Land Rover showed that on the night of 17 April it had travelled to the driveway of Corrigan\u2019s home and then to nearby Porthdafach beach, in what Rouch alleged was a reconnaissance before the killing. On Thursday 18 April, the car was driven from Whall\u2019s home to Porthdafach beach, where it remained for an hour and a half until 12.42am on 19 April, about 12 minutes after Corrigan was shot, the court heard. The system showed the boot was opened and closed when the car arrived and before it left. Rouch claimed Whall interrupted the satellite signal then hid and waited for Corrigan to come out. \u201cWhen he did so, he callously shot him,\u201d the prosecutor alleged. The court heard that Whall had owned two crossbows, but claimed he sold one to a stranger earlier in 2019 and the second, bought online in April 2019, was not delivered until after the shooting. When interviewed by police, Whall said that on the night of the shooting he was with friend Barrie Williams, also known as Baz, who he was having an affair with, the court heard. He said they had travelled to the beach car park and engaged in sexual activities in fields nearby. But Rouch told the jury that Williams was likely to tell them he had not seen Whall that night. Whall told police he had never met Corrigan or his partner. The court heard defendant Gavin Jones, who was friends with Whall and shared an interest in martial arts with him, had done work for Corrigan, including cutting the grass at his home. Whall and co-defendants Darren Jones, 41, Martin Roberts, 34, and Gavin Jones, 36, deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and conspiracy to commit arson in relation to the Land Rover, which Whall claimed had been stolen before it was found burnt out. Roberts and Darren Jones deny arson. The trial continues.",

It\u2019s a question that has long troubled cafe owners around the world, but now mathematicians say they have worked out the formula for achieving the perfect brew \u2013 and it all comes down to the daily grind. \u201cThere is a common experience, particularly for people making coffee in their homes, and baristas as well, that you brew two espressos one after the other, you use the same ground coffee and seemingly you brew it in exactly the same way, yet the two shots can taste quite different to one another,\u201d said Dr Jamie Foster at Portsmouth University, a co-author of the research. But by using coffee that is ground coarser than usual, Foster and colleagues say there is less variation from cup to cup \u2013 a switch that also brings other benefits: it is faster, cheaper, and produces less waste. Writing in the journal Matter, Foster and colleagues report how they set out to explore how to optimise coffee making by developing mathematical equations to model the processes occurring in the bed of coffee as water is forced through when making an espresso. The team found that for a given water temperature and pressure, the model suggested that the finer the grind, the greater the proportion of coffee that ends up dissolved in the water. Foster said, intuitively that made sense: \u201cIf the little chunks making up the bed of coffee are smaller then there is more surface area for the water to come into contact with.\u201d That would mean to reduce waste and produce the most efficient coffee, cafes should grind their coffee as fine as possible. However when the team carried out tests with a coffee machine in a real cafe, they found that at very fine grinds the model broke down beyond a certain point.. \u201cThe particles get so small that they actually clog up bits of the bed [of ground coffee],\u201d said Foster, which means the area becomes impenetrable to water. The team says that leads to differences in the extraction yield from different areas of the coffee bed, and variation from cup to cup as different sized parts of the bed can clog up each time. That variability is reflected in the flavour: a higher \u201cextraction yield\u201d is typically more bitter, while lower makes for a more sour cup. \u201cThe key to making the shot reproducible is you want the particles just large enough that the flow is uniform and predictable, but as small as they can be to maximise the surface area,\u201d said Foster. Crucially, he added, cafes typically use coffee that is ground too finely, meaning the taste is unpredictable. Foster and colleagues add that by grinding slightly more coarsely, the barista can subsequently lower the mass of coffee used for each shot \u2013 or the amount of water passing through it \u2013 to get the desired taste more consistently and at lower cost. \u201cWe reckon you can save about 25% coffee mass per shot if you use this kind of efficient recipe with the slightly coarser coffee,\u201d he said, adding that the team trialled their approach in a coffee shop in Oregon for a year and found it not only boosted revenues but reduced the time it took to produce a shot. \u201cThey save several thousands of dollars over the year,\u201d said Foster. But while there appears to be a sweet spot for grinding, quite what that is can vary \u2013 something Foster said means coffee-making remains something of an art. \u201cA barista chooses the temperature and the pressure and the beans to make it taste the way they like, and then you make the extraction reproducible and efficient by fiddling with the grind setting,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Fewer than half of American adults know how many Jews were killed in the Holocaust, according to a survey published ahead of International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27. Forty-five per cent of those asked by the Pew Research Center about the number of Jews killed by the Nazis gave the correct answer of approximately 6 million. From multiple choice answers, 12% selected about 3 million, and 2% selected less than 1 million. Another 12% said more than 12 million Jews died in the Holocaust. One in three people (29%) said they were not sure or did not answer. According to the survey of almost 11,000 Americans, 69% said the Holocaust happened between 1930 and 1950. One in 10 people thought it took place between 1910 and 1930, and 2% answered between 1890 and 1910. One in 100 people thought it was later than second world war, answering 1950-1970; and 18% did not know or gave no answer. Some people believe ignorance about the Holocaust is linked to a rise in antisemitism. There are also concerns that, as living witnesses to Nazi atrocities and the death camps dwindle in number, the Holocaust is receding in the collective memory. The Anti-Defamation League annual audit of antisemitic incidents in the US for 2018 recorded the third-highest total since the civil rights group began publishing data 40 years ago. According to the New York Times, a report soon to be published by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University says antisemitic hate crimes in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago \u2013 the three largest cities in the US \u2013 are poised to hit an 18-year peak. Last month, a man armed with a knife forced his way into the home of a New York rabbi during the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, wounding five people. In October 2018, 11 people were killed and six injured in a shooting attack at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pew survey also found that only 43% of respondents knew that Hitler became German chancellor through a democratic political process, with one in four people believing he and his supporters violently overthrew the government. The Pew report, What Americans Know About the Holocaust, said the findings raised an important question: \u201cAre those who underestimate the death toll simply uninformed, or are they Holocaust deniers \u2013 people with antisemitic views who \u2018claim that the Holocaust was invented or exaggerated by Jews as part of a plot to advance Jewish interests\u2019?\u201d The researchers found some correlation between correct answers and warmer feelings among non-Jews towards Jews. Those answering at least three of the four multiple-choice questions correctly had, on average, a 67% \u201cwarmth rating\u201d towards Jews. January 27 marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the death camp in German-occupied Poland where some 1.2 million people were killed. Up to 200 survivors are expected to attend a memorial service at the camp, and there will be commemorations around the world.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy are the overwhelming favourites to be the next Labour leader among senior party figures in \u201cred wall\u201d seats, a Guardian survey has found. Interviews with 33 Labour leaders in the party\u2019s leave-voting former strongholds revealed widespread concern about the prospect of Rebecca Long-Bailey winning the contest, with many describing her as the \u201ccontinuity Corbyn\u201d candidate. Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley council, said \u201cthings had to change\u201d and that voters would abandon the party unless it moved on from Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit. \u201cWe need to move back to the centre ground to make us appealing to a wider audience,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re not even appealing to our own heartlands.\u201d The Guardian survey is the most comprehensive barometer yet of the leadership contest in areas where voters defected in huge numbers to the Conservatives in last month\u2019s general election. The poll includes leaders in six of the 10 longest-held Labour constituencies, such as Rother Valley in South Yorkshire, where voters backed the Tories in December for the first time in the seat\u2019s 101-year history. All but three of those surveyed said they were supporting Starmer or Nandy and the vast majority expressed strong reservations about Long-Bailey, a frontrunner who is backed by allies of Corbyn. The endorsement of dozens of Labour council leaders is a significant boost for Nandy, whose polling lags behind Starmer and Long-Bailey. Jess Phillips had been a second choice for several local leaders before she withdrew from the race on Tuesday. None of those surveyed backed Emily Thornberry. Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign will not be surprised by her relative unpopularity with senior local figures, who were in many cases sceptical of Corbyn\u2019s leadership from the beginning and some of whom have been in place since the Blair-Brown era. Starmer has emerged as the early frontrunner in the contest after securing the backing of two major trade unions and 12 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). The backing from senior figures in leave-voting areas may come as a surprise given his vocal support for a second referendum before the general election, when he described Labour as the party of remain. Graeme Miller, the leader of Sunderland city council, one of the most heavily leave-voting areas in the country, said his \u201cgut instinct\u201d was to back Starmer as the candidate that would appeal most to the public. \u201cMy focus has been looking at what we need, not what the membership wants. What the public will vote for has to be the focus,\u201d he said. Many leaders felt Starmer was the most credible and competent candidate and would appeal to a broad church of voters, praising his legal background and clear public speaking. Those who supported Nandy praised her ability to connect with voters outside the metropolitan bubble, particularly in post-industrial towns where people have felt left behind. Many said they were impressed by the Wigan MP\u2019s forthright assessment of Labour\u2019s future, which included warning fellow MPs that the party must change or \u201cwe will die and we will deserve to\u201d. While Long-Bailey may be popular among a large section of Labour members, dozens of local party leaders expressed concern that she would simply continue the \u201cCorbyn project\u201d. The Salford and Eccles MP was felt by many to have failed to properly reflect on the reasons behind Labour\u2019s worst election result since 1935. There was also concern among council leaders that the leadership contest had been too heavily focused on big cities instead of the provinces, where many Labour voters broke a decades-long tradition to back Boris Johnson\u2019s party last month. Some said the candidates needed to \u201cget out more\u201d and reconnect with voters; others complained that the main hustings debates were closed off from the public \u2013 with only party members eligible to attend \u2013 and hosted mainly in large cities such as Liverpool, Glasgow and Cardiff. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the Labour party still doesn\u2019t seem to be learning from the fact that we need to be getting out into towns not just cities,\u201d said Kyle Robinson, the Labour opposition leader on Newcastle-under-Lyme council, where the Tories won majority control in 2017. \u201cThe Labour heartlands are where we need to be going and not just inviting Labour members but inviting members of the public so they can ask questions of the people who want to be our next leader.\u201d Fewer than 20 CLPs have so far declared their support in the leadership contest, the winner of which will be announced on 4 April. Starmer and Nandy have already made it through to the final ballot. Starmer won the backing of Unison, the UK\u2019s largest trade union, and the environmental affiliate Sera, while Nandy secured the support of the NUM and GMB unions, and the Chinese for Labour affiliate. Under Labour\u2019s leadership rules, candidates must have a certain amount of support from CLPs or affiliates (unions or socialist societies) to be sure of a place on the final ballot.",

The rise, according to GamCare, which runs the national gambling helpline, is directly attributable to the ease with which women can now gamble online using their phones. In the past, if they wanted to bet, women had to brave the male-dominated realm of the bookies or find the time and risk the exposure of an arcade. Now, 70% of female gamblers use apps and websites.</p> <p>Nancy would never have gone into a bookies or an arcade. \u201cI would never have even begun betting if I hadn\u2019t been able to do it secretly, on my phone,\u201d she says. \u201cI had hundreds of different online gambling accounts. When I ran out of credit on one, I\u2019d just go to another site and open a new one. I had five credit cards, multiple loans and loads of high-interest payday loans.

But the fact it can happen to me means it could happen to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, Nancy went to see a health worker about a different issue and broke down. \u201cAll it took was for the counsellor to ask: \u2018What do you do for fun?\u2019 and it was all bought home to me: where had I gone? Why was I doing these things?\u201d She went to an NHS counsellor and GamCare and is now in recovery.</p> <p>Ian Semel leads Breakeven, a charity supporting gambling addicts in the UK. He believes that the latest figures hide the true number of female problem gamblers, because so few reach out for help. \u201cThere\u2019s such a stigma for women gamblers,\u201d he says. \u201cSociety has very clear gender roles for women and expectations that they\u2019ll be the caregivers.\u201d To breach this risks \u201cjudgment, exposure, shame and guilt\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Liz Karter is a therapist specialising in gambling addiction in women. She says the way women gamble is very different to men. \u201cAt Gamblers Anonymous meetings, the men were telling women they weren\u2019t proper gamblers because they weren\u2019t doing it for the rush and the winnings,\u201d she says. Instead, \u201cwomen gamble to escape, soothe, reduce stress and distract themselves\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cFor women, gambling soothes them and numbs pain,\u201d says <a href=\"http://henriettabowdenjones.com/\">Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones</a>, founder and director of the <a href=\"https://www.cnwl.nhs.uk/cnwl-national-problem-gambling-clinic/\">National Problem Gambling Clinic</a>. \u201cSometimes they begin gambling as a result of bereavement or because they\u2019re a carer for someone they love, and it\u2019s an overwhelming responsibility for them,\u201d she says. \u201cMany women won\u2019t seek help because they\u2019re afraid of having their children taken away. Many have embezzled or stolen money and fear prison if they\u2019re discovered,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Typically, women begin gambling later in life than men, but their problems develop more quickly \u2013 which experts believe may be because they tend to choose quick, high-stakes games such as online slots and bingo.</p> <p>Kerri Nicholls, 37, had never gambled before she and her partner started making \u00a31 online bets on the football games they loved to watch together. \u201cIt began as a way to make the games more interesting,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Then the site they used gave her \u00a3200 of free bets (\u201cExcept, of course, those bets turned out not to be free; they came with financial strings,\u201d she says). \u201cIt was fun at first but then my partner went back to university and I was stuck, in a not-great job, in a not-great new flat. Because my partner was at uni, I felt I needed to earn more money for us and gambling seemed like a good way to do that,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Within six months of making her first \u00a31 bet, Kerri was gambling daily. \u201cIt had stopped being fun by then. I was chasing my losses. It had become an emotional thing. I was addicted,\u201d she says. Kerri was betting increasing sums of money and suddenly found herself seriously in debt. \u201cHaving gone through counselling, I now know that I was using gambling to escape my other problems,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt neglected and gambling replaced what I was missing. I could invest my time in it and distract myself from my thoughts and difficulties.\u201d</p> <p>The addiction lasted five years, cost her \u00a350,000 and was, she says, \u201cliterally a 24-hour thing. I was setting my phone to wake me up at night with notifications of matches being played around the world that I\u2019d bet on.

      "bodyText": "Nancy gambled away the \u00a33,000 her father had saved up for his own funeral. It\u2019s the thing she feels most ashamed of having done during her four-year addiction to online gambling. At the time, however, she barely thought twice about what she had done. \u201cFemale gambling addicts are just as bad as men. We will get money wherever we can and gamble it all away immediately,\u201d she says. \u201cThe extraordinary thing is that during my addiction, no one suspected a thing. I was gambling online for hours every day. I\u2019d sit down on the settee with my phone in the early evening and the next thing I knew, it was 3am. I hadn\u2019t moved except to press the same button again and again to work the slots. But my bank account would be empty.\u201d The number of women reporting a gambling problem has risen at double the rate of men over the past five years, from 2,303 in 2014 to 2015 to 3,109 last year. The rise, according to GamCare, which runs the national gambling helpline, is directly attributable to the ease with which women can now gamble online using their phones. In the past, if they wanted to bet, women had to brave the male-dominated realm of the bookies or find the time and risk the exposure of an arcade. Now, 70% of female gamblers use apps and websites. Nancy would never have gone into a bookies or an arcade. \u201cI would never have even begun betting if I hadn\u2019t been able to do it secretly, on my phone,\u201d she says. \u201cI had hundreds of different online gambling accounts. When I ran out of credit on one, I\u2019d just go to another site and open a new one. I had five credit cards, multiple loans and loads of high-interest payday loans. I was entirely enslaved by gambling.\u201d By the time Nancy sought help she had spent \u00a375,000 on gambling and was \u00a325,000 in debt. She used up all her savings, wages and any other money she could lay her hands on. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for a rationally healthy person to understand, but I was in this bubble and couldn\u2019t escape,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was all I thought about: gambling and how to pay back my debts. I remember one Wednesday, getting home from work and crying and shaking in the kitchen because I knew I had to gamble. I was a slave to whatever game I was playing.\u201d Despite her obsession, Nancy didn\u2019t show a single outward sign of not being entirely in control. Even today, only her two best friends know what she has been through. She can\u2019t bear to tell her new husband. \u201cI\u2019m a very intelligent, sensible, caring person so it\u2019s hard to say why I did what I did. But the fact it can happen to me means it could happen to anyone.\u201d Eventually, Nancy went to see a health worker about a different issue and broke down. \u201cAll it took was for the counsellor to ask: \u2018What do you do for fun?\u2019 and it was all bought home to me: where had I gone? Why was I doing these things?\u201d She went to an NHS counsellor and GamCare and is now in recovery. Ian Semel leads Breakeven, a charity supporting gambling addicts in the UK. He believes that the latest figures hide the true number of female problem gamblers, because so few reach out for help. \u201cThere\u2019s such a stigma for women gamblers,\u201d he says. \u201cSociety has very clear gender roles for women and expectations that they\u2019ll be the caregivers.\u201d To breach this risks \u201cjudgment, exposure, shame and guilt\u201d, he says. Liz Karter is a therapist specialising in gambling addiction in women. She says the way women gamble is very different to men. \u201cAt Gamblers Anonymous meetings, the men were telling women they weren\u2019t proper gamblers because they weren\u2019t doing it for the rush and the winnings,\u201d she says.

Many have embezzled or stolen money and fear prison if they\u2019re discovered,\u201d she adds. Typically, women begin gambling later in life than men, but their problems develop more quickly \u2013 which experts believe may be because they tend to choose quick, high-stakes games such as online slots and bingo. Kerri Nicholls, 37, had never gambled before she and her partner started making \u00a31 online bets on the football games they loved to watch together. \u201cIt began as a way to make the games more interesting,\u201d she says.

The 55-year-old maths teacher recently helped his entire class of 30 year 11 students at the Fitzalan high school in Leckwith, Cardiff, to achieve A* grades in their GCSE maths exam \u2013 six months early. </p> <p>Inspirational teachers like Elive, who has been dubbed the \u201cmaths whisperer\u201d, don\u2019t come along often. But when they do, they can have a lifelong impact. When Lauren Aitchinson was 17, she had a wobble with her mental health. Her boyfriend had dumped her for her best friend and her confidence plummeted. \u201cI thought I was the most stupid person alive,\u201d Aitchinson, a 31-year-old caseworker from Perthshire, remembers. \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve to go to uni.\u201d Aitchinson refused to sit the exams she would need to pass to go to university.</p> <p>\u201cAll the teachers thought I had an attitude problem, so were like: \u2018Let her fail,\u2019\u201d Aitchinson says. Only Mr Pullar, her religious studies teacher, thought differently. \u201cHe said: \u2018No, she needs encouragement.\u2019\u201d Pullar arranged for Aitchinson to sit her exams on a day the school was closed. When she passed them, he didn\u2019t make a big deal of it. Aitchinson went on to college and has a book coming out next year. She plans to send him a copy when it is published, with a note saying thank you.</p> <p>If it weren\u2019t for Miss Cockburn, L\u00e9onie Drury\u2019s life would have turned out very differently. It is down to her that Drury, who is 36 and lives in London, became a teacher. \u201cIn my 20s, I was lost and I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I went to see her,\u201d recalls Drury. \u201cShe said: \u2018Become an English teacher! You love books.\u2019\u201d She was right \u2013 Drury has been an English teacher for seven years, and loves her job.</p> <p>Cockburn was an inspirational teacher. \u201cShe had a bright-red bob and was the most literary person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Drury smiles. \u201cShe could bring anything to life.\u201d Cockburn started a poetry competition at Drury\u2019s all-girls school. \u201cWe all thought we were Sylvia Plath, obviously,\u201d Drury laughs. </p> <p>\u201cIt was the sort of school where everyone\u2019s ambition was to be a football hooligan,\u201d says Shaun Paul Tomkiss, a 42-year-old chef from Shrewsbury, of his secondary school. \u201cYou weren\u2019t allowed to like books or art. It wasn\u2019t on.\u201d As a result, Tomkiss kept his passion for books quiet. After school, when his classmates were playing football, Tomkiss would read Oscar Wilde in the privacy of his bedroom.</p> <p>Miss Herbert changed everything. \u201cShe\u2019d read aloud from the The Catcher in the Rye, but insist on doing it in a New York drawl,\u201d Tomkiss laughs. He was transported, and took the JD Salinger novel home to finish in his own time. The next lesson, Herbert noticed he seemed disengaged, and pulled him aside. What was going on? \u201cI said: \u2018I took the book home and read it already and loved it to bits. Are there any more books like this?\u2019\u201d Her eyes lit up. She wrote him a list of books, which he devoured. Tomkiss credits her for his lifelong love of books.</p> <p>Drury and Cockburn remain friends to this day, catching up once a year to talk about books and life. Sadly, Herbert died while Tomkiss was in his late teens, so he never got a chance to say thank you. \u201cIt took a lot for a 14-year-old council estate boy to follow such lofty pursuits,\u201d Tomkiss says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be the same person without her.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Francis Elive deserves a bonus. The 55-year-old maths teacher recently helped his entire class of 30 year 11 students at the Fitzalan high school in Leckwith, Cardiff, to achieve A* grades in their GCSE maths exam \u2013 six months early. Inspirational teachers like Elive, who has been dubbed the \u201cmaths whisperer\u201d, don\u2019t come along often. But when they do, they can have a lifelong impact. When Lauren Aitchinson was 17, she had a wobble with her mental health. Her boyfriend had dumped her for her best friend and her confidence plummeted. \u201cI thought I was the most stupid person alive,\u201d Aitchinson, a 31-year-old caseworker from Perthshire, remembers. \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve to go to uni.\u201d Aitchinson refused to sit the exams she would need to pass to go to university. \u201cAll the teachers thought I had an attitude problem, so were like: \u2018Let her fail,\u2019\u201d Aitchinson says. Only Mr Pullar, her religious studies teacher, thought differently. \u201cHe said: \u2018No, she needs encouragement.\u2019\u201d Pullar arranged for Aitchinson to sit her exams on a day the school was closed. When she passed them, he didn\u2019t make a big deal of it. Aitchinson went on to college and has a book coming out next year. She plans to send him a copy when it is published, with a note saying thank you. If it weren\u2019t for Miss Cockburn, L\u00e9onie Drury\u2019s life would have turned out very differently. It is down to her that Drury, who is 36 and lives in London, became a teacher. \u201cIn my 20s, I was lost and I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I went to see her,\u201d recalls Drury. \u201cShe said: \u2018Become an English teacher! You love books.\u2019\u201d She was right \u2013 Drury has been an English teacher for seven years, and loves her job. Cockburn was an inspirational teacher. \u201cShe had a bright-red bob and was the most literary person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Drury smiles. \u201cShe could bring anything to life.\u201d Cockburn started a poetry competition at Drury\u2019s all-girls school. \u201cWe all thought we were Sylvia Plath, obviously,\u201d Drury laughs. \u201cIt was the sort of school where everyone\u2019s ambition was to be a football hooligan,\u201d says Shaun Paul Tomkiss, a 42-year-old chef from Shrewsbury, of his secondary school. \u201cYou weren\u2019t allowed to like books or art. It wasn\u2019t on.\u201d As a result, Tomkiss kept his passion for books quiet. After school, when his classmates were playing football, Tomkiss would read Oscar Wilde in the privacy of his bedroom. Miss Herbert changed everything. \u201cShe\u2019d read aloud from the The Catcher in the Rye, but insist on doing it in a New York drawl,\u201d Tomkiss laughs. He was transported, and took the JD Salinger novel home to finish in his own time. The next lesson, Herbert noticed he seemed disengaged, and pulled him aside. What was going on? \u201cI said: \u2018I took the book home and read it already and loved it to bits. Are there any more books like this?\u2019\u201d Her eyes lit up. She wrote him a list of books, which he devoured. Tomkiss credits her for his lifelong love of books. Drury and Cockburn remain friends to this day, catching up once a year to talk about books and life. Sadly, Herbert died while Tomkiss was in his late teens, so he never got a chance to say thank you. \u201cIt took a lot for a 14-year-old council estate boy to follow such lofty pursuits,\u201d Tomkiss says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be the same person without her.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The veteran BBC journalist John Ware has launched legal action against the Labour party over his controversial Panorama investigation into allegations of antisemitism last year. It is understood that prior to the action being taken, a letter was sent to the party just before Christmas alleging it had libelled Ware in statements following broadcast of the programme last July. Ware, 72, has been an investigative journalist for more than 40 years, exposing cover-ups in Northern Ireland and human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, and is the former presenter of the BBC\u2019s Rough Justice. At the centre of the dispute is a statement by Labour that the BBC had engaged in \u201cdeliberate and malicious representations designed to mislead the public\u201d in its broadcast. It is understood five whistleblowers are also threatening legal action against the party. The Panorama programme, which was broadcast last July, alleged that top party figures had interfered with investigations into antisemitism. Labour strongly denied the allegations of political interference, and came out on the offensive, as it accused the BBC of bias and called for the documentary to be pulled. A Labour spokesman at the time said the party had fully answered \u201ca number of questions\u201d put to it by the programme, and had also sent 50 pages of documents in response. In a statement after the airing of the programme, it said: \u201cThe Panorama programme and the BBC have engaged in deliberate and malicious representations designed to mislead the public.\u201d It is contended that the Labour party libelled a respected journalist for suggesting he deliberately set out to make a biased programme. The lawsuit emerged after the broadcast regulator, Ofcom, rejected 28 complaints against the same programme. It decided there were no grounds for pursuing any allegation of bias. In a statement Ofcom said: \u201cWe assessed complaints from viewers who felt that this programme was factually inaccurate and biased. In our view, the programme was duly impartial. \u201cAs well as highly critical personal testimonies, it included the Labour party\u2019s response prominently throughout, including in an interview with the shadow communities secretary.\u201d The Labour party declined to comment, saying it was an \u201congoing legal matter\u201d. Ware\u2019s solicitor, Mark Lewis of Patron Law, said: \u201cIt would not be appropriate to comment at this stage.\u201d",

I think we may be the only party that\u2019s never done it.\u201d Speaking at the homelessness charity Centrepoint, where she worked before becoming an MP, Nandy reiterated her calls for Labour to embrace fundamental change if it was to bounce back from December\u2019s crushing election defeat. Expanding on comments she made on BBC Radio earlier on Wednesday, Nandy criticised the Blair and Brown governments for not pushing back against the Thatcher-era idea to end the postwar consensus on the importance of the welfare state. \u201cWe tacitly accepted that four decades of economic conservatism was a bigger priority than people, that only by showing we could be as tight as the Tories could we buy legitimacy for helping people in the most need,\u201d Nandy argued, saying it was only under Corbyn that Labour changed tack. Nandy, often a critic of Corbyn, and who said the scale of promises made in the 2019 Labour manifesto was frightening for voters, said she would pay for a fairer social security system in part by taxing wealth at the same rates as income. She also argued that companies that make a profit but fail to pay the living wage to staff should be obliged to make up the difference in higher tax bills: \u201cI think we need to start calling this out for what it is. This is a system that allows profit to be put before people.\u201d Nandy said she would also scrap universal credit and replace it with a benefits system that reflects the \u201ccomplexity and the lived reality of the people in it\u201d.",

The book has been adapted into the Netflix film The Angel. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/15/who-killed-20th-centurys-greatest-spy-ashraf-marwan\">Egypt denies that Marwan betrayed his country</a>, with former president Hosni Mubarak saying: \u201cI do not doubt his loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>Lotfy won the IPA\u2019s Prix Voltaire award, which honours the freedom to publish, in June. But his final appeal against a jail sentence was rejected by the Egyptian military court of cassation in December. Now only a presidential pardon could free him.</p> <p>Lotfy\u2019s business, Tanmia, is being run in his absence by his brother Mahmoud. A prize-winning publisher as well as a bookshop in Cairo, Tanmia has often attended the Cairo fair, a major event for the Egyptian publishing industry . But organisers told the publisher it should stay away this year\u2019s event, which opened on Wednesday. </p> <p>Mahmoud commented: \u201cIt\u2019s sad for me to be excluded without a credible reason from an event that I have participated in for 11 years. Is Tanmia any threat to security? Aren\u2019t publishing houses with extremist publications or publishing houses who don\u2019t respect copyright more of a threat?\u201d</p> <p>Tanmia had known of its exclusion since December, said the IPA, which said it had appealed to organisers to \u201cshow solidarity\u201d and change their minds.

      "bodyText": "Cairo international book fair has excluded imprisoned publisher Khaled Lotfy\u2019s firm from the event citing \u201csecurity reasons\u201d, the International Publishers Association (IPA) has said. Lotfy was sentenced to five years in prison last April for \u201cspreading rumours and revealing military secrets\u201d by publishing a cheap Egyptian edition of Uri Bar-Joseph\u2019s The Angel, a biography of Ashraf Marwan, the Egyptian senior official who spied for Israel. The book has been adapted into the Netflix film The Angel. Egypt denies that Marwan betrayed his country, with former president Hosni Mubarak saying: \u201cI do not doubt his loyalty.\u201d Lotfy won the IPA\u2019s Prix Voltaire award, which honours the freedom to publish, in June. But his final appeal against a jail sentence was rejected by the Egyptian military court of cassation in December. Now only a presidential pardon could free him. Lotfy\u2019s business, Tanmia, is being run in his absence by his brother Mahmoud. A prize-winning publisher as well as a bookshop in Cairo, Tanmia has often attended the Cairo fair, a major event for the Egyptian publishing industry . But organisers told the publisher it should stay away this year\u2019s event, which opened on Wednesday. Mahmoud commented: \u201cIt\u2019s sad for me to be excluded without a credible reason from an event that I have participated in for 11 years. Is Tanmia any threat to security? Aren\u2019t publishing houses with extremist publications or publishing houses who don\u2019t respect copyright more of a threat?\u201d Tanmia had known of its exclusion since December, said the IPA, which said it had appealed to organisers to \u201cshow solidarity\u201d and change their minds. The IPA has yet to hear back, and contact from the Guardian has yet to be answered. \u201cIt is so disappointing to see that fair is unable to show its support for Khaled Lotfy by giving his publishing house a stand,\u201d said chair of the IPA\u2019s Freedom to Publish committee Kristenn Einarsson. \u201cI repeat my call for President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to grant Lotfy a pardon and encourage publishers and booksellers worldwide to show their support.\u201d Einarsson said it was \u201cincomprehensible\u201d that Lotfy could be imprisoned for publishing a new version of a book that was already available. The Angel had previously been available in Arabic in Egypt as a more expensive, imported edition from the Lebanon-based Arab Scientific Publishers. Accepting his brother\u2019s Voltaire award in June, Lotfy\u2019s brother Mahmoud said that he received \u201cdaily messages from readers asking about Khaled and wishing him a brighter future, where the right to knowledge is empowered and ideas are as valuable as life\u201d. Lotfy himself, in a letter read out during the ceremony, said he is going through \u201can ordeal I never expected \u2026 in supporting culture and providing all that is new and valuable for readers, without any biased affiliations or political orientations\u201d.

In a statement they said: \u201cTerry passed away on the evening of 21 January 2020 at the age of 77 with his wife Anna Soderstrom by his side after a long, extremely brave but always good humoured battle with a rare form of dementia, FTD.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cOver the past few days his wife, children, extended family and many close friends have been constantly with Terry as he gently slipped away at his home in North London. We have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2016, Jones and his family revealed he had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/23/terry-jones-monty-python-star-dementia-diagnosis-bafta-cymru\">diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia</a> a year earlier, and he became a public face of the illness \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/oct/03/monty-python-star-terry-jones-and-son-tearful-at-bafta-ceremony-video\">appearing at a Bafta Cymru awards ceremony</a> to highlight its effects and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/16/monty-python-terry-jones-learning-to-live-with-dementia\">being interviewed</a> in conjunction with longtime friend and collaborator Michael Palin in 2017. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of Alzheimer\u2019s Society paid tribute, saying: \u201cWe were lucky enough to work with Terry and his family when he joined us for our London Memory Walk in 2017 and his support really helped inspire others to unite against dementia. We are truly grateful for his aid in raising awareness and much-needed funds.\u201d</p> \n<p>After huge success with Python in the 1970s and early 80s, including the feature films Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life, Jones went on to work on a huge variety of projects.

He made a series of TV documentaries (specialising in medieval history), wrote nearly 20 children\u2019s books, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/terryjones\">contributed a string of comment pieces for the Guardian and Observer</a> denouncing the \u201cwar on terror\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa4cd2d3c491a351ed5e83afcd1192619ce9fa1e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa4cd2d3c491a351ed5e83afcd1192619ce9fa1e/661_63_2635_1581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Jones, right, with Michael Palin in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Jones, right, with Michael Palin in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PA/status/1219972154202173441\">Palin said:</a> \u201cHe was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation, he was the complete Renaissance comedian \u2013 writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children\u2019s author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fellow Python <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/1219979583719690241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1219979583719690241&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fterry-jones-dead-celeb-reactions-death-monty-python-founder-1271973\">John Cleese</a> said: \u201cIt feels strange that a man of so many talents and such endless enthusiasm, should have faded so gently away,\u201d adding: \u201cOf his many achievements, for me the greatest gift he gave us all was his direction of Life of Brian. Perfection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Born in Colwyn Bay, Wales, in 1942, Jones moved to England as a child, growing up in Surrey. While at Oxford studying English literature, he met fellow student Palin while performing in the Oxford Revue. After university, along with Palin, Jones wrote and performed in a string of TV shows alongside other future stars of British comedy \u2013 including Cleese, Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/eric-idle\">Eric Idle</a>, Peter Cook and David Jason \u2013 on The Frost Report, Do Not Adjust Your Set and The Complete and Utter History of Britain.</p> \n<p>In 1969, Palin and Jones joined Cambridge graduates Cleese and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Chapman\">Graham Chapman</a> \u2013 along with Idle and animator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terry-gilliam\">Terry Gilliam</a> \u2013 on a BBC comedy sketch show. Eventually broadcast under the title Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus, it ran until 1974, with Jones largely writing with Palin (complementing Cleese\u2019s partnership with Chapman). Seemingly chaotic, frequently surreal and formally daring, Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus would became one of the most influential shows in BBC history, revolutionising comedy formats, spawning scores of catchphrases, and inspiring an entire generation of comedians. Jones\u2019s fondness for female impersonation was a key feature of the show, as was his erudite writing.</p> \n<p>However, Jones was becoming more interested in directing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/sep/13/theatre\">He later told the Guardian</a>: \u201cYou not only act in the things \u2013 you\u2019ve got to actually start directing the things as well.

He was very much signed up to Python\u2019s democratic instinct: \u201cIf all six of us laughed at something, then we all felt, \u2018That\u2019s OK, we can go ahead with that.\u2019 And, for me, it was just a question of getting that on the screen, getting that moment of us sitting around the read-through, that moment where we all laughed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones took over the Pythons\u2019 next film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/12/monty-pythons-life-of-brian-review\">The Life of Brian</a>, as a solo director, with Gilliam opting to concentrate on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/16/how-we-made-monty-python-life-of-brian-michael-palin-terry-gilliam\">the film\u2019s design.</a> Backed by George Harrison\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/03/george-harrison-beatle-monty-python-life-of-brian-handmade-studios\">HandMade films</a> and released in 1979, the religious satire proved a major commercial hit as well as sparking global controversy.

Jones became a vociferous opponent of the Iraq war, and published a collection of his newspaper columns and other writings in the 2004 book Terry Jones\u2019s War on the War on Terror. His final directorial credit was the 2015 comedy Absolutely Anything, in which all four surviving Python members participated, but it received an unenthusiastic reception. Jones was married twice: between 1970 and 2012 to biochemist Alison Telfer, with whom he had two children, and in 2012 to Anna S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, with whom he had one child.",

Welcome to our coverage on night three of the Australian Open. After the 88 completed singles matches yesterday, today has thankfully been a little more relaxed and the tournament will be hoping that we are also in store for a relaxed night as its two most famous players return to the Rod Laver Arena. </p> <p>Serena Williams will kick off the night session with her first ever meeting against Tamara Zidansek. The Slovenian is a resourceful, intelligent player with great movement, but she is also quite underpowered and the lack of weight behind her shots will make this a tough match-up against the supreme weaponry of Serena Williams. <br></p> <p>It will likely be a similar scenario when Roger Federer faces Filip Krajinovic, a stylish Serbian player with a lovely backhand and ample variety. However, Krajinovic\u2019s game also lacks the heft required to go toe-to-toe with the 20 time slam champion\u2019s vicious aggression. Still, the pair have played three times before and, although Krajinovic lost each meeting, he should take heart from snatching a set against Federer in 2018.</p> <p>On Margaret Court Arena, Australia\u2019s Jordan Thompson will face 12th seed Fabio Fognini and 10th seed Madison Keys, a former semi-finalist, will be up against Aranxta Rus.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-22T07:11:17.296Z\">at 7.11am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today. Thanks for following and until tomorrow. The order of plays for Rod Laver Arena and Margaret Court Arena are below. Here is Simon Cambers\u2019 interview with Caroline Wozniacki as she plays the final tournament of her career. Fabio Fognini recovered from two sets down in his first round against Reilly Opelka, winning 7-6(4) in the fifth. Today he blew a two sets lead but got it done 7-6(5) in the fifth. He is very happy about all of this: Good fight. I think that at the end it was more sweet [than a simple win]. You know why? Because I was winning two sets to zero, then two sets all, then 7-6 in the fifth? Wow, amazing! It\u2019s perfect, I feel good. Tired for sure. [At] two sets to zero, I played a horrible game on my serve at beginning of the third set and then he was playing better, he was serving unbelievable and that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s the sport. I won two matches 7-6 in the fifth. So, I couldn\u2019t be more happy than that I had 75 match points, I think. As I say, at the end it\u2019s more sweetie [sic] because it\u2019s too easy winning in three sets. The crowd laughed and then Fognini went on his way. He has probably ensured with these first two matches that he will hit a physical wall soon, but as long as he is in the draw he is incredibly fun to watch. Madison Keys marches past Aranxta Rus 7-6(3) 6-2. In less dramatic news, the tenth seed and former semi-finalist eases through with no troubles. Keys is in some of the best form of her career and she usually brings her best tennis in a slam. Watch out. What a battle! Fognini sealed the win with a screaming backhand down the line winner from the Italian. Fognini watched as his two set lead crumbled to a valiant Aussie, but he dragged himself back into the match in the fifth set and just about did enough to see it through. All credit to Thompson for his fight. He battled from two sets down and then he saved four match points across two service games in the fifth set, but in the end he was just outplayed by a better tennis player. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-6 (*3-7) Fabio Fognini: Fognini finally stepped in and took his forehand on, forcing Thompson out wide with a crosscourt forehand to force a Thompson error at *4-3. Fognini then found a great service winner at *5-3 to consolidate the mini-break. At 6-3*, Thompson dumped another backhand into the net. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-6 (3-4*) Fabio Fognini: The Italian takes an early lead in the ten point tiebreak. Thompson has just made a couple of loose backhand errors here. He will need to cut them out because Fognini has decided to load the Thompson backhand, taking as little risk as he can. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-6 Fabio Fognini: Thompson pieces together another miraculous hold, this time from 15-40 and double match point down to push Fognini into a deciding tiebreak. Thompson saved the third match point with a couple of incredible forehands from a defensive position, ending with a forehand winner. On the fourth, he crushed a backhand down the line. Across the net, Fognini is so tense and passive in these big moments. He is just waiting for unforced errors that may or may not come and this may come back to hurt him. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 *5-6 Fabio Fognini: Fognini wobbled there, making two horrendous forehand errors from 40-15 and piling the pressure on himself. But the Italian responded well, rushing Thompson with early ballstriking and brutal ballstriking off both wings in a long point at deuce, eventually forcing the error. Finally, Fognini held with a wicked inside out forehand winner. Thompson will serve to stay in the match again. On Rod Laver Arena, Madison Keys leads Aranxta Rus 7-6 1-1. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 5-5* Fabio Fognini: A astounding hold from Thompson, who saves two match points to level the set. After being pegged back by a tenacious Fognini from 40-15, Thompson saved the first match point with an ace and the second with a huge down-the-line point-ending forehand. All the while, Fognini was pressing as much as he could and crushing Thompson\u2019s second serves. But the Aussie stepped up and trusted both ground strokes, pounding his forehand whenever possible and soaking up the constant pressure his weaker backhand received to keep himself alive. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 *4-5 Fabio Fognini: Fognini follows up with a quick hold of his own, sealed with a curling ace. The momentum has clearly shifted and Fognini is strolling through his service games. Thompson will serve to stay in the match as Fognini looks to make his momentum count. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 4-4* Fabio Fognini: Thompson blinks first, dumping a forehand into the net at 30-30. But he responded with such clarity on break point, serving out wide and sweeping to the net to dispatch the volley. At deuce he swept into the net again, burying a crosscourt backhand before eventually finishing the point with another overhead. He closed it off with great body serve. Nothing short of a bold, excellent hold. We go on. Serena Williams\u2019 \u201ctesty\u201d win over Zidansek. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 *3-4 Fabio Fognini: Another solid hold for Fognini. So far, both Thompson and Fognini have won a total of 3 return points each in this set. With the exception of Thompson\u2019s escape from 0-30 at 1-2, neither have had anything to worry about. That will change soon. Here is Kevin Mitchell on Dan Evans saying that he probably will not compete in the Tokyo Olympics. First set: Madison Keys *3-4 Aranxta Rus: On Rod Laver Arena, 2016 semi-finalist Madison Keys is being given plenty to think about by 93rd-ranked Aranxta Rus, an extremely consistent lefty who is continually forcing the American to hit an extra ball. Still on serve. Fabio Fognini holds for 3-2 against Jordan Thompson. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 2-2* Fabio Fognini: A stunning hold from Thompson. After falling down 0-30 by dumping a forehand volley into the net, he responded by coming forward again and dispatching a volley, a couple of big serves and then the crown jewel at 40-30: an absurd running down-the-line backhand passing shot. Incredible work. He is still in it. Fifth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 *1-2 Fabio Fognini: Fognini looks a lot sharper early in the fifth set. He is serving well and sweeping up short balls, piecing together two easy holds in the process. Fourth set: Jordan Thompson 6-7(1) 1-6 6-3 6-4 Fabio Fognini: We\u2019re heading to 5 sets on Margaret Court Arena. After being thoroughly outclassed in the opening set, the Aussie has turned it all around in front of his home crowd. Speaking of Aussies, Jordan Thompson is currently attempting an incredible comeback from two sets down against twelfth seed Fabio Fognini. It is the final match of the evening on Margaret Court Arena, with Madison Keys vs Aranxta Rus moved to Rod Laver Arena. The score is currently 6-7(4) 1-6 6-3 *3-2. Federer also spoke about his upcoming match with Aussie John Millman, who beat him at the 2018 US Open in suffocating humidity: Great guy. I\u2019ve practiced a lot with him. I almost passed out when I played against him in your city in New York. It was so hot. He had no problem; he\u2019s from Queensland, so he\u2019s like: \u2018Normal stuff.\u2019 He never came to check on me if I passed out actually, after the match! But I didn\u2019t, I\u2019m here. He\u2019s a super good guy, unbelievably tough opponent. There\u2019s not many guys fitter than him out there. Those are the guys I respect the most actually because he gets absolutely the most out of the game. I hope it\u2019s going to be a great match with some great rallies and I hope you guys enjoy it. Roger Federer spoke to John McEnroe after the match. McEnroe opened his interview by fawning over Federer\u2019s great performance: \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell you to say that, right? You mean it? I\u2019m very happy, it\u2019s a great start to the season so far. I\u2019m feeling really relaxed out on court. You train hard and you hope it pays off and not that it was all for nothing this week. I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m still going and I\u2019m looking forward to the next one of course. Hopefully another good match. \u201cAt 0-40, 5-1 [fourth set], I was thinking it wasn\u2019t 100% fair that he played three and a half hours yesterday and me zero! But the rain helped me so you gotta take them when they fall that way. Yeah, I do feel a little sorry for it but you have to take advantage of it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Roger Federer completes an efficient performance with a quick break to 15, sealed with a wicked forehand crosscourt winner. Federer should be very happy with that. He started incredibly well and his game flowed for much of the match, but it was the little blip in the second set that should please him the most. When Krajinovic finally showed some resistance to break his serve, Federer responded quickly. Good win. Third set: Roger Federer 6-1 6-4 5-1* Filip Krajinovic: With an ace down the T after more excellent serving, Federer holds to 15 and moves to within a game of victory. This probably will not take too long. Third set: Roger Federer 6-1 6-4 *4-1 Filip Krajinovic: Krajinovic actually called out the doctor to treat his arm, so naturally Federer immediately tested it out by drawing him into a long rallies with ample slice and margin. Krajinovic sent a forehand well long at 15-30 after one such rally and then he mishandled a tough volley on break point. Double break secured. Third set: Roger Federer 6-1 6-4 3-1* Filip Krajinovic: Medical timeouts can be controversial. They often affect the opposing player, arresting their momentum and giving them time to think about what they are doing. Apparently this doesn\u2019t apply to Federer! He strolled back to the baseline after the break, slammed down a few aces and held to love in what felt like a couple of seconds. Third set: Roger Federer 6-1 6-4 *2-1 Filip Krajinovic: Great work from the Serb to keep himself in the game. He saved break point thanks to a Federer unforced error but otherwise he pummelled the ball throughout and moved forward to the net whenever he could. Krajinovic generated one game point from deuce with a sizzling backhand down the line. When Federer scuppered the game point with a searing forehand winner of his own, the Serb just kept on going. He eventually saw out the hold with a big serve followed by a point ending forehand down-the-line. Krajinovic has now called the doctor. Third set: Roger Federer 6-1 6-4 2-0* Filip Krajinovic: Federer consolidates the break with a quick hold to 15 and no problems whatsoever. He closed it off with a beautiful low forehand volley off a serve and volley on game point. Third set: Roger Federer 6-1 6-4 *1-0 Filip Krajinovic: The Serb\u2019s resistance was fun while it lasted. Krajinovic handed over his service game with a double fault on break point after some sloppy errors earlier in the game. However, kudos to Federer for a glorious angled backhand passing shot at 15-30. The finishing line is slowly appearing in the distance. Roberto Bautista Agut moves into the third round. A big third round battle with Marin Cilic, who is beginning to show some form, awaits. Second set: Roger Federer 6-1 6-4 Filip Krajinovic: Federer blinked for one brief second, but the Swiss overcame his second set stutter with aplomb. A nice hold to 15 to close off the set with ample big serving, sealed with a big service winner down the T. One set away. Second set: Roger Federer 6-1 *5-4 Filip Krajinovic: That did not last very long. Federer tightened up his game and refused to miss but that was fairly disappointing from Krajinovic. He missed a routine backhand at 15-30 and then dumped a backhand volley into the net at 15-40. Still, Federer should be pleased with how quickly he recovered the break and tightened up his game. Second set: Roger Federer 6-1 4-4* Filip Krajinovic: Filip Kraijinovic breaks! And how deserved it was. He is returning extremely well now and he put Federer\u2019s serve under constant pressure in that return game, forcing three errors off Federer\u2019s first shot after his serve. On break point, Krajinovic refused to hesitate this time, crunching the ball and then moving forward behind a big forehand to force a Federer error. Bold. Elsewhere, the two other top seeds in action are flitting to victory almost as quickly as Federer now. Twelfth seed Fabio Fognini is up 7-6(4) 6-1 on Aussie Jordan Thompson and Ninth seed Roberto Bautista Agut now leads Michael Mmoh 5-7 6-2 6-4 *4-1. Second set: Roger Federer 6-1 4-2* Filip Krajinovic: Krajinovic really could have changed the second set there. After a couple of loose points from Federer including an errant slice under no pressure, Krajinovic found himself up break point and with a big opportunity on his favoured backhand. Instead of burying the short ball and moving the set to 3-3, he sent the ball flying wide as he screamed in frustration. Federer quickly dusted himself off, found his first serve and held. Opportunity gone. Second set: Roger Federer 6-1 *3-2 Filip Krajinovic: A good hold from Krajinovic, who saved two break points to keep himself in the set. Federer helped with the shank on the first break point, but the Serb continued to be aggressive and advance to the net. He finished with some beautiful hands at the net as Federer desperately attempted to pass him. It should be noted that Federer came up with the shot of the match at 15-30. Krajinovic hit the most perfect backhand volley right into the corner, only for Federer to chase it down and effortlessly flick a forehand past him. Elsewhere, ninth seed Roberto Bautista Agut just took the third set against Michael Mmoh to lead 5-7 6-2 6-4 in Melbourne Arena. In Margaret Court Arena, Fabio Fognini leads Australia\u2019s Jordan Thompson 7-6 4-0. Second set: Roger Federer 6-1 2-0* Filip Krajinovic: The one thing Federer\u2019s first set performance lacked was his typical good serving. He won only 71% of points behind his first serve and struggled to hit his spots. Sadly for Krajinovic, that seems to be changing. Federer held for his second consecutive love hold with a searing ace down the T. Second set: Roger Federer 6-1 *1-0 Filip Krajinovic: Krajinovic attempted to change things up with some net forays. He hit a couple of really nice volleys, but then at 30-30 he dumped a volley into the net behind an attempted serve and volley. At 30-40, Krajinovic stayed back and Federer bullied him at the baseline with a vicious inside out forehand. He cannot win in any part of the court. Roger Federer hit 13 winners and 4 unforced errors in the first set, which is close enough to perfect. Across the net, Krajinovic hit 7 winners and 5 unforced errors. He had a positive ratio yet still won only one game. That doesn\u2019t exactly help with the confidence. First set: Roger Federer 6-1 Filip Krajinovic: Roger Federer takes the first set with some great serving and his first love hold of the day. It is fair to say that Federer has indeed hit the ground running. First set: Roger Federer *5-1 Filip Krajinovic: The Serb averts the break with thanks to some sloppy forehands from Federer, who swung for the fences with the knowledge that he will have many opportunities to serve this out. The third seed will serve for the set. First set: Roger Federer 5-0* Filip Krajinovic: Krajinovic has played some lovely points and he has showed his talent, this time moving to 30-30 on Federer\u2019s serve for the second time. However, the score is 5-0 in 15 minutes and for good reason. From 30-30, Federer slammed down an unreturned serve and then crushed an inside out forehand winner to move ahead. One game away from the first set. First set: Roger Federer *4-0 Filip Krajinovic: Krajinovic finally had a chance to put himself on the board at 40-30, but in the blink of an eye it was gone. Federer saved the break point by crunching a forehand down the line winner and then he found another brutal inside out forehand to snatch the second break. Meanwhile, the Krajinovic forehand is already landing too short and leaking too many errors. First set: Roger Federer 3-0* Filip Krajinovic: Federer consolidates the break with no problem and plenty of help from his opponent. Krajinovic actually pushed him to 30-30 for the first time, only to errantly stop the point in order to challenge Federer\u2019s serve. The ball was in. Federer then feathered in a sublime forehand dropshot at 40-30 to put clear distance between the two. First set: Roger Federer *2-0 Filip Krajinovic: If this is the perfect start for Federer, it is already a bit of a nightmare for the Serb. Krajinovic flitted to the net twice in succession, one to Federer\u2019s forehand and the other to Federer\u2019s backhand. How did Federer respond? He slotted in an easy passing shot both times. It took Federer a couple of break points, including one gorgeous drop volley from Krajinovic at 30-40, but he broke on the third. First set: Roger Federer 1-0* Filip Krajinovic: The perfect start for Federer, who holds to 15 with ease. The third seed slammed down some big serves and then he slotted an easy forehand down the line winner on game point. No problem. What can we expect from Filip Krajinovic? Krajinovic is an elegant player with a lovely backhand and a lot of variety. He likes to play dropshots and come to the net, plus he is a decent returner. His problem against Federer is that he simply doesn\u2019t serve well enough and his forehand can be too tentative under pressure. If he brings his best tennis, he can certainly push Federer for a set or so but anything else would usually be a big surprise. However, this isn\u2019t a normal occasion. Federer is arriving in Melbourne with minimal preparation after he spent his off season traveling around South American for lucrative exhibitions. His form is still a huge question mark and he really needs to hit the ground running this week if he wants another good run in Melbourne. Only the three roofed courts are in play right now: Third seed Roger Federer and Filip Krajinovic are warming up on Rod Laver Arena. Jordan Thompson has a narrow 6-5* lead against twelfth seed Fabio Fognini on Margaret Court Arena. Michael Mmoh and ninth seed Roberto Bautista Agut will finish their second round match on Melbourne Arena. The current score: 7-5 2-6 2-1. Another great win for Australia\u2019s John Millman, who moves into the third round with a brilliant 6-4 7-4 6-3 win over 31st seed Hubert Hurkacz. He will face the winner of the upcoming match between Roger Federer and Filip Krajinovic. Serena Williams on her second round win: It was a good match for me. She was a real good fighter and she didn\u2019t just let me win [laughter]. Everyone plays me like that though so it\u2019s nothing new. I was up 40-0 on both of her serves so I was a little frustrated. I think I made so many errors in a row so I had to battle through that; my own internal emotions. I knew I had to play better. I couldn\u2019t keep making unforced errors like that. I knew I had to just step up or it was going to be a very long evening for me. So, I don\u2019t know. I know I have a great forehand, I know I have a great backhand so I just have to rely on it a little bit more and not question myself so much After a host of missed returns and wayward forehands, of course Serena Williams finished it off with a dismissive forehand return winner. The comfortable scoreline belies the fact that this was often a struggle and the American was frustrated with her level of play throughout. This could have been a statement win for Williams, but no matter. Victory is the most important thing for her and she will have another opportunity to play her best tennis in round three. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 5-3* Tamara Zidansek: A well consolidated break from Serena Williams to move within a game of victory. At 30-15, she slammed down a big unreturned serve and then she pressured the Zidansek forehand on game point, eliciting an error. Although Williams continues to cheer and shout, she seems slightly more relaxed with the break secured. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 *4-3 Tamara Zidansek: At last, Williams finally breaks. Once again, she moved to 0-40 with for a third consecutive game, but this time she nailed a point ending backhand down-the-line and cheered to her team. This seems like the decisive break. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 3-3* Tamara Zidansek: Serena digs out a hold, but what a struggle that was. She missed numerous routine forehands, screamed dramatically after every winner and dumped one particulary dire forehand drive volley into the net as her mother, Oracene, screamed \u201cwhy?\u201d to the heavens. However, Williams also found big serves on the break points and she held with a great backhand down the line. Still on serve. It has been drizzling in Melbourne for some while and the roof is now sliding into action on Rod Laver Arena. Meanwhile, Michael Mmoh and Roberto Bautista Agut, who are competing on an outside court, have been sent to the locker room. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 *2-3 Tamara Zidansek: Once again, Williams worked her way to 0-40 before faltering. She missed the first break point with a backhand return into the net, the second after failing to track down a sweet drop shot from Zidansek and the third with another netted backhand return. At deuce, Williams sent a forehand return flying many metres wide and then she shanked final forehand return close to the back fence. In other words, she just missed four returns in five points. Oh dear. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 2-2* Tamara Zidansek: The good news for Serena is that she is winning the vast majority of the big points here, even as she seethes and shows her displeasure at some of her play. This time, she fell down 15-30 after some great play from the Slovenian. Her response? Three unreturned serves in succession to hold. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 *1-2 Tamara Zidansek: Zidansek digs out another hold! This time she saved four break points with winners that included a gutsy net point and a searing down the line backhand winner. She is showing her ability and Williams is getting increasingly frustrated with every point. A small amount of pressure for the American. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 1-1* Tamara Zidansek: After another underwhelming hold from Williams, she is understandably not happy. Williams led 40-15 before a couple of errors, including a limp forehand into the bottom of the net at 40-30, brought her back to deuce. Williams then found two big serves to hold. Second set: Serena Williams 6-2 *0-1 Tamara Zidansek: That was an infinitely better start to the set from Zidansek. At 30-30, she hooked a brilliant forehand down-the-line winner into the corner before executing a delicate dropshot to hold immediately. Williams has hit 14 unforced errors today and she may well hit more errors with more games like that from the Slovenian. First set: Serena Williams 6-2 Tamara Zidansek: Serena Williams snatches the first set with few problems on her second set point, sealed with a huge body serve service winner. Business as usual on Rod Laver Arena. First set: Serena Williams *5-2 Tamara Zidansek: Good effort from Zidansek, who saved set point with an unreturned body serve and then marched to a second hold of the match. She kept her depth in the rallies and actually managed to push Williams back on game point, forcing a wayward backhand error from the former number one. Williams will serve for the first set now. First set: Serena Williams 5-1* Tamara Zidansek: Serena Williams has raced to a 5-1 lead but she has not had it all her own way here. She saved break point before holding for 3-1 and then Zidansek pushed her to deuce at 4-1. Serena seems to be overplaying a little and she dumped an easy overhead into the net on her first advantage. However, she came through with a service winner followed by a booming crosscourt forehand. Tommy Paul defeats Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 (10-8). What an effort from Tommy Paul to recover from a break down in the final set. By far the biggest win of his career and his first ever slam third round. Fifth set: Grigor Dimitrov vs Tommy Paul 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 6-6 (3-9*): Match point for Tommy Paul after Dimitrov dumped a backhand into the net. Fifth set: Grigor Dimitrov vs Tommy Paul 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 6-6 (3-8*): Dimitrov sprayed a forehand long and then bunted a volley out. Paul to serve for an incredible win. Fifth set: Grigor Dimitrov Tommy Paul 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 6-6 (*3-6): Tommy Paul took the minibreak and then he nailed two brilliant crosscourt forehands in successive points. Great serving from him there and he has a significant lead in the tiebreak. Fifth set: Grigor Dimitrov vs Tommy Paul 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 6-6: We are heading to a final set tiebreak after Dimitrov held with some good serving and then a great combination of volleys at the net. This is very difficult to call - Paul looks more likely to take the ball on and make something happen in the tiebreak, but he is also visibly tired. Dimitrov could probably run for another 10 hours, but he is so tense on the big points. First set: Serena Williams 2-0* Tamara Zidansek: Serena Williams has started on Rod Laver Arena and she is already in full flow. She battered Zidansek\u2019s serve to open the match with a break, then she pieced together a brilliant hold to 15, punctuated with a 187kmh unreturned serve. Fifth set: Grigor Dimitrov defeats Tommy Paul 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 *5-6: Paul looks absolutely exhausted out here and nothing in his short career has prepared him for such a tense 5 setter on the biggest stage, but here he is fighting his heart out. After an unreturned serve at 30-15 and an ace out wide at 40-15, he will get at least a deciding tiebreak. Fifth set: Grigor Dimitrov defeats Tommy Paul 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 5-5*: Incredible scenes as Tommy Paul breaks back for 5-5! Dimitrov was 30-0 up but as the Bulgarian faltered, Paul threw the kitchen sink across the court. At 30-30, he nailed a backhand down the line and then, after a long and tense rally, he attacked the net and forced a backhand error from Dimitrov to break back. The Bulgarian is far too passive in these tense moments and he is paying for it. Serena Williams and Tamara Zidansek have arrived on Rod Laver Arena. Serena could not have had a better start to the year, really. She started her season with a tough, hard fought title in Auckland and she looked fantastic in her opening round against Anastasia Potapova. This is another opportunity for her to show her level against a lesser opponent. We\u2019ll see if the 22 year-old can disrupt Williams with her slice and defence. It will be certainly be hard. Fifth set: Grigor Dimitrov 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 *4-3 Tommy Paul: Tense, tense moments on Margaret Court Arena with a flurry of breaks. First Dimitrov broke for 3-2, then Paul broke straight back, but Dimitrov was unperturbed. He restored the break lead with a pair of brilliant points: at deuce, he broke up a long 20 stroke rally with a wicked down the line slice that forced a Paul forehand error. On break point, he nailed a backhand down the line passing shot. We\u2019ll see if Dimitrov has the nerve to finish it. What has happened so far today? The good news for most of the top seeds: not much has happened. Petra Kvitova, Ashleigh Barty and Naomi Osaka are all through in the women\u2019s draw, while Caroline Wozniacki pulled off a great 7-5 7-5 win over Dayana Yastremska, recovering from a double break down in both sets to brush aside retirement for one more day. Coco Gauff, meanwhile, edged out Sorana Cirstea 7-5 in the third to book another meeting with Naomi Osaka. 13th seed Elise Mertens fell to Julia Goerges, a superior player despite the rankings, while 11th seed Aryna Sabalenka was outplayed by former top 5 player Carla Suarez Navarro, the woman with the glorious single-handed backhand, who will retire at the end of theyear. In the men\u2019s draw, Dan Evans was ousted by Yoshihito Nishioka of Japan, Novak Djokovic was an easy winner, Stefanos Tsitsipas received a walkover and Milos Raonic also won. The major upset so far is 8th seed Matteo Berrettini, who fell in five sets to Tenny Sandgren The big match in progress right now is between 18th seed Grigor Dimitrov and young American Tommy Paul on Margaret Court Arena. 22 year-old Paul started incredibly well, but the the Bulgarian has admirably fought back from two sets down to force a fifth set. The current score at 4-6 6-7 6-3 7-6 1-1* and there will be a one set shootout for a spot in the third round. Here is Kevin Mitchell on Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff, who will meet again on Friday after their victories today. Hello! Welcome to our coverage on night three of the Australian Open. After the 88 completed singles matches yesterday, today has thankfully been a little more relaxed and the tournament will be hoping that we are also in store for a relaxed night as its two most famous players return to the Rod Laver Arena. Serena Williams will kick off the night session with her first ever meeting against Tamara Zidansek. The Slovenian is a resourceful, intelligent player with great movement, but she is also quite underpowered and the lack of weight behind her shots will make this a tough match-up against the supreme weaponry of Serena Williams. It will likely be a similar scenario when Roger Federer faces Filip Krajinovic, a stylish Serbian player with a lovely backhand and ample variety. However, Krajinovic\u2019s game also lacks the heft required to go toe-to-toe with the 20 time slam champion\u2019s vicious aggression. Still, the pair have played three times before and, although Krajinovic lost each meeting, he should take heart from snatching a set against Federer in 2018. On Margaret Court Arena, Australia\u2019s Jordan Thompson will face 12th seed Fabio Fognini and 10th seed Madison Keys, a former semi-finalist, will be up against Aranxta Rus.",

The conservative state \u2013 which has voted for a Republican president every year since 1968 \u2013 barred the practice after the Mormon church said it would support the legislation. Campaigners hope other conservative states could also ban conversion therapy this year. Conversion therapy has been widely discredited as unethical and damaging to recipients\u2019 mental health. A study in the UK in 2019 found that people who received conversion therapy were more likely to have suicidal thoughts, anxiety and depression. The passing of the ban was reliant on the support of the Mormon church, which holds tremendous influence in Utah. The majority of state lawmakers and nearly two-thirds of the state\u2019s 3.1 million residents are members. The Mormon church opposes same-sex marriage and teaches that intimate same-sex relationships are a sin, but also urges members to be kind and compassionate to LGBTQ+ people. The church\u2019s support for the conversion therapy ban was conditional on assurances that church leaders and members who are therapists would be allowed to provide spiritual counseling for parishioners or families. The original sponsor of the proposal, Republican Utah representative Craig Hall, applauded the rule going into effect, saying in a statement that it prohibits dangerous practices while protecting healthcare professionals. \u201cThis measure will truly save lives,\u201d he said. The new rule bans Utah therapists from subjecting LGBTQ+ minors to the practice that the American Psychological Association has said is not based in science and is harmful to mental health.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has insisted that the UK will go ahead with plans for a tax on giant tech companies this spring despite intensifying pressure from the US to drop the idea. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the proposed digital services tax discriminated against US multinationals and there would be retaliation \u2013 probably a tax on UK car exports to the US \u2013 if the 2% levy were imposed in April. Speaking on a panel in Davos that included Mnuchin and the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, Javid said: \u201cWe plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in April. \u201cIt is a proportionate tax, and a tax that is deliberately designed as a temporary tax.\u201d France is preparing to drop its own plan for a 3% levy on the total annual revenues of the largest technology firms providing services to French consumers. France\u2019s plan \u2013 called the GAFA tax because it was seen to target the US companies Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon \u2013 prompted the threat of retaliation from Washington, which vowed to put taxes on French imports including wine. Mnuchin and Georgieva argued strongly that the way to tax digital commerce was to back the attempts to strike an international accord being negotiated by the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Javid said the proposed UK tax \u201cwill fall away when there is an international agreement\u201d. Mnuchin said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have some private conversations about that and I\u2019m sure the president and Boris [Johnson] will be speaking on it as well. This is an important issue that we\u2019ll deal with.\u201d He added: \u201cIf people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies.\u201d Georgieva said digital companies needed to pay their fair share of tax. \u201cBut do it properly and do it in a multilateral context rather than having countries coming up with plans here, there and everywhere.\u201d Javid was also challenged over the UK government\u2019s insistence that it can negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal with the EU by the end of the year.

Urine is rich in nitrogen and phosphorus and has been used for generations to help plants grow. But the presence of urinary tract infections in donors means the fluid can also contain DNA from bacteria \u2013 including genes for antibiotic resistance. One concern is that even if the microbes themselves are killed either as a result of storage conditions or pasteurisation, this DNA could be taken up by other bacteria in the environment and end up causing antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. The spread of antibiotic resistance is an issue experts have said is as great a threat to humanity as the climate crisis. But now experts say that, for stored urine at least, bacterial DNA is not passed on to other microbes. \u201cI think this is an important step in demonstrating that we have methods where we can reduce the risks that the things in urine pose,\u201d said Dr Krista Wigginton, a co-author of the research from the University of Michigan. Writing in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, Wigginton and colleagues report how they investigated the issue by focusing on rings of DNA found within certain microbes, including bacteria, and which can be passed between them. Such DNA plasmids have previously been found in urine. The team collected more than 100 litres of urine from male and female donors across Vermont and stored it for between 12 and 16 months \u2013 enough time for a substance within the urine, known as urea, to break down to ammonia. The team introduced plasmid DNA that contained genes for resistance towards two antibiotics, tetracycline and ampicillin, into the aged urine and carried out a number of tests to see whether the common soil bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi would take up the DNA and hence gain antibiotic resistance. The results reveal no difference in the uptake of either antibiotic resistance gene by Acinetobacter baylyi, whether aged urine immediately spiked with plasmid DNA was used, aged urine incubated with the plasmid DNA for 10 hours or plasmid DNA in water. However, as the time the plasmid DNA spent in the aged urine increased to 24 hours, a 99% drop in the uptake of the antibiotic resistant genes by the soil bacteria was seen. That, the team said, suggested the contents of the urine affected the plasmid DNA over time, making it less able to be taken up \u2013 possibly by severing the plasmid. \u201cWe found that after a pretty short time in this stored urine \u2026 the DNA had lost its ability to transform these environmental bacteria,\u201d said Wigginton.

The team say that suggests either bacteria within the urine itself, or enzymes in the aged urine, are responsible for decreasing the ability for the plasmid DNA to be shared with the soil bacteria. The team conclude that, provided urine is aged \u2013 as is the case in most systems designed to collect urine for fertiliser \u2013 it is unlikely to spread antibiotic resistance if used on crops. The study has limitations, including that it only looked at plasmid DNA and only examined the spread to one type of bacteria. But Wigginton said the idea of using human urine for fertiliser was a growing field: an estimated 330 tonnes of nitrogen and 20 tonnes of phosphorus a day could be retrieved should 10% of the US population collect their urine. \u201cHumans have been collecting urine and using it for fertiliser for a long, long time, but then in the west that really stopped with the invention of sewage system,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are just trying now to figure out with this infrastructure system that we have, how do we pull back and think differently about what goes into this sewage system and capture some of those valuable products before [they] get mixed and diluted with everything else?\u201d",

Michelle Obama and her daughters at the first inauguration ceremony \u2013 with jewel-bright J Crew coats and scarves for the girls, a lemongrass coat with moss gloves for the first lady \u2013 was the all-time masterclass. If rain is forecast, think feet first. Leather ankle boots are far superior to trainers, which get squelchy quickly. If you wear trousers, tuck the hems into your boots to keep them dry and the silhouette neat. Do not wear light-coloured trousers, because a van will definitely race past as you wait to cross the road and leave you mud-spattered and cross.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ae0a262750a7c119ed26b1da8da1bf9797f6dc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ae0a262750a7c119ed26b1da8da1bf9797f6dc7/0_509_2991_1994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha Obama at Obama\u2019s presidential inauguration in January 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha Obama at Obama\u2019s presidential inauguration in January 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For rain, you will also need either an umbrella or a hood or a hat. Umbrellas are viciously anti-social and perhaps best avoided on busy urban commutes, but they are essential for winter weddings, or on a rainy night out when you want to wear a pretty outfit and put a roof over it for short periods. Invest in a decent brolly, though. The cheap ones are a false economy, inevitably blowing inside out at the worst possible moment, and there is something so very miserable about a brolly with broken spokes. If you can pull off a fedora or a trilby, without giving yourself comedy hair and without immediately leaving it behind at the first place you take it off (I fail on both counts), bingo. I rarely find hooded coats that look smart, so for day-to-day I swear by detachable hoods, which you tuck under a normal coat. I have a treasured Cos one, which doesn\u2019t appear to be in stock right now, but Zara\u2019s version, which comes in black or a very jolly fisherman\u2019s yellow, is <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/padded-hood-p03920402.html\" title=\"\">reduced from \u00a317.99 to \u00a37.99</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e66f9c7d6527fa026ded9a2e61dc33223188a5d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e66f9c7d6527fa026ded9a2e61dc33223188a5d2/141_144_3306_3289/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan on the cover of his first album.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"995\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan on the cover of his first album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBW/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With a detachable hood, and a scarf in a contrasting colour, you can make one smart coat work for most weathers. A classic tie-belt style is versatile and timeless \u2013 this one <a href=\"https://www.stories.com/en_gbp/clothing/jackets-coats/woolcoats/product.belted-wool-blend-coat-blue.0643545005.html\" title=\"\">from &amp; Other Stories</a>, with a chic collarless lapel, has a sleek silhouette and can be cosied up with a scarf. A trenchcoat is a classic, and works just as brilliantly to keep out wind as it does in the rain: something about that stiffened collar, that proud shoulder line, lends you a Bogartesque, Casablanca-finale resolve. A quilted duvet coat is a brilliantly practical option that is now thoroughly fashion-approved. I\u2019ve seen plenty of them at haute couture this week and they look surprisingly chic layered over blazers. I am resolving to try this out for New York fashion week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a86c55e8b9aaef633fd0a54cd0667e8824d7991d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a86c55e8b9aaef633fd0a54cd0667e8824d7991d/0_122_3164_1899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in When Harry Met Sally.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in When Harry Met Sally.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a reason fashion people love September, and it isn\u2019t just because of the new collections in the shops. It is because September weather \u2013 transitional, half-and-half weather \u2013 is a dream to dress for. This time of year, on the other hand, is a bit of a nightmare. But while we can prevail against frostbite and fashion fails, I have one final, bossy fashion decree: please, no fur trimmed hoods. No real fur, obviously, but also no fake fur \u2013 it just looks very 00s. It\u2019s tough out there. All the more reason to look sharp.</p>",

Do not wear light-coloured trousers, because a van will definitely race past as you wait to cross the road and leave you mud-spattered and cross. For rain, you will also need either an umbrella or a hood or a hat. Umbrellas are viciously anti-social and perhaps best avoided on busy urban commutes, but they are essential for winter weddings, or on a rainy night out when you want to wear a pretty outfit and put a roof over it for short periods. Invest in a decent brolly, though. The cheap ones are a false economy, inevitably blowing inside out at the worst possible moment, and there is something so very miserable about a brolly with broken spokes. If you can pull off a fedora or a trilby, without giving yourself comedy hair and without immediately leaving it behind at the first place you take it off (I fail on both counts), bingo. I rarely find hooded coats that look smart, so for day-to-day I swear by detachable hoods, which you tuck under a normal coat. I have a treasured Cos one, which doesn\u2019t appear to be in stock right now, but Zara\u2019s version, which comes in black or a very jolly fisherman\u2019s yellow, is reduced from \u00a317.99 to \u00a37.99. With a detachable hood, and a scarf in a contrasting colour, you can make one smart coat work for most weathers. A classic tie-belt style is versatile and timeless \u2013 this one from &amp; Other Stories, with a chic collarless lapel, has a sleek silhouette and can be cosied up with a scarf. A trenchcoat is a classic, and works just as brilliantly to keep out wind as it does in the rain: something about that stiffened collar, that proud shoulder line, lends you a Bogartesque, Casablanca-finale resolve. A quilted duvet coat is a brilliantly practical option that is now thoroughly fashion-approved. I\u2019ve seen plenty of them at haute couture this week and they look surprisingly chic layered over blazers. I am resolving to try this out for New York fashion week. There is a reason fashion people love September, and it isn\u2019t just because of the new collections in the shops. It is because September weather \u2013 transitional, half-and-half weather \u2013 is a dream to dress for. This time of year, on the other hand, is a bit of a nightmare. But while we can prevail against frostbite and fashion fails, I have one final, bossy fashion decree: please, no fur trimmed hoods. No real fur, obviously, but also no fake fur \u2013 it just looks very 00s. It\u2019s tough out there. All the more reason to look sharp.",

Meanwhile, better urban planning and city management could improve the lives of more than 1 billion people who currently live in slums, often with little access to decent sanitation, clean water or energy. Better migration policies and lower transaction costs for family remittances would also allow millions of people to pursue better opportunities and improve their lives, added the report. \u201cIt is difficult to address inequality, but it can be successfully reduced. We need to agree on the need and the policy, and then address it,\u201d said Harris. \u201cThis is not [our] destiny. If we act now through policy, we can deliver better outcomes.\u201d",

But now she is getting out, and she could not be happier.</p> <p>\u201cI think I had my first interview when I was eight or nine years old, it\u2019s pretty crazy,\u201d Wozniacki said at the Australian Open. \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been scrutinised, my career\u2019s been scrutinised. So it\u2019s nice to do what I want to do, not have to think twice about anything. Obviously I want to make right decisions but just be able to live life.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about being an athlete, once you stop, there are always new people coming up and taking your spot, you can live a normal life, you can live a family life and have the best of both worlds, having your time in the spotlight but also just doing normal stuff.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/22/serena-williams-into-australian-open-tennis-third-round-testy-win-zidansek\">Serena Williams into Australian Open third round after testy win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wozniacki announced last month that this year\u2019s Australian Open, where she won her first and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/27/caroline-wozniacki-wins-australian-open-title-after-epic-battle-with-halep\" title=\"\"> only grand slam title in 2018</a>, would be her last event.

No one worked harder or was more dedicated and, as she showed yet again at Melbourne Park on Wednesday her desire remains undimmed; she came back from 5-1 down in the first set and 3-0 down in the second to beat one of the young pretenders, the No 23 seed, Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine, in the second round, extending her career a few days longer at least.</p> <p>At 29, she is retiring relatively young by today\u2019s standards. Her decision came after she was diagnosed in the summer of 2018 with rheumatoid arthritis, the auto-immune disease that can cause joint pain all over the body. Wozniacki refused to be pigeonholed, refused to believe she could not carry on being one of the best athletes in the world.

      "bodyText": "Caroline Wozniacki has spent the majority of her life in a fishbowl, her every move monitored and detailed. She never complained, accepting that it is part of the business of being a top sportswoman, that if she told paparazzi not to take photos it wouldn\u2019t do any good. But now she is getting out, and she could not be happier. \u201cI think I had my first interview when I was eight or nine years old, it\u2019s pretty crazy,\u201d Wozniacki said at the Australian Open. \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been scrutinised, my career\u2019s been scrutinised. So it\u2019s nice to do what I want to do, not have to think twice about anything. Obviously I want to make right decisions but just be able to live life. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about being an athlete, once you stop, there are always new people coming up and taking your spot, you can live a normal life, you can live a family life and have the best of both worlds, having your time in the spotlight but also just doing normal stuff.\u201d Wozniacki announced last month that this year\u2019s Australian Open, where she won her first and only grand slam title in 2018, would be her last event. The Dane, who topped the world rankings at the age of 20, spent 71 weeks as the world No 1 and has won 30 titles all over the world, from Stockholm in 2008 to Beijing in 2018. Few players can boast a career even half as good as Wozniacki, who has also won more than $35m in prize money. No one worked harder or was more dedicated and, as she showed yet again at Melbourne Park on Wednesday her desire remains undimmed; she came back from 5-1 down in the first set and 3-0 down in the second to beat one of the young pretenders, the No 23 seed, Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine, in the second round, extending her career a few days longer at least. At 29, she is retiring relatively young by today\u2019s standards. Her decision came after she was diagnosed in the summer of 2018 with rheumatoid arthritis, the auto-immune disease that can cause joint pain all over the body. Wozniacki refused to be pigeonholed, refused to believe she could not carry on being one of the best athletes in the world. But it opened her eyes to a disease she knew little about and a community of people who she hopes, in retirement, to still be able to inspire. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely [been] very challenging,\u201d Wozniacki said, admitting that forcing herself to work hard every day, to play a full schedule had been very difficult. \u201cI love going to the gym, I love being active, so it\u2019s something I\u2019m always going to do. I hope I can inspire a lot of people and if I can even help a few people, I\u2019ve already done my part. \u201cBut I hope I can inspire and help a lot of people, and educate a lot of people as well, because RA is something that not a lot of people are very familiar with. \u201cI wasn\u2019t, I had no idea what I was getting myself into, what was happening, so if I can help someone that was as confused as I was, that would mean a lot to me.\u201d Wozniacki won junior Wimbledon in 2006 but she began her professional career the year before, in Cincinnati, where she was beaten in the first round by Patty Schnyder of Switzerland, then ranked inside the top 10.

If she is hugely proud of her attitude \u2013 \u201cI never slacked\u201d \u2013 her character has had as much an impact as her on-court achievements. On the court, though, becoming No 1 for a third time when she won her first grand slam title in Melbourne two years ago \u2013 one in the face for those who said she would never win one \u2013 ranks as her most proud moment as a player. \u201cI think being No 1 for such a long period of time is probably much harder than winning one tournament, where you have a great couple of weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut having the combination of the two is something very few people have done.\u201d She has inspired a generation of players in her home country - Denmark has had both junior world No 1s in the past year \u2013 and family life beckons. But first there may just be time for one last hurrah; if she can beat Ons Jabeur of Tunisia on Friday she is likely to face her best friend on Tour, Serena Williams, in the last 16. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy, that career she\u2019s had, both her and Venus still playing now and on this level is impressive,\u201d Wozniacki said. \u201cI really admire that and I think that\u2019s the career choice they\u2019ve made.

Yet arranging a temporary deal for the former Napoli striker, who earns a reported \u00a3360,000 a week after tax, will not be easy. While Chelsea do not want to pay a large loan fee for a player on such high wages, PSG are not minded to let Cavani go on cheap.</p> <p>Another complication is that Cavani favours a move to Spain. Atl\u00e9tico are confident of signing him, even though Chelsea are desperate to find quality competition for Abraham, and the player\u2019s father has urged PSG to let him leave now rather than make him wait until he is able to depart on a free transfer in the summer. Reports have claimed that the French club want their Spanish counterparts to pay at least \u00a315m for the former Napoli player.</p> <p>\u201cHe wants to join another club in Europe,\u201d Luis Cavani said. \u201cThat would please me that he plays here [at Atl\u00e9tico]. Simeone wants him now. The head coach of Paris Saint-Germain has also said he needs him to help compete in the Champions League.</p> <p>\u201cBut PSG do not want him to go to Atl\u00e9tico if he finds an agreement. I think there is a strong chance that he will go to Atl\u00e9tico.

      "bodyText": "Chelsea\u2019s hopes of signing Edinson Cavani on loan until the end of the season have been dealt a blow after the striker\u2019s father said his son will join Atl\u00e9tico Madrid if the La Liga club can agree a deal with Paris Saint-Germain. Frank Lampard wants Chelsea to sign Cavani on a short-term basis and PSG have rejected their first offer of a six-month loan. However it is understood the Uruguayan has already agreed an 18-month deal worth \u20ac10m euros a year with Atl\u00e9tico, who have had three bids for the 32-year-old turned down by PSG. Cavani, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, has made it clear he wants to secure a permanent move to Diego Simeone\u2019s side this month. Chelsea, who are concerned about Tammy Abraham\u2019s fitness after the striker injured his ankle during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Tuesday, are desperate for attacking reinforcements before the transfer window shuts and Lampard is an admirer of Cavani. Yet arranging a temporary deal for the former Napoli striker, who earns a reported \u00a3360,000 a week after tax, will not be easy. While Chelsea do not want to pay a large loan fee for a player on such high wages, PSG are not minded to let Cavani go on cheap. Another complication is that Cavani favours a move to Spain. Atl\u00e9tico are confident of signing him, even though Chelsea are desperate to find quality competition for Abraham, and the player\u2019s father has urged PSG to let him leave now rather than make him wait until he is able to depart on a free transfer in the summer. Reports have claimed that the French club want their Spanish counterparts to pay at least \u00a315m for the former Napoli player. \u201cHe wants to join another club in Europe,\u201d Luis Cavani said. \u201cThat would please me that he plays here [at Atl\u00e9tico]. Simeone wants him now. The head coach of Paris Saint-Germain has also said he needs him to help compete in the Champions League. \u201cBut PSG do not want him to go to Atl\u00e9tico if he finds an agreement. I think there is a strong chance that he will go to Atl\u00e9tico. The option to join the club Atl\u00e9tico always remains in June. \u201cThere are lots of other clubs but when you give your word to a team, you respect it. If tomorrow, if he is available and Atletico still want him, I think he will sign. He is a player who needs time to play and today, he only plays four or six minutes per game. PSG are treating him unfairly.\u201d Cavani\u2019s mother has also weighed in on her son\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated but he wants to play at Atl\u00e9tico and if it\u2019s not now, in the summer,\u201d Berta Gom\u00e9z said. \u201cWe have been eager for some time but it doesn\u2019t depend on my son but on PSG and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. We understand their position but what we don\u2019t understand is that they want him to stay and then they only bring him out for six minutes. They are not treating him well considering what he has given to PSG in the almost seven years he has been there.\u201d Cavani has also been offered to Tottenham, who are without the hamstrung Harry Kane until mid-April, and he could be of interest to Manchester United, who are without Marcus Rashford for at least two months with a double stress fracture in his back.

So when I sat down in my seat, slightly perspiring, I was very much in the right zone.</p> <p>Between them, the Berlin circus trio <a href=\"https://www.still-hungry.net/\">Still Hungry</a> have six children and decades of performing experience, and the imperfect juggling of those two sides of their lives is what they\u2019re wrestling with on stage. Lena Ries, Romy Seibt and Anke van Engelshoven mix aerial acrobatics and contortion with candid monologue (confessional live art queen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bryony-kimmings\">Bryony Kimmings</a> was a consultant on the show), plus comic scenes of the prosaic but horrifying truths of parenthood: zombified sleeplessness, endless laundry, competitive mothering and constant judgment.</p> <p><em>Rabenmutter</em> (\u201craven mother\u201d) is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12703897\">a German term</a> for a neglectful mother, or just one who leaves her children in order to work. The women in this show have heard the insult and both defend and second-guess themselves. Maybe their vocation is too risky? Maybe they are away on tour for too long? Maybe they are getting too old for all this? The last one seems unlikely: they certainly still have the skills \u2013 Seibt adeptly climbing a rope balancing a baby (doll) on her foot \u2013 and they use them to build layers on top of their text. But too few images really stick. One scene that works is when Van Engelshoven dares to talk about what she misses from her pre-kids life (freedom, irresponsibility, loud music, lost weekends), rises to the roof on aerial straps to a thumping bass, and spins herself into oblivion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35ebfcf49a9ff7bbd646c1960b4420fca3fbce9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35ebfcf49a9ff7bbd646c1960b4420fca3fbce9e/0_159_3764_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anke van Engelshoven, Romy Seibt and Lena Ries in Raven\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Despite the women\u2019s unusual skillset, Raven is utterly relatable, especially since the cast don\u2019t really have the answers. It\u2019s timely, important and entertaining subject matter, but as theatre it could go deeper, darker, be even funnier and more badass. Both parenting and circus are full of extremes. With more of these on stage, Still Hungry could push this clever and likeable show into something stellar.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://www.jacksonslane.org.uk/whats-on/raven\">Jacksons Lane, London</a>, until 23 January. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A disclaimer: to make it to this circus-theatre show about the challenges and compromises of being a working mother, I ran down the street to the station having hustled my two-year-old through dinner, bathtime and a relay-style parental handover. So when I sat down in my seat, slightly perspiring, I was very much in the right zone. Between them, the Berlin circus trio Still Hungry have six children and decades of performing experience, and the imperfect juggling of those two sides of their lives is what they\u2019re wrestling with on stage. Lena Ries, Romy Seibt and Anke van Engelshoven mix aerial acrobatics and contortion with candid monologue (confessional live art queen Bryony Kimmings was a consultant on the show), plus comic scenes of the prosaic but horrifying truths of parenthood: zombified sleeplessness, endless laundry, competitive mothering and constant judgment. Rabenmutter (\u201craven mother\u201d) is a German term for a neglectful mother, or just one who leaves her children in order to work. The women in this show have heard the insult and both defend and second-guess themselves. Maybe their vocation is too risky? Maybe they are away on tour for too long? Maybe they are getting too old for all this? The last one seems unlikely: they certainly still have the skills \u2013 Seibt adeptly climbing a rope balancing a baby (doll) on her foot \u2013 and they use them to build layers on top of their text. But too few images really stick. One scene that works is when Van Engelshoven dares to talk about what she misses from her pre-kids life (freedom, irresponsibility, loud music, lost weekends), rises to the roof on aerial straps to a thumping bass, and spins herself into oblivion. Despite the women\u2019s unusual skillset, Raven is utterly relatable, especially since the cast don\u2019t really have the answers. It\u2019s timely, important and entertaining subject matter, but as theatre it could go deeper, darker, be even funnier and more badass. Both parenting and circus are full of extremes. With more of these on stage, Still Hungry could push this clever and likeable show into something stellar. \u2022 At Jacksons Lane, London, until 23 January.",

The eventual members of Flood threw many of their own parties because, as they see it, commercialised venues prioritise footfall and double-vodka receipts over the sensory experience. Today, Syn helps run a queer night called CXNT in the Roundy, where throbbing, untrendy styles like hardgroove, gabber and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/jul/29/bouncytechnomeetsterribler\">donk pass as the norm</a>. As O\u2019Connell puts it: \u201cThe big clubs just want to hear EDM and boring, Heineken-sponsored, white-bread, Fiat 500 techno.\u201d</p> <p>Despite their own inventiveness, and the support of Plugd and other venues, such as Kino and the Village Hall, producers are forced to look elsewhere for opportunities. The sounds being created in Cork have been championed by artists and DJs in the capital, at <a href=\"https://listen.dublindigitalradio.com/home\">Dublin Digital Radio</a> \u2013 a haven for Ireland\u2019s weirdest sounds, where McMorrow still hosts a monthly show called Hush \u2013 as well as exciting collectives such as Club Comfort.</p> <p>Many talented producers and creatives have, at least semi-permanently, gone overseas. Qualified mathematician O\u2019Connell left recently for Beijing, while King and Superf\u00efcie have both moved to Berlin. As it happens, McMorrow is busy preparing himself for a move to Glasgow when we speak, a common journey for Irish creatives in recent years. Rents are lower there, conditions for nightlife culture are less suffocating, and young people are, in his view, treated better in Scotland than in his home country.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re planning on forking out over half your basic income every month, you probably won\u2019t be able to find a place to live in Cork,\u201d he laments. \u201cI would love nothing more than to be able to stay in Cork, and do what I love here, but right now it\u2019s just not feasible.\u201d</p> <p>Financial barriers have not halted the momentum of these artists, however. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a warehouse party with 30 drunk people crammed into a dark, dingy room listening to industrial remixes of Princess Superstar, or watching the Roundy get turned into a topless sweatbox,\u201d O\u2019Mahony says of his enduring memories of the community-based micro-scene, \u201cit\u2019s the things that were done for, and by, people like us that stand out.\u201d</p>",

Most of these artists don\u2019t identify with Cork\u2019s pathological self-mythologising, though. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy much of my youth, and spent a lot of my time as a teenager in local drinking spots,\u201d says Syn, 25, whose mother has worked as a club DJ. \u201cI remember begrudging Cork from a young age because of the lack of activities for youth in the city beyond getting fucked up.\u201d DIY hustling was the only way forward in a tourism-oriented country where, every couple of months, a hotel seems to replace a vital nightlife hub. The eventual members of Flood threw many of their own parties because, as they see it, commercialised venues prioritise footfall and double-vodka receipts over the sensory experience. Today, Syn helps run a queer night called CXNT in the Roundy, where throbbing, untrendy styles like hardgroove, gabber and donk pass as the norm. As O\u2019Connell puts it: \u201cThe big clubs just want to hear EDM and boring, Heineken-sponsored, white-bread, Fiat 500 techno.\u201d Despite their own inventiveness, and the support of Plugd and other venues, such as Kino and the Village Hall, producers are forced to look elsewhere for opportunities. The sounds being created in Cork have been championed by artists and DJs in the capital, at Dublin Digital Radio \u2013 a haven for Ireland\u2019s weirdest sounds, where McMorrow still hosts a monthly show called Hush \u2013 as well as exciting collectives such as Club Comfort. Many talented producers and creatives have, at least semi-permanently, gone overseas. Qualified mathematician O\u2019Connell left recently for Beijing, while King and Superf\u00efcie have both moved to Berlin. As it happens, McMorrow is busy preparing himself for a move to Glasgow when we speak, a common journey for Irish creatives in recent years. Rents are lower there, conditions for nightlife culture are less suffocating, and young people are, in his view, treated better in Scotland than in his home country. \u201cUnless you\u2019re planning on forking out over half your basic income every month, you probably won\u2019t be able to find a place to live in Cork,\u201d he laments. \u201cI would love nothing more than to be able to stay in Cork, and do what I love here, but right now it\u2019s just not feasible.\u201d Financial barriers have not halted the momentum of these artists, however. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a warehouse party with 30 drunk people crammed into a dark, dingy room listening to industrial remixes of Princess Superstar, or watching the Roundy get turned into a topless sweatbox,\u201d O\u2019Mahony says of his enduring memories of the community-based micro-scene, \u201cit\u2019s the things that were done for, and by, people like us that stand out.\u201d",

Peter Phillips and Lady Kitty Spencer. And who, with the greatest respect, are they? Phillips is Princess Anne\u2019s son, and 15th in line to the throne. Spencer is Princess Diana\u2019s niece, and nowhere in line to the throne. I take it they are both rearing luxury dairy herds. Not quite, no. What then? They are promoting rival milk brands in China. What do posh British people know about Chinese milk? Good question. Last June, Spencer hosted a launch event in London for a product called Satine Jersey Milk British Museum Classic Edition. I\u2019m no marketing expert, but museum-quality milk just sounds a bit \u2026 old. A press release issued at the time said: \u201cKitty Spencer, niece of the late Princess Diana, made an authentic English breakfast tea with Jersey milk and shared the story of Jersey milk and the British royal family.\u201d What story is that? She told assembled Chinese journalists: \u201cThe day of the royal family usually begins with a cup of milk or a cup of tea.\u201d Hard to debunk that one. Meanwhile, Phillips was appearing in an advert for another brand of Jersey milk produced by a state-owed Chinese food company. What does he do in the advert? He stands about in a palace (which appears to be Longleat House, though is uncredited), accepts a glass of milk from a butler holding a tray and says \u2013 in English \u2013 \u201cThis is what I drink.\u201d He drinks milk imported from China?

And Spencer as well, don\u2019t forget. Yes, although she is styled as a \u201cBritish noble member\u201d for the purposes of Chinese dairy product promotion. Isn\u2019t this exactly what Harry and Meghan stand accused of? It is indeed, but the duke and duchess have so far got only a logo and a website, while these two have been quietly cashing in for six months. What, if anything, do sources close to Phillips have to say about his advert? One told the Daily Mail: \u201cAs Peter does not undertake any royal duties and does not receive any income from the taxpayer, he is entitled to go about his business and earn a living.\u201d Do say: \u201cShow one the money.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cJust a bit of lemon for me thanks, Jeeves.\u201d",

Shapps said options for the franchise included nationalisation or the issuing of a new contract to SWR\u2019s operators.</p> <p>Filings at Companies House published earlier this month showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/07/south-western-railway-may-be-nationalised-after-firm-loses-137m\">business lost \u00a3137m</a> in the year to March 2019 and was in danger of going bust before the end of this year.</p> <p>The franchise has been beset by poor punctuality and reliability, combined with slower-than-expected revenue growth and a wave of strikes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/30/south-western-railway-faces-fresh-wave-of-rmt-strikes-in-new-year\">in a dispute</a> over the use of guards on trains.

      "bodyText": "The South Western Railway franchise is \u201cnot sustainable\u201d and could be nationalised, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps\u2019s warning, which comes as the rail franchising system looks likely to be ripped up and redrawn, follows a period of poor financial performance for SWR, a joint venture between FirstGroup and the Hong Kong firm MTR. Shapps said options for the franchise included nationalisation or the issuing of a new contract to SWR\u2019s operators. Filings at Companies House published earlier this month showed the business lost \u00a3137m in the year to March 2019 and was in danger of going bust before the end of this year. The franchise has been beset by poor punctuality and reliability, combined with slower-than-expected revenue growth and a wave of strikes in a dispute over the use of guards on trains. In a written statement to parliament, Shapps said the company\u2019s recent financial statements indicated that the franchise, which began in August 2017 and stretches from London to the Surrey commuter belt, Bournemouth and Exeter, \u201cis not sustainable in the long term\u201d. SWR has not yet failed to meet its financial commitments, said Shapps but the Department for Transport \u201cmust prepare suitable contingency measures\u201d, including handing the route over to the state-owned operator of last resort. Earlier this month, Shapps began the process of nationalising the Northern rail franchise, two years after the government took control of the east coast mainline. Industry figures show that, between 8 December and 4 January, the proportion of scheduled train stops made within a minute of the timetable by SWR was 55%, compared with the average across Britain of 62%. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union on SWR have staged a series of strikes stretching back more than two years in a dispute over the role of guards, which has caused severe disruption for passengers. The latest strikes lasted throughout December and into New Year\u2019s Day, leading to cancellations and delays. The RMT has recently launched a fresh ballot of members on continuing industrial action. Shapps said in the statement that the strikes are \u201cnot about safety, accessibility or helping passengers\u201d and insisted: \u201cDriver-controlled trains are perfectly safe. These trains allow the guards to devote much more time to looking after passengers.\u201d The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cThis government is acting like a puppet for the rail companies, throwing good public money after bad and trying to breathe life into the rotting corpse of privatised rail. \u201cInstead of dreaming up new ways to subsidise private-sector profits by attacking civil liberties, he [Grant Shapps] should stop pushing cost-cutting driver-only operation and bring SWR into public ownership, running it in the interests of passengers and workers, not his mates in the City.\u201d The government-commissioned Williams review into the future of the rail industry is due to report soon and the review\u2019s chairman, the former British Airways boss Keith Williams, has already said franchising no longer works in its current form. SWR and Northern\u2019s troubles are being staged against the backdrop of a lawsuit launched by the train operator Stagecoach, alongside Virgin Trains and France\u2019s state-backed SNCF. The high court case could force the government to pay tens of millions of pounds in compensation and cancel two franchises. The train companies claim they were improperly disqualified from rail franchise bids because the government expected them to take on an unrealistic amount of financial risk relating to the railways pension scheme.",

But 15% is emitted into the atmosphere as climate-heating gases and nearly a quarter is discarded into the environment, such as plastic in waterways and oceans. A third of the materials is treated as waste, mostly going to landfill and mining spoil heaps. Just 8.6% is recycled.</p> <p>\u201cThis report sparks an alarm for all governments,\u201d said Carolina Schmidt, Chile\u2019s environment minister. \u201cWe need to deploy all the policies to really catalyse this transformation [to a circular economy].\u201d</p> <p>Cristianne Close of the conservation group WWF said: \u201cThe circular economy provides a framework for reducing our impacts, protecting ecosystems and living within the means of one planet.\u201d</p> <p>The report said increasing recycling can make economies more competitive, improve living conditions and help to meet emissions targets and avoid deforestation.

      "bodyText": "The amount of material consumed by humanity has passed 100bn tonnes every year, a report has revealed, but the proportion being recycled is falling. The climate and wildlife emergencies are driven by the unsustainable extraction of fossil fuels, metals, building materials and trees. The report\u2019s authors warn that treating the world\u2019s resources as limitless is leading towards global disaster. The materials used by the global economy have quadrupled since 1970, far faster than the population, which has doubled. In the last two years, consumption has jumped by more than 8% but the reuse of resources has fallen from 9.1% to 8.6%. The report, by the Circle Economy thinktank, was launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It shows that, on average, every person on Earth uses more than 13 tonnes of materials per year. But the report also found that some nations are making steps towards circular economies in which renewable energy underpins systems where waste and pollution are reduced to zero. \u201cWe risk global disaster if we continue to treat the world\u2019s resources as if they are limitless,\u201d said Harald Friedl, the chief executive of Circle Economy. \u201cGovernments must urgently adopt circular economy solutions if we want to achieve a high quality of life for close to 10bn people by mid-century without destabilising critical planetary processes.\u201d Marc de Wit, the report\u2019s lead author, said: \u201cWe are still fuelling our growth in population and affluence by the extraction of virgin materials. We can\u2019t do this indefinitely \u2013 our hunger for virgin material needs to be halted.\u201d The report found that 100.6bn tonnes of materials were consumed in 2017, the latest year for which data is available. Half of the total is sand, clay, gravel and cement used for building, along with the other minerals quarried to produce fertiliser. Coal, oil and gas make up 15% and metal ores 10%. The final quarter are the plants and trees used for food and fuel. The lion\u2019s share of the materials \u2013 40% \u2013 is turned into housing. Other major categories include food, transport, healthcare, communications, and consumer goods such as clothes and furniture. Almost a third of the annual materials remain in use after a year, such as buildings and vehicles. But 15% is emitted into the atmosphere as climate-heating gases and nearly a quarter is discarded into the environment, such as plastic in waterways and oceans. A third of the materials is treated as waste, mostly going to landfill and mining spoil heaps. Just 8.6% is recycled. \u201cThis report sparks an alarm for all governments,\u201d said Carolina Schmidt, Chile\u2019s environment minister. \u201cWe need to deploy all the policies to really catalyse this transformation [to a circular economy].\u201d Cristianne Close of the conservation group WWF said: \u201cThe circular economy provides a framework for reducing our impacts, protecting ecosystems and living within the means of one planet.\u201d The report said increasing recycling can make economies more competitive, improve living conditions and help to meet emissions targets and avoid deforestation. It reported that 13 European countries have adopted circular economy roadmaps, including France, Germany and Spain, and that Colombia became the first Latin American country to launch a similar policy in 2019. China\u2019s ban on waste imports aims to encourage domestic recycling, the report said, but has also stimulated the development of circular economy strategies in Australia and other countries which previously exported their waste to China. Janez Poto\u010dnik, a former European environment commissioner and the co-chair of the UN Environment Programme international resource panel, said the world needed to learn to do more with less and replace ownership with sharing, as is increasingly being seen with cars.",

As is often the way in tennis\u2019s unique scoring system, Evans posted 31 points in the first frame to the Japanese player\u2019s 28, so he rightly reckoned there was little between them in the quality of their tennis. However, when broken for the fourth time at the end of the contest, his energy levels had dipped. As Evans observed, \u201cI had two big chances in the third and I didn\u2019t take them. He took his. And I thought he returned pretty good considering the conditions.\u201d As for building on his resurgence and aiming at a place in the top 20, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how good I am, so it\u2019s difficult to have ambitions. I know what I would like to be, but I can\u2019t tell you if I can be or not. It\u2019s one of the good things to find out; there\u2019s some good tournaments, I don\u2019t have to go through qualifying so I will be fresher each match.\u201d Evans will stay in Australia for a couple of days with his girlfriend and father before flying home. He will not have as busy a post-slam schedule as last year, cutting out Montpellier and probably sticking with commitments to Rotterdam, Marseille and Dubai.",

      "body": "<p>Mapo tofu, more romantically, if less glamorously, known as \u201cpock-marked old woman\u2019s tofu\u201d, is the beancurd equivalent of bacon: the surefire way to convert tofu sceptics to its quiet pleasures. A speciality of <a href=\"https://www.thefoodranger.com/the-ultimate-chengdu-food-tour/\" title=\"\">Chengdu</a>, the capital of Sichuan Province, it brims over with what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/14/pock-marked-old-woman-s-tofu-recipe\" title=\"\">Fuchsia Dunlop</a> describes as the \u201cspicy generosity\u201d of the region\u2019s cooking, being hot, salty and very moreish.</p> <p>The story goes that the dish is named after the smallpox-ravaged Old Mother Chen, who cooked up a fiery storm near the city\u2019s Bridge of Ten Thousand Blessings in the time of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (1856\u201375). More than a century later, her creation is on menus from Tokyo to Tulsa, known and loved for its aromatic heat and intensely savoury flavours, perfectly balanced by the creamy blandness of the beancurd. Trust me: even if you can\u2019t bear tofu, you\u2019ll love this.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/06/how-to-cook-the-perfect-nasi-goreng-recipe\">How to cook the perfect nasi goreng \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The tofu</h2> <p>There\u2019s surprisingly little agreement on the main component of the dish. J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt, <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/real-deal-mapo-dofu-tofu-chinese-sichuan-recipe.html\" title=\"\">whose recipe is based on that served by chef Zhang Wenxue at Boston\u2019s Fuloon restaurant</a>, calls expressly for \u201cmedium to firm\u201d silken tofu \u2013 the undrained and unpressed kind. But the \u201cself-taught cook from north-west China\u201d behind the <a href=\"https://redhousespice.com/mapo-tofu-authentic-way/\" title=\"\">Red House Spice blog</a>, Wei, recommends against using it \u2013 she prefers \u201cmedium-firm\u201d pressed tofu. <a href=\"https://blog.themalamarket.com/chengdu-challenge-10-mapo-doufu/\" title=\"\">The Sichuan Gourmet Association uses soft pressed beancurd</a>, as does <a href=\"https://www.gourmettraveller.com.au/recipes/fast-recipes/ma-po-beancurd-9508\" title=\"\">Tony Tan in his book Hong Kong Food City</a>, while Fuchsia Dunlop simply mentions plain, white beancurd.</p> <p>The difference, as these names suggest, is largely one of texture; the more liquid has been pressed out of the beancurd, the firmer it will be, and thus the easier to fry. Taylor Holliday, who, with her Chinese daughter <a href=\"https://themalamarket.com/\" title=\"\">runs a business importing Sichuan ingredients to the US</a>, sums up my feelings on the matter: \u201cEven though most people use firm tofu, I much prefer the soft type. I adore the fresh soybean flavour and cloud-like texture, and I don\u2019t mind if it breaks apart just a little when it cooks\u201d. The function of the tofu here, to my mind at least, is to provide a soft, creamy foil to the strong flavours of the other ingredients, so the softer and creamier you make it, the better \u2013 I like soft, but medium is the firmest I\u2019d go for here.</p> <p>You can firm up the outside a little by parboiling the tofu before stir-frying \u2013 this has the added benefit of warming it up, so reducing the amount of time it has to spend being tossed around in the wok. If you don\u2019t mind it being more of a tofu scramble, however, you can skip this step; <a href=\"http://www.jenniferjoyce.co.uk/about_me.html?LMCL=VwTrvk\" title=\"\">Jennifer Joyce</a> simply pats it dry in her book My Asian Kitchen.</p> <h2>The meat</h2> <p>A bit-part player; there\u2019s a reason mapo tofu can be so successfully adapted to suit a vegan diet (may I point you in the direction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/27/mushroom-mapo-tofu-recipe-meera-sodha\" title=\"\">Meera Sodha\u2019s mushroom version?</a>), because all you really need is something savoury and more solid than the beancurd. That said, meat does bring deliciously flavourful fat to the party, so it\u2019s worth using it if you do eat the stuff \u2013 given the small amount used, this dish is a handy one for anyone looking to cut down their consumption this year. (Joyce is the only one to call for more meat than tofu, which makes her recipe very intense, confirming my suspicions about tofu\u2019s calming role in this dish.)</p> <p>Though beef is the traditional choice, as Dunlop notes in her recently reissued <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-food-of-sichuan-9781408867556.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Food of Sichuan</a>, these days \u201cmany restaurants, even in Chengdu, use pork instead\u201d. This is put down to the fact that pork is apparently the cheaper meat, though the two seem to be much of a muchness here pricewise, making what you go for largely a matter of taste. Much as I love minced pork, here I marginally prefer the earthier richness of the beef fat as it melts into the sauce, but even Quorn would work, albeit with less in the way of flavour.</p> <p>Tan marinates his mince in light soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, salt and sugar, but the dish as a whole is so salty that I don\u2019t think this is necessary \u2013 like the tofu, the meat should provide a welcome contrast, rather than more of the same.</p> <h2>The sauce</h2> <p>The sauce is the most important element of mapo tofu, the essential elements of which which Wei describes in five Chinese characters:</p> <p>\u2013 numbing (from the lip-tingling Sichuan peppercorns)<br>\u2013 spicy (from chillies, both dried, and in the fermented chilli bean paste, which is an essential ingredient of this dish)<br>\u2013 aromatic (in the form of fermented black beans)<br>\u2013 physically hot (this is a dish best served straight away) and<br>\u2013 tender (that lovely, soft tofu).</p> <p>I\u2019d also add \u201cintensely savoury\u201d to the list, because this is the principal characteristic of the fermented broad bean paste, salted black beans and what little there is of the meat.</p> <p>Because of this last point, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to add extra salt in the form of soy sauce, popular though that is in the recipes, or indeed Shaoxing wine. Instead, concentrate on the chilli bean paste, the best of which, Tan and Dunlop agree, comes from Pixian, though you\u2019ll probably have to squint closely at the labels to identify this \u2013 certainly the one I find is much richer and saltier than the milder version made in Hong Kong. The other essential (in theory at least, though L\u00f3pez-Alt and Joyce both leave them out) are fermented black soy beans, or \u201cumami bombs\u201d, as Holliday describes them, which give the dish a slight funkiness that reminds me, oddly perhaps, of roquefort. Rinse and chop them, as the Sichuan Gourmet Association suggests, to distribute the flavour more evenly.</p> <p>The citrussy, numbing and utterly addictive heat of Sichuan pepper really lifts this dish \u2013 make sure you toast it to bring out its flavour before adding it to taste: Dunlop notes that \u201cSichuanese people can take about four times as much pepper as outsiders, in my experience\u201d. Dunlop and the Sichuan Gourmet Association also use ground or flaked Sichuan chilli \u2013 if you can\u2019t find this, use the more widely available roasted chilli flakes in oil, as Tan, Lopez-Alt and Joyce suggest. Holliday explains that one of the characteristics of this dish is \u201ca deep-red oil slick on top \u2026 that\u2019s just the way it is and always has been in Sichuan. And the way it tastes best\u201d. So a little more certainly won\u2019t hurt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/24/how-to-cook-the-perfect-laksa-recipe\">How to cook the perfect laksa \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The fat</h2> <p>That being the case, don\u2019t skimp on the cooking oil \u2013 or, if you do, be aware you\u2019re cheating the dish, just as you would be by cutting the fat from bacon before adding it to a sandwich. Joyce uses sesame oil, but that feels a waste \u2013 you certainly can\u2019t taste it under all those seasonings. A neutral oil of some kind is a better bet, and I love L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s trick of flavouring it with Sichuan pepper.</p> <h2>The veg</h2> <p>Garlic and ginger are popular bases, again, like the Sichuan pepper, giving the dish a more rounded, complex flavour than simply salty heat. Tan also puts in Sichuan preserved vegetables, which provide an interesting texture, but these are preserved in salt, so they make things a little overwhelming, even after a thorough rinse as instructed. Better to stick with spring onions, though you can use baby leeks, if you prefer; both are fair substitutes for the Chinese green garlic, which, Dunlop explains, is rarely seen over here.</p> <h2>Thickening</h2> <p>The sauce should cling to the cubes of tofu, so you get a good helping of both with each mouthful, which means thickening it with cornflour or potato starch as preferred; they\u2019re much of a muchness, to be honest. As soon as the sauce is viscous enough, decant into a serving dish and serve painfully hot with steamed rice and perhaps some plain green veg, to help mop up all that delicious brick-red oil.</p> <h2>Perfect mapo tofu</h2> <p>Prep 10 min<br>Cook 7 min<br>Serves 2</p> <p><strong>250g soft or medium tofu</strong>, cut into roughly 2.5cm chunks<br><strong>1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp neutral oil</strong><br><strong>40g beef or pork mince</strong><br><strong>2 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>1 tbsp grated ginger</strong><br><strong>4 spring onions</strong>, whites and greens separated, both sliced on the diagonal into roughly 2cm lengths<br><strong>1 heaped tbsp Sichuan chilli bean paste </strong>(also called doubanjiang or toban djan)<br><strong>\u00bd tbsp fermented black beans</strong>, drained<strong> </strong><br><strong>1 tsp chilli flakes</strong>, drained if in oil (you can use this on top)<br><strong>85ml water</strong><br><strong>2 tsp cornflour</strong>, mixed to a paste with 1 tbsp cold water</p> <p>Before you start cooking, make sure you have all the ingredients laid out next to the cooker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01bde471d05983947e9a99bf72cb9004e10b860b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01bde471d05983947e9a99bf72cb9004e10b860b/437_0_7762_7760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mapo Tofu 01: Blanch the cubed tofu in salted boiling water, then set aside; and grind half the Sichuan peppercorns.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blanch the cubed tofu in salted boiling water, then set aside; and grind half the Sichuan peppercorns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Mathews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil and gently slip in the tofu.

      "bodyText": "Mapo tofu, more romantically, if less glamorously, known as \u201cpock-marked old woman\u2019s tofu\u201d, is the beancurd equivalent of bacon: the surefire way to convert tofu sceptics to its quiet pleasures. A speciality of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, it brims over with what Fuchsia Dunlop describes as the \u201cspicy generosity\u201d of the region\u2019s cooking, being hot, salty and very moreish. The story goes that the dish is named after the smallpox-ravaged Old Mother Chen, who cooked up a fiery storm near the city\u2019s Bridge of Ten Thousand Blessings in the time of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (1856\u201375). More than a century later, her creation is on menus from Tokyo to Tulsa, known and loved for its aromatic heat and intensely savoury flavours, perfectly balanced by the creamy blandness of the beancurd. Trust me: even if you can\u2019t bear tofu, you\u2019ll love this. The tofu There\u2019s surprisingly little agreement on the main component of the dish. J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt, whose recipe is based on that served by chef Zhang Wenxue at Boston\u2019s Fuloon restaurant, calls expressly for \u201cmedium to firm\u201d silken tofu \u2013 the undrained and unpressed kind. But the \u201cself-taught cook from north-west China\u201d behind the Red House Spice blog, Wei, recommends against using it \u2013 she prefers \u201cmedium-firm\u201d pressed tofu. The Sichuan Gourmet Association uses soft pressed beancurd, as does Tony Tan in his book Hong Kong Food City, while Fuchsia Dunlop simply mentions plain, white beancurd. The difference, as these names suggest, is largely one of texture; the more liquid has been pressed out of the beancurd, the firmer it will be, and thus the easier to fry. Taylor Holliday, who, with her Chinese daughter runs a business importing Sichuan ingredients to the US, sums up my feelings on the matter: \u201cEven though most people use firm tofu, I much prefer the soft type. I adore the fresh soybean flavour and cloud-like texture, and I don\u2019t mind if it breaks apart just a little when it cooks\u201d. The function of the tofu here, to my mind at least, is to provide a soft, creamy foil to the strong flavours of the other ingredients, so the softer and creamier you make it, the better \u2013 I like soft, but medium is the firmest I\u2019d go for here. You can firm up the outside a little by parboiling the tofu before stir-frying \u2013 this has the added benefit of warming it up, so reducing the amount of time it has to spend being tossed around in the wok. If you don\u2019t mind it being more of a tofu scramble, however, you can skip this step; Jennifer Joyce simply pats it dry in her book My Asian Kitchen. The meat A bit-part player; there\u2019s a reason mapo tofu can be so successfully adapted to suit a vegan diet (may I point you in the direction of Meera Sodha\u2019s mushroom version?), because all you really need is something savoury and more solid than the beancurd. That said, meat does bring deliciously flavourful fat to the party, so it\u2019s worth using it if you do eat the stuff \u2013 given the small amount used, this dish is a handy one for anyone looking to cut down their consumption this year. (Joyce is the only one to call for more meat than tofu, which makes her recipe very intense, confirming my suspicions about tofu\u2019s calming role in this dish.) Though beef is the traditional choice, as Dunlop notes in her recently reissued The Food of Sichuan, these days \u201cmany restaurants, even in Chengdu, use pork instead\u201d. This is put down to the fact that pork is apparently the cheaper meat, though the two seem to be much of a muchness here pricewise, making what you go for largely a matter of taste. Much as I love minced pork, here I marginally prefer the earthier richness of the beef fat as it melts into the sauce, but even Quorn would work, albeit with less in the way of flavour. Tan marinates his mince in light soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, salt and sugar, but the dish as a whole is so salty that I don\u2019t think this is necessary \u2013 like the tofu, the meat should provide a welcome contrast, rather than more of the same. The sauce The sauce is the most important element of mapo tofu, the essential elements of which which Wei describes in five Chinese characters: \u2013 numbing (from the lip-tingling Sichuan peppercorns) \u2013 spicy (from chillies, both dried, and in the fermented chilli bean paste, which is an essential ingredient of this dish) \u2013 aromatic (in the form of fermented black beans) \u2013 physically hot (this is a dish best served straight away) and \u2013 tender (that lovely, soft tofu). I\u2019d also add \u201cintensely savoury\u201d to the list, because this is the principal characteristic of the fermented broad bean paste, salted black beans and what little there is of the meat. Because of this last point, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to add extra salt in the form of soy sauce, popular though that is in the recipes, or indeed Shaoxing wine. Instead, concentrate on the chilli bean paste, the best of which, Tan and Dunlop agree, comes from Pixian, though you\u2019ll probably have to squint closely at the labels to identify this \u2013 certainly the one I find is much richer and saltier than the milder version made in Hong Kong. The other essential (in theory at least, though L\u00f3pez-Alt and Joyce both leave them out) are fermented black soy beans, or \u201cumami bombs\u201d, as Holliday describes them, which give the dish a slight funkiness that reminds me, oddly perhaps, of roquefort. Rinse and chop them, as the Sichuan Gourmet Association suggests, to distribute the flavour more evenly. The citrussy, numbing and utterly addictive heat of Sichuan pepper really lifts this dish \u2013 make sure you toast it to bring out its flavour before adding it to taste: Dunlop notes that \u201cSichuanese people can take about four times as much pepper as outsiders, in my experience\u201d. Dunlop and the Sichuan Gourmet Association also use ground or flaked Sichuan chilli \u2013 if you can\u2019t find this, use the more widely available roasted chilli flakes in oil, as Tan, Lopez-Alt and Joyce suggest. Holliday explains that one of the characteristics of this dish is \u201ca deep-red oil slick on top \u2026 that\u2019s just the way it is and always has been in Sichuan. And the way it tastes best\u201d. So a little more certainly won\u2019t hurt. The fat That being the case, don\u2019t skimp on the cooking oil \u2013 or, if you do, be aware you\u2019re cheating the dish, just as you would be by cutting the fat from bacon before adding it to a sandwich. Joyce uses sesame oil, but that feels a waste \u2013 you certainly can\u2019t taste it under all those seasonings. A neutral oil of some kind is a better bet, and I love L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s trick of flavouring it with Sichuan pepper. The veg Garlic and ginger are popular bases, again, like the Sichuan pepper, giving the dish a more rounded, complex flavour than simply salty heat. Tan also puts in Sichuan preserved vegetables, which provide an interesting texture, but these are preserved in salt, so they make things a little overwhelming, even after a thorough rinse as instructed. Better to stick with spring onions, though you can use baby leeks, if you prefer; both are fair substitutes for the Chinese green garlic, which, Dunlop explains, is rarely seen over here. Thickening The sauce should cling to the cubes of tofu, so you get a good helping of both with each mouthful, which means thickening it with cornflour or potato starch as preferred; they\u2019re much of a muchness, to be honest. As soon as the sauce is viscous enough, decant into a serving dish and serve painfully hot with steamed rice and perhaps some plain green veg, to help mop up all that delicious brick-red oil. Perfect mapo tofu Prep 10 min Cook 7 min Serves 2 250g soft or medium tofu, cut into roughly 2.5cm chunks 1 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns 2 tbsp neutral oil 40g beef or pork mince 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 tbsp grated ginger 4 spring onions, whites and greens separated, both sliced on the diagonal into roughly 2cm lengths 1 heaped tbsp Sichuan chilli bean paste (also called doubanjiang or toban djan) \u00bd tbsp fermented black beans, drained 1 tsp chilli flakes, drained if in oil (you can use this on top) 85ml water 2 tsp cornflour, mixed to a paste with 1 tbsp cold water Before you start cooking, make sure you have all the ingredients laid out next to the cooker. Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil and gently slip in the tofu. Simmer for a minute, then turn off the heat. Meanwhile, toast half the peppercorns in a dry pan until aromatic, then grind to a powder. Put a wok on a medium high heat, then add the oil and, once it starts to smoke, the remaining whole peppercorns. Fry until aromatic, then scoop out and discard. Add the meat and fry until brown and crisp, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Turn down the heat slightly, then fry the garlic, ginger and spring onion whites for a minute or so, being careful they don\u2019t burn. Stir in the bean paste, fermented black beans and chilli, fry for 20 seconds, then pour in 85ml cold water. Bring to a simmer, then carefully drain the tofu and add to the wok with the meat. Spoon the sauce over the tofu and meat, disturbing it as little as possible. Stir in the cornflour mixture, cook until the sauce thickens, then gently decant into a serving bowl. Sprinkle with the ground pepper and spring onion greens, and serve with plain rice and perhaps some greens. \u2022 Is mapo tofu the dish that turned you on to tofu, and if not, what\u2019s your secret weapon to convert sceptics? And if you prefer yours meatless, what do you use instead?",

You can\u2019t set foot outside the house without encountering other people, which inevitably prompts consideration of their lives in comparison to yours.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/20/orwell-wigan-pier-75-years\">The Road to Wigan Pier</a> by George Orwell clarifies the process by dividing it into two distinct parts \u2013 observation and reflection. To begin with, he describes the poverty and hardship he witnessed during a two-month spell in Yorkshire and Lancashire in 1936. Then he considers his favoured solution \u2013 socialism \u2013 and the obstacles to its widespread adoption. Some of it has come to seem petulant and outdated, as with his swipe at \u201cthe dreary tribe of high-minded women and sandal-wearers and bearded fruit-juice drinkers\u201d, but there are also insights that remain relevant: \u201cEven the fascist bully at his symbolic worst \u2026 does not necessarily feel himself a bully; more probably he feels like Roland in the pass at Roncevaux, defending Christendom against the barbarian,\u2019 he writes.</p> <p>Yet today\u2019s greatest political challenge \u2013 confronting the climate crisis \u2013 transcends the kind of nationalist squabble that Orwell understood so well. In my book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-great-flood-9781447298199.html\">The Great Flood: Travels Through a Flooded Landscape</a>, I travelled around the country, visiting places that had flooded, and meeting the people affected. I wanted to try and understand the emotional and psychological effects of being flooded, because flooding is the way that climatic upheaval is making itself felt in Britain.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t write about policy or engage in scientific debates about climate change: I explored people\u2019s response to this experience and their attempts to hold authority to account. What could be more political than that? Here are 10 other political travelogues \u2013 defined in equally broad terms - that I love.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d2e12d9ceb5e1d3a2f5b3f84374c9a57cb4b153c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2e12d9ceb5e1d3a2f5b3f84374c9a57cb4b153c/0_0_4451_6890/646.jpg\" alt=\"Beryl Bainbridge flying into Albert Dock in Liverpool in 1990.\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beryl Bainbridge flying into Albert Dock in Liverpool in 1990.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/beryl-bainbridge-2/english-journey-or-the-road-to-milton-keynes/\">English Journey, or The Road to Milton Keynes by Beryl Bainbridge</a><br></strong>JB Priestley\u2019s English Journey, which he described as \u201ca rambling but truthful account of what one man saw and heard and thought and felt during a journey through England in the autumn of 1933\u201d, was the first Great Depression-era travelogue, preceding Orwell\u2019s. Fifty years later, in the depths of another recession, Bainbridge set out in Priestley\u2019s footsteps. The fact that she was accompanied by a film crew of six men and one woman does not detract from her distinctive voice, which is funny and self-deprecating. Her visit to her home town of Liverpool - more memoir than reportage - is particularly moving. (\u201cThe blackened city sails in an ocean of white cloud, perpetually racing before the wind.\u201d)</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Fiennes\">The Illustrated Journeys of Celia Fiennes, 1685\u2013c.1712 (ed Christopher Morris, 1995)</a><br></strong>Think of a place in Britain you know and love, and there is a fair chance Celia Fiennes will have been there 300 years before you. For a woman to travel around the country, on horseback, in the late 17th and early 18th century, was revolutionary in itself. Writing it up made it even more so. Her account of these journeys \u2013 first published as <a href=\"http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/fiennes/saddle/saddle.html\">Through England on a Side Saddle</a> \u2013 is one of the founding works of British travel writing. There are stately homes, but there are also towns and cities, and acerbic verdicts on places she didn\u2019t like. Ely, for instance, is \u201ca harbour to breed and nest vermin\u201d.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://somewhereboy.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/grand-tour-27-united-kingdom-the-people-of-providence-tony-parker/\">The People of Providence: A Housing Estate and Some of Its Inhabitants by Tony Parker</a><br></strong>An inspiration when I was writing my first book, about the inhabitants of Western Avenue, the road that leads west out of London: I did not have the skill or the self-effacing discipline that Parker uses to present the stories of the inhabitants of an unidentified south London estate in their words alone, but I drew constant reassurance from the proof that there were undiscovered worlds close at hand.</p> <p><strong>4.<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/naples-44-9780907871729.html\"> Naples \u201944 by Norman Lewis</a><br></strong>Travel of a different kind \u2013 in the vanguard of an occupying army. Lewis, who was one of the great travel writers of the 20th century, arrived in southern Italy during the Allied invasion of September 1943, as an intelligence officer attached to the US Fifth Army. To begin with, his brilliantly observed diary entries deal with the chaos and brutality of the war, but at the beginning of October, he arrives in Naples, and despite the terrible privations of life in a war-ravaged city, finds himself enchanted by the city and its inhabitants.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jaguar_Smile\">The Jaguar Smile by Salman Rushdie</a><br></strong>Rushdie visited Nicaragua during July 1986, when the Sandinista government was battling to survive in the face of hostility from the US and the US-sponsored Contra rebels. Since he was a patron of the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign in London, he was not \u201ca wholly neutral observer\u201d. He was dismayed by the censorship in force, but \u201c<em>el escritor hind\u00fa\u201d</em>, as he was called, could not bring himself to condemn a government led by a poet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-ortega\">Daniel Ortega</a>. Rushdie\u2019s \u201cpostcards\u201d from Nicaragua, as he calls this record of his trip, were once an insight into a venture that failed. But since Ortega won power again in 2011 and 2016, their historical significance has changed again.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/sleeping-on-a-wire-9780099552284.html\">Sleeping on a Wire: Conversations With Palestinians in Israel by David Grossman</a><br></strong>True to its title, the brilliant Israeli writer relays long conversations with Palestinians in Israel, his not-quite-compatriots, interspersed with agonised reflections on the compromised nature of every encounter. These meetings add up to a kind of foreign travel in his own land. \u201cDo I actually understand the nature of Jewish-Arab coexistence?\u201d he writes: \u201c\u2018And what does it demand of me, as a Jew in Israel? How much room am I really willing to make for \u2018them\u2019 in the Jewish state?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff824889fd1ceae8b558a91c5df7954a68a522e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff824889fd1ceae8b558a91c5df7954a68a522e9/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raja Shehadeh, reading to visiting journalists from his work in the terraced hills outside Ramallah in the West Bank in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Unwanted\u2019 \u2026 Raja Shehadeh, reading to visiting journalists from his work, in the terraced hills outside Ramallah in the West Bank in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/raja-shehadeh-ramallah-palestine-israel-occupation-struggle-failure-to-liberate\">Palestinian Walks: Notes on a Vanishing Landscape by Raja Shehadeh</a><br></strong>The essential counterpoint to Grossman \u2013 a reminder that Grossman, for one, would not need, that some people are denied the luxury of going anywhere at all. Raja Shehadeh, a lawyer and writer from Ramallah, describes the ever-tightening Israeli grip on the West Bank through an account of six walks conducted between 1978 and 2006. At the beginning of the book, he describes the Palestinians\u2019 traditional habit of setting off on a kind of aimless ramble, called a <em>sarha</em>, that might last for days or weeks, but by the time of his sixth and final walk in 2006, he says they are moving through their own country \u201csurreptitiously, like unwanted strangers, constantly harassed, never feeling safe\u201d.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wanderlust-9781783780396.html\">Wanderlust: A History of Walking by Rebecca Solnit</a><br></strong>Walking is always a political act, Solnit says, for \u201cthe history of both urban and rural walking is a history of freedom\u201d. It is also \u201can unwritten, secret\u201d history that \u201ctrespasses through everybody else\u2019s field \u2013 through anatomy, anthropology, architecture, gardening, geography, political and cultural history, literature, sexuality, religious studies\u201d. Few other writers could navigate a path through such a maze. Solnit\u2019s reading is so wide-ranging that she lays down a secondary trail across the bottom of the page, an unfurling tickertape of other writers\u2019 thoughts.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/05/private-island-why-britain-now-belongs-to-someone-else-james-meek-review\">Private Island: Why Britain Now Belongs to Someone Else by James Meek</a><br></strong>Meek shows how the widespread privatisations of the last 30 years achieved exactly the opposite of what they set out to do: instead of passing control of essential public services such as water and power to small investors, and creating nimble, fast-moving operations for a competitive market, they handed them over to foreign, state-owned companies or oligarchic investors. The latter now milk their captive markets for profit. The consequences are dramatised through Meek\u2019s encounters with the people affected and vivid descriptions of the places he visits.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/27/top-10-eyewitness-20th-century-history-charles-emmerson-crucible\">Top 10 eyewitness accounts of 20th-century history | Charles Emmerson</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/owen-hatherley-ruins-great-britain\">A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain by Owen Hatherley</a><br></strong>Another book that emulates Priestley\u2019s English Journey, though it takes in Wales and Scotland as well.

      "bodyText": "All travel is political. You can\u2019t set foot outside the house without encountering other people, which inevitably prompts consideration of their lives in comparison to yours. The Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell clarifies the process by dividing it into two distinct parts \u2013 observation and reflection. To begin with, he describes the poverty and hardship he witnessed during a two-month spell in Yorkshire and Lancashire in 1936. Then he considers his favoured solution \u2013 socialism \u2013 and the obstacles to its widespread adoption. Some of it has come to seem petulant and outdated, as with his swipe at \u201cthe dreary tribe of high-minded women and sandal-wearers and bearded fruit-juice drinkers\u201d, but there are also insights that remain relevant: \u201cEven the fascist bully at his symbolic worst \u2026 does not necessarily feel himself a bully; more probably he feels like Roland in the pass at Roncevaux, defending Christendom against the barbarian,\u2019 he writes. Yet today\u2019s greatest political challenge \u2013 confronting the climate crisis \u2013 transcends the kind of nationalist squabble that Orwell understood so well. In my book, The Great Flood: Travels Through a Flooded Landscape, I travelled around the country, visiting places that had flooded, and meeting the people affected. I wanted to try and understand the emotional and psychological effects of being flooded, because flooding is the way that climatic upheaval is making itself felt in Britain. I didn\u2019t write about policy or engage in scientific debates about climate change: I explored people\u2019s response to this experience and their attempts to hold authority to account. What could be more political than that? Here are 10 other political travelogues \u2013 defined in equally broad terms - that I love. 1. English Journey, or The Road to Milton Keynes by Beryl Bainbridge JB Priestley\u2019s English Journey, which he described as \u201ca rambling but truthful account of what one man saw and heard and thought and felt during a journey through England in the autumn of 1933\u201d, was the first Great Depression-era travelogue, preceding Orwell\u2019s. Fifty years later, in the depths of another recession, Bainbridge set out in Priestley\u2019s footsteps. The fact that she was accompanied by a film crew of six men and one woman does not detract from her distinctive voice, which is funny and self-deprecating. Her visit to her home town of Liverpool - more memoir than reportage - is particularly moving. (\u201cThe blackened city sails in an ocean of white cloud, perpetually racing before the wind.\u201d) 2. The Illustrated Journeys of Celia Fiennes, 1685\u2013c.1712 (ed Christopher Morris, 1995) Think of a place in Britain you know and love, and there is a fair chance Celia Fiennes will have been there 300 years before you. For a woman to travel around the country, on horseback, in the late 17th and early 18th century, was revolutionary in itself. Writing it up made it even more so. Her account of these journeys \u2013 first published as Through England on a Side Saddle \u2013 is one of the founding works of British travel writing. There are stately homes, but there are also towns and cities, and acerbic verdicts on places she didn\u2019t like. Ely, for instance, is \u201ca harbour to breed and nest vermin\u201d. 3. The People of Providence: A Housing Estate and Some of Its Inhabitants by Tony Parker An inspiration when I was writing my first book, about the inhabitants of Western Avenue, the road that leads west out of London: I did not have the skill or the self-effacing discipline that Parker uses to present the stories of the inhabitants of an unidentified south London estate in their words alone, but I drew constant reassurance from the proof that there were undiscovered worlds close at hand. 4. Naples \u201944 by Norman Lewis Travel of a different kind \u2013 in the vanguard of an occupying army. Lewis, who was one of the great travel writers of the 20th century, arrived in southern Italy during the Allied invasion of September 1943, as an intelligence officer attached to the US Fifth Army. To begin with, his brilliantly observed diary entries deal with the chaos and brutality of the war, but at the beginning of October, he arrives in Naples, and despite the terrible privations of life in a war-ravaged city, finds himself enchanted by the city and its inhabitants. 5. The Jaguar Smile by Salman Rushdie Rushdie visited Nicaragua during July 1986, when the Sandinista government was battling to survive in the face of hostility from the US and the US-sponsored Contra rebels. Since he was a patron of the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign in London, he was not \u201ca wholly neutral observer\u201d. He was dismayed by the censorship in force, but \u201cel escritor hind\u00fa\u201d, as he was called, could not bring himself to condemn a government led by a poet, Daniel Ortega. Rushdie\u2019s \u201cpostcards\u201d from Nicaragua, as he calls this record of his trip, were once an insight into a venture that failed. But since Ortega won power again in 2011 and 2016, their historical significance has changed again. 6. Sleeping on a Wire: Conversations With Palestinians in Israel by David Grossman True to its title, the brilliant Israeli writer relays long conversations with Palestinians in Israel, his not-quite-compatriots, interspersed with agonised reflections on the compromised nature of every encounter. These meetings add up to a kind of foreign travel in his own land. \u201cDo I actually understand the nature of Jewish-Arab coexistence?\u201d he writes: \u201c\u2018And what does it demand of me, as a Jew in Israel? How much room am I really willing to make for \u2018them\u2019 in the Jewish state?\u201d 7. Palestinian Walks: Notes on a Vanishing Landscape by Raja Shehadeh The essential counterpoint to Grossman \u2013 a reminder that Grossman, for one, would not need, that some people are denied the luxury of going anywhere at all. Raja Shehadeh, a lawyer and writer from Ramallah, describes the ever-tightening Israeli grip on the West Bank through an account of six walks conducted between 1978 and 2006. At the beginning of the book, he describes the Palestinians\u2019 traditional habit of setting off on a kind of aimless ramble, called a sarha, that might last for days or weeks, but by the time of his sixth and final walk in 2006, he says they are moving through their own country \u201csurreptitiously, like unwanted strangers, constantly harassed, never feeling safe\u201d. 8. Wanderlust: A History of Walking by Rebecca Solnit Walking is always a political act, Solnit says, for \u201cthe history of both urban and rural walking is a history of freedom\u201d. It is also \u201can unwritten, secret\u201d history that \u201ctrespasses through everybody else\u2019s field \u2013 through anatomy, anthropology, architecture, gardening, geography, political and cultural history, literature, sexuality, religious studies\u201d. Few other writers could navigate a path through such a maze. Solnit\u2019s reading is so wide-ranging that she lays down a secondary trail across the bottom of the page, an unfurling tickertape of other writers\u2019 thoughts. 9. Private Island: Why Britain Now Belongs to Someone Else by James Meek Meek shows how the widespread privatisations of the last 30 years achieved exactly the opposite of what they set out to do: instead of passing control of essential public services such as water and power to small investors, and creating nimble, fast-moving operations for a competitive market, they handed them over to foreign, state-owned companies or oligarchic investors. The latter now milk their captive markets for profit. The consequences are dramatised through Meek\u2019s encounters with the people affected and vivid descriptions of the places he visits. 10. A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain by Owen Hatherley Another book that emulates Priestley\u2019s English Journey, though it takes in Wales and Scotland as well. Hatherley, who is an architecture critic, set out in 2010 to survey the school of buildings bankrolled by the PFI (Private Finance Initiative) that he calls \u201cpseudo-modernism\u201d. Yet his disdain for the \u201curban renaissance\u201d of the Blair and Brown years is offset by his \u201cconstant surprise and fascination at just how strange, individual and architecturally diverse British cities actually are\u201d. \u2022 The Great Flood by Edward Platt is published by Picador.

      "bodyText": "The Sahel is facing an unprecedented wave of violence, with more than 4,000 deaths reported last year, and a bloody start to 2020. The number of attacks have increased fivefold in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger since 2016, United Nations figures have revealed. Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the UN\u2019s envoy for the fragile region on the southern rim of the Sahara, said it had experienced \u201ca devastating surge in terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets\u201d. In Burkina Faso, the number of deaths rose from about 80 in 2016 to more than 1,800 in 2019. On Tuesday, authorities in Ouagadougou, the capital, said dozens of civilians had been killed in the latest attack by suspected Islamic militants on a village market in the northern province of Sanmatenga. Chambas told the UN security council earlier this month that the \u201cdevastating surge in terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets\u201d would have alarming humanitarian consequences in the region and was set to spread. \u201cMost significantly, the geographic focus of terrorist attacks has shifted eastwards from Mali to Burkina Faso and is increasingly threatening west African coastal states,\u201d he said earlier this month. European officials are worried the Sahel is close to a tipping point that could see an irreversible slide into violent chaos that will strengthen extremist groups and send a new wave of migrants to Europe. Extremist violence in the Sahel surged after a coalition of Islamists and local separatist tribesmen took control over much of northern Mali in 2012. A seven-year campaign led by French troops, the deployment of hundreds of US special forces, massive aid for local militaries and a billion dollar-a-year United Nations peacekeeping operation have been unable to decisively weaken the multiple overlapping insurgencies in the region and security has continued to deteriorate. Many of the bloodiest recent attacks have been attributed to an Isis affiliate, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). In November, two attacks claimed by the ISGS on military bases in Mali, at Tabankort and Indelimane, claimed the lives of 92 soldiers. In December, the group claimed responsibility for the killing of 42 people \u2013 35 of them civilian \u2013 in Arbinda in Burkina Faso. More than 170 soldiers have died in two recent ISGS attacks in Niger. European security officials believe the claims of responsibility by the ISGS are credible, though the group frequently exaggerates its capabilities. It is not clear who was responsible for this week\u2019s attack in Burkina Faso, though Islamic militants are active in the area. Chambas said attacks were often \u201cdeliberate efforts by violent extremists to capture weapons and trafficking routes\u201d. The ISGS has adopted tactics pioneered by the al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab, which has been fighting foreign and national forces in Somalia for more than a decade. Attacks are launched by dozens of jihadists arriving on motorbikes who overrun often scant defences after cutting off the camp\u2019s communications and pounding the site with mortars. They then kill as many soldiers as possible and then disappear before the army can fully respond. \u201cThe latest attacks seem to show that the group has acquired skills in command, control and coordination that it didn\u2019t have before, with group leaders able to carry out major operations,\u201d a French military source told Reuters news agency. The group\u2019s rapid expansion in the Sahel will not compensate strategically for the loss of its heartland in Iraq and Syria, nor the death in October of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but will boost morale among its beleaguered fighters and help attract new recruits. It will also underline the continuing primacy of Islamic State in its long-running rivalry with al-Qaida, the older group from which it split six years ago. Analysts say the ISGS, like other jihadist groups in the Sahel, uses \u201cad hoc\u201d fighters to beef up its ranks, with up to 70% of the force launched against military bases hired just for the operation from local communities. Many are poachers, criminals or traffickers who are paid with cash, weapons or ammunition. The hard core of ISGS is probably no more than 200- or 300-strong, specialists say. French forces total 4,500 and there are more than 13,000 UN peacekeepers. Chambas said terrorism, organised crime and intercommunal violence were often intertwined, especially in peripheral areas where a state\u2019s presence was weak where \u201cextremists provide safety and protection to populations, as well as social services in exchanged for loyalty\u201d. The rise in violence comes amid reports that the US is likely to reduce its military presence in the Sahel, as it refocuses on great power rivals as a more significant threat than terrorism. The US currently has thousands of troops in the region and recently opened a major $100m air base in Niger. The prospect of many of its forces withdrawing from the region has dismayed many actors. A small detachment of British troops is due to deploy later this year to Mali as part of the UN peacekeeping force there.",

Running from Glasgow north to Mallaig, with a branch line off to Oban, the line passes hills and mountains before hauling itself up onto Rannoch Moor, a slice of wilderness that brings a sense of awe. The remote station at Corrour \u2013 familiar to fans of the Trainspotting films \u2013 is the highest in Britain (408m), while beyond lies Glenfinnan Viaduct and the craggy coastline, with its views out to the Small Isles.</p> <h2>Rome to Palermo, Italy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3011376b3bf017d00db4f67361ee492f9321bb02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3011376b3bf017d00db4f67361ee492f9321bb02/0_0_1295_865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coastal near Salerno, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coastal near Salerno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Wilson/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not every rail journey that involves a bonus sea voyage.

The trip takes a little under 12 hours in total, passing down the Tyrrhenian Sea coastline. Highlights en route include Mount Vesuvius, the Bay of Naples and the countryside of Calabria, Italy\u2019s toe.

Happily, this is a route that gives the lie to the notion that beautiful scenery is wasted on sleeper trains. Go in summer when the night barely gets dark and you can watch the hypnotic passing of forests and lakes from the comfort of a snug berth. Travel in winter and you may see the night sky illuminated by the northern lights. The train takes nearly 19 hours to cover the 1,000km journey up eastern Sweden, crossing the Arctic Circle into Lapland, squeezing between mountains and Lake Tornetr\u00e4sk before finally heading into Norway.</p> <h2>Glacier Express, Switzerland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8342805e44dd44d375bf34218e6a7b7222242a0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8342805e44dd44d375bf34218e6a7b7222242a0f/0_270_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from the Glacier Express to snow-covered Alps, Switzerland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Swiss have produced some of the most gloriously picture-perfect railway lines on the planet, their trains gliding along Alpine valleys or climbing doggedly up unfeasibly steep inclines to mountain fastnesses.

An extraordinary feat of engineering that involves 291 bridges and 91 tunnels, the railway is a Unesco world heritage site. It would be a shame to pass through such scenery quickly, so this \u201cexpress\u201d service takes nearly eight hours to travel less than 300km, allowing passengers plenty of time to gaze out of the panoramic windows at the majestic surroundings.</p> <h2>Mainz to Koblenz, Germany</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61b645653a472c28cc40d4066aebc552cb3a85a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61b645653a472c28cc40d4066aebc552cb3a85a9/0_416_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A train passes Bacharach on the Mittelrheinbahn service, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A train passes Bacharach on the Mittelrheinbahn service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Grady/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A must for fans of German wine and fairytale castles. This route along the Rhine cruises past the seemingly limitless vineyards that rise up along the steep banks of the river. Thrusting between mountains, it passes many of the flamboyant castles that inspired Disney and takes in the famous cliff at St Goarshausen, where Loreley\u2019s siren song once brought sailors to grief. Although the fastest express trains complete the journey in 50 minutes, the more relaxing <a href=\"https://www.mittelrheinbahn.de/de/strecken/linien-fahrplaene/linie/rb-26\" title=\"\">Mittelrheinbahn RB26</a> stopper services between Mainz and Cologne take nearly an hour and a half to chug along the Rhine\u2019s left bank \u2013 time enough to admire the fetching old-world towns and villages as you sip a glass of riesling, or a floral Gew\u00fcrztraminer.</p> <h2>Nice to Digne-les-Bains, France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ec5c686d4f6762312e276b1a64e5c8778a0563c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ec5c686d4f6762312e276b1a64e5c8778a0563c/0_333_4999_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama of Nice railway station, sunny day, blue sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nice railway station.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vladimir Drozdin Photography/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A hundred years ago there were four metre-gauge railway lines that made up the Train des Pignes (Pine Cones Train) in southern France.

This is not a train in a hurry. Aside from the regular stations en route, there are dozens of tiny \u201chalts\u201d at which passengers may alight or board. Wending its way slowly upwards beside the River Var, the train visits medieval towns and compact villages before its arrival, over three hours later, in Digne on the edge of the Alpine foothills.</p> <h2>Bar to Belgrade, Montenegro-Serbia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef075559f521c0964cc281db4daa3e017eb9572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ef075559f521c0964cc281db4daa3e017eb9572/0_290_4029_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Belgrade Bar railway\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The fact that the Montenegro Express has to travel through 254 tunnels and over 435 bridges to climb from the seaport of Bar to the Serbian capital gives an indication of the spectacular scenery through which it passes. A relatively modern line \u2013 it opened in 1976 \u2013 it pulls away from the Adriatic, runs by Lake Skadar, southern Europe\u2019s largest lake, and into the mountainous <a href=\"https://www.visit-montenegro.com/destinations/kolasin/attractions/biogradska-gora/\" title=\"\">Biogradska Gora national park</a>. Clipping a corner of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the train negotiates its way through Serbian hills before finally arriving at Belgrade\u2019s Top\u010dider station, 12 hours and 475km later.

The pastel-coloured villages have been nestled in the cliffs for a thousand years or so, and along with their olive groves and vineyards make up an exquisite scene. For the full experience, take the regional train rather than the express: this stops at all five Cinque Terre villages \u2013 Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore \u2013 allowing passengers to hop off, hike between villages, and hop back on a train again.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

However, for passengers who alight at remote and tiny Myrdal an even greater pleasure awaits. The branch line from here down to Fl\u00e5m is one of the world\u2019s steepest railway lines, dropping 867m in just 20km, and was created in 1940 to serve villages along Sognefjord. Along the way, it provides vistas of the fjord, along with mountains, the picturesque Lake Reinungavatnet and myriad waterfalls, including the mighty 93m Kjosfossen. West Highland Line, Scotland Although the Cambrian Coast Line in Wales and the Highlands\u2019 Kyle of Lochalsh Line both make compelling claims to be Britain\u2019s most scenic railway, there\u2019s really no competing with the West Highland Line for the variety and splendour of the landscapes it passes through. Running from Glasgow north to Mallaig, with a branch line off to Oban, the line passes hills and mountains before hauling itself up onto Rannoch Moor, a slice of wilderness that brings a sense of awe. The remote station at Corrour \u2013 familiar to fans of the Trainspotting films \u2013 is the highest in Britain (408m), while beyond lies Glenfinnan Viaduct and the craggy coastline, with its views out to the Small Isles. Rome to Palermo, Italy It\u2019s not every rail journey that involves a bonus sea voyage. Board the direct service from Rome to the Sicilian capital, though, and you\u2019ll find your train shunted onto a ferry to be carried across the Strait of Messina. The trip takes a little under 12 hours in total, passing down the Tyrrhenian Sea coastline. Highlights en route include Mount Vesuvius, the Bay of Naples and the countryside of Calabria, Italy\u2019s toe. After a short passage across the waves, the train offers views of the north coast of Sicily as it heads westward to Palermo. \u2022 seat61.com Mariazellerbahn, Austria Clocking in at an impressive 78km, the Mariazell railway is the longest narrow-gauge line in Austria and has been running since 1907. It starts its journey a little to the west of Vienna, at St P\u00f6lten, one of Austria\u2019s oldest cities. After gliding along the scenic Pielach valley the train pushes up into the mountains, heading for the \u00d6tscher-Torm\u00e4uer Nature Park and Gemeindealpe Mitterbach ski resort, its passage smoothed by 19 viaducts and 21 tunnels, before arriving at Mariazell, a place of pilgrimage for more than 800 years. A steam locomotive takes over pulling duties on selected dates from May to October, while at the weekends and during Advent, first-class panorama carriages offer an even better view of the scenery. Stockholm to Narvik, Sweden-Norway If you want to travel direct from the Swedish capital to Narvik, one of Europe\u2019s most northerly railway stations, your only option is the Norrlandst\u00e5get sleeper. Happily, this is a route that gives the lie to the notion that beautiful scenery is wasted on sleeper trains. Go in summer when the night barely gets dark and you can watch the hypnotic passing of forests and lakes from the comfort of a snug berth. Travel in winter and you may see the night sky illuminated by the northern lights. The train takes nearly 19 hours to cover the 1,000km journey up eastern Sweden, crossing the Arctic Circle into Lapland, squeezing between mountains and Lake Tornetr\u00e4sk before finally heading into Norway. Glacier Express, Switzerland The Swiss have produced some of the most gloriously picture-perfect railway lines on the planet, their trains gliding along Alpine valleys or climbing doggedly up unfeasibly steep inclines to mountain fastnesses. The Glacier Express between St Moritz and Zermatt is perhaps the cream of the crop, cutting through the Alps on its journey from the Matterhorn to Piz Bernina mountains. An extraordinary feat of engineering that involves 291 bridges and 91 tunnels, the railway is a Unesco world heritage site. It would be a shame to pass through such scenery quickly, so this \u201cexpress\u201d service takes nearly eight hours to travel less than 300km, allowing passengers plenty of time to gaze out of the panoramic windows at the majestic surroundings. Mainz to Koblenz, Germany A must for fans of German wine and fairytale castles. This route along the Rhine cruises past the seemingly limitless vineyards that rise up along the steep banks of the river. Thrusting between mountains, it passes many of the flamboyant castles that inspired Disney and takes in the famous cliff at St Goarshausen, where Loreley\u2019s siren song once brought sailors to grief. Although the fastest express trains complete the journey in 50 minutes, the more relaxing Mittelrheinbahn RB26 stopper services between Mainz and Cologne take nearly an hour and a half to chug along the Rhine\u2019s left bank \u2013 time enough to admire the fetching old-world towns and villages as you sip a glass of riesling, or a floral Gew\u00fcrztraminer. Nice to Digne-les-Bains, France A hundred years ago there were four metre-gauge railway lines that made up the Train des Pignes (Pine Cones Train) in southern France. Now the only survivor is this 150km route from Nice, on the Mediterranean coast, up to the spa town of Digne-les-Bains, the capital of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department. This is not a train in a hurry. Aside from the regular stations en route, there are dozens of tiny \u201chalts\u201d at which passengers may alight or board. Wending its way slowly upwards beside the River Var, the train visits medieval towns and compact villages before its arrival, over three hours later, in Digne on the edge of the Alpine foothills. Bar to Belgrade, Montenegro-Serbia The fact that the Montenegro Express has to travel through 254 tunnels and over 435 bridges to climb from the seaport of Bar to the Serbian capital gives an indication of the spectacular scenery through which it passes. A relatively modern line \u2013 it opened in 1976 \u2013 it pulls away from the Adriatic, runs by Lake Skadar, southern Europe\u2019s largest lake, and into the mountainous Biogradska Gora national park. Clipping a corner of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the train negotiates its way through Serbian hills before finally arriving at Belgrade\u2019s Top\u010dider station, 12 hours and 475km later. Look left just beforehand and you\u2019ll get a glimpse of Marshal Tito\u2019s deluxe private train. \u2022 seat61.com Levanto to La Spezia, Italy The journey along the Italian riviera from Levanto to La Spezia may only take 35 minutes, but it includes the most sublime stretch of the Ligurian coast \u2013 the popular Cinque Terre (Five Lands). The pastel-coloured villages have been nestled in the cliffs for a thousand years or so, and along with their olive groves and vineyards make up an exquisite scene. For the full experience, take the regional train rather than the express: this stops at all five Cinque Terre villages \u2013 Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore \u2013 allowing passengers to hop off, hike between villages, and hop back on a train again.

Ultimately, it will do Saracens the power of good to bid farewell to the moral high ground, even though they never really knew it in the first place. Realism is far preferable to moralism. Indeed, for my tastes, one of the best things about Premier League football is its hugely well-established moral vacuum. We don\u2019t have to pretend that we\u2019re being bettered in some way when we watch it, or take lessons from it, or go on some corporate away-day style journey of discovery using the mindset we\u2019ve learned from it. We have mostly long discovered that those are fool\u2019s errands, and that the people who run the sport are radioactive shits, so we don\u2019t have to indulge the nonsense. We don\u2019t have to get its cheerleaders in to lecture the NHS, as happened with British cycling, or commercially monetise its \u201cway\u201d as Saracens did. We can simply WATCH FOOTBALL \u2013 mad, I know \u2013 and shriek with laughter at anything else it tries to serve up to us. It\u2019s not such a bad way to be, and I strongly urge rugby to try it.",

      "body": "<p>Deborah Dugan, the chief executive and president of the Recording Academy, which organises the Grammy awards, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/17/grammys-chief-deborah-dugan-suspended-misconduct-allegation\">suspended last week after a misconduct allegation</a>, has countered with her own 44-page legal complaint five days before 2020\u2019s awards ceremony. In it, she alleges sexual harassment and voting corruption in the company. Her most serious claim is the academy was aware of allegations that her predecessor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up\">Neil Portnow</a>, who was chief executive from 2002 to 2019, raped an unnamed female recording artist.</p> <p>The filing written by her legal team reads that after she was hired, \u201cMs Dugan was hauled into a conference room and told \u2013 for the very first time \u2013 that a foreign recording artist (and member of the academy) had accused Mr Portnow of raping her following a performance that she gave at Carnegie Hall. The news was presented to Ms Dugan as though the board had just learned of the allegation. In reality, they were well aware of the allegation at the time Ms Dugan agreed to take on the CEO position, but never told her.\u201d The allegation of assault was, she was told, \u201cthe real reason his contract was not renewed\u201d in 2019. She claims she was nonetheless pressured by the then chairman John Poppo to rehire Portnow as a consultant with a $750,000 salary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b6507eed5ccd9d7273247619ce49b99a7a003b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b6507eed5ccd9d7273247619ce49b99a7a003b0/0_0_3196_2131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Recording Academy chief executive Neil Portnow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Recording Academy chief executive Neil Portnow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time, Portnow did not give reasons for stepping down as chief executive, and only said that he wanted to create a smooth transition for his successor. The end of his tenure had been heavily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/04/grammy-most-patronising-comment-neil-portnow\">marred by comments he made in 2018</a>, in the wake of very few female winners at that year\u2019s Grammys, that female creatives needed to \u201cstep up\u201d if they were to succeed.</p> <p>The academy released a statement dismissing Dugan\u2019s accusations. It reads in part: \u201cIt is curious that Ms Dugan never raised these grave allegations until a week after legal claims were made against her personally by a female employee.\u201d Portnow later denied Dugan\u2019s claims, calling them \u201cludicrous and untrue\u201d.</p> <p>Dugan was placed on administrative leave last week, following the allegation of misconduct. A memo from the interim chief executive to academy members earlier this week gave further details, saying Dugan fostered a \u201ctoxic and intolerable\u201d work environment and was \u201cabusive and bullying\u201d. Academy board member <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/arts/music/grammys-deborah-dugan-harassment.html\">Christine Albert told the New York Times</a> that Dugan\u2019s leadership style had clashed with the academy, saying: \u201cWhat we expected was change without chaos.\u201d</p> <p>In Dugan\u2019s filing, she calls the academy\u2019s allegation that she asked for $22m to resign \u201cflat out false\u201d. A further statement from her lawyer Douglas Wigdor alleges she was offered \u201cmillions of dollars to drop all of this and leave the academy\u201d, and was put on leave when she refused, and says Dugan \u201crepeatedly raised concerns throughout her entire tenure at the academy\u201d, not just now following her suspension.</p> <p>Elsewhere in her legal filing, made to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Dugan alleges that she was sexually harassed by entertainment lawyer Joel Katz, who is general counsel for the academy. She says he \u201cacted extremely inappropriately\u201d during a business dinner in May 2019, repeatedly remarking on her physical appearance and attempting to kiss her and \u201cwoo her\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Deborah Dugan, the chief executive and president of the Recording Academy, which organises the Grammy awards, who was suspended last week after a misconduct allegation, has countered with her own 44-page legal complaint five days before 2020\u2019s awards ceremony. In it, she alleges sexual harassment and voting corruption in the company. Her most serious claim is the academy was aware of allegations that her predecessor Neil Portnow, who was chief executive from 2002 to 2019, raped an unnamed female recording artist. The filing written by her legal team reads that after she was hired, \u201cMs Dugan was hauled into a conference room and told \u2013 for the very first time \u2013 that a foreign recording artist (and member of the academy) had accused Mr Portnow of raping her following a performance that she gave at Carnegie Hall. The news was presented to Ms Dugan as though the board had just learned of the allegation. In reality, they were well aware of the allegation at the time Ms Dugan agreed to take on the CEO position, but never told her.\u201d The allegation of assault was, she was told, \u201cthe real reason his contract was not renewed\u201d in 2019. She claims she was nonetheless pressured by the then chairman John Poppo to rehire Portnow as a consultant with a $750,000 salary. At the time, Portnow did not give reasons for stepping down as chief executive, and only said that he wanted to create a smooth transition for his successor. The end of his tenure had been heavily marred by comments he made in 2018, in the wake of very few female winners at that year\u2019s Grammys, that female creatives needed to \u201cstep up\u201d if they were to succeed. The academy released a statement dismissing Dugan\u2019s accusations. It reads in part: \u201cIt is curious that Ms Dugan never raised these grave allegations until a week after legal claims were made against her personally by a female employee.\u201d Portnow later denied Dugan\u2019s claims, calling them \u201cludicrous and untrue\u201d. Dugan was placed on administrative leave last week, following the allegation of misconduct. A memo from the interim chief executive to academy members earlier this week gave further details, saying Dugan fostered a \u201ctoxic and intolerable\u201d work environment and was \u201cabusive and bullying\u201d. Academy board member Christine Albert told the New York Times that Dugan\u2019s leadership style had clashed with the academy, saying: \u201cWhat we expected was change without chaos.\u201d In Dugan\u2019s filing, she calls the academy\u2019s allegation that she asked for $22m to resign \u201cflat out false\u201d. A further statement from her lawyer Douglas Wigdor alleges she was offered \u201cmillions of dollars to drop all of this and leave the academy\u201d, and was put on leave when she refused, and says Dugan \u201crepeatedly raised concerns throughout her entire tenure at the academy\u201d, not just now following her suspension. Elsewhere in her legal filing, made to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Dugan alleges that she was sexually harassed by entertainment lawyer Joel Katz, who is general counsel for the academy. She says he \u201cacted extremely inappropriately\u201d during a business dinner in May 2019, repeatedly remarking on her physical appearance and attempting to kiss her and \u201cwoo her\u201d. Katz\u2019s lawyer said her recollection was \u201cfalse and Mr Katz categorically and emphatically denies her version of that evening\u201d. She also alleges corruption in the academy\u2019s voting procedures. She gives the example of a song longlisted for the 2019 song of the year award, which was ranked 18th place out of 20 songs by the nominations committee, but which nevertheless ended up on the shortlist as the artist behind the song sat on the committee and was represented by a member of the Grammys board. She alleges that the nomination committees added in artists who weren\u2019t selected by the academy\u2019s voting pool. Her complaint says that the Grammys board \u201chas decided to shroud the process in secrecy, and ultimately controls, in large part, who is nominated\u201d and \u201cmanipulates the nominations process to ensure that certain songs or albums are nominated when the producer of the Grammys [Ken Ehrlich] wants a particular song performed on the show\u201d. The academy has not responded to these specific allegations beyond the aforementioned dismissal of Dugan\u2019s filing. Dugan\u2019s filing says that the alleged behaviour was made possible by a \u201cboys\u2019 club mentality\u201d in the company. In an accompanying statement, her legal team said those accused used \u201ctactics reminiscent of those deployed by individuals defending Harvey Weinstein\u201d. The EEOC will now work to determine whether Dugan\u2019s allegations have merit, and whether her suspension discriminates against her. Whatever the outcome, it is a damaging episode for a company that was trying to rehabilitate its image: as well as criticism of its bias towards male winners, artists including Frank Ocean, Kanye West and Drake have criticised the awards in recent years over a lack of support for non-white musicians in major categories. In 2018, Michelle Obama\u2019s former chief of staff Tina Tchen was hired to head up a taskforce to examine how the Grammys operate. Its final report, published in December, proposed greater diversity in academy members and changes to voting procedures. The 2020 Grammy awards take place on Sunday, with Lizzo earning the most nominations with eight, ahead of Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X with six each.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. UN to address Guardian revelations over Saudis\u2019 Bezos \u2018hack\u2019 UN investigators are expected to release a statement about the alleged 2018 hacking of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone by the Saudis, details of which were revealed by the Guardian. A forensic analysis implicated a WhatsApp account purportedly owned by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, which sent a large video file to Bezos in May 2018. It is \u201chighly probable\u201d, investigators found, that the file contained malware. Within hours, large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezos\u2019 phone. Dinner meeting. Prince Mohammed and Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man, had both attended a dinner in LA a few weeks before the hack, hosted by the film producer Brian Grazer. Months later, Prince Mohammed was implicated in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos. Democrats decry Republican \u2018cover-up\u2019 on day one of Trump trial As the first day of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial stretched towards midnight, Adam Schiff, the lead Democratic prosecutor, voiced his frustration over Republican tactics. \u201cThere is a reason why we are still here at five minutes till midnight,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the American people to see what\u2019s going on here.\u201d In votes that \u2013 to Democrats\u2019 disappointment \u2013 fell squarely on party lines, the Senate voted down proposals to subpoena testimony from four potential witnesses. Forever Trump? The impeachment trial is a test of whether the Republican party can ever divorce itself from a demagogic president, writes David Smith. And on the evidence of its first day, that seems unlikely. Psychologist admits \u2018abusive drift\u2019 in terror suspects\u2019 treatment One of the two CIA contract psychologists who created the so-called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d used by the agency on terror suspects has told a military tribunal he was unable to prevent \u201cabusive drift\u201d by an unnamed senior agency official. Giving evidence in a pre-trial hearing of the 9/11 case, James Mitchell described the 2002 decision to use waterboarding and other techniques that the US later admitted constituted torture, as Julian Borger reports from Guantanamo Bay. Legal line. \u201cThe CIA was never interested in prosecution,\u201d Mitchell said, watched by the five defendants including the self-proclaimed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. \u201cThey were going to go right up to the line of what was legal, put their toes on it, and lean forward.\u201d China tries to contain coronavirus as first US case is reported The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced the first known US case of the coronavirus strain that has now killed nine people in China. A man in his 30s, who recently returned from a trip to central China, was diagnosed in Seattle and is said to be in good condition at a hospital in Everett, Washington. That makes the US the fifth country to report cases of the illness, which was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan before spreading to Beijing, Shanghai and beyond. \u2018Mutating\u2019 disease. China has said 440 people have contracted the Sars-like disease, as Beijing unveiled measures to contain its spread, warning the disease could mutate and advising Wuhan residents to remain in the city.

The organisation\u2019s president, Alexis McGill Johnson, tells Jessica Glenza how she plans to \u201cundo all of the damage\u201d of abortion bans in the Trump era. Dancer hit by #MeToo scandal stages a Broadway comeback Amar Ramasar was caught up in a major #MeToo scandal in 2018, when he and his former New York City Ballet colleague Chase Finlay were revealed to have exchanged explicit photographs of female dancers. Alexandra Villareal asks whether Ramasar ought to be back on stage already, in the Broadway revival of West Side Story. American Dirt: is Oprah\u2019s latest book club pick \u2018problematic\u2019? American Dirt, the divisive new novel by Jeanine Cummins, tells the story of a Mexican mother and son\u2019s perilous journey to the US border after their family is murdered by a cartel. It has earned a coveted place in Oprah\u2019s book club, but critics say it is exploitative and patronising. Andr\u00e9 Wheeler reports. The strange, surprising world of faecal transplants Injecting patients with other people\u2019s excrement has proven to be a highly effective treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Rose George asks whether this unlikely sounding approach could also hold the key to curing dementia, anorexia and obesity. Opinion Peter Daou worked on both of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns. He says her attack on \u201conline Bernie bros\u201d amplifies a destructive myth about Sanders supporters, who in fact comprise a diverse coalition, committed to upholding core progressive values. It is long past time for a progressive overhaul of the entire party, and it would better for our country and our future if Democratic leaders encouraged the Sanders movement rather than try to erase it.

The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) has previously cautioned that EU citizens risk discrimination if they do not have a card showing their status when looking to rent properties.

The House of Commons will be asked to vote on an amendment to the Brexit bill passed in the House of Lords that calls for a physical card to be issued. The government rejected the idea outright on Monday after the defeat in the Lords claiming a digital record was the most secure. Brandon Lewis, the Home Office minister, said the government had no intention of changing its policy. \u201cI disagree with the results of today\u2019s @UKHouseofLords vote.

This indicates the Lords\u2019 amendment to offer physical cards will be overturned later on Wednesday. Critics have expressed confusion with the government\u2019s position since a physical card could be issued alongside the digital number used to access an EU citizen\u2019s status online. Previous research by the JCWI on the government\u2019s right-to-rent policy found that of 150 anonymous inquiries from prospective tenants who asked landlords to conduct an online status check, 85% received no response and only three responses explicitly stated that the landlord was willing to conduct an online check. Landlords were happier to respond positively when the tenant could provide a clear physical document proving their status, they said in a statement. A survey of EU citizens published on Monday showed that 90% want a physical card to prove their right to be in the country and avert discrimination by employers and landlords after the UK leaves the EU. Last year the RLA said it was unreasonable to expect landlords to implement government immigration rules by placing the responsibility on them to establish a person\u2019s right to be in the country. David Smith, the RLA\u2019s policy director, said landlords \u201cdo not follow every twist and turn of Brexit\u201d yet under the right-to-rent rules they face fines of \u00a35,000 for each adult tenant if they are found to be renting out a property to an illegal immigrant. \u201cTechnically EU citizens have the right to rent, but some landlords will not be aware of the law.

      "bodyText": "A weekend blizzard and a sub-zero deep freeze helped cool tempers that were reaching boiling point among Democrats. Chill, everyone. Whoever wins the nomination will beat Trump across the struggling midwest. The Sanders crowd suggested Warren was an elitist. Warren elbowed back with a gender argument. Sanders attacked Biden over social security; Biden countered that he was lying. The snake emojis are out. Old resentments over issues that can\u2019t even be recalled are fed. The result of it all? Nobody knows. JD Scholten, running for US congress in Iowa, was in Ames on Saturday when the temperature was -4F. Hundreds came out for the Story County Democrats\u2019 soup supper in the hometown of Iowa State University, a key territory. He asked how many were undecided. Half raised their hands. A poll one week shows Sanders on top in Iowa. A week later, another poll finds Biden leading, with Amy Klobuchar in the double digits. Warren, Sanders and Klobuchar are confined to the Senate with two weekends left to campaign ahead of the 3 February caucuses. In their absence, Pete Buttigieg is everywhere all at once, working like a beaver. Any one of them can beat Trump. The president knows it. That\u2019s why he sent his daughter-in-law Lara Trump to Iowa to make fun of Biden\u2019s stuttering, which endeared him even more to Iowans. Vice-President Mike Pence was dispatched to Iowa this week to shore up the evangelical vote for this philanderer of a president.

      "body": "<p>There is a flagrantly anti-theatrical quality to Cormac McCarthy\u2019s 2006 play The Sunset Limited. It unfolds as a conversation on faith and faithlessness between two men: one believes in Jesus, the other in nothingness.</p> <p>There is no plot beyond their Socratic exchanges, and even names are replaced by epithets denoting skin colour. Black, a self-appointed citizen saviour, intercepts the attempted suicide of White in a New York subway and subsequently attempts to talk him round to valuing his life. White stays depressed and defensive: \u201cWho appointed you my guardian angel?\u201d As they sit down in Black\u2019s tenement block to thrash it out, they appear \u2013 like many of McCarthy\u2019s men \u2013 to be existential cowboys as they warm up beans on Black\u2019s campsite stove, drink coffee from metal cups and chew the cud about God and ontology.</p> <p>There is, within this dynamic, the potential for the kind of emotionally charged clashes and complicated intimacies found between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shepard\">Sam Shepard</a>\u2019s men, facing off in sitting rooms or secluded space. But Black and White do not crack open or combust. They just sip coffee and carry on talking.</p> <p>While its promise of unconventional theatre of the mind is bold, The Sunset Limited stays belligerently anti-dramatic.

      "bodyText": "There is a flagrantly anti-theatrical quality to Cormac McCarthy\u2019s 2006 play The Sunset Limited. It unfolds as a conversation on faith and faithlessness between two men: one believes in Jesus, the other in nothingness. There is no plot beyond their Socratic exchanges, and even names are replaced by epithets denoting skin colour. Black, a self-appointed citizen saviour, intercepts the attempted suicide of White in a New York subway and subsequently attempts to talk him round to valuing his life. White stays depressed and defensive: \u201cWho appointed you my guardian angel?\u201d As they sit down in Black\u2019s tenement block to thrash it out, they appear \u2013 like many of McCarthy\u2019s men \u2013 to be existential cowboys as they warm up beans on Black\u2019s campsite stove, drink coffee from metal cups and chew the cud about God and ontology. There is, within this dynamic, the potential for the kind of emotionally charged clashes and complicated intimacies found between Sam Shepard\u2019s men, facing off in sitting rooms or secluded space. But Black and White do not crack open or combust. They just sip coffee and carry on talking. While its promise of unconventional theatre of the mind is bold, The Sunset Limited stays belligerently anti-dramatic. The relationship between the men does not deepen though they are both carrying trauma, and their tensions do not develop or escalate. Their back-stories are tantalising but only touched upon, and the tales they tell do not rouse any significant emotion. Their arguments begin to sound repetitive too. The play sometimes bears the subtitle \u201ca novel in dramatic form\u201d, but this production comes to feel like a treatise in dramatic form.

The call for automatic cost-of-living increases for social security recipients figured prominently in the 29-year-old\u2019s stump speech.

This despite a majority of Americans <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v52n12/v52n12p2.pdf\">supporting more funding</a> for the program, even if it meant higher taxes.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters not looking forward to a potential Joe Biden nomination might want to time-travel back to 1972. That year, Biden was an underdog Senate candidate running against a popular incumbent. With his sister, Valerie, as campaign manager and limited resources, he knocked on hundreds of doors and embraced a progressive message centered around ending the Vietnam war, protecting the environment and supporting civil rights. He directed particular ire at millionaires who didn\u2019t pay taxes and mega-corporations that grew rich while being subsidized by the public. The Democrats\u2019 exceptionally leftwing 1972 platform called for an expansion of key entitlement programs and, as the journalist Branko Marcetic writes in Yesterday\u2019s Man: The Case Against Joe Biden, the prospective senator was fully onboard. The call for automatic cost-of-living increases for social security recipients figured prominently in the 29-year-old\u2019s stump speech. As Biden told a crowd of Delaware autoworkers, the program needed to be more generous, \u201craised to a level where people can live in dignity\u201d. They rewarded him with a United Autoworkers Union endorsement, support that would be crucial in his narrow victory. A decade later, the \u201cNew Deal Democrat\u201d had completely changed his tune. As the Reagan era dawned, Biden recalls listening to friends \u201cmostly on the Republican side of the aisle\u201d. \u201cMore and more,\u201d he became \u201ca believer in balanced budgets.\u201d By 1984, Biden took his newfound small-government approach to its logical conclusion and proposed a total federal spending freeze. A majority of states had double-digit unemployment rates at the time, and there were widespread economic worries. But instead of taking aim at the structural reasons for decline, Biden focused single-mindedly on the deficit. Along with two Republican colleagues, he spearheaded a plan to \u201cshock the living devil out of everyone in the US Senate\u201d by freezing spending, including cost-of-living adjustments for social security recipients. This despite a majority of Americans supporting more funding for the program, even if it meant higher taxes. At the time, inflation was nearing 5%, so effectively Biden would have taken billions of dollars away from working people. \u201cMiddle-class Joe\u201d from Scranton, Pennsylvania, the economic populist of 1972, was long gone. And he never regretted his shift. In 1995, when he finally had a Republican majority to work with in the Senate, Biden reminded his colleagues that \u201cWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant social security as well, I meant Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d He joined only a handful of Democrats in backing a Republican proposal to enshrine small government into the constitution through a balanced budget amendment. He was just as unremorseful when running for president in 2007, telling Tim Russert on Meet the Press he wasn\u2019t afraid of the \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics \u2013 entitlement reform, even cuts to popular programs. In particular, he touted the idea of \u201cprotecting\u201d social security by raising the retirement age. In the early weeks of 2020, this troubling history has finally gotten mainstream attention. It\u2019s been mostly driven by the Sanders campaign, which is eager to cut into Biden\u2019s huge lead among older voters.

Church protested a bit too much with the assistant referee, earning him a booking while still on the bench. Bristol City converted the penalty and the score remained 1-0 until the 90th minute when substitute Church popped in a dramatic late equaliser.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWith Bar\u00e7a sacking Valverde,\u201d tweets Gordon, \u201cwhen was the last time a manager was sacked at the top of the league?\u201d William Hogg can recall one Halloween horror show. \u201cScot Symon was told \u2013 through an intermediary, though this was typical of Rangers at the time \u2013 that his services were no longer required at Ibrox on 31 October 1967, when Rangers were a point ahead of Hibernian and three clear of Celtic at the top of Division One. It should, of course, be remembered that 1967 had been a difficult year for Symon. Rangers had fallen out of the Scottish Cup at the first hurdle the season before against the mighty, er, Berwick Rangers, while hopes of a Cup Winners\u2019 Cup win to stand alongside Celtic\u2019s European Cup triumph in Lisbon were dashed by Bayern Munich in the final. \u201cIn fact, at the time of Symon\u2019s sacking, Celtic (who had collected a clean sweep of five first-team trophies during 1966-67) were in Buenos Aires preparing for the first of two feisty encounters with Racing Club for the World Championship. The weekend before Symon\u2019s sacking; Rangers had laboured to a goalless draw at home to Dunfermline.\u201d One of his last signings before getting the boot had been a centre-forward by the name of Alex Ferguson. \u201c[Symon was] a marvellous man who maybe didn\u2019t have the luck, didn\u2019t get the support he should have got from the club,\u201d Ferguson later admitted. Florian Labrouche gets in touch with news of a rival. \u201cIt happens that L\u2019Equipe asked themselves the same question, and found \u2026 Antoine Kombouar\u00e9, sacked in December 2011 by PSG and their new owner QSI, to make place for Carlo Ancelotti. PSG were top of Ligue 1, and Ancelotti finished three points behind Montpellier on the final day; Radomir Antic, axed by Real Madrid in 1992, who finished second behind Barcelona that year; and Branko Zebec, ditched by Hamburg in 1980. And guess what? Yes, they finished second that year. That does not bode well for Barcelona.\u201d Martin Jackson remembers that \u201cBobby Robson was sacked by top-of-the-table Sporting in 1993, mainly due to the team\u2019s exit from the Uefa Cup at the hands of Salzburg. Robson was quickly snapped up by rivals Porto, and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho appointed as his assistant. I wonder whatever became of him?\u201d On we go. \u201cFC Copenhagen sacked Roland Nilsson after six months in charge (on 9 January 2012), holding a four-point lead over FC Nordsj\u00e6lland heading into the Danish Superliga\u2019s winter break,\u201d tweets Walid Hajjaj. \u201cHe was succeeded by sporting director Carsten V Jensen, who described it as the easiest job in Danish football. Jensen duly squandered the lead and Copenhagen finished as runners-up \u2026 in the first season ever with direct qualification to the Champions League for the Danish champions.\u201d Dirk Maas has another. \u201cOn 14 January 1993, Luka Peruzovic was sacked by the Anderlecht board, despite a comfortable six-point lead in the league after 18 games. The board cited \u2018communication problems between players and the manager\u2019 as the main reason for Peruzovic\u2019s departure. The Croatian couldn\u2019t speak Dutch and barely managed to communicate in French and English. Another point of criticism was the form of tactics used. He was blamed for playing too conservatively.\u201d And George Burley was removed from Tynecastle by owner Vladimir Romanov in October 2005, with Hearts unbeaten and leading the way in Scotland (barely a month after this piece). They finished second, 17 points behind Celtic. Speaking years later, Romanov was remorseless: \u201cWe could have lost more with him staying. Without him, we still got second place and the cup as well. All the players brought to Hearts that year were brought by me. George Burley\u2019s influence was very minimal. I don\u2019t know why people think he was the great coach. Look especially at when he was promoted to the Scottish national team - that was one of Scottish football\u2019s biggest farces.\u201d Take us to Church \u201cHas any substitute been shown a yellow card while on the bench, then brought on and shown a second yellow card?\u201d enquires Guy Stephenson. \u201cSimon Church was on the bench for Reading when they played away to Bristol City on 19 December 2009 (their first match Brendan Rodgers\u2019 ill-fated four-month stint in charge),\u201d recalls Richard Harland. \u201cCity were awarded a dubious penalty in the 13th minute. Church protested a bit too much with the assistant referee, earning him a booking while still on the bench. Bristol City converted the penalty and the score remained 1-0 until the 90th minute when substitute Church popped in a dramatic late equaliser. Cue over exuberant celebration with the Reading fans, a second booking and an (slightly) early bath.\u201d Good Jord \u201cSeeing that Jordan Henderson seems to have developed his own special trophy lift, are there other footballers who can claim the same?\u201d asks Gareth Bell-Jones. Hilderaldo Bellini, captain of Brazil\u2019s first World Cup-winning side in 1958, was the first footballer to triumphantly lift a trophy over their head. Amid the throng of fans on the Rasunda Stadium pitch in Solna, Bellini thrust it skywards so the attending press could capture the image, one that is immortalised in a statue outside the Maracan\u00e3 in Rio.

      "body": "<p>The man and woman are wearing blue hospital gowns and clear face shields. Dr James Sones and Dr Indu Srinivasan are in a room in the Division of Digestive Diseases at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. They are about to create something that has spread through medicine like, well, a shitstorm.</p> <p>Sones takes a brown gloopy material and spoons it into what looks like a regular kitchen blender. The camera zooms in to a label on it: faecal blender. The brown gloopy stuff is, depending on your profession and level of politeness, faecal matter, stool, excrement or poo. It has been donated by a generous volunteer and it is almost certainly going to transform the life of the person who is going to receive it.</p> <p>Once blended and mixed with saline, the brown stuff is poured into large syringes and infused into a willing patient by colonoscopy. (Nasogastric tubes and enemas are other delivery methods.) In the UK, this treatment is available for patients suffering from repeated infections of <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"><em>Clostridium difficile</em> </a>or <em>C diff.</em></p> <p>These bacteria can live harmlessly inside us. But in patients who are given strong antibiotics, <em>C diff</em> can survive, overwhelm a gut wiped of its microbiome, then secrete a toxin that causes severe pain, awful diarrhoea and vomiting. In the worst cases, it can be fatal. Even when vanquished by antibiotics, it can return except if the patient receives an infusion of poo, a procedure known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/25/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-why-patients-are-no-longer-pooh-poohing-faecal-transplants\" title=\"\">a faecal microbiota transplant (FMT)</a>.</p> <p>Human waste is a misnomer. What we excrete contains nutrients and bacteria, and it can be a useful fertiliser or fuel. That the bacteria it contains can also cure ailing guts was known by ancient Chinese writers, who wrote of \u201cyellow soup\u201d (assumed to have been liquidised excrement), which was used to treat food poisoning and bad diarrhoea.</p> <p>A US surgeon, Ben Eiseman, resurrected the procedure in 1958, but then the antibiotic vancomycin was discovered and became the standard treatment for <em>C diff</em>. Yet when antibiotics began failing, enterprising doctors began to try FMT to restore a damaged microbiome. The success rates were astounding: about 90% of patients with recurrent <em>C diff</em> were cured.</p> <p>In 2013, Dutch researchers halted a randomised control trial \u2013 the gold standard of medical trials \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23323867\" title=\"\">because FMT was so much more effective than vancomycin</a>. By 2014, the procedure was accepted enough that the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued guidelines allowing <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/IPG485\" title=\"\">faecal transplants to be used in clinical practice</a>, but only for <em>C diff</em>.</p> <p>Even so, says Prof Tariq Iqbal of the Microbiome Treatment Centre (MTC) at the University of Birmingham,\u201cit was very poorly taken up. Only about 30 hospitals [in the UK] had ever done a faecal transplant. Only four had done 10 or more.\u201d</p> <p>Partly, there was a supply problem: where was the poo to come from? In the early years of FMT, patients were often infused with faecal material donated by a close relative or friend. Slowly, though, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/21/faecal-transplant-researchers-identify-super-pooper-donors\" title=\"\">concept of a stool donor emerged</a>. Now, MTC is one of only two licensed stool banks in the UK, and in its first year of operation sent out 150 samples, at a cost of \u00a3650 for each 50ml.</p> <p>Donors are recruited by poster and word of mouth. Iqbal says they need to drop off their stools for 10 days in a row before 11am (so they have to be regular in more ways than one). Although MTC is next to Queen Elizabeth hospital, healthcare workers are excluded because they are exposed to too many bugs.</p> <p>Screening is rigorous: it has to be, when each sample can be different. More than 90% of volunteers are turned away. For safety reasons, each sample is kept for three months before being used, in case a donor is incubating something. A sample will be kept indefinitely, too. The screening tests are as severe as the donor questionnaires: all samples are tested for a wide range of pathogens.</p> <p>What does a finished FMT sample look like? Does it smell? Iqbal looks at my coffee cup. \u201cIt\u2019s the colour of latte.\u201d And yes, of course it smells. \u201cIt\u2019s shit.\u201d Patients, he says, have no problem accepting the procedure. They won\u2019t smell it, for a start, in a nasogastric tube or colonoscopy. And you can\u2019t afford an ick factor when you are desperately ill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b81fa3c54905d90d7b1035a77e234b42e3985a56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b81fa3c54905d90d7b1035a77e234b42e3985a56/0_183_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adrienne Grierson: \u2018By the third FMT treatment, it was like my brain had been switched on.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adrienne Grierson: \u2018By the third FMT treatment, it was like my brain had been switched on.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Elliot, 50, a company director from Dudley, developed ulcerative colitis in his 30s. He would take antibiotics and be well, then relapse. His diarrhoea was so bad, he had to go to the toilet 50 times a day. Then Iqbal told him about FMT. Although he didn\u2019t have <em>C diff</em>, he could get the procedure as part of a planned clinical trial into colitis and FMT.</p> <p>He had an enema of FMT once a week for eight weeks. \u201cAfter six weeks, there was a drastic improvement. After the course I was 90% to 95% well.\u201d He remembers clearly that it was during the World Cup two years ago, because when he went in for a final assessment by an internal camera, \u201cthe room went up in applause. I remember comparing it to watching England playing the night before and these people were cheering at my colon.\u201d</p> <p>Because it is so simple and widely available and seems so miraculous, the use of FMT has long since departed from sterile medical establishments into home bathrooms and YouTube. If it transforms the microbiome so well for <em>C diff</em>, why shouldn\u2019t it do it for other conditions? If the microbiome plays a part in all sorts of body functions from mood to metabolism, as <a href=\"https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/6/1108\" title=\"\">research</a> seems to show, why shouldn\u2019t a dose of healthy poo sort out other problems, too?</p> <p>There are more than 300 clinical trials listed on <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/\" title=\"\">clinicaltrials.gov</a> that are using FMT to treat a range of conditions including autism, dementia, anorexia, and obesity. The most recent wants to explore FMT as a treatment for faecal incontinence (the inability to control bowel movements) in women.</p> <p>But Mark Wilcox, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds, is circumspect. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s common about FMT is that, wherever you are, there are particular enthusiasts, and in the US in particular. It\u2019s a major fee-earning opportunity in the US. But it is, like it or not, an experimental procedure.\u201d</p> <p>Animal trials have shown that conditions and pre-conditions can be transmitted with the faecal material. \u201cThere are data that gut bacteria play a role in gut cancers, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity. You can turn fat mice thin and thin mice fat by transplanting their gut bacteria. Because we don\u2019t know the full roles of the gut microbiome, you are potentially transferring someone\u2019s bacteria that have something to do with cancer, diabetes, obesity and so on.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, two people participating in trials in the US contracted <em>E</em><em> Coli</em> from faecal transplants \u2013 one died \u2013 because samples had not been tested for that pathogen. But even this news does not stop people who can\u2019t get FMT on the NHS or can\u2019t afford it in the US (where it can cost $1,000) from doing their own thing. Adrienne Grierson, an Australian film-maker based in London, describes herself as \u201can antibiotic child\u201d. Since then she has suffered \u201cterrible stomach troubles\u201d including \u201ccramps, doubling over, vomiting, diarrhoea, boiling hot flush, sweating, agony\u201d.</p> <p>In 2015, stuck in bed, she turned to Google and discovered faecal transplants and the microbiome. \u201cI thought, my God, I\u2019ve been playing here with half a deck of cards.

      "bodyText": "The man and woman are wearing blue hospital gowns and clear face shields. Dr James Sones and Dr Indu Srinivasan are in a room in the Division of Digestive Diseases at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. They are about to create something that has spread through medicine like, well, a shitstorm. Sones takes a brown gloopy material and spoons it into what looks like a regular kitchen blender. The camera zooms in to a label on it: faecal blender. The brown gloopy stuff is, depending on your profession and level of politeness, faecal matter, stool, excrement or poo. It has been donated by a generous volunteer and it is almost certainly going to transform the life of the person who is going to receive it. Once blended and mixed with saline, the brown stuff is poured into large syringes and infused into a willing patient by colonoscopy. (Nasogastric tubes and enemas are other delivery methods.) In the UK, this treatment is available for patients suffering from repeated infections of Clostridium difficile or C diff. These bacteria can live harmlessly inside us. But in patients who are given strong antibiotics, C diff can survive, overwhelm a gut wiped of its microbiome, then secrete a toxin that causes severe pain, awful diarrhoea and vomiting. In the worst cases, it can be fatal. Even when vanquished by antibiotics, it can return except if the patient receives an infusion of poo, a procedure known as a faecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Human waste is a misnomer. What we excrete contains nutrients and bacteria, and it can be a useful fertiliser or fuel. That the bacteria it contains can also cure ailing guts was known by ancient Chinese writers, who wrote of \u201cyellow soup\u201d (assumed to have been liquidised excrement), which was used to treat food poisoning and bad diarrhoea. A US surgeon, Ben Eiseman, resurrected the procedure in 1958, but then the antibiotic vancomycin was discovered and became the standard treatment for C diff. Yet when antibiotics began failing, enterprising doctors began to try FMT to restore a damaged microbiome. The success rates were astounding: about 90% of patients with recurrent C diff were cured. In 2013, Dutch researchers halted a randomised control trial \u2013 the gold standard of medical trials \u2013 because FMT was so much more effective than vancomycin. By 2014, the procedure was accepted enough that the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued guidelines allowing faecal transplants to be used in clinical practice, but only for C diff. Even so, says Prof Tariq Iqbal of the Microbiome Treatment Centre (MTC) at the University of Birmingham,\u201cit was very poorly taken up. Only about 30 hospitals [in the UK] had ever done a faecal transplant. Only four had done 10 or more.\u201d Partly, there was a supply problem: where was the poo to come from? In the early years of FMT, patients were often infused with faecal material donated by a close relative or friend. Slowly, though, the concept of a stool donor emerged. Now, MTC is one of only two licensed stool banks in the UK, and in its first year of operation sent out 150 samples, at a cost of \u00a3650 for each 50ml. Donors are recruited by poster and word of mouth. Iqbal says they need to drop off their stools for 10 days in a row before 11am (so they have to be regular in more ways than one). Although MTC is next to Queen Elizabeth hospital, healthcare workers are excluded because they are exposed to too many bugs. Screening is rigorous: it has to be, when each sample can be different. More than 90% of volunteers are turned away. For safety reasons, each sample is kept for three months before being used, in case a donor is incubating something. A sample will be kept indefinitely, too. The screening tests are as severe as the donor questionnaires: all samples are tested for a wide range of pathogens. What does a finished FMT sample look like? Does it smell? Iqbal looks at my coffee cup. \u201cIt\u2019s the colour of latte.\u201d And yes, of course it smells. \u201cIt\u2019s shit.\u201d Patients, he says, have no problem accepting the procedure. They won\u2019t smell it, for a start, in a nasogastric tube or colonoscopy. And you can\u2019t afford an ick factor when you are desperately ill. James Elliot, 50, a company director from Dudley, developed ulcerative colitis in his 30s. He would take antibiotics and be well, then relapse. His diarrhoea was so bad, he had to go to the toilet 50 times a day. Then Iqbal told him about FMT. Although he didn\u2019t have C diff, he could get the procedure as part of a planned clinical trial into colitis and FMT. He had an enema of FMT once a week for eight weeks. \u201cAfter six weeks, there was a drastic improvement. After the course I was 90% to 95% well.\u201d He remembers clearly that it was during the World Cup two years ago, because when he went in for a final assessment by an internal camera, \u201cthe room went up in applause. I remember comparing it to watching England playing the night before and these people were cheering at my colon.\u201d Because it is so simple and widely available and seems so miraculous, the use of FMT has long since departed from sterile medical establishments into home bathrooms and YouTube. If it transforms the microbiome so well for C diff, why shouldn\u2019t it do it for other conditions? If the microbiome plays a part in all sorts of body functions from mood to metabolism, as research seems to show, why shouldn\u2019t a dose of healthy poo sort out other problems, too? There are more than 300 clinical trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov that are using FMT to treat a range of conditions including autism, dementia, anorexia, and obesity. The most recent wants to explore FMT as a treatment for faecal incontinence (the inability to control bowel movements) in women. But Mark Wilcox, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds, is circumspect. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s common about FMT is that, wherever you are, there are particular enthusiasts, and in the US in particular. It\u2019s a major fee-earning opportunity in the US. But it is, like it or not, an experimental procedure.\u201d Animal trials have shown that conditions and pre-conditions can be transmitted with the faecal material. \u201cThere are data that gut bacteria play a role in gut cancers, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity. You can turn fat mice thin and thin mice fat by transplanting their gut bacteria. Because we don\u2019t know the full roles of the gut microbiome, you are potentially transferring someone\u2019s bacteria that have something to do with cancer, diabetes, obesity and so on.\u201d Last year, two people participating in trials in the US contracted E Coli from faecal transplants \u2013 one died \u2013 because samples had not been tested for that pathogen. But even this news does not stop people who can\u2019t get FMT on the NHS or can\u2019t afford it in the US (where it can cost $1,000) from doing their own thing. Adrienne Grierson, an Australian film-maker based in London, describes herself as \u201can antibiotic child\u201d. Since then she has suffered \u201cterrible stomach troubles\u201d including \u201ccramps, doubling over, vomiting, diarrhoea, boiling hot flush, sweating, agony\u201d. In 2015, stuck in bed, she turned to Google and discovered faecal transplants and the microbiome. \u201cI thought, my God, I\u2019ve been playing here with half a deck of cards. There\u2019s only so much I can do with what I\u2019ve destroyed.\u201d She paid for 10 FMTs from a private clinic and \u201cby the third day, it was like somebody had switched my brain on, like the antibiotics used to do. And that was a shock. I hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead. I just wanted my guts to not fall out.\u201d Since then, Grierson has had faecal transplants every three months or so, although now she does it DIY, at home.

      "bodyText": "UN investigators are poised to release a statement about the alleged hacking of Jeff Bezos\u2019s mobile phone after the Guardian revealed details of a forensic analysis that has implicated a WhatsApp account purportedly owned by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. The astonishing disclosure prompted a Democratic lawmaker in the US to urgently demand more information about the malware that was allegedly used to infiltrate Bezos\u2019s phone in the 2018 hack of the Amazon founder. Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, said in a letter to Bezos that the alleged breach of the billionaire\u2019s phone \u201cappears to be part of a growing trend\u201d, citing reports that Saudi Arabia had acquired cyber-hacking capabilities from Hacking Team, based in Italy, and Israel\u2019s NSO Group. Wyden reacted following a Guardian story that cites sources who said the alleged \u201chack\u201d occurred after Bezos apparently received a video file sent to him by Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s WhatsApp account. Large amounts of data were allegedly exfiltrated from Bezos\u2019s phone within hours of him receiving the video file. David Kaye, a UN special rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, said in a tweet that he and Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the special rapporteur on extrajudicial murders, would announce further information about the alleged Bezos hack on Wednesday morning. Bezos \u2013 the owner of the Washington Post \u2013 is the most high-profile alleged victim of Saudi Arabia\u2019s cyber-surveillance efforts, but independent experts have concluded that a number of dissidents and activists living outside Saudi Arabia have also been targeted by the kingdom. They include close associates of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Saudi press officials did not return a request for comment, but the Saudi embassy in Washington said in a tweet in response to the Guardian\u2019s story: \u201cRecent media reports that suggest the kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone are absurd. We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out.\u201d The fresh allegations about Bezos suggest that even the world\u2019s richest person can fall victim to a cyber-attack, a fact that will likely shine a spotlight on the issue and is likely to cause some consternation on Capitol Hill. Bezos\u2019s head of security, Gavin de Becker, said in an opinion column last March that he had handed the results of his own investigation to law enforcement officials. The FBI did not return a request for comment on Tuesday. WhatsApp, the popular messaging service, filed a lawsuit against NSO Group last year alleging that 1,400 users were hacked over a two-week period between April-May 2019 using the Israeli company\u2019s malware. About 100 of those alleged victims were journalists, human rights campaigners, academics and activists who were apparently targeted by NSO\u2019s government clients. Wyden told the Guardian in December he was examining the possible hacking of US citizens by technology sold by the NSO Group and other foreign surveillance companies, an issue he said raised \u201cserious national security issues\u201d. NSO has staunchly denied the allegations and has said its technology is intended to be used only to fight crime and terrorism. It has also said its malware technology is not used against US mobile phone numbers, although WhatsApp has suggested in litigation against the company that at least one \u201c202\u201d phone number was targeted using the malware. Hacking Team could not immediately be reached for comment. Wyden, an outspoken privacy advocate, asked Bezos to assist him in providing as much technical assistance as possible about the alleged intrusion, saying it would help Congress prevent more cyber-attacks on Americans. Among other details, the senator is seeking the IP addresses of the servers associated with the malware, and any detailed forensic reports that Bezos and his team may have had conducted after the alleged breach. Wyden is also seeking to determine whether the Saudis used an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d surveillance software, and if so, which one. It is not clear what precise data was allegedly exfiltrated by Saudi Arabia. Bezos\u2019s own security team has in the past linked allegations that Saudis \u201caccessed\u201d Bezos\u2019s phone to the publication last January of a National Enquirer expos\u00e9, which included details about Bezos\u2019s extramarital relationship and intimate text messages. Bezos\u2019s spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment. But an attorney for the chief executive told the Guardian on Tuesday that Bezos was cooperating with \u201cinvestigations\u201d. He declined to comment on the new claims about the crown prince\u2019s alleged personal involvement in the hack. Both Saudi Arabia and American Media Inc (AMI), which owned the National Enquirer, have denied the kingdom was involved in the publication of the Bezos story.",

But that\u2019s not stopped the club\u2019s co-owner, David Beckham, from dreaming big when it comes to his plans for assembling a winning team from scratch. Becks has taken on harder challenges \u2013 such as the time he stayed up till 3am to build a 4,000-piece Lego castle \u2013 so creating a competitive MLS club in a few months shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Which is why he\u2019s batting his eyelids in the direction of David Silva and Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Hot air doing the rounds suggests Ag\u00fcero might prefer to see out his career on the same continent as his son, while Silva\u2019s already said he will leave City at the end of the season and Miami\u2019s not a bad place to spend your downtime. They could be South Beach\u2019s most famous double act since Crockett and Tubbs. Mind you, the City empire includes New York City FC, so any move Stateside for either player could cause a family rift. Manchester United have had breakthrough talk with Sporting, which means Bruno Fernandes\u2019s shoulders may soon be loaded with the heavy weight of expectation that comes with being a playmaker in the club\u2019s misfiring midfield. Once \u00a355m is exchanged, Fernandes will be a Red Devil. The Portuguese playmaker could be joined by Jude Bellingham.

It is understood that it is considered credible enough for investigators to be considering a formal approach to Saudi Arabia to ask for an explanation. </p> \n<p>Callamard, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-evidence-un-report\">whose own investigation into the murder of Khashoggi</a> found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d the crown prince and other senior Saudi officials were responsible for the killing, confirmed to the Guardian she was still pursuing \u201cseveral leads\u201d into the murder, but declined to comment on the alleged Bezos link.</p> \n<p>When asked by the Guardian whether she would challenge Saudi Arabia about the new \u201chacking\u201d allegation, Callamard said she followed all UN protocols that require investigators to alert governments about forthcoming public allegations.</p> \n<p>Saudi experts \u2013 dissidents and analysts \u2013 told the Guardian they believed Bezos was probably targeted because of his ownership of the Post and its coverage of Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/10/06/read-jamal-khashoggis-columns-for-the-washington-post/\">critical columns about Mohammed bin Salman</a> and his campaign of repression against activists and intellectuals rankled the crown prince and his inner circle.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://pomed.org/team/andrew-miller/\">Andrew Miller</a>, a Middle East expert who served on the national security council under President Obama, said if Bezos had been targeted by the crown prince, it reflected the \u201cpersonality-based\u201d environment in which the crown prince operates.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe probably believed that if he got something on Bezos it could shape coverage of Saudi Arabia in the Post.

      "bodyText": "The Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos had his mobile phone \u201chacked\u201d in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had apparently been sent from the personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, sources have told the Guardian. The encrypted message from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone of the world\u2019s richest man, according to the results of a digital forensic analysis. This analysis found it \u201chighly probable\u201d that the intrusion into the phone was triggered by an infected video file sent from the account of the Saudi heir to Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post. The two men had been having a seemingly friendly WhatsApp exchange when, on 1 May of that year, the unsolicited file was sent, according to sources who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity. Large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezos\u2019s phone within hours, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Guardian has no knowledge of what was taken from the phone or how it was used. The extraordinary revelation that the future king of Saudi Arabia may have had a personal involvement in the targeting of the American founder of Amazon will send shockwaves from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It could also undermine efforts by \u201cMBS\u201d \u2013 as the crown prince is known \u2013 to lure more western investors to Saudi Arabia, where he has vowed to economically transform the kingdom even as he has overseen a crackdown on his critics and rivals. The disclosure is likely to raise difficult questions for the kingdom about the circumstances around how US tabloid the National Enquirer came to publish intimate details about Bezos\u2019s private life \u2013 including text messages \u2013 nine months later. It may also lead to renewed scrutiny about what the crown prince and his inner circle were doing in the months prior to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was killed in October 2018 \u2013 five months after the alleged \u201chack\u201d of the newspaper\u2019s owner. Saudi Arabia has previously denied it targeted Bezos\u2019s phone, and has insisted the murder of Khashoggi was the result of a \u201crogue operation\u201d. In December, a Saudi court convicted eight people of involvement in the murder after a secret trial that was criticised as a sham by human rights experts. Digital forensic experts started examining Bezos\u2019s phone following the publication last January by the National Enquirer of intimate details about his private life. The story, which included his involvement in an extramarital relationship, set off a race by his security team to uncover how the CEO\u2019s private texts were obtained by the supermarket tabloid, which was owned by American Media Inc (AMI). While AMI insisted it was tipped off about the affair by the estranged brother of Bezos\u2019s girlfriend, the investigation by the billionaire\u2019s own team found with \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the Saudis had managed to \u201caccess\u201d Bezos\u2019s phone and had \u201cgained private information\u201d about him. Bezos\u2019s head of security, Gavin de Becker, wrote in the Daily Beast last March he had provided details of his investigation to law enforcement officials, but did not publicly reveal any information on how the Saudis accessed the phone. He also described \u201cthe close relationship\u201d the Saudi crown prince had developed with David Pecker, the chief executive of the company that owned the Enquirer, in the months before the Bezos story was published. De Becker did not respond to calls and messages from the Guardian. The Guardian understands a forensic analysis of Bezos\u2019s phone, and the indications that the \u201chack\u201d began within an infected file from the crown prince\u2019s account, has been reviewed by Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the UN special rapporteur who investigates extrajudicial killings. It is understood that it is considered credible enough for investigators to be considering a formal approach to Saudi Arabia to ask for an explanation. Callamard, whose own investigation into the murder of Khashoggi found \u201ccredible evidence\u201d the crown prince and other senior Saudi officials were responsible for the killing, confirmed to the Guardian she was still pursuing \u201cseveral leads\u201d into the murder, but declined to comment on the alleged Bezos link. When asked by the Guardian whether she would challenge Saudi Arabia about the new \u201chacking\u201d allegation, Callamard said she followed all UN protocols that require investigators to alert governments about forthcoming public allegations. Saudi experts \u2013 dissidents and analysts \u2013 told the Guardian they believed Bezos was probably targeted because of his ownership of the Post and its coverage of Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi\u2019s critical columns about Mohammed bin Salman and his campaign of repression against activists and intellectuals rankled the crown prince and his inner circle. Andrew Miller, a Middle East expert who served on the national security council under President Obama, said if Bezos had been targeted by the crown prince, it reflected the \u201cpersonality-based\u201d environment in which the crown prince operates. \u201cHe probably believed that if he got something on Bezos it could shape coverage of Saudi Arabia in the Post. It is clear that the Saudis have no real boundaries or limits in terms of what they are prepared to do in order to protect and advance MBS, whether it is going after the head of one of the largest companies in the world or a dissident who is on their own.\u201d The possibility that the head of one of America\u2019s leading companies was targeted by Saudi Arabia could pose a dilemma for the White House. Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner have maintained close ties with the crown prince despite a US intelligence finding \u2013 reportedly with a medium\u2013to\u2013high degree of certainty \u2013 that Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder. Both Saudi Arabia and AMI have denied that the kingdom was involved in the publication of the Bezos story. A lawyer for Bezos who was contacted by the Guardian said: \u201cI have no comment on this except to say that Mr Bezos is cooperating with investigations.\u201d The Guardian asked the Saudi embassy in Washington about the claims. It did not immediately return a request for comment but later said on Twitter that suggestions Saudi Arabia was responsible for the hack were \u201cabsurd\u201d.

      "body": "<p>After missing 43 games with a knee injury, New Orleans Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson is set to make his long-awaited season debut <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PelicansNBA/status/1217531943790825472\">on Wednesday night against the San Antonio Spurs</a>.</p> <p>Why are so many fans and pundits so eager to see Williamson after his long layoff? Here\u2019s a quick primer on why Williamson is one of basketball\u2019s most intriguing players.</p> <h2><strong>Why the excitement?</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek-bVyaTRE4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ek-bVyaTRE4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The 19-year-old rookie is considered by many to be the best professional basketball prospect since LeBron James. The No1 overall draft pick is listed at 6ft 6in and 284lbs with a 6ft 10in wingspan and 45 inch vertical leap \u2013 nearly two-thirds higher than the average vertical for an NBA player. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh6jg6dpFbo\">Williamson\u2019s monstrous dunks</a> became viral while he was still in high school and helped transform him into one of the most touted college prospects of all time. After enrolling at Duke for one season, he averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek-bVyaTRE4\">throwing down more huge dunks</a> \u2013 and was the consensus top player in last year\u2019s draft class.</p> <h2><strong>Why is he drawing comparisons to LeBron James?</strong></h2> <p>Comparing anyone to James, the greatest player of his era, is unfair but the chatter about Williamson\u2019s generational athleticism is legitimate. He overwhelmed opponents in college by maneuvering his 280lbs frame to box out defenders and leaping over them at the rim for contested balls. His burst makes him unstoppable in fast-break settings. If he finds open space, he\u2019s a safe bet to get close to the rim for a high-percentage shot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/29/luka-doncic-dallas-mavericks-nba-basketball\">So good, so soon: Luka Doncic\u2019s \u2018insane\u2019 rise to NBA stardom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The focus on his physical abilities may overshadow his technical skills though. Williamson\u2019s deft footwork makes him dangerous on spin moves and hook shots near the rim. While he\u2019s undersized for an interior forward or center, opposing forwards and centers will struggle to block out or overpower a strong player with elite body control. As with any rookie, Williamson is raw but his explosiveness and fluidity make him more advanced than the standard \u201cpure athlete\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>He will succeed if\u2026</strong></h2> <p>He harnesses his physical gifts into dominance on both sides of the floor. Williamson is ready to be one of the league\u2019s most explosive players, but he\u2019ll single handedly freeze opposing defenses if he can reliably hit outside jump shots and improve his passing. Even in a league that features high-flyers like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Williamson should be one of the game\u2019s best finishers when he finds open routes to the bucket.</p> <p>Defensively, he\u2019s physically equipped to lock down some of the league\u2019s most versatile players. Given the praise he\u2019s earned for his effort and attention to detail from several former teammates and coaches, it\u2019s fair to assume that he can be one of the league\u2019s best defenders within his first few seasons.</p> <h2><strong>He won\u2019t fulfill the hype if\u2026</strong></h2> <p>He struggles with shooting. Some critics focus on his lack of shooting range as his biggest hindrance, but he hit big long-range shots at Duke and <a href=\"https://stats.nba.com/articles/2019-nba-draft-profile-zion-williamson/\">compiled a diverse and efficient shot chart</a> in his lone collegiate season. His progress will hopefully mirror players such as Draymond Green and Blake Griffin, both of whom were unreliable shooters when they entered the league and have emerged as legitimate perimeter threats.</p> <p>The bigger question may involve his knees. Williamson\u2019s shoe famously exploded during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWtObstsKdE\">Duke\u2019s matchup with North Carolina</a> in February and he played just nine minutes in the NBA Summer League before missing the rest of the campaign with a bruised knee. The October meniscus injury wasn\u2019t regarded as serious, but the Pelicans took a cautious three months instead of the expected four to six weeks to \u2013 hopefully \u2013 ensure he is completely fit upon his return. The foremost concern is that he\u2019ll be a larger version of Derrick Rose \u2013 a superstar whose body <a href=\"https://clutchpoints.com/derrick-rose-a-tragic-injury-history-toppled-a-promising-career/\">couldn\u2019t contain its own explosiveness</a>.</p> <p>More philosophically, the NBA is rich with some of the world\u2019s finest athletes, many of whom will feast on the prospect of limiting a player with as much hype and as many endorsements as Williamson. He is already one of the most famous players in the NBA and signed a contract with Jordan Brand <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2019/07/23/zion-williamson-signs-multi-year-deal-with-jordan-brand/#7d8617a917e2\">worth an estimated $75m</a> before he had even played a regular season game.</p> <h2><strong>What are reasonable expectations?</strong></h2> <p>For veteran NBA fans, Williamson resembles a modern version of Hall of Fame forward Charles Barkley \u2013 a relentless physical presence with excellent finishing and rebounding skills. But the best comparison may be a more athletic Draymond Green: somebody who can defend any player on the floor, plays intelligently in the interior and has the motor to exhaust his opponents. Williamson doesn\u2019t have Green\u2019s perimeter savvy or passing skills, but he may do after a few years\u2019 experience. This year, look for Williamson\u2019s style to resemble those of Knicks forward Julius Randle: a skilled forward capable of scoring from most spots on the floor with the explosiveness to bait defenders and open space for his teammates.</p> <p>Whatever Williamson ends up producing over the second half of this season, there will be plenty of curious viewers watching the Pelicans.</p> <h2>And if the basketball doesn\u2019t work out \u2026</h2> <p>He is a very talented poet. \u201cI began making suggestions. Then all he did was write poems ... and the deeper we got into the year, the more complicated and sophisticated they became,\u201d one of his high-school teachers, Bill Pell, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/26406892/the-education-zion-williamson\">told ESPN last year</a>. \u201cThey were remarkable.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "After missing 43 games with a knee injury, New Orleans Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson is set to make his long-awaited season debut on Wednesday night against the San Antonio Spurs. Why are so many fans and pundits so eager to see Williamson after his long layoff? Here\u2019s a quick primer on why Williamson is one of basketball\u2019s most intriguing players. Why the excitement? The 19-year-old rookie is considered by many to be the best professional basketball prospect since LeBron James. The No1 overall draft pick is listed at 6ft 6in and 284lbs with a 6ft 10in wingspan and 45 inch vertical leap \u2013 nearly two-thirds higher than the average vertical for an NBA player. Williamson\u2019s monstrous dunks became viral while he was still in high school and helped transform him into one of the most touted college prospects of all time. After enrolling at Duke for one season, he averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game \u2013 throwing down more huge dunks \u2013 and was the consensus top player in last year\u2019s draft class. Why is he drawing comparisons to LeBron James? Comparing anyone to James, the greatest player of his era, is unfair but the chatter about Williamson\u2019s generational athleticism is legitimate. He overwhelmed opponents in college by maneuvering his 280lbs frame to box out defenders and leaping over them at the rim for contested balls. His burst makes him unstoppable in fast-break settings. If he finds open space, he\u2019s a safe bet to get close to the rim for a high-percentage shot. The focus on his physical abilities may overshadow his technical skills though. Williamson\u2019s deft footwork makes him dangerous on spin moves and hook shots near the rim. While he\u2019s undersized for an interior forward or center, opposing forwards and centers will struggle to block out or overpower a strong player with elite body control. As with any rookie, Williamson is raw but his explosiveness and fluidity make him more advanced than the standard \u201cpure athlete\u201d. He will succeed if\u2026 He harnesses his physical gifts into dominance on both sides of the floor. Williamson is ready to be one of the league\u2019s most explosive players, but he\u2019ll single handedly freeze opposing defenses if he can reliably hit outside jump shots and improve his passing. Even in a league that features high-flyers like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Williamson should be one of the game\u2019s best finishers when he finds open routes to the bucket. Defensively, he\u2019s physically equipped to lock down some of the league\u2019s most versatile players. Given the praise he\u2019s earned for his effort and attention to detail from several former teammates and coaches, it\u2019s fair to assume that he can be one of the league\u2019s best defenders within his first few seasons. He won\u2019t fulfill the hype if\u2026 He struggles with shooting. Some critics focus on his lack of shooting range as his biggest hindrance, but he hit big long-range shots at Duke and compiled a diverse and efficient shot chart in his lone collegiate season. His progress will hopefully mirror players such as Draymond Green and Blake Griffin, both of whom were unreliable shooters when they entered the league and have emerged as legitimate perimeter threats. The bigger question may involve his knees. Williamson\u2019s shoe famously exploded during Duke\u2019s matchup with North Carolina in February and he played just nine minutes in the NBA Summer League before missing the rest of the campaign with a bruised knee. The October meniscus injury wasn\u2019t regarded as serious, but the Pelicans took a cautious three months instead of the expected four to six weeks to \u2013 hopefully \u2013 ensure he is completely fit upon his return. The foremost concern is that he\u2019ll be a larger version of Derrick Rose \u2013 a superstar whose body couldn\u2019t contain its own explosiveness. More philosophically, the NBA is rich with some of the world\u2019s finest athletes, many of whom will feast on the prospect of limiting a player with as much hype and as many endorsements as Williamson. He is already one of the most famous players in the NBA and signed a contract with Jordan Brand worth an estimated $75m before he had even played a regular season game. What are reasonable expectations? For veteran NBA fans, Williamson resembles a modern version of Hall of Fame forward Charles Barkley \u2013 a relentless physical presence with excellent finishing and rebounding skills. But the best comparison may be a more athletic Draymond Green: somebody who can defend any player on the floor, plays intelligently in the interior and has the motor to exhaust his opponents. Williamson doesn\u2019t have Green\u2019s perimeter savvy or passing skills, but he may do after a few years\u2019 experience. This year, look for Williamson\u2019s style to resemble those of Knicks forward Julius Randle: a skilled forward capable of scoring from most spots on the floor with the explosiveness to bait defenders and open space for his teammates. Whatever Williamson ends up producing over the second half of this season, there will be plenty of curious viewers watching the Pelicans. And if the basketball doesn\u2019t work out \u2026 He is a very talented poet. \u201cI began making suggestions. Then all he did was write poems ... and the deeper we got into the year, the more complicated and sophisticated they became,\u201d one of his high-school teachers, Bill Pell, told ESPN last year. \u201cThey were remarkable.\u201d",

Johnson became acting CEO in July after Dr Leana Wen was forced out, a short and rocky tenure in a critical election year. \u201cI\u2019ve had a tremendous opportunity to be able to fly around the country and meet and sit with so many of our staff\u2026 and engage with many of our patients as well,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like sitting on the plane next to people [to hear] about how Planned Parenthood was there, and I know that is both the nexus of the wonderful experience that they\u2019ve had, and how hard multiple staff worked to make that experience what it is.\u201d In all the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d, it\u2019s those conversations that keep her optimistic. \u201cI feel incredibly good about going into this year.\u201d",

Most evidence in support of doll therapy is anecdotal, though there is a growing research base. A study completed in 2007 <a href=\"http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/clinical-zones/mental-health/using-dolls-to-alter-behaviour-in-patients-with-dementia/201683.article\">found </a><a href=\"http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/clinical-zones/mental-health/using-dolls-to-alter-behaviour-in-patients-with-dementia/201683.article\"> it was an effective approach in caring for older people with dementia</a>.

      "bodyText": "Brenda Madden, 94, sits in an armchair in a care home in Abertillery in south Wales, holding a baby doll that appears to breathe and have a heartbeat. She has advanced dementia and can no longer speak, but looks peaceful as she cradles the doll and bends down to kiss it as if it were one of her own children. \u201cAt first it was a bit of a shock,\u201d says her daughter, Sandra. \u201cIt was a bit upsetting because she\u2019s gone back in time to when we were kids.\u201d Her brother Barry agrees but can now see the benefits of doll therapy for his mother. \u201cShe\u2019s always loved kids. She\u2019s got four children, 11 grandchildren and four or five great-grandchildren. We can see how much she loves [the doll] and we\u2019ve accepted it.\u201d Dawn Chivers, manager of Cwrt Mytton care home, has also seen how doll therapy has had an impact on Brenda. She explains: \u201cThe majority of residents think the dolls are real. I just see the benefits. It\u2019s evident to see Brenda is content with the baby. It gives her reassurance, beyond anything we can do sometimes.\u201d Doll therapy involves offering dolls to people living with dementia with the aim of improving their comfort, engagement and quality of life. Most evidence in support of doll therapy is anecdotal, though there is a growing research base. A study completed in 2007 found it was an effective approach in caring for older people with dementia. And Australian research in 2019 cited by the Social Care Institute for Excellence concluded that doll therapy can provide some residents with enjoyment and purposeful engagement. Doll therapy in Cwrt Mytton care home started when residents\u2019 grandchildren would bring in their dolls and there seemed to be a natural affinity, adds Chivers. In late 2018, the care home received 10 new dolls from Monmouthshire county council as part of a plan to help people with dementia. Sarah Turvey-Barber, the council\u2019s strategic and sustainable living manager, commissioned the dolls and recognises that dementia is a challenge for health and social care services in the area.

She purchased 50 and they have been shared around other organisations in Gwent. The dolls \u2013 which cost between \u00a3165 and \u00a3185 each and were found on Amazon \u2013 weigh the same as a baby; the chest rises and falls as if it were breathing, there is a palpable heartbeat and some make gurgling noises. \u201cInitially the feedback [about the dolls] was brilliant,\u201d says Turvey-Barber. \u201cNursing staff said it was making such a difference, making people feel calmer and helping them to understand and engage in conversations.\u201d She went to a carers group herself and remembers: \u201cA woman started to interact with me and called the baby a name. Her husband said it was the most verbal she had been in a while. It was incredibly moving.\u201d Turvey-Barber has plans to expand the project into other areas of health and social care. There have been conversations with the Welsh ambulance service around whether it might be able to use them and there are plans to use them when doing assessments and disability checks, as well as in people\u2019s homes. \u201cI think we\u2019ve only just tickled what we could use them for.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has referred former sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s handling of the $100m sports grants program to his department to investigate whether ministerial standards were breached. In a statement on Wednesday, Morrison revealed that last Friday he referred the auditor general\u2019s scathing report into the $100m community sport infrastructure grant program to the department of the prime minister and cabinet \u201cfor advice in relation to any actions in the application of the statement of ministerial standard\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister is awaiting the secretary\u2019s advice and will continue to follow due process,\u201d the statement said. Earlier, the attorney general Christian Porter defended McKenzie after the revelation she approved a $36,000 grant to a shooting club of which she is a member, claiming being a \u201cpaper member\u201d of a club raises no probity issue. Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday that more than $1m in sports grants was handed to nine clubs that boast senior Coalition MPs as members or patrons, including the $35,980 grant to the Wangaratta Clay Target Club, which is not listed on McKenzie\u2019s register of interests. McKenzie told the Age that since her membership of the club was a \u201cgift\u201d in January 2019 and valued at less than $300 a declaration to the Senate was \u201cunnecessary\u201d. Morrison confirmed that \u201cthe matters raised in the media today have also been referred\u201d. Earlier on 6PR Radio, Porter clarified that he is \u201cnot investigating or reviewing\u201d the community sport infrastructure grant program, but rather has sought legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor about McKenzie\u2019s authority to approve grants. The Australian National Audit Office said that it was \u201cnot evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was\u201d for McKenzie to approve grants, but Porter suggested the minister may have had an \u201coverarching\u201d ability to direct Sport Australia. On Wednesday Anthony Albanese renewed Labor\u2019s calls for McKenzie to resign. The shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for McKenzie\u2019s conduct, and accused Scott Morrison of being \u201cup to his neck in it\u201d because he refused to sack her. Before the latest revelation, McKenzie\u2019s position had been backed by Morrison, the Liberal deputy leader, Josh Frydenberg, and Nationals colleague David Littleproud. Porter said he \u201cdid not know the individual circumstances\u201d but noted it is \u201cnot unusual for a local member to be a member or patron of a club that might get a grant\u201d. \u201cIn this case of course the local member was also a minister \u2013 as to the procedures of that particular grant I don\u2019t have the information to comment. \u201cThe situations are different depending on your level of involvement \u2013 being a mere patron or a paper member of a club is different from having a very active role in a club.\u201d Porter said it was \u201cfair\u201d of the auditor general to advise better conflict of interest policies, but noted that recommendation was directed at Sport Australia. Porter acknowledged that McKenzie had \u201cbrought in considerations that were different\u201d to Sport Australia, but argued ministers can exercise \u201cexecutive authority\u201d to depart from recommendations and take a \u201cslightly different\u201d view in selecting from eligible projects. The auditor general\u2019s report found that 70% of projects approved by McKenzie in the second round in March 2019 were not recommended by Sport Australia, rising to 73% in the third round in April 2019. Porter then argued the sports grants did not constitute \u201crorts\u201d or \u201cpork barrelling\u201d because they did not favour one side of politics over the other, with more Labor seats awarded grants than if McKenzie had not intervened. \u201cHaving ministerial authority and oversight on those things is completely fair and reasonable \u2013 and all of these projects were deemed to be eligible.\u201d Porter said there was a \u201cclear distinction\u201d between McKenzie deciding her own ranking of projects and a minister awarding a grant to an ineligible project, as he said occurred in the Ros Kelly affair, without proper record keeping. Porter said he did not believe there was \u201csomething here that requires some further level of attention in terms of probity \u2026 based on what I\u2019ve seen\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday, the Liberal MP Tim Wilson told Sky News it was \u201cultimately a decision for the National party about who is deputy leader\u201d but said it was up to McKenzie how to allocate funding between eligible projects. ABC News Breakfast revealed that Somers Yacht Club received $172,606 and its treasurer Tim Brock had thanked the health minister Greg Hunt\u2019s office for \u201cwork behind the scenes\u201d to help win the grant. \u201cWhat we do is \u2013 like all MPs \u2013 and what all MPs should be doing is fighting for and advocating for projects within their electorate,\u201d Hunt said. Hunt said MPs should support worthy projects by writing letters of support and \u201cmaking the case for them\u201d. McKenzie is likely to face renewed scrutiny when parliament resumes in February, with minor parties the Greens, Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation and Centre Alliance offering to support a Senate inquiry into the program.",

According to the CWA, it was the last fatality since the union began pushing to include <a href=\"https://cwa-union.org/national-issues/health-and-safety/health-and-safety-fact-sheets/temperature-extremes-and-workplace\">heat stress workplace standards</a> in collective bargaining agreements.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately these catastrophic events have to occur to get employer\u2019s adequate attention,\u201d said David LeGrande, now retired Occupational Safety &amp; Health Director for the CWA.

A dangerous heat day is defined as one in which the heat index, accounting for heat and humidity, exceeds 104F (40C).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/dec/06/killer-heat-us-cities-plans-for-coming-heatwaves-fail-to-protect-vulnerable\">Killer heat: US cities' plans for coming heatwaves fail to protect vulnerable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cClimate change means it\u2019s only getting hotter, and workers are at exposure for all kinds of excessive heat,\u201d Judy Chu, a Democratic congresswoman from California, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Earlier this year, she introduced the <a href=\"https://trackbill.com/bill/us-congress-house-bill-3668-asuncion-valdivia-heat-illness-and-fatality-prevention-act-of-2019/1762780/\">Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act of 2019</a>, which would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) to issue and enforce standards to protect workers from heat-related risks on the job.</p> <p>Chu said: \u201cIt all started when I was in the California state assembly. The United Farm Workers came to me about the situation with Asuncion Valdivia. He was a farmworker picking grapes for 10 hours straight when he collapsed in 105F temperatures.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of having any kind of proper treatment for him, a supervisor told his son to take him home. They didn\u2019t even call an ambulance. On the way home, the son saw his father foam at the mouth, fall over and die. So the son had to watch his father die of a preventable heat stroke.\u201d</p> <p>In the California state assembly, Chu authored a bill for the California division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/Osha) to enforce heat standard protections for outdoor workers, which <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-aug-03-me-farmworkers3-story.html\">passed </a>in 2005, making California the first state in the US to mandate employers to provide workers with periods of rest, shade and adequate water while doing outdoor work.</p> <p>In 2015, the state of California settled two lawsuits brought by the United Farm Workers.</p> <p>\u201cThose called for greater protections for all outdoor workers in high heat temperatures and also called for establishing a mechanism where farmworkers can call us directly to report complaints to CalL/Osha,\u201d said Marichel Meija, national field coordinator for the United Farm Workers Foundation. \u201cWe now have regular communications with Cal/Osha to ensure situations are investigated.\u201d</p> <p>Now the United Farm Workers and several other organizations are <a href=\"https://ufw.org/as-climate-heats-up-public-calls-for-worker-protections-from-heat/\">pushing</a> for similar standards to be enforced across the US. <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/migration/180717_petition_to_osha_on_heat_stress-signed_final_0.pdf\">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, between 1992 and 2016, 783 workers in the US died and more than 69,000 workers suffered serious injuries due to heat exposure on the job, though labor advocates argue the real numbers are even higher due to widespread under-reporting and employers misclassifying worker deaths as non-work-related.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had issues where workers are not classified as dying because of their job when we know that is the case,\u201d said Rebecca Reindel, senior safety and health specialist at the AFL-CIO union federation. \u201cWith heat you\u2019re running into a lot of vulnerable workers, immigrant workers, where employers will pass it off, say something else happened, and no one is following up and that person\u2019s family don\u2019t know their rights to get it classified as a workplace fatality.\u201d</p> <h2>Heat inspections decreasing under Trump administration</h2> <p>As workers in the US are facing workplace environments that are getting hotter, and experiencing extreme temperatures more frequently, critics say the Trump administration has refused to address the problem. In an April 2019 <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/DOTJ2019Fnb_1.pdf\">report</a>, the AFL-CIO noted federal Osha\u2019s inspections related to heat declined by 49% under the Trump administration\u2019s first two fiscal years in office.</p> <p>More than 130 organizations <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/migration/trump-leaves-workers-behind-report.pdf\">petitioned </a>Osha in 2018 to develop federal heat standards, with Chu prompted by the agency\u2019s inaction to introduce legislation in Congress.</p> <p>\u201cThis bill would have such a high impact for so many workers forced to work every day in conditions they can\u2019t control,\u201d said Reindel of the AFL-CIO union federation. \u201cIt\u2019s a structure to identify the hazards. These programs are really good because workers are part of the process, and when workers are part of the process that\u2019s when you get to the root of the problem.\u201d</p> <p>According to an Osha spokesperson, the agency launches a heat awareness campaign annually the Friday before Memorial Day, has been educating employers and workers about the dangers of working in heat since 2011, and in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0606-niosh-osha-apps.html\">helped</a> update an app for heat safety. The agency did not respond to requests for comment on <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/news/as-climate-heats-up-government-must-protect-workers-from-heat/\">petitions</a> calling the agency to enact federal heat safety standards.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was more than 100F (38C) in the attic where telephone technician Brent Robinson was working. The 55-year-old, who had worked for 30 years at Verizon, was installing a phone service for a residential customer in Rancho Cucamonga, 40 miles east of Los Angeles in southern California. He had been out for days sick earlier in the week. After he finished the job in Rancho Cucamonga, he collapsed in the car park of a grocery store where he had gone for a cool drink; paramedics could not revive him. Robinson, who died in 2011, is one of dozens of workers who die every year because of heat exposure. In 2018, 60 workers died due to temperature extremes, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data on workplace fatalities. Though the climate crisis is creating conditions where workers are facing hotter temperatures on a more frequent basis, there are no federal safety protections for workers in extreme temperatures, and only three states, California, Washington and Minnesota, have heat stress workplace protection standards. The fatality was one of several over that decade suffered by telecommunications technicians on the job. According to the CWA, it was the last fatality since the union began pushing to include heat stress workplace standards in collective bargaining agreements. \u201cUnfortunately these catastrophic events have to occur to get employer\u2019s adequate attention,\u201d said David LeGrande, now retired Occupational Safety &amp; Health Director for the CWA. The CWA represented Robinson at Verizon at the time of the incident, and LeGrande was one of the leads involved with the union\u2019s investigation of Robinson\u2019s death. LeGrande said: \u201cWe are, to my knowledge, the first union that has negotiated protective language with employers. That has been carried out on a national basis.\u201d Verizon did not respond to requests for comment. More heat days According to projections conducted by the not-for-profit organization Climate Central, the number of dangerous heat days for 133 US cities, will increase from 20 a year on average in 2000 to 58 in 2050. A dangerous heat day is defined as one in which the heat index, accounting for heat and humidity, exceeds 104F (40C). \u201cClimate change means it\u2019s only getting hotter, and workers are at exposure for all kinds of excessive heat,\u201d Judy Chu, a Democratic congresswoman from California, told the Guardian. Earlier this year, she introduced the Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act of 2019, which would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) to issue and enforce standards to protect workers from heat-related risks on the job. Chu said: \u201cIt all started when I was in the California state assembly. The United Farm Workers came to me about the situation with Asuncion Valdivia. He was a farmworker picking grapes for 10 hours straight when he collapsed in 105F temperatures. \u201cInstead of having any kind of proper treatment for him, a supervisor told his son to take him home. They didn\u2019t even call an ambulance. On the way home, the son saw his father foam at the mouth, fall over and die. So the son had to watch his father die of a preventable heat stroke.\u201d In the California state assembly, Chu authored a bill for the California division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/Osha) to enforce heat standard protections for outdoor workers, which passed in 2005, making California the first state in the US to mandate employers to provide workers with periods of rest, shade and adequate water while doing outdoor work. In 2015, the state of California settled two lawsuits brought by the United Farm Workers. \u201cThose called for greater protections for all outdoor workers in high heat temperatures and also called for establishing a mechanism where farmworkers can call us directly to report complaints to CalL/Osha,\u201d said Marichel Meija, national field coordinator for the United Farm Workers Foundation. \u201cWe now have regular communications with Cal/Osha to ensure situations are investigated.\u201d Now the United Farm Workers and several other organizations are pushing for similar standards to be enforced across the US. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1992 and 2016, 783 workers in the US died and more than 69,000 workers suffered serious injuries due to heat exposure on the job, though labor advocates argue the real numbers are even higher due to widespread under-reporting and employers misclassifying worker deaths as non-work-related. \u201cWe\u2019ve had issues where workers are not classified as dying because of their job when we know that is the case,\u201d said Rebecca Reindel, senior safety and health specialist at the AFL-CIO union federation. \u201cWith heat you\u2019re running into a lot of vulnerable workers, immigrant workers, where employers will pass it off, say something else happened, and no one is following up and that person\u2019s family don\u2019t know their rights to get it classified as a workplace fatality.\u201d Heat inspections decreasing under Trump administration As workers in the US are facing workplace environments that are getting hotter, and experiencing extreme temperatures more frequently, critics say the Trump administration has refused to address the problem. In an April 2019 report, the AFL-CIO noted federal Osha\u2019s inspections related to heat declined by 49% under the Trump administration\u2019s first two fiscal years in office. More than 130 organizations petitioned Osha in 2018 to develop federal heat standards, with Chu prompted by the agency\u2019s inaction to introduce legislation in Congress. \u201cThis bill would have such a high impact for so many workers forced to work every day in conditions they can\u2019t control,\u201d said Reindel of the AFL-CIO union federation. \u201cIt\u2019s a structure to identify the hazards. These programs are really good because workers are part of the process, and when workers are part of the process that\u2019s when you get to the root of the problem.\u201d According to an Osha spokesperson, the agency launches a heat awareness campaign annually the Friday before Memorial Day, has been educating employers and workers about the dangers of working in heat since 2011, and in 2017 helped update an app for heat safety. The agency did not respond to requests for comment on petitions calling the agency to enact federal heat safety standards.",

      "bodyText": "Live impeachment reporting continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Live coverage of the impeachment trial continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Over the course of nearly 13 hours, House impeachment managers clashed with White House lawyers as they debated the rules that will govern the impeachment trial. Republican senators voted to kill 11 amendments to the trial rules brought forth by the Democrats, thwarting multiple attempts to subpoena documents and witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton. House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler, who is one of the impeachment managers, accused Republicans of \u201cvoting for a coverup\u201d by rejecting attempts to acquire more evidence. Voting along party lines, Republicans pushed through the rules as proposed by Senate leader Mitch McConnell, unamended. McConnell did change the rules a bit since he first revealed them, allowing for each side to take three days, rather than two, to present their cases. He also allowed the House\u2019s impeachment evidence to be admitted into the Senate record. Throughout, Chief Justice John Roberts played a procedural role \u2014 piping up just once to admonish both sides for a lack of civil discourse. \u201cI do think that those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,\u201d he said. As the hours wore on, lawmakers looked visibly worn out \u2014 a couple of senators appeared to nod off. The trial is adjourned until Wednesday at 1pm ET, when House managers will present their case. Guardian reporters will be back tomorrow with more live updates from the impeachment trial. In the meantime, catch up on our coverage so far: Review the case against Trump. Meet the Republican senators who could cross party lines. Relive the drama that was, and wasn\u2019t. After 13 hours of debate, Republican senators pushed through the organizing resolution for the impeachment proposed by Mitch McConnell, without any of the 11 amendments proposed by Democrats. The trial is now adjourned until 1pm ET on Wednesday. The final amendment proposed by minority leader Chuck Schumer would allow Chief Justice John Roberts \u2014 as a neutral party \u2014 to decide whether to allow motions to subpoena witnesses or documents. Finally, the senators are voting on the organizing resolution for the impeachment trial, as proposed by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Before the vote, McConnell addressed Chief Justice John Roberts: \u201cWe want to thank you for your patience,\u201d he said. \u201cComes with the job,\u201d Roberts responded. The Office of Management and Budget responded to a FOIA request by releasing a trove of documents on military aid to Ukraine. The watchdog organization made \u201crequest for directives and communications that may relate to any effort to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate one of President Trump\u2019s political opponents as part of an effort to give the president an electoral advantage,\u201d it said. Senators kill the 10th Democratic amendment to allow for additional time to file responses to motions. The rules provide each side two hours. Schumer\u2019s amendment asked for 24. The debate on this one was very short \u2014 things are speeding up. As expected, Democrats\u2019 eighth amendment, like all the others, was voted down, along party lines. Republicans blocked the Democratic push to subpoena John Bolton. The former national security advisor could still testify if a majority of senators vote to subpoena his testimony later. They also killed a ninth amendment, which would force a Senate vote on any motion to subpoena witnesses and documents. The current rules require a procedural vote that must pass before a vote on subpoenas. In this vote, there was one Republican defector: Senator Susan Collins. John Roberts took an opportunity to rebuke both House managers and the White House counsel \u201cin equal terms\u201d for their language and personal attacks. He asked everyone to \u201cavoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse\u201d. Roberts also offered a fun fact. In 1905, a Senator objected to a manager using the word \u201cpettifogging\u201d and the presiding officer found that the world \u201cought not to be used\u201d, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to aspire to that high a standard, but I do think those addressing the senate should remember where they are,\u201d Roberts added. In response, White House lawyer Jay Sekulow raised his voice and banged the podium for emphasis. He accused Nadler of trying to \u201cshred Constitution on the floor of the floor of the Senate\u201d by questioning Donald Trump\u2019s executive privilege claim. Pat Cipollone called the impeachment a \u201cfarce\u201d. \u201cMister Nadler, you owe an apology to the President of the United States and his family, you owe an apology to the Senate, but most of all you owe an apology to the American people,\u201d he said. Nadler: \u2018Only guilty people try to hide the evidence\u2019 Arguing for a subpoena of John Bolton, Jerrold Nadler accused senators quashing against Democrats\u2019 attempts to bring forth more witnesses of \u201cvoting for a coverup\u201d. \u201cVoting to deny witnesses and obviously a treacherous vote,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cA vote against an honest consideration of the evidence against the President. A vote against an honest trial. A vote against the United States.\u201d Nadler also said that Trump\u2019s supporters want to block Bolton\u2019s testimony are doing so because \u201cthey know he knows too much\u201d. \u201cOnly guilty people try to hide evidence,\u201d Nadler said. Seventh Democratic amendment tabled, along party lines. And we move on to yet the next amendment... to subpoena John Bolton. Each side gets an hour to make their case. This time, Jerrold Nadler, the representative from New York and House Judiciary chair, is arguing the Democrats\u2019 case. Bolton, a former national security advisor, recently said he is willing to testify after resisting doing so during the impeachment inquiry. Donald Trump has said he\u2019ll block Bolton, invoking executive privilege. Democrats believe that Bolton has firsthand information about the president\u2019s efforts to secure a quid pro quo with the government of Ukraine. Three Republican senators \u2014 Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins \u2014 have indicated they might want to hear from Bolton. But it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll vote to approve the amendment to subpoena Bolton today. Collins said in a statement today that she\u2019ll consider witnesses after hearing the case, and answers to senators\u2019 questions. Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial all day, will have to be up early tomorrow morning for his day job. At 10 am Eastern Time, he\u2019s expected to hear arguments in a Supreme Court case to decide whether publicly funded religious education is constitutional. Even today, his very long day started at the Supreme Court, where he oversaw oral arguments in two cases before heading to the Senate. The constitution requires that the chief justice \u201cshall preside\u201d over an impeachment trial of a president. In practice, the role has mostly been ceremonial. Previously, chief justices have left it to a Senate parliamentarian to manage the process. Roberts could take a more hands-on approach, and compel witnesses to testify \u2014 but that\u2019s unlikely to happen. So far, Roberts\u2019 role in the Senate trial has been to ask White House lawyers and impeachment managers to speak, in turn, and grant motions to take recess as needed. It\u2019s close to midnight in Washington DC, and the senators are taking a 5-minute break. Each of Chuck Schumer\u2019s amendments so far have been voted down along party lines, 53-47. Schumer has proposed yet another amendment, \u201cto prevent the selective admission of evidence and to provide for appropriate handling of classified and confidential materials\u201d. The amendment would require each side to provide the other any additional evidence that is gathered via a subpoena. When he asked for it to be read out loud before the break, he reassured everyone, \u201cIt\u2019s short.\u201d What the cameras aren\u2019t showing us The video feed of the trial is controlled by the Senate Recording Studio. C-SPAN asked Mitch McConnell for permission to bring in its own cameras because the existing setup \u201cprovides a restricted view of Senate floor debates\u201d, but the Senate majority leader did not respond, the New Yorker reports. As a result, people at home can\u2019t catch a glimpse of Senator Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s bright yellow boots, or hear what lawmakers are whispering to each other in between presentations. We can\u2019t see the expression on Lisa Murkowski\u2019s face or snoop on what Marco Rubio is scribbling in his notebook. TV camera crews are also restricted outside the Senate chamber \u2014 reporters aren\u2019t allowed to approach senators directly outside. Some news organizations have commissioned courtroom sketch artists to capture what the cameras aren\u2019t showing. Like all the other Democratic efforts to subpoena more evidence, it was voted down along party lines \u2014 53-47. Minority leader Chuck Schumer has moved right on, and introduced a sixth amendment, to subpoena testimony by Robert Blair, an aide to Mick Mulvaney, and Michael Duffey, and Office of Management and Budget official. The Democrats\u2019 fifth amendment today is to subpoena documents from the Department of Defense. There will be two hours of debate on this impeachment as well, and it\u2019s unclear how late the trial will go tonight. Read The Guardian\u2019s recap of the trial so far: In four consecutive votes split precisely on party lines, the Senate voted down Democratic proposals to subpoena the testimony of the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and to subpoena documents and records from the White House, the state department and the budget office relevant to an alleged scheme by Trump to twist the powers of the presidency to extract personal political favors from Ukraine. Each of the proposed subpoenas was defeated by a 53-47 vote. Democrats accused Republicans of failing to commit to a fair impeachment trial and of engaging in a \u201ccover-up\u201d of misconduct by the president. \u201cThe president is engaged in this cover-up because he is guilty, and he knows it,\u201d said Representative Val Demings of Florida, one of the impeachment prosecutors, referred to as \u201cmanagers\u201d, in the case. A further opportunity for the senators to demand documents or witnesses was anticipated in the weeks ahead. But Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, urged the senators to issue subpoenas before an allotted period for senators to question the legal teams. \u201cYou should want to see these documents,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cYou should want to know what these private emails and text messages have to say. \u201cThe American people want a fair trial,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut a great many Americans don\u2019t believe that will happen. Let\u2019s prove them wrong.\u201d Report: Senate Democrats are privately considering allowing Republicans to call Hunter Biden as a witness, in exchange for testimony from a key Trump administration official. Though Democrats have publicly dismissed Republicans\u2019 calls to subpoena Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter, privately, some senators and aides considering making an unusual deal. They\u2019re willing to call in one of the Bidens if Republicans agree to subpoena national security advisor John Bolton, or another administration official with firsthand knowledge of the Ukraine controversy, the Washington Post reports: The discussions about the Bidens are being closely held, and the issue is fraught for Democrats, due to the differing levels of support for Biden in a chamber stocked with presidential candidates and the clashing views on impeachment strategy. In private conversations in recent days, there has been much loathing of the Republicans\u2019 spotlight on the Bidens among Senate Democrats, but also a fear that unless a witness deal is eventually struck, the trial could proceed without witnesses, according to party officials and Senate aides. That predicament has led to discussions about whether, down the line, Hunter Biden or Joe Biden should be considered as part of a witness proposal. But there is hesitancy to raise the issue publicly until Senate Democratic leaders signal interest, the officials and aides said. For the fourth time today, senators voted to kill a Democratic amendment to the impeachment trial resolution, deciding against calling Mick Mulvaney as a witness. In October, Mulvaney admitted that Donald Trump froze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in part to pressure Ukranian officials into investigating Democrats. Almost immediately, he denied it. Senate leader Mitch McConnell asked the Democrats to \u201cstack\u201d their amendments. Chuck Schumer refused, but said he\u2019d be opening to having some of the votes tomorrow. \u201cThere will be a good number of votes. There\u2019s no reason we have to do them tonight,\u201d Schumer said. Addressing the Democratic senators running for president, White House lawyer Pat Cipollone said the whole impeachment process was about \u201cremoving\u201d Donald Trump from the 2020 ballot. This wasn\u2019t the first time Cipollone singled out the 2020 candidates. Earlier, he suggested that Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennett were sour they couldn\u2019t campaign this week. \u201c Some of you are upset because you should be in Iowa right now,\u201d he said. Klobuchar responded by saying she\u2019s able to \u201cdo two things at once\u201d. The first day of the trial has been far less dramatic than expected. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith fills in what the Senate cameras aren\u2019t showing: This moment had been much hyped by cable TV but viewers hoping for the political equivalent of the OJ Simpson trial were in for a disappointment. There was no prisoner in the dock; Trump is thousands of miles away in Davos. This was reality TV without the reality TV president. There was, however, the California Democrat Adam Schiff, the lead House manager in the impeachment trial, who once wrote a screenplay for a Hollywood crime thriller. He was not quite Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men or Tom Cruise in A Few Good Men, but he did put Republicans on the spot over their pledge on oath to be impartial jurors. \u201cThe American people want a fair trial. They want to believe their system of government is still capable of rising to the occasion,\u201d Schiff entreated. \u201cThey want to believe we can rise above party and do what\u2019s best for the country, but a great many Americans don\u2019t believe that will happen. Let\u2019s prove them wrong. Let\u2019s prove them wrong!\u201d In the Hollywood version, the chamber erupted in applause, heavenly horns played and a solitary tear trickled down McConnell\u2019s face. In the Washington version, however, Republicans sat or slouched expressionless or studied papers on their desks, while McConnell fixed Schiff with a death stare as if intent on turning him to stone. The trial has resumed after a 30-minute dinner break. Hakeem Jeffries, one of the House impeachment managers, is now making the case to subpoena Mick Mulvaney. The congressman from New York said Donald Trump makes Richard Nixon \u201clook like a choir boy\u201d. Trump is \u201cpersonally responsible for depriving the Senate of information important to consider in this trial\u201d, Jeffries said, referring to the president\u2019s efforts to block House investigators from accessing documents and witnesses throughout the impeachment inquiry. \u201cEvidence matters. And the truth matters,\u201d Jeffries said. But Republicans have voted down multiple Democratic efforts to subpoena more evidence. The trial, writes the Guardian\u2019s David Smith, is testing conscience of the Republican party. A motion to subpoena documents related to the suspension of military aid to Ukraine from the Office of Management and Budget has been tabled, with a 53-47 vote along party lines. This is the third amendment brought by the minority leader Chuck Schumer that Senate Republicans have voted down. Schumer has also introduced another amendment to subpoena Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff. The senators will address that later tonight, after taking a 30-minute recess for dinner. While the trial is ongoing, snacks are banned in the chamber, though drinks of water and milk are permitted. Both parties have two hours to debate this amendment, and then, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, indicated he\u2019ll move to table it. After a vote, the lawmakers will get a 30-minute break \u2013 which, from the looks of everyone in the chamber is much needed. Senator James Risch of Idaho appeared to nod off, according to reporters. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand seemed to rest her eyes for a bit as well. And Senator Martha McSally had a blanket on her lap. As expected, senators voted along party lines, 53-47. Minority leader Chuck Schumer has introduced a third amendment to subpoena the White House Office of Management and Budget. This one is again, expected to fail. Meanwhile, in 2020 news... Rush, a Democratic representative from Illinois, told the Chicago Sun-Times he was impressed by Bloomberg\u2019s approach to the \u201ceconomic discrimination in the black community.\u201d The congressman had endorsed Kamala Harris before she dropped out of the presidential race. To demonstrate the importance of subpoenaing the state department, Val Demings displayed text messages between the US envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and the US diplomat Bill Taylor, which were uncovered during the House impeachment inquiry. One of the messages seemed to confirm that the Trump administration was withholding military aid in order to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. The texts and other messages uncovered by House investigators make clear that there\u2019s more damaging information out there, Demings said. But the Trump administration has been blocking the release of information, claiming executive privilege. Information obtained through a Senate subpoena \u201cwould help complete our understanding of how the president\u2019s scheme unfolded in realtime\u201d, Demings said. Senators are now debating another amendment to the rules of the Senate impeachment trial from Chuck Schumer. This one involves subpoenaing the state department. Val Demings, a Democratic representative from Florida and one of the House impeachment managers, spoke in support of Schumer\u2019s amendment. State department documents \u201cwould support the conclusion that senior Ukrainian officials understood the corrupt nature of President Trump\u2019s demand and they would further expose the extent to which Secretary Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney and other senior Trump officials were aware of the president\u2019s plot and helped carry it out\u201d, she said. \u201cWe know that [the documents] are relevant, and we know the president is desperately trying to conceal them,\u201d she added. Still, the amendment is expected to fail along party lines. It\u2019s unclear how many amendments that Schumer will introduce today. Republican senator indicates she\u2019ll support a motion to subpoena witnesses Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, issued a statement indicating that she will likely support a motion to call more witnesses. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours as the Senate impeachment trial continues. Here\u2019s where the trial stands so far: In a party-line vote, Senate Republicans successfully killed the minority leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s amendment to the resolution outlining rules for the impeachment trial. The New York Democrat\u2019s amendment called for subpoenaing White House documents related to the charges against Trump. The House impeachment manager Adam Schiff argued on the Senate floor that it would be \u201cass-backwards\u201d to hold an impeachment trial and then request witness testimony. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, altered the resolution outlining rules for the impeachment trial, allowing each side to present their arguments over three days rather than two. The altered resolution also allows for automatic inclusion of evidence from the House impeachment inquiry, although senators have the chance to object. The House impeachment managers presented evidence arguing in favor of Trump\u2019s removal from office, while the president\u2019s lawyers depicted his impeachment as the result of a partisan \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. Maanvi will have more updates from the trial coming up, so stay tuned. The Senate is now taking a ten-minute recess, after which the House impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s legal team will be allowed to debate Chuck Schumer\u2019s second amendment to Mitch McConnell\u2019s impeachment trial resolution. But McConnell said he intended to propose to also table that amendment, and that motion is likely to succeed on a party-line vote, as the first motion to table did. Senate Republicans successfully killed minority leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s amendment to the resolution outlining rules for the impeachment trial, which called for subpoenaing White House documents related to the charges against Trump. Schumer is now introducing another amendment, which is aimed at subpoenaing State Department documents related to the impeachment. It will likely also fail along party lines. As expected, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has introduced a motion to table (or kill) Chuck Schumer\u2019s amendment, which calls for subpoenaeing White House documents related to Trump\u2019s impeachment charges. The motion to table is expected to pass along party lines, and Schumer will then likely introduce another amendment to McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining the rules for the impeachment trial. House impeachment manager Zoe Lofgren pushed back against arguments from Pat Philbin, deputy counsel to the president, that the House is trying to get the Senate to do its investigative job. \u201cThe House is certainly not asking the Senate to do the House\u2019s job,\u201d Lofgren said. \u201cThe House is asking the Senate to do its job.\u201d The House impeachment managers and the president\u2019s legal team continue to debate an amendment from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer calling for the White House to be subpoenaed for relevant documents. Fun fact: House impeachment manager Adam Schiff is not actually the first person to use the term \u201cass-backwards\u201d on the Senate floor. That honor appears to go to Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who used the term in 2016 to denounce a bipartisan proposal to block a military arms sale to Saudi Arabia. \u201cI think it would be pretty odd for members on the other side of the aisle who almost unanimously supported the Iranian nuclear agreement ... [to] deny a weapons sale to somebody who is in the fight with you,\u201d Graham said at the time. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about ass-backwards.\u201d Former Republican senator Jeff Flake, who declined to run for reelection in 2018 because of his opposition to Trump, was spotted in the Senate chamber as the president\u2019s impeachment trial continues. Flake wrote a Washington Post op-ed last month urging his former Republican colleagues to \u201cput country over party\u201d once the trial began: I don\u2019t envy you. You\u2019re on a big stage now. Please don\u2019t accept an alternate reality that would have us believe in things that obviously are not true, in the service of executive behavior that we never would have encouraged and a theory of executive power that we have always found abhorrent. If there ever was a time to put country over party, it is now. And by putting country over party, you might just save the Grand Old Party before it\u2019s too late. Denouncing the proposed rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, House impeachment manager Adam Schiff argued it would be \u201cass-backwards\u201d to hold a trial and then request witness testimony. House impeachment manager Zoe Lofgren has now taken the Senate floor to argue for the need to subpoena White House documents related to the charges against Trump. Lofgren, who participated in the Clinton and Nixon impeachment cases, will make history as the first woman to present arguments as a manager during an impeachment trial. The New York Times has more on Lofgren\u2019s impeachment history: She was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 when it approved articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with a White House intern. And as a young law student in 1974, she helped the committee draft its Watergate charges against President Richard M. Nixon. Now \u2014 46 years after the Nixon case \u2014 the 72-year-old lawmaker will take a high-profile role in the nation\u2019s third impeachment trial, serving as one of the managers who will prosecute the House\u2019s case against President Trump in the Senate. Amy Klobuchar, one of the Democratic senators running for president, psuhed back against a comment from White House counsel Pat Cipollone that the presidential candidates are \u201cupset\u201d to be away from the campaign trail. As Trump\u2019s impeachment trial continues on Capitol Hill, Joe Biden is holding a campaign event in Ames, Iowa, with less than two weeks to go until the state\u2019s caucuses. Two of Biden\u2019s closest rivals -- senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- have been pulled away from the campaign trial because of the impeachment trial, and Sanders has already had to cancel at least one rally because of the trial schedule. A Yahoo News reporter sitting in the trial room said Republicans appeared uncomfortable as House impeachment manager Adam Schiff made the case for Trump\u2019s removal from office. Meanwhile, some of the president\u2019s Senate allies appear to be using the recess to push back against Schiff\u2019s argument because they are not allowed access to electronic devices while they are in the trial room. Congressional reporters, who are used to relatively free rein at the Capitol to grab lawmakers for hallway interviews, are taking to social media to complain about the press restrictions enforced during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Speaking earlier today on the Senate floor, minority leader Chuck Schumer assured reporters that he would fight to protect their constitutional right to cover the proceedings. \u201cI want to assure everyone in the press that I will vociferously oppose any attempt to begin the trial unless the reporters trying to enter the gallery are seated,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cSome may not want what happens here to be public. We do.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has called for a 15-minute recess before Trump\u2019s legal team and the House impeachment managers are allowed to debate Chuck Schumer\u2019s amendement. Schumer\u2019s amendment to the impeachment trial resolution calls for the White House to be subpoenaed for documents related to the charges against Trump, so the president\u2019s lawyers will likely be forcefully pushing back against it. As promised, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has introduced an amendment to the impeachment trial resolution to suboena the White House for documents related to the allegations against Trump. Schumer would need a majority of the Republican-controlled chamber to support the measure in order to get it passed, but the potential Republican swing votes have largely said they are not ready at this point in the trial to back the proposal. While slamming Trump\u2019s impeachment on the Senate floor, White House counsel Pat Cipollone mocked the Democratic senators who are running for president. \u201cSome of you are upset because you should be in Iowa right now,\u201d Cipollone said, referring to the imminent Iowa caucuses. But the Democratic senators who are seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination -- Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- have emphasized the importance of fulfilling their constitutional duty by participating in the impeachment trial. \u201cSome things are more important than politics,\u201d Warren said during last week\u2019s debate. White House counsel Pat Cipollone falsely claimed that Republican House members who sit on the committees that led the impeachment inquiry were not allowed to attend closed-door hearings during the investigation. A staffer for Republican senator Ted Cruz posted this tweet to apparently poke fun at chamber rules barring members from carrying their cell phones into the impeachment trial. But several Capitol Hill reporters going in and out of the trial room said the Texas Republican did not appear to be actually violating the rule barring senators from carrying electronics during the proceedings. House impeachment manager Adam Schiff has yielded back the floor, and another one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, is now speaking. White House counsel Pat Cipollone only used up three minutes of his side\u2019s hour of time, so Sekulow could speak for up to 57 minutes. Sekulow accused Democrats of spearheading a baseless investigation against Trump with the partisan goal of removing him from office. It appears Trump is watching the Senate impeachment trial from Davos, where he is attending the World Economic Forum. The president advised his Twitter followers to read the \u201ctranscripts,\u201d inaccurately referring to the memos the White House released about Trump\u2019s calls with the Ukrainian president. However, the White House memo from Trump\u2019s July phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy actually showed the US president asking his Ukrainian counterpart for a \u201cfavor\u201d before going on to discuss political investigations. Presenting the House impeachment managers\u2019 argument against Mitch McConnell\u2019s impeachment trial resolution, Adam Schiff played clips of Trump that Democrats say underscore the president\u2019s abuse of power. One of Schiff\u2019s clips included Trump falsely saying in July, \u201cThen, I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president.\u201d Article II of the constitution outlines the president\u2019s \u201cexecutive power,\u201d but it does not grant the commander-in-chief unchecked power. The office of senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican whose approach to Trump\u2019s impeachment trial is being closely watched because of her tough reelection race this year, said she pushed for changes to the resolution outlining trial procedures. In another change to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s impeachment resolution, evidence from the House impeachment inquiry will be automatically added to the record unless there\u2019s an objection. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial now allows each side to have three days to present their arguments, instead of two. That change could allow the trial to wrap up around 9 p.m. ET for three consecutive days, instead of ending at around 1 a.m. ET for two days. Democrats had complained that the original schedule was meant to allow arguments to stretch into the early hours of the morning, when most Americans would not be watching the proceedings. White House counsel Pat Cipollone used his time on the Senate floor to denounce Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cWe believe that once you hear those initial presentations, the only conclusion will be that the president has done absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d Cipollone told senators. \u201cAnd that these articles of impeachment do not begin to approach the standard required by the Constitution.\u201d Cipollone then reserved the rest of his hour of time to rebut the arguments of the House impeachment managers. White House counsel Pat Cipollone has now taken the Senate floor to argue in favor of majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Cipollone will be given up to an hour to argue in favor of the resolution, and then the floor will be turned over to the House impeachment managers, who will argue against the resolution. But several congressional reporters noted the reading of the resolution included a significant change from yesterday. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment hearing is now being read on the floor. After that, the president\u2019s legal team and the House impeachment managers will each get an hour to debate the proposal. Minority leader Chuck Schumer will then be able to begin introducing amendments to the resolution aimed at allowing new evidence and witness testimony to be uncovered during the trial, but McConnell has said he will move to table the measures. As a reminder, senators are not allowed to speak during the debate. John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, has sworn in senator Jim Inhofe, who missed last week\u2019s swearing-in because of a family medical emergency. Every senator has now been sworn in, and the impeachment trial of Donald Trump can resume. A debate over majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining potential rules for the impeachment trial will soon begin. The White House has issued a statement denouncing House impeachment managers\u2019 argument that Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel who will represent Trump during the impeachment trial, has a conflict of interest because he was told about concerns regarding the president\u2019s Ukraine call. \u201cThe Democrats are an utter joke - they have no case, and this latest political stunt proves it,\u201d said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley. \u201cThe idea that the Counsel to the President has to turn over protected documents and confidential information is ludicrous, and to imply he can\u2019t represent the President of the United States in an impeachment proceeding is completely absurd.\u201d The Senate is minutes away from beginning debate on the resolution outlining rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, and the House impeachment managers have just filed a reply to the brief from the president\u2019s team. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s brief confirms that his misconduct is indefensible,\u201d the reply reads. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s lengthy brief to the Senate is heavy on rhetoric and procedural grievances, but entirely lacks a legitimate defense of his misconduct. \u201cIt is clear from his response that President Trump would rather discuss anything other than what he actually did.\u201d The fiery brief from the president\u2019s team derided Trump\u2019s impeachment as \u201ca dangerous perversion of the Constitution that the Senate should swiftly and roundly condemn.\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer warned that the impeachment trial rules proposed by majority leader Mitch McConnell would \u201cresult in a rushed trial with little evidence, in the dark of night.\u201d The New York Democrat argued the rules should be taken as further evidence of Trump\u2019s guilt. \u201cThe McConnell rules seem to be designed by President Trump for President Trump. It asks the Senate to rush through as fast as possible and makes getting evidence as hard as possible,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf Leader McConnell is so confident the president did nothing wrong, why don\u2019t they want the case to be presented in broad daylight?\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is now speaking on the floor, denouncing the press restrictions enforced on Capitol Hill for the impeachment trial. \u201cSome may not want what happens here to be public,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe do.\u201d Congressional reporters have repeatedly complained about the restrictions, warning that they represent an unprecedented infringement on press freedoms. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he would move to table any amendments to the impeachment trial resolution focused on obtaining new evidence for Trump\u2019s trial. Minority leader Chuck Schumer has promised to introduce a series of amendments aimed at allowing new evidence and witness testimony to be uncovered in the course of the trial, but McConnell only needs a simple majority to kill those measures. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is currently speaking on the floor in defense of his resolution outlining proposed rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. McConnell said the measure already had the support of a majority of the Republican-controlled chamber. \u201cThat\u2019s because it sets up a structure that is fair, evenhanded and tracks closely with past precedents,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. Democrats have complained the resolution would force arguments to go into the early hours of the morning, when most Americans would not be watching the proceedings, and argued the rules do not mirror those of Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, as McConnell had claimed they would. A little more on the growing political pressure on Susan Collins, the moderate Republican from Maine whom Senate Democrats hope might help them force the calling of new witnesses and admission of new information later in Trump\u2019s trial. Earlier today, Planned Parenthood endorsed a Democratic challenger to Collins in November\u2019s election. As headlines go, \u201cfederal women\u2019s health provider backs challenger to Republican\u201d might sound a bit \u201cdog bites man\u201d, but Collins has defended Planned Parenthood against Republican attempts to cut its funding and as recently as 2017 she was honoured by the group as \u201can outspoken champion for women\u2019s health\u201d. The organisation endorsed her in 2002. Here\u2019s a taste of how the Associated Press reported Planned Parenthood\u2019s move: Sara Gideon, speaker of the Maine House of Representatives [and running for the nomination to face Collins], welcomed the endorsement from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \u2018There\u2019s never been a more important time to stand up for reproductive rights,\u2019 she said, in the face of \u2018systematic attacks on reproductive rights across the country.\u2019 Collins \u2026 is facing perhaps the toughest re-election fight of her career. Critics have vowed they won\u2019t forget her key vote for [Trump supreme court nominee Brett] Kavanaugh, whose nomination [in 2018] survived an accusation that he sexually assaulted someone in high school. \u2018From her decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh to her refusal to stop Republican attacks on our health and rights, it\u2019s clear that she has turned her back on those she should be championing,\u2019 said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood, adding that Collins \u2018has abandoned not only the people of Maine, but women across the country\u2019. Tuesday is the day before the 47th anniversary of the landmark Roe vs Wade supreme court ruling that made abortion legal across the US. Collins has said it is settled law and Kavanaugh would not rule to overturn it but many fear otherwise under a court tilted firmly right under Trump. Here\u2019s Jessica Glenza on the growing threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights and access to abortion: Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he would introduce a series of amendements to majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s impeachment trial resolution later today, with the goal of collecting new evidence for Trump\u2019s trial. The House impeachment managers slammed the proposed trial rules outlined in McConnell\u2019s resolution as \u201ca White House-driven and rigged process, with a truncated schedule designed to go late into the night and further conceal the President\u2019s misconduct.\u201d The impeachment managers raised ethical concerns about White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who will represent Trump during the Senate trial. The House Democrats said Cipollone was a \u201cmaterial witness to the charges in both Articles of Impeachment for which President Trump now faces trial.\u201d The blog will have much more as the Senate debate over the impeachment trial rules gets underway, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders has issued a statement in response to Hillary Clinton\u2019s comments that \u201cnobody likes\u201d him and \u201cnobody wants to work with\u201d him, insiting he is focusing on Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. \u201cMy focus today is on a monumental moment in American history: the impeachment trial of Donald Trump,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cTogether, we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in American history.\u201d The comments, which were included as part of an upcoming documentary about Clinton, were first reported by the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cHe was in Congress for years [and] had one senator support him,\u201d Clinton said of her 2016 primary rival, calling him \u201ca career politician\u201d and criticizing the \u201cculture around\u201d the two-time Democratic presidential candidate. \u201cI feel so bad that people got sucked into it,\u201d Clinton said. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer repeatedly declined to answer reporters\u2019 questions about how many amendments Democrats would be introducing to the impeachment resolution. There will be up to two hours of debate for each amendment, but they will not pass unless four Republicans support the Democrats\u2019 proposals, which currently seems unlikely. Senate Democrats need at least four of their Republican colleagues to cross the aisle to have their amendments to the impeachment resolution adopted, and that seems very unlikely to happen at this point. If the amendments are not adopted, it would likely cut off senators from hearing new witness testimony during the impeachment trial. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he would introduce a number of amendments to majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining proposed rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. In addition to an amendment calling for a subpoena of White House documents related to the allegations, Schumer said he would introduce several other amendments aimed at calling new witnesses to testify. \u201cWe have no intention to be dilatory,\u201d Schumer said. He closed by reminding senators of their constitutional responsibility. \u201cThis is a historic moment,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe eyes of America are watching. Republican senators must rise to the occasion.\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is holding a press conference on Capitol Hill and slamming majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining proposed rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Echoing his earlier statement, Schumer said McConnell\u2019s resolution was \u201cnothing short of a national disgrace\u201d and warned that its implementation would make the impeachment trial \u201cone of the very dark days of the Senate.\u201d He added that the resolution outlined an impeachment trial on \u201cfast forward\u201d mode. The New York Democrat went on to say he would be introducing amendments to the resolution later today, starting with a proposal to subpoena White House documents related to the charges against the president. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has canceled a planned rally at the University of Northern Iowa tomorrow because of the Senate impeachment trial. But the Vermont senator has deployed one of his most high-profile surrogates, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to the first caucus state as he participates in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. There are four Democratic senators currently running for president -- Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- whose campaigning plans will likely be complicated by the impeachment trial. The proceedings come at a critical moment in the campaign, with less than two weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses. While speaking to reporters, House impeachment manager Adam Schiff brushed off a question about whether his team would use the full 24 hours to present their case for Trump\u2019s removal from office, as the proposed trial rules would allow. Republican senator John Cornyn previously downplayed Democrats\u2019 complaints that the proposed rules from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell could allow arguments to stretch into the early hours of the morning. Cornyn told a CBS News reporter, \u201cI think some of the hyperventilating over the possibility that we would extend to the wee hours of the morning, I think we\u2019ll work all that out.\u201d House impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s planned rules for the impeachment trial make it \u201cimpossible to have a fair trial.\u201d The California Democrat added that if McConnell\u2019s rules are adopted and Trump is acquitted, the proceedings will not have proven the president innocent. Instead, Schiff argued, the trial would only be a display of the Senate\u2019s willingness to help the president cover up the truth. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, House impeachment manager Adam Schiff again criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. \u201cWe can see why this resolution was kept from us and the American people,\u201d the California Democrat said. Schiff outlined the differences between McConnell\u2019s resolution and the rules observed during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, which the Senate leader claimed he would use as a model for his proposal. \u201cThis is not the process for a fair trial,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThis is the process for a rigged trial.\u201d Jerry Nadler, another House impeachment manager, then took the microphione to say, \u201cThis fixation on the Clinton trial is weird.\u201d The New York Democrat argued the focus should not be on a past impeachment trial. \u201cThe question is, should you have a fair trial now?\u201d Nadler said. He added that any senator who supports McConnell\u2019s proposed rules would be \u201ccomplicit in the cover-up of the president.\u201d A solid majority of Americans believe the impeachment trial should include new testimony from witnesses who did not appear during the House inquiry, according to a new poll. The CNN poll found that 69% of Americans, including 48% of Republicans, say the trial should feature new witness testimony. The poll also concluded that 51% of Americans support the Senate voting to remove Trump from office, compared to 45% who oppose it. But despite half of the country pushing for his ouster, Trump\u2019s approval rating remains unchanged at 43%, compared to 53% who disapprove. So it appears that nearly everyone who disapproves of Trump\u2019s job performance also believes he should be removed from office. Speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump dismissed the importance of the impeachment trial as Democrats cried foul over the proposed rules for the proceedings. \u201cThat whole thing is a hoax,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt goes nowhere because nothing happened. The only thing we\u2019ve done is a great job.\u201d During his speech at the forum this morning, Trump ignored impeachment and instead focused on taking credit for the growth of the US economy. \u201cAmerica is thriving; America is flourishing, and, yes, America is winning again like never before,\u201d Trump said. Former Democratic senator Claire McCaskill, who served in the Senate for 12 years before she lost her reelection race in 2018, predicted Susan Collins would be the only Republican senator to split with her party on allowing new witnesses to testify during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Democrats need to pick off at least four Republican senators to get changes to the proposed rules approved, so Collins\u2019 potential vote would not be enought to move the needle. Collins faces a difficult reelection race later this year in her home state of Maine. The House impeachment managers have issued another statement warning of potential ethical concerns about White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who will represent Trump during the Senate trial. \u201cIn preparation for the trial of Donald J. Trump before the Senate, we write to notify you that evidence received by the House of Representatives during its impeachment inquiry indicates that you are a material witness to the charges in both Articles of Impeachment for which President Trump now faces trial,\u201d said the managers, who are Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Jason Crow and Sylvia Garcia. \u201cYou must disclose all facts and information as to which you have first-hand knowledge that will be at issue in connection with evidence you present or arguments you make in your role as the President\u2019s legal advocate so that the Senate and Chief Justice can be apprised of any potential ethical issues, conflicts, or biases.\u201d In a longer letter explaining their concerns, the managers cited this Wall Street Journal story from November, which said that John Eisenberg, the general counsel for the National Security Council, told Cipollone about concerns regarding Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president. Echoing Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, House speaker Nancy Pelosi has issued a statement slamming Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution outlining rules for Trump\u2019s impeachment trial as a \u201csham proposal.\u201d \u201cLeader McConnell\u2019s process is deliberately designed to hide the truth from the Senate and from the American people, because he knows that the President\u2019s wrongdoing is indefensible and demands removal,\u201d Pelosi said in the statement. \u201cNo jury would be asked to operate on McConnell\u2019s absurdly compressed schedule, and it is obvious that no Senator who votes for it is intending to truly weigh the damning evidence of the President\u2019s attacks on our Constitution. ... \u201cDuty, honor and country are at stake. Every Senator who supports this sham process must be held accountable to the American people.\u201d In response to the rules proposed by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for the impeachment trial, the House impeachment managers issued a statement slamming the resolution as an unfair attempt to acquit the president without scrutiny. \u201cA White House-driven and rigged process, with a truncated schedule designed to go late into the night and further conceal the President\u2019s misconduct, is not what the American people expect or deserve,\u201d said the managers, who are Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Hakeem Jeffries, Val Demings, Jason Crow and Sylvia Garcia. The managers also dismissed arguments from McConnell that the proposed rules mirrored those of Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial in 1999. \u201cIn the Clinton case, the President provided all of the documents \u2014 more than 90,000 pages of them \u2014 before the trial took place. McConnell\u2019s resolution rejects that basic necessity,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAnd in the Clinton case, all of the witnesses had testified before the Senate trial began, and the only issue was whether they would be re-called to testify once more. The substance of what they would say was already known. Here, McConnell is trying to prevent the witnesses from ever testifying, and the public from ever finding out what they have to say.\u201d Good morning, live blog readers! It has been more than a month since the House voted to impeach Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and the matter is finally advancing to a Senate debate over the rules of a trial to determine whether he should be removed from office. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, released his proposed rules for the trial last night, and the resolution immediately sparked outrage from Democrats, who argued the president\u2019s allies were trying to rush to an acquittal. According to the rules, the White House counsel and House impeachment managers will each be allowed 24 hours over two days each to make opening arguments. Those opening arguments will be followed by 16 hours of questioning and a four-hour debate before the ultimate vote on whether to remove Trump from office. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, called the proposal a \u201cnational disgrace,\u201d as many other Democrats complained that the timetable could force arguments to stretch into the early hours of the morning and thus minimize public attention on the proceedings. But with Republicans holding the majority of Senate seats, Democrats will need to convince some of their colleagues across the aisle to push back against the proposal in order to secure changes. They will get the chance to do so today at 1pm ET, when the trial will pick up again and the Senate will get the chance to debate the resolution. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he delivered a speech early this morning. Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg are campaigning in Iowa today, with less than two weeks to go until the caucuses. Tulsi Gabbard is campaigning in New Hampshire. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

The chimney is your only way to freedom.\u201d In case anyone had not got the message, guards then beat a man senseless with clubs in front of them all.</p> <p>A former cavalry officer in the Polish army, Pilecki was a member of the resistance in Warsaw. When news reached them in July 1940 that a concentration camp had been opened in a former Polish army barracks near the town of O\u015bwi\u0119cim, Pilecki volunteered to be captured and taken to the camp \u2013 which the Germans called Auschwitz \u2013 in order to gain intelligence about what was happening there and to organise a break out. Few men had returned alive from Auschwitz and it was an incredibly brave decision. When a prisoner learned that Pilecki had volunteered to be there he was astonished: \u201cIf what you say is true you\u2019re either the greatest hero or the biggest fool.\u201d</p> <p>Pilecki quickly began organising an underground network in Auschwitz, but conditions were far worse than he had imagined. There were constant beatings, humiliations and a starvation diet, all designed to break down bonds between prisoners and to destroy them psychologically as well as physically. According to Pilecki, \u201csome slithered into a moral swamp.

Yet he did not give up. Each time someone escaped or was released, they carried reports for the Warsaw resistance. In October 1941 he detailed the gassing of Soviet prisoners using Zyklon B: \u201cHe had witnessed the creation of the camp\u2019s first gas chamber with the power to kill on an industrial scale.\u201d</p> <p>Next he reported on the creation of a new camp nearby, called Birkenau in German after the silver birch copses there. From the spring of 1942, trainloads of Jewish men, women and children arrived at Auschwitz to be gassed; 35,000 would be killed that summer alone. Later he would write: \u201cI would say that we have become animals \u2026 but no, we are a whole level of hell worse than animals.\u201d</p> <p>The resistance in Warsaw passed on his reports to the Polish government in exile, and they begged the allies to act.

But neither Roosevelt nor Churchill \u201cconsidered that the murder of Jews demanded a direct response\u201d.

As he says, Pilecki\u2019s story is \u201cessential for our understanding of how Auschwitz came into being\u201d. The concentration camp was transformed into a death factory before Pilecki\u2019s eyes. During nearly three years in Auschwitz, he risked his life to reveal the camp\u2019s true horror. His heroic attempts to alert the world to what was happening were only fully revealed after the fall of the Soviet Union and the opening of the Polish state archives.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He appeared in Poland\u2019s first Soviet-style show trials in March 1948, accused of being a traitor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually Pilecki escaped from Auschwitz with two friends in April 1943. They travelled more than 100 miles on foot and Pilecki was shot in the shoulder by a German guard. Back in Warsaw he found that few people knew about the underground organisation he had created in Auschwitz and even fewer were aware of the camp\u2019s role in the mass-murder of Jews.</p> <p>He wanted to lead an attack on the camp, but the resistance refused. When he discovered that the leaders of the underground he had formed back in the camp had all been shot \u201che was devastated\u201d. He believed he had failed to convince people that what was happening in Auschwitz was \u201cevil\u201d and that there was a moral imperative to confront it.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the summer of 1944, when allied forces had landed on the beaches of Normandy and Soviet planes were above Warsaw, that western leaders acknowledged the significance of what was happening at Auschwitz. By then Pilecki had just completed his 10th report on the camp. Five thousand Jews a day were being gassed, so many that the crematoria couldn\u2019t cope and there were giant funeral pyres of corpses.</p> <p>After the war, Pilecki returned to Warsaw to set up a new underground organisation hoping to liberate Poland from its new communist rulers. In March 1946 he returned to Auschwitz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/23/poland-catholicism-nazis-difficult-past\" title=\"\">which had just been turned into a permanent memorial</a>: \u201cHe\u2019d come looking for answers but found none.\u201d Instead he turned to writing in order to understand what had happened. But Pilecki was forced to acknowledge \u201cthat the horrors of the camp might never be comprehensible, even to a prisoner like himself who had suffered within its walls\u201d.</p> <p>The following year, he was arrested by the secret police and accused of treason. He was tortured and interrogated more than 150 times in six months: \u201cHe told them the truth, he told them lies, he told them what he thought they wanted to hear.\u201d</p> <p>Eventually he signed a confession and appeared in Poland\u2019s first Soviet-style show trials in March 1948, accused of being a traitor and of \u201cthreatening society and our wonderful youth\u201d. During a break in the trial he had a brief conversation with his wife, Maria, telling her: \u201cAuschwitz was just a game compared to this. I\u2019m very tired. I want a swift conclusion.\u201d</p> <p>Refusing to beg for forgiveness, he told the court: \u201cI tried to live my life in such a fashion so that in my last hour, I would rather be happy than fearful. I find happiness in knowing that the fight was worth it.\u201d He was executed with a bullet to the back of the head on 25 May 1948.</p> <p>Pilecki died believing he had failed. Yet as this compelling study of his remarkable life shows, he did more than anyone to reveal the true horror of the camp: \u201cIt was the allies that didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Volunteer is published by Ebury (RRP \u00a37.99).

Back in Warsaw he found that few people knew about the underground organisation he had created in Auschwitz and even fewer were aware of the camp\u2019s role in the mass-murder of Jews. He wanted to lead an attack on the camp, but the resistance refused. When he discovered that the leaders of the underground he had formed back in the camp had all been shot \u201che was devastated\u201d. He believed he had failed to convince people that what was happening in Auschwitz was \u201cevil\u201d and that there was a moral imperative to confront it. It wasn\u2019t until the summer of 1944, when allied forces had landed on the beaches of Normandy and Soviet planes were above Warsaw, that western leaders acknowledged the significance of what was happening at Auschwitz. By then Pilecki had just completed his 10th report on the camp. Five thousand Jews a day were being gassed, so many that the crematoria couldn\u2019t cope and there were giant funeral pyres of corpses. After the war, Pilecki returned to Warsaw to set up a new underground organisation hoping to liberate Poland from its new communist rulers. In March 1946 he returned to Auschwitz, which had just been turned into a permanent memorial: \u201cHe\u2019d come looking for answers but found none.\u201d Instead he turned to writing in order to understand what had happened. But Pilecki was forced to acknowledge \u201cthat the horrors of the camp might never be comprehensible, even to a prisoner like himself who had suffered within its walls\u201d. The following year, he was arrested by the secret police and accused of treason. He was tortured and interrogated more than 150 times in six months: \u201cHe told them the truth, he told them lies, he told them what he thought they wanted to hear.\u201d Eventually he signed a confession and appeared in Poland\u2019s first Soviet-style show trials in March 1948, accused of being a traitor and of \u201cthreatening society and our wonderful youth\u201d. During a break in the trial he had a brief conversation with his wife, Maria, telling her: \u201cAuschwitz was just a game compared to this. I\u2019m very tired. I want a swift conclusion.\u201d Refusing to beg for forgiveness, he told the court: \u201cI tried to live my life in such a fashion so that in my last hour, I would rather be happy than fearful. I find happiness in knowing that the fight was worth it.\u201d He was executed with a bullet to the back of the head on 25 May 1948. Pilecki died believing he had failed. Yet as this compelling study of his remarkable life shows, he did more than anyone to reveal the true horror of the camp: \u201cIt was the allies that didn\u2019t listen.\u201d \u2022 The Volunteer is published by Ebury (RRP \u00a37.99).

HRW documented abuses including murder, kidnappings, disappearances, child recruitment and rape. \u201cArmed groups in Arauca and Apure also punish residents with forced labor, requiring them to work for free, sometimes for months, farming, cleaning roads, or cooking in the armed groups\u2019 camps, which are often in Venezuela,\u201d says the report, released on Wednesday.

While that accord formally ended a conflict that killed over 260,000 and forced 7 million from their homes, little has changed on the ground in former Farc strongholds such as the Arauca province. HRW\u2019s report claims that one of the two armed groups present there is a splinter group of the Farc\u2019s 10th Front, which still uses the defunct rebel army\u2019s insignia. Another Colombian leftist group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) works in alliance with the dissidents. The Patriotic Forces of National Liberation (FPLN), a Venezuelan guerrilla group that supports its country\u2019s leftist government, is also present. \u201cThe Colombian-Venezuelan border is strategically important to armed groups due to the illegal economies that exist there, including contraband, drug trafficking, and human trafficking,\u201d said Juan Pappier, one of the authors of the report. \u201cArmed groups can also attack civilians in Colombia and then use Venezuela as a rearguard, something that happens often on the Arauca-Apure border.\u201d But Venezuela is also a hotbed for criminal activity, with gangs taking advantage of the chaos left by the country\u2019s social and economic collapse. Hyperinflation sits at an annual rate of 10,398%, according to a Forbes analyst, while shortages of food staples and medicines are commonplace. Colombia\u2019s president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, has accused Venezuela\u2019s embattled president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of directly contributing to the insecurity by sheltering ELN and dissident Farc fighters. Over 4 million people have now fled Venezuela, the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency reports. Many migrants, deeply impoverished, make the route through Colombia on foot, where they are further at risk of armed groups. \u201cCivilians pay the price for the security mess in Arauca, including the Venezuelan immigrants already fleeing a serious humanitarian crisis in their country,\u201d Pappier said.

      "bodyText": "Nine people are confirmed to have died and at least 440 have been infected in the outbreak of a new Sars-like virus that was first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan less than a month ago. The World Health Organisation met on Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, after authorities in China confirmed the death toll had risen from six overnight. The US reported one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, on Tuesday, and cases have also been confirmed in Korea and Thailand. It has also spread to 14 health workers in China, confirming human-to-human transmission. But health authorities say there is no cause for public concern in Australia. What is Australia doing? Medical staff from the New South Wales Health department will be stationed alongside biosecurity staff at Sydney airport to meet the thrice-weekly direct flight from Wuhan, conduct an initial diagnosis of any people on the flight who are exhibiting flu-like symptoms, and if necessary send them to Westmead hospital for testing. Authorities are also providing written information, in English and Chinese, to passengers on those flights about what to do if they develop respiratory symptoms. \u201cWe are meeting every passenger, providing information to them, asking them to declare if they have got any symptoms, but we know that an incubation period for a virus like this could be seven days,\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, told the ABC. He said temperature scanners would not be used because they did not detect infected people who had not yet developed a fever. \u201cWe know in our experience in swine flu and other epidemics that measuring temperature might pick up a few people but it also misses a lot of people, and it probably doesn\u2019t add anything to the biosecurity measures that we\u2019ve put in place,\u201d he said.

Most people can be relied upon to self-report unless their symptoms are so mild as to be mistakenly dismissed as a common cold, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales. \u201cMost people will self-report because they will be concerned,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThey will know that they have come from an area of concern and people do not want to die of a serious disease.\u201d Murphy said reports from China showed there \u201cclearly seem to be a number of mild cases that just have a fever, a bit like a common cold\u201d. McAnulty said the virus did not appear to be as severe as Sars, but that it was \u201cprudent to be cautious until we learn more about this situation\u201d. MacIntyre said severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) had fatality rates of 12% and 26% respectively, while the fatality rate for the novel coronavirus was currently about 2% to 5%. But she stressed there was no formal published data yet. Will that work to prevent the disease spreading to Australia? One suspected case has been reported in Australia, but tests showed he did not have the coronavirus. Queensland health authorities confirmed on Tuesday that a man who had recently visited Wuhan had presented with respiratory symptoms. He was released from home isolation after Queensland Health said he no longer had flu-like symptoms, and on Wednesday afternoon it was reported that test results were negative for the virus. Australian authorities are still developing a rapid test for the virus. A laboratory in Melbourne has developed a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, using the virus sequence provided by Chinese authorities. The incubation period for the virus is up to seven days, which means some people could be asymptomatic when assessed at the airport. Murphy said authorities did not have a \u201cclear clinical picture\u201d of whether people were infectious before they developed symptoms. He told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cyou cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country\u201d. \u201cSo it\u2019s about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention,\u201d he said. Who is at high risk? Anyone is at risk who has recently been in Wuhan, or who has had close contact with someone who has been there, and has developed flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, sore throat, coughing or breathlessness. People who suspect they may have the virus are advised to ring ahead to their general practitioner or local hospital, so precautions can be taken to protect other patients from infection and appropriately triage the at-risk patient. The biggest risk to controlling the virus, MacIntyre said, was a failure to appropriately triage. \u201cWe really want to focus on the healthcare system and make sure that detection is improved,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want somebody sitting in the emergency department for three hours with a cough or fever and not being properly triaged.\u201d Hospitals and general practitioners have been provided with information and advice about the virus, but MacIntyre said failure to swiftly isolate at-risk patients could increase the spread of the infection. \u201cWe see failure of triage all the time in Australia, such as with measles,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have got to look at where you can make the biggest impact and if it\u2019s anything like the Sars and Mers outbreaks it\u2019s going to be hospitals that are at the highest risk of outbreaks.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>M*A*S*H is a rare example of a movie that has been eclipsed by its television adaptation. The 1983 finale of the long-running sitcom about a medical unit near the frontlines of the Korean war was the highest-rated single television episode in history, with 125 million viewers tuning in. It\u2019s understandable that Robert Altman\u2019s 1970 film, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month, lives in its shadow. The subversive anti-war comedy avoided sentimentality and teachable moments in favor of cruel pranks and a more hardened cynicism. Coming at the start of cinema\u2019s most famous decade, it is a seminal film of New Hollywood, and it bears all the hallmarks of its era: a strong anti-establishment sentiment, the foregrounding of morally ambiguous protagonists, and, unfortunately, a deep and unexamined misogyny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/03/my-favourite-film-decade-1970s-dont-look-now-the-godfather-jaws\">From Don't Look Now to The Godfather \u2013 why the 1970s is my favourite film decade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The film follows the comic hijinks of three army surgeons \u2013 played by Elliott Gould, Donald Sutherland, and Tom Skerritt \u2013 stationed on a medical base during the Korean war. In between bursts of bloody activity, they become experts at killing time through football, golf, gambling and their pursuit of the female nurses. It starts immediately, when Hawkeye (Sutherland) and Forrest (Skerritt) arrive on base and aggressively proposition an attractive lieutenant, minding her own business in the mess hall. Hawkeye invades her personal space, sitting uncomfortably close to her despite the availability of other seats, and calls her \u201cLieutenant Dish\u201d. Several scenes later, he\u2019ll have her in his bed, a plot twist to reward him and the male viewers who want to see their hero complete his conquest.</p> <p>The boys save their most awkward cruelty for bigger game, the hated nurse Houlihan (Sally Kellerman). A comic foil who has the gall to confront the surgeons about their unprofessional attitude, she is introduced to viewers as she gets off a helicopter, with her skirt rising so we can see her garter belt below. Perhaps unable to tolerate the combination of her good looks and lack of submissiveness, the boys make her the target of their misplaced anger. When she succumbs to her loneliness one evening and has a casual rendezvous with Maj Burns (Robert Duvall), a stuffed-shirt religious type who is the boys\u2019 object of ridicule, Hawkeye and his friends transmit their sexual dalliance over the base broadcasting system. After she begs Burns to kiss her \u201chot lips\u201d, her new moniker \u2013 \u201cHot Lips\u201d Houlihan<strong> </strong><strong>\u2013 </strong>is born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09ec7425424cb00bcfcb4d5f2de2603f17aae456\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09ec7425424cb00bcfcb4d5f2de2603f17aae456/0_0_2745_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Given that M*A*S*H remains so highly esteemed \u2013 it ranked #43 in a 2017 BBC poll of the greatest comedies of all-time \u2013 it deserves this closer scrutiny\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Given that M*A*S*H remains so highly esteemed \u2013 it ranked #43 in a 2017 BBC poll of the greatest comedies of all-time \u2013 it deserves this closer scrutiny.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/CBS TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be easy to see this as an equal opportunity lampooning \u2013 after all, Maj Burns was also a target of the prank \u2013 but the film continues to pile on to nurse Houlihan. The most egregious act of violence against her comes later on when the boys decide to settle a bet as to whether she is a natural blonde by exposing her in the shower tent for the entire base \u2013 and us \u2013 to see. It\u2019s a cruel moment that the film revels in. She subsequently runs to the commander\u2019s tent to tearfully complain about her treatment, and he, who has another nurse in his bed at the time, dispassionately suggests she simply resign her post.</p> <p>The trauma that Houlihan experiences, brought to life with emotional force by Kellerman, cannot be laughed off in the way that it might have been in 1970. It was intended as a prank, but today, after the revelations of the #MeToo movement, it reads more like harassment or assault. Of course, depiction need not equal endorsement, and while one could argue that this misogyny is in some ways the subject of the movie \u2013 that the men are reverting to their primal selves amid the throes of war \u2013 the film itself tips its hand in the closing credits, which show brief shots of each actor from earlier in the film as their name is printed on screen. The clip of Kellerman is of her in the shower, encouraging the audience to see her \u2013 the actor, not only the character \u2013 as an object. This is not just depiction. It\u2019s endorsement.</p> <p>Of course, even the film version of M*A*S*H was an adaptation, so it\u2019s not quite fair to lay these critiques entirely at the film-makers\u2019 feet. The sexism is present in the 1968 novel by Richard Hooker that<strong> </strong>the film is based on, but it\u2019s greatly magnified in the screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr and the extensive improvisation that reportedly occurred on set. The shower scene, the broadcasting of the lovemaking between Houlihan and Burns, and a subplot involving a character who wants to kill himself because he is afraid he is gay; none of them are present in the book.</p> <p>Without the ability to assign a single author to the film\u2019s misogyny, it\u2019s reasonable to read it as a product of the culture from which the film sprang. The great films of the 1970s may have contained excellent, complex roles for women; Ellen Burstyn as a struggling but hopeful single mother in Scorsese\u2019s Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore; Faye Dunaway as the hardened TV executive in Network; and Diane Keaton as the heroine of Annie Hall, who undergoes a bigger transformation than her male counterpart created by Woody Allen. But there is no denying that the culture of New Hollywood, in which young, male mavericks like Scorsese, Spielberg, Coppola, Lucas and Ashby were given carte blanche, was fertile for sexism. Perhaps emboldened by their freedom, they inadvertently revealed a blind spot for women\u2019s equality. Even the best roles for women were somehow beholden to their male creators, and few were the type of roles women would create. They were projections of male insecurity, like Annie Hall, or women whose personalities were bent towards maleness by a patriarchal system, like Dunaway in Network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e275304962818c8c7486f1c658c59bbb27de452\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e275304962818c8c7486f1c658c59bbb27de452/0_0_3514_2808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Without the ability to assign a single author to the film\u2019s misogyny, it\u2019s reasonable to read it as a product of the culture from which the film sprung forth.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"799\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Without the ability to assign a single author to the film\u2019s misogyny, it\u2019s reasonable to read it as a product of the culture from which the film sprang.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AF archive/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>M*A*S*H can\u2019t compare to these complex depictions of femininity in a world of men. It may be remembered for its youthful subversions, but its protagonists treat women with the same disrespect that their fathers did, and it portended a troubling future. Squint at M*A*S*H, and you can see National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House, which would come eight years later. Look a little further into the future, and there\u2019s Porky\u2019s or Revenge of the Nerds, other films in which frat bros play sexual pranks on unsuspecting girls. In its defense, M*A*S*H has more to say than those films, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be the same intention of cruelty. Rather, it spreads its subversive sentiment in all directions, women just get caught in the crossfire and ended up getting the brunt of the injury. After all, Kellerman\u2019s nude scene was in itself a watershed moment. The Production Code was repealed in 1968 and replaced with the MPAA system. For the first time, nudity was permitted on screen, and it\u2019s easy to see how Altman could have viewed the shower scene as a flex of his first amendment rights.</p> <p>Still, given that M*A*S*H remains so highly esteemed \u2013 it ranked #43 in a 2017 BBC poll of the greatest comedies of all-time \u2013 it deserves this closer scrutiny. Many of today\u2019s best film-makers grew up idolizing the directors of the 1970s and modeling their careers after them. Perhaps then it\u2019s no surprise that Hollywood still has such a woman problem. The absence of female directors in this year\u2019s Oscar nominations to the eye-opening reporting of the #MeToo movement makes M*A*S*H more timeless than it should be. Women in Hollywood are still struggling to be seen as anything more than casualties of war.</p>",

In between bursts of bloody activity, they become experts at killing time through football, golf, gambling and their pursuit of the female nurses. It starts immediately, when Hawkeye (Sutherland) and Forrest (Skerritt) arrive on base and aggressively proposition an attractive lieutenant, minding her own business in the mess hall. Hawkeye invades her personal space, sitting uncomfortably close to her despite the availability of other seats, and calls her \u201cLieutenant Dish\u201d. Several scenes later, he\u2019ll have her in his bed, a plot twist to reward him and the male viewers who want to see their hero complete his conquest. The boys save their most awkward cruelty for bigger game, the hated nurse Houlihan (Sally Kellerman). A comic foil who has the gall to confront the surgeons about their unprofessional attitude, she is introduced to viewers as she gets off a helicopter, with her skirt rising so we can see her garter belt below. Perhaps unable to tolerate the combination of her good looks and lack of submissiveness, the boys make her the target of their misplaced anger. When she succumbs to her loneliness one evening and has a casual rendezvous with Maj Burns (Robert Duvall), a stuffed-shirt religious type who is the boys\u2019 object of ridicule, Hawkeye and his friends transmit their sexual dalliance over the base broadcasting system. After she begs Burns to kiss her \u201chot lips\u201d, her new moniker \u2013 \u201cHot Lips\u201d Houlihan \u2013 is born. It would be easy to see this as an equal opportunity lampooning \u2013 after all, Maj Burns was also a target of the prank \u2013 but the film continues to pile on to nurse Houlihan. The most egregious act of violence against her comes later on when the boys decide to settle a bet as to whether she is a natural blonde by exposing her in the shower tent for the entire base \u2013 and us \u2013 to see. It\u2019s a cruel moment that the film revels in. She subsequently runs to the commander\u2019s tent to tearfully complain about her treatment, and he, who has another nurse in his bed at the time, dispassionately suggests she simply resign her post. The trauma that Houlihan experiences, brought to life with emotional force by Kellerman, cannot be laughed off in the way that it might have been in 1970. It was intended as a prank, but today, after the revelations of the #MeToo movement, it reads more like harassment or assault. Of course, depiction need not equal endorsement, and while one could argue that this misogyny is in some ways the subject of the movie \u2013 that the men are reverting to their primal selves amid the throes of war \u2013 the film itself tips its hand in the closing credits, which show brief shots of each actor from earlier in the film as their name is printed on screen. The clip of Kellerman is of her in the shower, encouraging the audience to see her \u2013 the actor, not only the character \u2013 as an object. This is not just depiction. It\u2019s endorsement. Of course, even the film version of M*A*S*H was an adaptation, so it\u2019s not quite fair to lay these critiques entirely at the film-makers\u2019 feet. The sexism is present in the 1968 novel by Richard Hooker that the film is based on, but it\u2019s greatly magnified in the screenplay by Ring Lardner Jr and the extensive improvisation that reportedly occurred on set. The shower scene, the broadcasting of the lovemaking between Houlihan and Burns, and a subplot involving a character who wants to kill himself because he is afraid he is gay; none of them are present in the book. Without the ability to assign a single author to the film\u2019s misogyny, it\u2019s reasonable to read it as a product of the culture from which the film sprang. The great films of the 1970s may have contained excellent, complex roles for women; Ellen Burstyn as a struggling but hopeful single mother in Scorsese\u2019s Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore; Faye Dunaway as the hardened TV executive in Network; and Diane Keaton as the heroine of Annie Hall, who undergoes a bigger transformation than her male counterpart created by Woody Allen. But there is no denying that the culture of New Hollywood, in which young, male mavericks like Scorsese, Spielberg, Coppola, Lucas and Ashby were given carte blanche, was fertile for sexism. Perhaps emboldened by their freedom, they inadvertently revealed a blind spot for women\u2019s equality. Even the best roles for women were somehow beholden to their male creators, and few were the type of roles women would create. They were projections of male insecurity, like Annie Hall, or women whose personalities were bent towards maleness by a patriarchal system, like Dunaway in Network. M*A*S*H can\u2019t compare to these complex depictions of femininity in a world of men. It may be remembered for its youthful subversions, but its protagonists treat women with the same disrespect that their fathers did, and it portended a troubling future. Squint at M*A*S*H, and you can see National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House, which would come eight years later. Look a little further into the future, and there\u2019s Porky\u2019s or Revenge of the Nerds, other films in which frat bros play sexual pranks on unsuspecting girls. In its defense, M*A*S*H has more to say than those films, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be the same intention of cruelty. Rather, it spreads its subversive sentiment in all directions, women just get caught in the crossfire and ended up getting the brunt of the injury. After all, Kellerman\u2019s nude scene was in itself a watershed moment. The Production Code was repealed in 1968 and replaced with the MPAA system. For the first time, nudity was permitted on screen, and it\u2019s easy to see how Altman could have viewed the shower scene as a flex of his first amendment rights. Still, given that M*A*S*H remains so highly esteemed \u2013 it ranked #43 in a 2017 BBC poll of the greatest comedies of all-time \u2013 it deserves this closer scrutiny. Many of today\u2019s best film-makers grew up idolizing the directors of the 1970s and modeling their careers after them. Perhaps then it\u2019s no surprise that Hollywood still has such a woman problem. The absence of female directors in this year\u2019s Oscar nominations to the eye-opening reporting of the #MeToo movement makes M*A*S*H more timeless than it should be. Women in Hollywood are still struggling to be seen as anything more than casualties of war.",

Commenting on the Midia incident, the minister said he hoped the tragedy would not be repeated, adding: \u201cFor Romania, it would be more economically advantageous not to export live animals but to export meat instead.\u201d For the farmers \u2013 who are battling harsh, low-paid conditions as well as corruption over EU subsidies and land ownership \u2013 these improvements could provide some inducement to stay on their farms. \u201cShepherding is a tradition we\u2019ve had for hundreds of years in Romania and [economic and political elites pursuing their selfish interests] are slowly managing to destroy a national treasure,\u201d says a pessimistic D\u0103nule\u021biu. \u201cI\u2019m a patriot and I\u2019m trying to hope that something will change for the better in this country. But if not, we\u2019re coming to London, we have no option.\u201d",

He acknowledged the scale of the challenges they faced in finding solutions to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said was \u201ca hell of a job\u201d.</p> \n<p>As well as four experts to the assembly, a panel of advisers including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers\u2019 Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies have helped provide the questions on which assembly members will be asked to give their views.</p> \n<p>The key subjects to be considered will include transport, agriculture, domestic energy, and how consumerism is driving global heating. As well as policies such as bringing forward the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040, the panel will consider technological solutions to cutting carbon emissions. Watson said many technological initiatives were surrounded by hype. \u201cIt is really important we get across [to the assembly members] not just that the option is x, but what the status of that option is in the world,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The assembly will meet for four weekends. On the third weekend they will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net zero target.</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which is calling for the government to create and be led by the decisions of a citizens\u2019 assembly on climate, said they welcomed the fact that such assemblies were being used in mainstream politics. \u201cHowever, because it is not commissioned by the government it is not what we are looking for. We want something with real teeth, that has actual power to influence policy,\u201d she said.</p>",

Their views, which will be produced in a report in the spring, will be considered by the select committees but there is no guarantee any of the proposals will be taken up by government. Allen said it was rare for members of a citizens\u2019 assembly to get locked into dissent. She pointed to the success of the Irish citizens\u2019 assembly in 2016, which helped break the deadlock in the abortion debate. \u201cThis climate assembly is going to come up with recommendations that are going to be really invaluable in highlighting public preferences,\u201d she said. Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, is one of four experts who will guide the members of the public in their decision-making. He acknowledged the scale of the challenges they faced in finding solutions to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said was \u201ca hell of a job\u201d. As well as four experts to the assembly, a panel of advisers including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers\u2019 Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies have helped provide the questions on which assembly members will be asked to give their views. The key subjects to be considered will include transport, agriculture, domestic energy, and how consumerism is driving global heating. As well as policies such as bringing forward the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040, the panel will consider technological solutions to cutting carbon emissions. Watson said many technological initiatives were surrounded by hype. \u201cIt is really important we get across [to the assembly members] not just that the option is x, but what the status of that option is in the world,\u201d he said. The assembly will meet for four weekends. On the third weekend they will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net zero target. A spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which is calling for the government to create and be led by the decisions of a citizens\u2019 assembly on climate, said they welcomed the fact that such assemblies were being used in mainstream politics. \u201cHowever, because it is not commissioned by the government it is not what we are looking for. We want something with real teeth, that has actual power to influence policy,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and his ministers have made huge promises for the United Kingdom after we leave the European Union next week, particularly for \u201cthe north\u201d \u2013 that unfamiliar land which can now be mined for Tory votes, if no longer for coal. Conservative MPs elected in former Labour strongholds have pledged to \u201chunt like a pack\u201d for infrastructure improvements \u2013 of which there has been no sign over the past decade of Tory government. The north is promised bounty from the \u201cshared prosperity fund\u201d \u2013 the cynically named, back-of-an-envelope replacement for EU structural funds, which for decades have invested billions in Britain\u2019s regions to encourage economic revival. Transformation is promised for when Brexit is \u201cdone\u201d, yet there is still no acknowledgement that the most severe economic threat to the north is Brexit itself. The risks highlighted by government impact assessments \u2013 which Theresa May was so reluctant to publish \u2013 remain, with the north and Midlands facing the greatest peril due to the significance of their trade with Europe. And the chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s insistence that Britain will diverge from EU industrial and social standards puts the risk to the regional economy at the more serious levels calculated by those assessments. Blighted as many areas have been by job losses and severe public spending cuts, it is nevertheless a caricature to depict the north and Midlands as barely rebuilt since the mines, shipbuilding and other heavy industries were dismantled under the Thatcher government in the 1980s. Efforts have been made over three decades to regenerate deindustrialised areas \u2013 including investment, consistently, from the now-disappearing EU funds that are specifically targeted at deprived areas of Europe. British policy has been patchy, never enough, and was further undermined from 2010 by Tory governments withdrawing swathes of funding, and abolishing regional development agencies. Yet the modern industries that have been established during this period, of which car manufacturing is the strongest example, have based their operations on Britain being a member of the EU. The north-east, a small region by population and still pockmarked by decline, has hosted the growth of Nissan, and the 30,000 jobs in its supply chain, since the Japanese car giant was first attracted to Sunderland in 1986. The impact assessments found that this region, with its high-quality manufacturers principally exporting to Europe, faces losing the most: an 11% hit even with a trade deal, if Johnson achieves the incredible and strikes one by the end of this year. If there is no deal, and full barriers and tariffs are erected with Europe, the projected hit is 16%. The north-west \u2013 where Leigh, Burnley and Blackpool South voted for Johnson but where there are still strong chemicals, machinery and transport export industries \u2013 faces an 8% economic decline, rising to 12% if there is no trade deal. The damage to the West Midlands, east Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humber is projected to be at least 5%, and up to 13% for the West Midlands if there\u2019s no deal. These downturns would affect companies in all sectors, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk \u2013 such as in the ceramics industry, which still directly employs 22,500 people, many in its traditional Staffordshire heartland. The new year has already delivered a bracing blow to 283 steelworkers in South Yorkshire, where Liberty Speciality Steels cited \u201cissues around Brexit\u201d among its difficulties when announcing the redundancies. Johnson\u2019s new MPs have gushed about knocking on doors in Sedgefield, Blyth Valley and Redcar, and finding people impatient for the Brexit they voted for in 2016. But when the MPs talk to people involved professionally in their constituencies\u2019 economic development, they will find them almost unanimously alarmed by the prospect of leaving the EU. In the north-east, the region\u2019s CBI, Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses, Entrepreneurs\u2019 Forum, Northern TUC, local authorities and its four universities signed up to a call for continued access to the single market \u2013 which seems impossible now \u2013 in order to lessen the economic damage. Nissan itself, which employs almost 8,000 people directly in Sunderland, gradually escalated the seriousness of its warnings, before saying emphatically last October that a no-deal Brexit would make its UK operation unviable. The day after Johnson\u2019s election victory, a company spokeswoman said it is \u201cstill waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like\u201d. The Japanese government has repeatedly issued similar warnings on behalf of 1,000 Japanese companies based in the UK, saying some are already halting investment and looking to move operations to Europe. A survey cited by the Nikkei Asian Review found that more than 70% of Japanese manufacturers in Britain are already \u201cfeeling a negative impact from Brexit\u201d.

Not so much the thoughtless \u201cLet them eat brioche\u201d side of the spendthrift French queen (assuming she ever said it) but her playing at being a rustic farmworker but dropping it all and heading back to the palace as soon as it becomes a chore vibe. It\u2019s a dream few of us get to realise, though one woman who did was Elizabeth Brownlow, 4th Countess of Darnley. She lived at a time (late 18th/early 19th century) when a return to the simple life was en vogue among the landed gentry \u2013 as a response to the mechanisation unleashed by the Industrial Revolution.</p> <p>Around two centuries later, I found myself staying in the restored \u201cpleasure dairy\u201d she had built on the southern edge of the grounds of Cobham Hall, an Elizabethan country house (now a school) near Rochester, Kent.

Working from Wyatt\u2019s drawings, craftspeople replaced the unusual slate cladding on the brick walls, made up the sanded paint used to give those slates a look of glimmering stone, and replaced the coloured and ornamented window panes.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s face it, at some point we\u2019ve all had a hankering to get in touch with our inner Marie Antoinette. Not so much the thoughtless \u201cLet them eat brioche\u201d side of the spendthrift French queen (assuming she ever said it) but her playing at being a rustic farmworker but dropping it all and heading back to the palace as soon as it becomes a chore vibe. It\u2019s a dream few of us get to realise, though one woman who did was Elizabeth Brownlow, 4th Countess of Darnley. She lived at a time (late 18th/early 19th century) when a return to the simple life was en vogue among the landed gentry \u2013 as a response to the mechanisation unleashed by the Industrial Revolution. Around two centuries later, I found myself staying in the restored \u201cpleasure dairy\u201d she had built on the southern edge of the grounds of Cobham Hall, an Elizabethan country house (now a school) near Rochester, Kent. The work of prolific architect James Wyatt, it was intended to resemble an Italianate chapel. The dairy served as an elegant retreat where Elizabeth could oversee the production of butter, cream and cheese from the estate\u2019s cows, or hold decorous tea parties for her high-born female friends, away from the strictures of a world dominated by men. This month, the Landmark Trust opened it as holiday accommodation. The trust has spent five years returning the dilapidated building into the playful, if undoubtedly fey, confection it had been in 1794-5 when erected. Working from Wyatt\u2019s drawings, craftspeople replaced the unusual slate cladding on the brick walls, made up the sanded paint used to give those slates a look of glimmering stone, and replaced the coloured and ornamented window panes. They also rebuilt the glorious fan-vaulted ceiling and recreated the interior\u2019s intricate plasterwork, its corbels and bosses festooned with oak leaves. I\u2019d arrived by bike from Sole Street station, a two-mile ride that took me past the community shop in Cobham village, which was handy for picking up a few victuals. Leaving the road, I pedalled into Cobham Park, turning down a dark holloway to pass through a gap in high bushes of laurel. And there was the dairy, in the sunshine, for all the world a tiny chapel complete with gothic mullioned windows, a bell tower and views down through ancient trees to Cobham Hall. Inside, I was greeted with a patterned stone floor, an almost double-height ceiling, a collection of large, venerable-looking milk bowls and a couple of comfy armchairs arranged around a woodburning stove (an indulgent extra, given the efficacy of the underfloor heating). The other rooms, long, slim affairs, were wrapped around this parlour \u2013 a smart kitchen, a bathroom in whose deep, free-standing bath I took nightly soaks, and a room just wide enough for a double bed. This last had once been the bedroom of Sarah Hemmings, the first of a succession of dairy maids to live here. Unlike Sarah, I was not pressed into work. For much of my stay, when not indulging in writing, I was more than content to lounge about, enjoying the beauty of the interior, the play of window-coloured sunlight on the paintwork, and the serenity of the place.

According to photos of the messages provided to the Guardian, Ramasar wrote: \u201cI might need blow in order to try and f*** her!\u201d The West Side Story actor later insinuated that he planned to offer his own partner in exchange because he would owe Finlay.</p> <p>Beyond the texts, Waterbury has alleged that Ramasar would grope and kiss people at after-parties and gatherings. She had to ask Finlay to tell Ramasar to leave her alone because she didn\u2019t want to be touched.</p> <p>When the text scandal broke in 2018, Ramasar was a <a href=\"https://www.nycballet.com/Dancers/Dancers-Bios/Amar-Ramasar.aspx\">principal dancer</a> with City Ballet and in the midst of his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/theater/carousel-review-broadway.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftheater&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=theater&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=28&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">Broadway debut</a> in Carousel.

And in April, he was<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/arts/dance/city-ballet-amar-ramasar-sexually-explicit-texts.html\"> ordered reinstated</a> at City Ballet by an arbitrator who reportedly required him to undergo counseling but believed his termination the previous year had gone too far (the arbitrator\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/arts/dance/city-ballet-amar-ramasar-sexually-explicit-texts.html\">was not made public</a>).</p> <p>\u201cAs I move forward, learning, and evolving, I am eager to once again dance amongst the colleagues I respect, doing the ballets I have held close to my heart for the past 18 years,\u201d Ramasar<a href=\"https://apnews.com/3df29f3e3a734a26bd6d82f4a6561300\"> said at the time.</a></p> <p>By May, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/arts/dance/amar-ramasar-new-york-city-ballet.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email\">he was performing again</a> as a principal dancer with City Ballet. Then, in July, a new adaptation of West Side Story produced by Scott Rudin and directed by the Tony Award winner Ivo van Hove <a href=\"http://shubert.nyc/press/complete-cast-and-theatre-announced-for-the-broadway-revival-of-west-side-story/\">announced Ramasar as Bernardo</a>.</p> <p>In 10 months, he had gone full circle and ended up exactly where he left off: a favorite at City Ballet with a starring role on Broadway.</p> <p>Previews for West Side Story started in December, and the show will officially open <a href=\"https://www.broadway.com/shows/west-side-story/\">on 20 February</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe longer he\u2019s there, the longer he\u2019s getting paid.

Artists who know Waterbury and are familiar with her experience reiterated those safety concerns.</p> <p>\u201cIf I knew that someone had been found guilty of misconduct, harassment or assault, I\u2019d feel incredibly uncomfortable with that person being in a place where they could be partnering me, or really anything backstage,\u201d said Jessica Altchiler, a sexual assault survivor who is currently part of a Broadway national tour.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0_xg28XY7o\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N0_xg28XY7o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After the sexual assault awareness advocate Bargelt\u2019s former classmates from the University of Utah <a href=\"http://www.balletnext.com/press-release-december-20-2018\">performed alongside Ramasar with BalletNext</a> last year, she wrote a letter to the school\u2019s dance community and leadership calling him \u201can exploitative sexual predator\u201d and questioning the decision-making that put her peers \u201cin harm\u2019s way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI just really didn\u2019t appreciate that he was allowed access to my friends, who are the same age as Alex, essentially,\u201d Bargelt said. \u201cThat seemed really not cool to me.\u201d</p> <p>West Side Story features a similarly green cast. Ramasar, a 20-year veteran of New York\u2019s most prominent stages, is the exception.

      "bodyText": "In the Broadway revival of West Side Story, Amar Ramasar pulls the actor who plays Anita in for a kiss and tosses her around the dance floor. He embodies his character Bernardo \u2013 sexy, intense \u2013 and his onstage girlfriend drapes over him like an accessory. At one point in the show, they burrow into each other as big and little spoons. Seconds later, she mounts him near center stage. Ramasar, 38, is starring in the Broadway revival less than two years after he was outed as a player in one of ballet\u2019s most infamous #MeToo moments. Not everyone\u2019s a fan of his onstage comeback. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone equally as talented who is deserving of this opportunity who isn\u2019t entangled in a sex scandal, you know?\u201d said Christina Bargelt, a professional ballerina and sexual assault awareness advocate and activist. \u201cPut in the understudy. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fabulous.\u201d \u201cText me those photos/videos!!\u201d Ramasar wrote to his former New York City Ballet colleague Chase Finlay. The latter obliged, sending images of his then girlfriend, Alexandra Waterbury, performing a sexual act, bare-breasted, according to a complaint filed in the state supreme court in Manhattan. Waterbury, now 22, is a student at Columbia University who trained at City Ballet\u2019s affiliated dance school. She has sworn an affidavit that she never gave Finlay permission to photograph her in the nude or capture her on camera while they were having sex, much less disseminate explicit images of her. \u201cI was assaulted. Several other women were assaulted. And like, there\u2019s proof of it,\u201d Waterbury told the Guardian. Ramasar, in turn, shared intimate pictures of a female City Ballet corps member with Finlay, among them an image of the woman\u2019s vagina, the complaint says. Their back-and-forth is part of a larger trove of correspondence that Waterbury unearthed on Finlay\u2019s computer between City Ballet dancers and donors, in which men compared women to \u201cfarm animals\u201d and \u201csluts\u201d and expressed the desire to \u201cviolate\u201d and \u201cabuse\u201d them. In one string of texts, Finlay suggested sharing Waterbury with Ramasar. According to photos of the messages provided to the Guardian, Ramasar wrote: \u201cI might need blow in order to try and f*** her!\u201d The West Side Story actor later insinuated that he planned to offer his own partner in exchange because he would owe Finlay. Beyond the texts, Waterbury has alleged that Ramasar would grope and kiss people at after-parties and gatherings. She had to ask Finlay to tell Ramasar to leave her alone because she didn\u2019t want to be touched. When the text scandal broke in 2018, Ramasar was a principal dancer with City Ballet and in the midst of his Broadway debut in Carousel. But, after concluding that he had indeed \u201cengaged in inappropriate communications\u201d, City Ballet suspended and then fired him and his fellow dancer Zachary Catazaro, who was also implicated (Finlay resigned). On 15 September 2018, Ramasar wrote on Instagram: \u201cUnfortunately we live in a time where allegations are taken as fact, and actions are made rashly and harshly.\u201d A few days later, he captioned another photo: \u201cThe messages exchanged between Mr. Finlay and myself were private and sent on personal time outside of work.\u201d He claimed that pictures he possessed of a female City Ballet dancer were of a \u201cconsenting adult\u201d and \u201cthe photos that were sent to me I have not circulated\u201d. Ramasar\u2019s exile from the spotlight lasted mere months. By January 2019, he wrote on social media about his \u201cnew home\u201d, Teatro Dell\u2019Opera Di Roma in Italy. That February, he returned to New York to perform with the dancer Michele Wiles\u2019 company BalletNext. And in April, he was ordered reinstated at City Ballet by an arbitrator who reportedly required him to undergo counseling but believed his termination the previous year had gone too far (the arbitrator\u2019s decision was not made public). \u201cAs I move forward, learning, and evolving, I am eager to once again dance amongst the colleagues I respect, doing the ballets I have held close to my heart for the past 18 years,\u201d Ramasar said at the time. By May, he was performing again as a principal dancer with City Ballet. Then, in July, a new adaptation of West Side Story produced by Scott Rudin and directed by the Tony Award winner Ivo van Hove announced Ramasar as Bernardo. In 10 months, he had gone full circle and ended up exactly where he left off: a favorite at City Ballet with a starring role on Broadway. Previews for West Side Story started in December, and the show will officially open on 20 February. \u201cThe longer he\u2019s there, the longer he\u2019s getting paid. The longer he\u2019s getting a good reputation. The longer he\u2019s kind of just, like, making all of this disappear,\u201d Waterbury said. Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the production, defended Ramasar\u2019s hiring by pointing to the arbitrator\u2019s call to reinstate him at City Ballet. \u201cThroughout that legal process, Amar received the full support of Actors Equity Association, and he is currently a member in good standing of the union,\u201d Miramontez wrote in a statement. \u201cWe are aligned with Actors Equity in its support of Amar\u2019s employment eligibility and his appearance in our production of West Side Story.\u201d But a different union appealed Ramasar\u2019s termination from City Ballet, and a spokesperson for Actors\u2019 Equity said it took no position on the arbitration. In terms of Ramasar\u2019s casting in West Side Story, Brandon Lorenz, communications director for Actors\u2019 Equity, said the union \u201cdid not make any hiring suggestions regarding any member of the West Side Story company\u201d and \u201chad no awareness of casting decisions for West Side Story before the cast was publicly announced\u201d. \u201cEquity did not communicate \u2018support\u2019 to the employer about any members of the company as part of the hiring process,\u201d Lorenz wrote in a statement. Miramontez declined for others involved in the production, including Ramasar, to answer questions for this article. Alisa Hurwitz, a clinical psychologist who specializes in sexual trauma and writes about theater and psychology, called the choice to cast Ramasar \u201cabsolutely, unequivocally irresponsible\u201d. Hurwitz believes that Ramasar\u2019s fellow dancers are either in active denial about the accusations leveled against him, or they\u2019re being made to feel unsafe because they\u2019re in such a physically intimate situation with him. Artists who know Waterbury and are familiar with her experience reiterated those safety concerns. \u201cIf I knew that someone had been found guilty of misconduct, harassment or assault, I\u2019d feel incredibly uncomfortable with that person being in a place where they could be partnering me, or really anything backstage,\u201d said Jessica Altchiler, a sexual assault survivor who is currently part of a Broadway national tour. After the sexual assault awareness advocate Bargelt\u2019s former classmates from the University of Utah performed alongside Ramasar with BalletNext last year, she wrote a letter to the school\u2019s dance community and leadership calling him \u201can exploitative sexual predator\u201d and questioning the decision-making that put her peers \u201cin harm\u2019s way\u201d. \u201cI just really didn\u2019t appreciate that he was allowed access to my friends, who are the same age as Alex, essentially,\u201d Bargelt said. \u201cThat seemed really not cool to me.\u201d West Side Story features a similarly green cast. Ramasar, a 20-year veteran of New York\u2019s most prominent stages, is the exception. The show has touted how dozens of performers are making their Broadway debuts. Some are still in college. Others graduated recently. The revival is being heralded as \u201cone of the most eagerly awaited productions of the 2019-2020 season\u201d. \u201cI hear such great things about 99% of it except for this,\u201d said Altchiler, referencing Ramasar\u2019s role. \u201cAnd unfortunately this situation \u2013 even though it might be pretty insignificant compared to however many positive things there are \u2013 it\u2019s everything. It changes everything for people who are informed, for people who have been victims.\u201d Ahead of the show\u2019s opening night, more than 21,000 signatures on a Change.org petition are calling to \u201cget Amar Ramasar off the stage\u201d. The 19-year-old college student and former dancer Megan Rabin, who created the petition, said she hoped Ramasar would be removed from the cast and his firing would serve as a precedent that people who violate women will be held accountable. Chris Peterson, founder and editor-in-chief of OnStage Blog, has advocated for theatergoers to boo Ramasar during his bows. \u201cIf one person boos, not only will Amar Ramasar hear it, but everyone around you will hear it, and it becomes a palpable, effective, impactful protest,\u201d Peterson told the Guardian. For her part, Hurwitz, the psychologist, said she would not be attending West Side Story because she did not want her money going to Ramasar and the people who hired him. Bargelt and Waterbury suggested that others follow suit. \u201cSay nobody shows up to West Side Story. They don\u2019t sell any tickets. And it\u2019s all because of Amar. What do you think they\u2019re gonna do? Fire Amar,\u201d Waterbury said. \u201cThe ticket buyers have all of the power, whether they know that or not.\u201d But the box office has been doing just fine. West Side Story has already broken a house record at the Broadway Theatre, where it is being performed. It has easily grossed more than $1m each week, even when one of its stars was injured and out of the show. At a Monday night performance in mid-January, a huge audience packed into the orchestra and mezzanine. When Ramasar took his bow, the actor who played Anita bowed alongside him. And no one booed \u2013 at least not loudly enough to hear.",

Only one procedural amendment garnered a single Republican vote, from Susan Collins of Maine. The 13-hour session came to an end just before 2am local time, with yet another straight party-line vote to approve guidelines for the trial unveiled by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, just a day earlier.</p> \n<p>Democrats accused Republicans of failing to commit to a fair impeachment trial and of engaging in a \u201ccover-up\u201d of misconduct by the president.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe president is engaged in this cover-up because he is guilty, and he knows it,\u201d said Representative Val Demings of Florida, one of the impeachment managers.</p> \n<p>A further opportunity for the senators to demand documents or witnesses was anticipated in the weeks ahead.

A long-shot two-thirds majority of senators present would be required to remove Trump from office.</p> \n<p>The supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts, gaveled the trial to order shortly after 1pm.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Senate will convene as a court of impeachment,\u201d Roberts said, proceeding to swear in one senator, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who missed the group swearing-in last week.</p> \n<p>Over the next 12 hours, Roberts stepped out of a strictly procedural role only once, after the manager Jerry Nadler accused any senator who voted against hearing from Bolton of casting a \u201ctreacherous vote\u201d and Cipollone demanded that Nadler apologize to Trump and his family.</p> \n<p>Admonishing both sides, Roberts noted that Senate rules and tradition required civil discourse. \u201cI do think that those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p> The opposing legal teams, seated in a cramped arrangement at tables stacked with paper at the base of the Senate rostrum, struck an immediate contrast in style and substance.</p> \n<p>While Trump\u2019s team attacked the conduct of the impeachment process in the House and resuscitated a call for more information about the whistleblower whose complaint launched the process, the Democrats appealed to the 100 senators before them.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey talk about how bad the House is \u2013 I don\u2019t agree with that at all,\u201d the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters during a break in the trial, referring to Trump\u2019s defense team. \u201cThey don\u2019t make a single argument why there shouldn\u2019t be witnesses or documents.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the hours wore on, certain rhythms and incongruities in the trial emerged. While the House managers used almost all of their allotted debate time, liberally deploying video clips drawn from public hearings last month, Trump\u2019s defense team used only a fraction of its time, repeating a blanket defense of the president\u2019s conduct and rarely referring to previous testimony in the case.</p> \n<p>To debate various proposed subpoenas, Schiff deployed one of the other seven managers to make a scripted case and then, after Trump\u2019s team had spoken, rose to deliver impromptu rebuttals.</p> \n<p>After the deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin said the Democratic request for new witnesses amounted to an admission that they were unprepared for trial, Schiff pounced, calling on Trump\u2019s former national security adviser and current acting chief of staff to appear.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1dfdbb1b669fbe3fdba7f1981a80de66d3a3494\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1dfdbb1b669fbe3fdba7f1981a80de66d3a3494/88_0_2635_1582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow speaks during the trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Jay Sekulow speaks during the trial.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe House calls John Bolton.

      "bodyText": "Democratic hopes that a moderate bloc of Senate Republicans would join their demand for witnesses and testimony at Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial were temporarily disappointed, if not dashed, as arguments on the first proper day of the trial extended past midnight into Wednesday morning. In seven consecutive votes split precisely along party lines, the Senate voted down Democratic proposals to subpoena testimony from four potential witnesses and documents from multiple government agencies. Four additional votes defeated proposals to ease the admission of documents and testimony and to relax related time restrictions. \u201cI know it\u2019s late, but it doesn\u2019t have to be late,\u201d Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment \u201cmanager\u201d, or prosecutor in the case, said as the proceedings entered their 12th hour. \u201cWe don\u2019t control the schedule. There is a reason why we are still here at five minutes till midnight, and that\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the American people to see what\u2019s going on here.\u201d Democrats fruitlessly called for testimony and documents from the former national security adviser John Bolton; the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney; Mulvaney\u2019s aide Robert Blair; the budget official Michael Duffey; the White House; the state department; the defense department; and the budget office relevant to an alleged scheme by Trump to twist the powers of the presidency to extract personal political favors from Ukraine. Each of the proposed subpoenas was defeated by a 53-47 vote. Only one procedural amendment garnered a single Republican vote, from Susan Collins of Maine. The 13-hour session came to an end just before 2am local time, with yet another straight party-line vote to approve guidelines for the trial unveiled by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, just a day earlier. Democrats accused Republicans of failing to commit to a fair impeachment trial and of engaging in a \u201ccover-up\u201d of misconduct by the president. \u201cThe president is engaged in this cover-up because he is guilty, and he knows it,\u201d said Representative Val Demings of Florida, one of the impeachment managers. A further opportunity for the senators to demand documents or witnesses was anticipated in the weeks ahead. But Schiff urged the senators to issue subpoenas before an allotted period for senators to question the legal teams. \u201cYou should want to see these documents,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cYou should want to know what these private emails and text messages have to say. \u201cThe American people want a fair trial,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut a great many Americans don\u2019t believe that will happen. Let\u2019s prove them wrong.\u201d Trump\u2019s defense team struck a combative posture, expressing outrage at what they said was unfair treatment of the president and accusing the House of an attack on democracy. \u201cThey\u2019re not here to steal one election, they\u2019re here to steal two elections,\u201d said Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel. \u201cThey won\u2019t tell you that. They don\u2019t have the guts to say it directly. But that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re here to do.\u201d The trial was scheduled to continue with late-night sessions starting on Wednesday afternoon and running into the weekend. A long-shot two-thirds majority of senators present would be required to remove Trump from office. The supreme court\u2019s chief justice, John Roberts, gaveled the trial to order shortly after 1pm. \u201cThe Senate will convene as a court of impeachment,\u201d Roberts said, proceeding to swear in one senator, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who missed the group swearing-in last week. Over the next 12 hours, Roberts stepped out of a strictly procedural role only once, after the manager Jerry Nadler accused any senator who voted against hearing from Bolton of casting a \u201ctreacherous vote\u201d and Cipollone demanded that Nadler apologize to Trump and his family. Admonishing both sides, Roberts noted that Senate rules and tradition required civil discourse. \u201cI do think that those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,\u201d he said. The opposing legal teams, seated in a cramped arrangement at tables stacked with paper at the base of the Senate rostrum, struck an immediate contrast in style and substance. While Trump\u2019s team attacked the conduct of the impeachment process in the House and resuscitated a call for more information about the whistleblower whose complaint launched the process, the Democrats appealed to the 100 senators before them. \u201cThey talk about how bad the House is \u2013 I don\u2019t agree with that at all,\u201d the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters during a break in the trial, referring to Trump\u2019s defense team. \u201cThey don\u2019t make a single argument why there shouldn\u2019t be witnesses or documents.\u201d As the hours wore on, certain rhythms and incongruities in the trial emerged. While the House managers used almost all of their allotted debate time, liberally deploying video clips drawn from public hearings last month, Trump\u2019s defense team used only a fraction of its time, repeating a blanket defense of the president\u2019s conduct and rarely referring to previous testimony in the case. To debate various proposed subpoenas, Schiff deployed one of the other seven managers to make a scripted case and then, after Trump\u2019s team had spoken, rose to deliver impromptu rebuttals. After the deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin said the Democratic request for new witnesses amounted to an admission that they were unprepared for trial, Schiff pounced, calling on Trump\u2019s former national security adviser and current acting chief of staff to appear. \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe House calls John Bolton. The House calls Mick Mulvaney. Let\u2019s get this trial started, shall we. \u201cWe are ready to present our case. We are ready to call witnesses. The question is, will you let us?\u201d Pounding the lectern, Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for Trump and talk-radio host, blazed through a series of conservative talking points and conspiracy theories ranging in focus from the special counsel Robert Mueller to the former attorney general Eric Holder. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a legal defense,\u201d tweeted Kate Brannen, editorial director of the Just Security website. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of impeachment jazz hands.\u201d After Cipollone delivered a terse statement declaring: \u201cThe president has done absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d Schiff took the lectern to reprise his description of Trump\u2019s alleged misconduct and to underscore the gravity of the moment. \u201cYou have all now sworn an oath,\u201d Schiff told the senators. \u201cTo do impartial justice. That oath binds you. That oath supersedes all else. Nothing matters now but the oath to do impartial justice. And that oath requires a fair trial.\u201d Trump is charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, in connection with his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. In the hours before the trial began, Democrats escalated their criticism, lambasting what they called a \u201ccover-up\u201d and a \u201crigged process\u201d designed to push key moments of the trial into the \u201cdark of night\u201d. If Democrats are to secure additional witnesses, they will need at least four Republicans to back them. A handful of moderates, including Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah, have indicated that they could support an effort to call witnesses \u2013 but only on the timeline outlined in a proposal advanced by McConnell. With the trial under way, Democrats continued to press Republicans to refuse McConnell\u2019s terms and work with them to reach a bipartisan solution. \u201cNo jury would be asked to operate on McConnell\u2019s absurdly compressed schedule,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker. \u201cIt is obvious that no senator who votes for it is intending to truly weigh the damning evidence of the president\u2019s attacks on our constitution.\u201d In their legal brief submitted to the Senate on Sunday, the House managers outlined their case, alleging Trump corruptly sought foreign interference in the 2020 election by pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations into his political opponents while withholding nearly $400m in military aid and dangling a coveted White House meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Kingdom faces fresh questions about conduct</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories from the Guardian this morning.</p> \n<p>Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world\u2019s richest man, had his phone \u201chacked\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince\">after receiving a WhatsApp message from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia</a>, Mohammed bin Salman, sources have told the Guardian. The message, sent during a friendly exchange between the pair, contained a malicious file that enabled Saudi agents to exfiltrate data from Bezos\u2019s phone within hours of him receiving the message in May 2018, forensic analysis has concluded. Security experts working for Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, only began examining his phone last January following the publication by the National Enquirer of a story about Bezos\u2019s affair with Lauren Sanchez.</p> \n<p>The revelation will increase unease in western capitals<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/revealed-the-saudi-heir-and-the-alleged-plot-to-undermine-jeff-bezos\"> about Saudi Arabia\u2019s aggressive targeting of its perceived enemies</a> after the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. It will also raise renewed questions about how the Enquirer, then owned by David Pecker, a media mogul with close links to Saudi Arabia and also Donald Trump, obtained Bezos\u2019s private text messages and why the publication appeared to be conducting a campaign against the Amazon boss.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Setbacks for Democrats \u2013 </strong>Hopes that moderate Republicans could help Democrats shift the rules of engagement in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/democrats-trump-impeachment-trial-rules\">were dashed this morning</a>. In votes along party lines, the Senate rejected a series of attempts to subpoena witnesses and force the White House to produce evidence. The votes, which included a bid to force former national security chief John Bolton to give evidence, came amid fierce debate on the first day of the president\u2019s impeachment trial, which began when chief justice John Roberts brought down his gavel to begin proceedings shortly after 1pm Washington time. There could be renewed efforts by Democrats to bring forward witnesses but for now they have been frustrated by what one called a \u201ccover-up\u201d. Republicans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-day-one\">stuck with their party</a> despite pressure on senators such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/trump-impeachment-trial-key-senators-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-susan-collins\">Mitt Romney and Susan Collins to shift ground</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Kingdom faces fresh questions about conduct Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories from the Guardian this morning. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world\u2019s richest man, had his phone \u201chacked\u201d after receiving a WhatsApp message from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, sources have told the Guardian. The message, sent during a friendly exchange between the pair, contained a malicious file that enabled Saudi agents to exfiltrate data from Bezos\u2019s phone within hours of him receiving the message in May 2018, forensic analysis has concluded. Security experts working for Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, only began examining his phone last January following the publication by the National Enquirer of a story about Bezos\u2019s affair with Lauren Sanchez. The revelation will increase unease in western capitals about Saudi Arabia\u2019s aggressive targeting of its perceived enemies after the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. It will also raise renewed questions about how the Enquirer, then owned by David Pecker, a media mogul with close links to Saudi Arabia and also Donald Trump, obtained Bezos\u2019s private text messages and why the publication appeared to be conducting a campaign against the Amazon boss. * * * Setbacks for Democrats \u2013 Hopes that moderate Republicans could help Democrats shift the rules of engagement in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial were dashed this morning. In votes along party lines, the Senate rejected a series of attempts to subpoena witnesses and force the White House to produce evidence. The votes, which included a bid to force former national security chief John Bolton to give evidence, came amid fierce debate on the first day of the president\u2019s impeachment trial, which began when chief justice John Roberts brought down his gavel to begin proceedings shortly after 1pm Washington time. There could be renewed efforts by Democrats to bring forward witnesses but for now they have been frustrated by what one called a \u201ccover-up\u201d. Republicans stuck with their party despite pressure on senators such as Mitt Romney and Susan Collins to shift ground. Trump was in Davos where he warned business and political leaders not to listen to the \u201cprophets of doom\u201d on climate change. * * * Dementia \u2018dump\u2019 \u2013 Emergency hospital admissions for people with dementia have risen by more than a third in five years, a new study shows, as sufferers are increasingly being \u201cdumped\u201d on the health service. There were more than 379,000 emergency admissions in England for people with dementia in 2017-18, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society says, a rise of one third on 2012-13. The NHS data also showed that 40,000 people stayed in hospital more than a month after their admission. * * * Mutation risk \u2013 China warned that the outbreak of coronavirus that has killed nine people and infected another 440 could \u201cmutate\u201d as it spreads around the country. Health officials said they feared the upcoming lunar new year holiday could increase the risk of contagion and announced measures to minimise large crowds and increase temperature checks and screening. Wuhan, the central city suspected of being the epicentre of the outbreak, has been placed into lockdown with its 11 million residents advised not to leave. * * * Online crackdown \u2013 Technology companies will be forced to take more measures to protect children from online abuse and predators in a crackdown planned for next year by the information watchdog. Firms will be have to assess their sites for sexual abuse risks, prevent content that could lead to self-harm or suicide, and block children from broadcasting their location. They could face heavy fines if they fail to comply. * * * Labouring on \u2013 The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn is hurtling along with two significant developments. First Jess Phillips pulled out of the race, lifting the prospects of Wigan MP Lisa Nandy, who is now backed by the powerful GMB union. Our columnist Zoe Williams thinks Kier Starmer\u2019s \u201csoft left\u201d credentials are just the thing to unite the party. Also, in the first part of a new series, there\u2019s a must-read piece from our political editor Heather Stewart about how Labour\u2019s election campaign was undermined by tactical spats, mixed messages and frayed tempers as the party\u2019s hierarchy struggled to find the right strategy on Brexit. * * * Royal wrangle \u2013 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are threatening legal action over photographs taken of Meghan while walking in the woods on Vancouver Island, their new home in Canada. The couple say the pictures were taken without their permission by photographers hiding in bushes. The latest flashpoint with the media came hours after Harry arrived in the country to begin a new life which they hope will take them out of the spotlight. Channel 5 will tonight broadcast an interview with Meghan\u2019s estranged father, Thomas Markle, in which he attempts to defend his reputation and denies doing \u201ctrashy things\u201d. Today in Focus podcast: Zo\u00eb Brock v Harvey Weinstein Like dozens of women in the entertainment industry, the actor, model and writer Zo\u00eb Brock has claimed she had a traumatic encounter with the film producer Harvey Weinstein. Now she is faced with a settlement offer that she believes would allow him to escape blame for the alleged assaults. Also today: Lily Kuo on the spread of the deadly coronavirus in China. Lunchtime read: Kitty the nation \u2013 how cats leave us divided An unlikely legal battle over a cat in west London captured headlines when a couple were forced to go to court to enforce their ownership after a neighbour allegedly tried to adopt it. Far from being a one-off case, it seems our feline friends (or enemies) are divisive pets. From one family in rural Scotland being shunned for having the temerity to ask the local landowner not to shoot their cat to the woman forced to move house after her cat ate all the frogs in her neighbour\u2019s pond, we look at how the humble domestic moggy can cause a lot of spilt milk. Sport David Luiz saw red in the first half but Arsenal twice battled back to secure a point in the London derby against Chelsea. Sergio Ag\u00fcero secured a win off the bench for Manchester City against Sheffield United when the defending champions appeared in danger of being held for a second successive game. Crowd favourite and world No 1 Ashleigh Barty remains on track to win her home grand slam after brushing aside Polona Hercog in the Australian Open. Premiership Rugby has rejected any suggestion that other leading clubs may be breaching the salary cap following Saracens\u2019 relegation to the Championship. In a critical look at the short form of cricket, Vic Marks writes that the England Under-19s team struggling at the World Cup still underpin Joe Root\u2019s Test side. Mo Farah has waded into the row over whether his blood and urine samples should be retested as part of an investigation into the Nike Oregon Project, insisting he is more than happy for the authorities to do so. Business The Turkish conglomerate Cengiz Holdings could step in to buy British Steel if a planned \u00a350m sale to the Chinese industrial firm Jingye falls through, the Guardian understands. Donald Trump boasted at Davos that the US was undergoing an unprecedented economic boom and financial markets liked his optimism, sending stocks higher on most Asian bourses. The FTSE100 is due for a modest rise this morning while the pound is \u00a31.305 and \u20ac1.177. The papers The Times leads on news from Davos with \u201cTrump calls for \u2018prophets of doom\u2019 to be rejected\u201d, as does the i with a different take: \u201cEarth\u2019s No1 climate change denier\u201d. The Telegraph has \u201cTech giants to be bound by code of conduct\u201d and the Metro agrees that\u2019s the top story under a headline saying \u201cSafety net\u201d. The Guardian has \u201cAmazon boss Jeff Bezos\u2019s phone \u2018hacked by Saudi crown prince\u201d while the Mail leads with royals closer to home. \u201cDiana\u2019s niece milking it, too!\u201d it says, in a story about Lady Kitty Spencer promoting milk sales in China. The Express is interested in a \u201cCrackdown on soft justice\u201d it says is planned by the government. The red tops agree that Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s illness is the top story. \u201cOzzy: I have Parkinson\u2019s \u2026 I can\u2019t hide my pain any more\u201d says the Mirror while the Sun has \u201cOzzy: I hid my Parkinson\u2019s for a year\u201d.

She was slicing and dicing and getting everything. I was, like: \u2018Can I just hit a winner already?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She hit 20 of them, to Zheng\u2019s seven, and converted half of her 12 breaks in what, from outside the court, looked like a routine win \u2013 even though she had to skip to avoid stepping on \u2026 an insect. \u201cThere are a lot of birds on that court,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was practising, Wim [Fissette, her coach] tried to move a bug and it flew away, but then the bird just ate it mid-air.

She struggled at the start, losing her serve twice but made it tough for Pliskova in a stubborn passage of play at the end of the set, forcing her to save two break points before getting over the line.

      "bodyText": "Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff, two of the most precocious talents tennis has had in many years, are on track to meet in the third round of the Australian Open on Friday. The defending champion will start favourite, having beaten the American teenager handily at Flushing Meadows six months ago, but will take nothing for granted. They won in contrasting styles on Wednesday, Osaka having the easier time of it over two sets against the unseeded Saisai Zheng in an hour and 20 minutes on Margaret Court Arena, while Gauff, the youngest player in either draw at 15, had to dig deep to beat the seasoned Romanian Sorana Cirstea, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, in a thriller that lasted just over two hours on the Melbourne Arena. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what different personalities can bring to the sport,\u201d Osaka said of Gauff. \u201cSince she is so young, she has brought so much interest and a new wave. She played doubles in one of the stadiums at the US Open last year and it was full. That is not normal and I don\u2019t think it is something that can be taken for granted.\u201d Gauff, still riding high after putting Venus Williams out of a slam in the first round for the second time, said courtside of Osaka: \u201cI know what to expect in the next round. She\u2019s a great competitor. I know it\u2019s going to be a good one.\u201d She paid tribute to the crowd for lifting her when she was love-three down in the deciding set. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get so much support in Australia. They cheered me on to win. I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m glad I have their support. I have that will to win.\u201d Osaka, who entertains as much in her post-match deliberations as on the court, said after her 6-2, 6-4 win: \u201cI got very frustrated in the second set, and it\u2019s something that I knew would happen, but I didn\u2019t know the scale, like, what she would do to make me frustrated. She was slicing and dicing and getting everything. I was, like: \u2018Can I just hit a winner already?\u2019\u201d She hit 20 of them, to Zheng\u2019s seven, and converted half of her 12 breaks in what, from outside the court, looked like a routine win \u2013 even though she had to skip to avoid stepping on \u2026 an insect. \u201cThere are a lot of birds on that court,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was practising, Wim [Fissette, her coach] tried to move a bug and it flew away, but then the bird just ate it mid-air. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you this, but in my mind it fits the story.\u201d Osaka has switched coaches again, from Jermain Jenkins to Fissette, who helped Johanna Konta to the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2017 and recently left Victoria Azarenka \u2013 which is part of the merry-go-round for hired help on the women\u2019s tour. Sascha Bajin, who hit with Serena Williams for many years, coached Osaka to her first slam in New York two Septembers ago. Bajin has since joined the exciting teenager, Dayana Yastremska, who made the final in Adelaide against Ashleigh Barty on Saturday, but lost to Caroline Wozniacki. The 29-year-old Dane, who retires after this tournament, came from two breaks down in the second set to win, 7-5, 7-5, and is one win away from a fourth-round match against her best friend, Serena Williams after the American beat Slovakia\u2019s world No 70 Tamara Zidansek with minimum fuss 6-2, 6-3. Heather Watson won her postponed first-round match, conquering the swirling wind on an outside court, and the steady tennis of Krystina Pliskova. She struggled at the start, losing her serve twice but made it tough for Pliskova in a stubborn passage of play at the end of the set, forcing her to save two break points before getting over the line. Watson took that energy into the second set and dominated most of the exchanges, breaking to level at a set apiece. Pliskova was now fading under the consistent pressure from the back of the court, as Watson rallied her into submission in the third. The mistakes piled up for the languid Czech, who continued to go for her shots but found the net an inconvenience. A final wayward shot from the baseline ended her agony. Watson out-served her, made fewer mistakes and hit more clean winners, including nine aces in just under two hours to win, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. It was an impressive, solid performance to go with her run to the semi-finals in Hobart last week and, given she looked stronger as the match went on, should be in good shape, mentally and physically, for Elise Mertens in the second round. \u201cIt was super windy today,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI felt prepared because it was like that in Hobart a lot of the days. Being the first-round match and it being postponed, I was a bit nervous in the first set, a bit tense. After the first set, I managed to loosen up, relax and start enjoying it. I thought my game improved more and more as the match went on.\u201d She said growing up in windy Guernsey has helped her in such conditions. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the wind at all.

      "body": "<p>Forget teenagers with asbos or improperly demarcated boundary fences. Cats are the great neighbourhood menace of our age, as likely to rip apart once-harmonious communities as Japanese knotweed. They pad between homes, destroying civic feeling, pitting us against each other in our search for their devotion. Think politics creates division? Cats are worse.</p> <p>Last week, it was reported that a Hammersmith couple, John and Jackie Hall, had waged a legal battle to prevent a nearby resident, Nicola Lesbirel, from stealing their maine coon, Ozzy. The Halls accused Lesbirel of repeatedly feeding Ozzy, taking him into her house and replacing Ozzy\u2019s collar with one that had Lesbirel\u2019s phone number and the words \u201cMy home\u201d on it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dbb5a3ac6bd8a03bd98d555d3e118eb51188ee67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb5a3ac6bd8a03bd98d555d3e118eb51188ee67/1002_324_2175_2176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ozzy, the maine coon at the centre of a legal dispute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ozzy, the maine coon at the centre of a legal dispute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Champion News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the situation escalated, emails were exchanged. \u201cHe is very loved and well cared for and he is very attached to his territory, and to me,\u201d Lesbirel wrote. \u201cSurely leaving him where he is determined to be and where you can be reassured he is settled and happy and healthy is the best thing for everyone involved, both feline and human.\u201d Jackie responded: \u201cHe is not your cat and we are not just giving him over to you.\u201d In a subsequent email to Lesbirel, she wrote: \u201c\u2018The question we all have asked ourselves year after year: why doesn\u2019t Nicola just get her own cat? Why can\u2019t she just leave ours alone?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sad case,\u201d says the Halls\u2019 barrister, Tom Weisselberg QC. \u201cIf she\u2019d seen sense, everyone\u2019s time and money would have been saved.\u201d He worked pro bono on the case, because the Halls are friends. There are few legal options for someone wanting to stop their neighbour stealing their cat. Technically, it\u2019s theft, but generally the police won\u2019t get involved. \u201cYou have to show that they intend to deprive you permanently of possession,\u201d Weisselberg says. \u201cThat\u2019s a high threshold to satisfy.\u201d</p> <p>When he was a junior barrister, Weisselberg worked on a legal dispute between Kuwait Airways and Iraqi Airways. The Kuwaitis argued, <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldjudgmt/jd020516/kuwait-4.htm\" title=\"\">successfully</a>, that the Iraqis had in effect stolen some Kuwaiti planes, because they had painted their own colours on them, thereby converting them. \u201cI said: \u2018Look, if the Kuwaitis can say the Iraqis converted their aircraft by putting different colours on the planes, why can\u2019t you say the defendant has converted your cat by changing its collar?\u2019\u201d Weisselberg planned to use this precedent in court but, at the courthouse door, Lesbirel agreed to a number of restrictions on contact with Ozzy.</p> <p>Ozzy isn\u2019t the only cat tearing communities asunder. \u201cWe thought it would be our forever home,\u201d sighs Lana, 49, a company director from London. In 2017, Lana, her husband, their children and their three cats moved to rural Scotland. It was a stretch to take on the mortgage, but it was the home they had always dreamed of and the neighbours were welcoming \u2013 at first.</p> <p>In October, however, the shooting season started. \u201cA neighbour said: \u2018I\u2019d keep your cats in. We know the groundskeeper has shot 12 cats to stop them taking the game birds.\u201d Lana and her husband were appalled, but thought that, if they reasoned with the local landowner, he would have his gamekeeper leave the cats alone. They were wrong. \u201cHe said: \u2018It\u2019s my land, I\u2019ll do what the hell I like. Who do you think you are? You\u2019re not even from round here!\u2019\u201d Once-friendly neighbours took his side. \u201cWe were shunned. He had a lot of influence in the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fec9b73832a46660fe371771b8f74f998db1dde1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec9b73832a46660fe371771b8f74f998db1dde1/0_286_4560_2735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Francis with Moustachio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Francis with Moustachio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fearful for their cats\u2019 safety \u2013 they were worried the gamekeeper might shoot into their garden \u2013 they erected a six-foot fence. Being ostracised in a close-knit rural community took its toll. \u201cNo one would talk to us. You\u2019d go into the pub and people would turn their backs on you. From a mental health point of view, it impacted us a lot.\u201d They started finding rocks on their driveway. Eventually they sold up. They now live in a rented house in France, where their cats are free to roam again.</p> <p>Sam Francis\u2019s garden is constantly under attack. The assailant is an unneutered tom cat whom she has nicknamed Little Big Balls. \u201cAt first I thought he was quite cute,\u201d says the 43-year-old arts producer from Weston-super-Mare. \u201cThen the bullying started.\u201d Little Big Balls is a remorseless playground thug. \u201cHe would run across the garden and just go for my cat, Moustachio. If Moustachio was outside, Little Big Balls would attack him.\u201d Moustachio became too terrified to go outside.</p> <p>After doing some research, Francis bought a small water pistol; she would spray Little Big Balls when he swaggered into her garden. It seemed to be working \u2013 until his owner got wind of it. \u201cHe ripped into me,\u201d says Francis. \u201cSaying: \u2018You\u2019re terrorising my cat, you\u2019re obviously an animal hater.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m just trying to protect my cat,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Cats can go wherever they like!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For a while, Francis and Moustachio mostly stayed indoors. Francis was avoiding her neighbour and Moustachio was fearful of Little Big Balls. But now Francis is venturing outdoors again. \u201cI can\u2019t be held hostage by a cat,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a flutter of discomfort when I\u2019m out in the garden.\u201d When Francis tries to shoo Little Big Balls away now, he doesn\u2019t even move. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care. He knows I\u2019m not a threat to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so naughty!\u201d says Gina Burnside, a 33-year-old payroll processor from Darlington, of her shorthair rescue cat, Hector. Naughty might be an understatement: Hector is one of the reasons Burnside moved house, after her relationship with the elderly couple who lived next door became unbearably tense. Why? Because Hector is about as expansionist as Napoleon, only more merciless. First there were the frogs. \u201cThey had a frog pond until Hector moved in,\u201d Burnside groans. \u201cHe caught every single one.\u201d</p> <p>Burnside apologised, but the couple were clearly annoyed. Dumping Hector back over the fence, they would make passive-aggressive remarks. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Here he is \u2013 <em>again</em>,\u2019\u201d Burnside says. \u201cBut I could tell it wasn\u2019t a joke.\u201d Things became so fraught that Burnside would watch their movements out of the window, so that she didn\u2019t put the bins out at the same time. Then came Hector\u2019s most aggressive move yet. \u201cMy husband came in one day and said: \u2018Hector\u2019s eating the chicken you left out for dinner. I said: \u2018We\u2019re not having chicken.\u2019\u201d Hector had stolen it from their table. \u201cWe tried to take it off him, but there was nothing we could do! He was tearing all over the garden with it.\u2019\u201d Burnside couldn\u2019t face the confrontation, so she did the sensible thing and sold the house. The neighbours didn\u2019t come to say goodbye.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/13/are-pets-really-good-for-us-or-just-hairy-health-hazards\">Are pets really good for us \u2013 or just hairy health hazards?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s going on in a cat\u2019s brain when it maraudes into a neighbour\u2019s garden? \u201cIt could be hungry,\u201d muses Sheila Hamilton Andrews, <a href=\"http://www.dogandcatbehaviour.co.uk/id7.html\" title=\"\">a cat behaviour</a><a href=\"http://www.dogandcatbehaviour.co.uk/id7.html\" title=\"\"> expert</a>. \u201cIt could be cold.

The 52-year-old from London says he worries that, if he sees them, \u201cI\u2019m going to lose my temper again\u201d. It all started when his cat, Bob, started disappearing for long stretches of time. He put up posters and posted notes through people\u2019s doors. Eventually, his neighbours called \u2013 Bob was living in their house, gaining access through a garden window. Mike went around. Could they please keep the window closed, so Bob would stop getting in? They refused. Mike lost it. \u201cThey were completely incapable of seeing how upsetting it was,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Bob continues to spend all his time at the neighbours, but returns to Mike to be fed. He doesn\u2019t know if they feed him. Mike offered the neighbours ownership of Bob, but changed his mind when they refused to put in a cat flap and went on holiday for a week, leaving Bob in their garden. The situation is at an all-time low: he has considered suing them, but worries the legal bills would be too expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s my cat,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2817e8f6f981cb61eceb9c105a5c678f4497f350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2817e8f6f981cb61eceb9c105a5c678f4497f350/834_0_2499_2500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He\u2019s so naughty\u2019: Gina Burnside and her rescue cat, Hector.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He\u2019s so naughty\u2019: Gina Burnside and her rescue cat, Hector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mike\u2019s experience is not unique. \u201cIn the last three years, we\u2019ve dealt with more incidents of cat theft than ever before,\u201d says the pet detective Colin Butcher. His outfit, <a href=\"https://thepetdetectives.com/about_us.php\" title=\"\">The Pet Detectives</a>, specialises in returning cats to their owners. Butcher differentiates between \u201ccat seduction\u201d \u2013 which is when neighbours allow the cat into their home and feed it, but ultimately let it go \u2013 and outright theft. \u201cThe vast majority of cat-seduction cases will become theft if individuals are not stopped,\u201d Butcher warns. How can you tell if someone is interfering with your feline friend? He suggests that if your cat is gaining weight, returning home smelling unusual or is newly groomed, these are signs someone else has their eye on your pet.</p> <p>A lot of people don\u2019t realise they are stealing someone else\u2019s cat: they think they are taking in a stray. (There are few genuine strays.) But some are shameless. \u201cI\u2019ve had cases where we\u2019ve filmed people chucking a cat into the back of a removal van and moving down the road,\u201d Butcher says. \u201cWe stop them and they say: \u2018Oh, we have no idea how the cat got in!\u2019 But there are cat bowls and litter trays in there, so you know they planned the theft.\u201d</p> <p>Butcher, a retired police detective inspector, uses the skills he learned in 15 years on the force to cajole neighbours into returning the cats. \u201cI can be very persuasive,\u201d he says. He carries a letter around with him from Surrey police\u2019s chief constable, confirming that cat snatching is a crime. \u201cI show them the letter and say: \u2018You need to be sensible, now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Most cases end amicably: shamefaced neighbours return the cat, everyone moves on. But there are a few cases that haunt him. These involve so-called collectors: serial predators who trawl the streets, looking for cats to steal. \u201cThere\u2019s a crazy cat lady on every street,\u201d Butcher says seriously. \u201cThey are always women.\u201d The worst case he ever worked on involved a collector who had lured 16 cats from their owners and locked them in her attic.</p> <p>Carolyn Sherlock\u2019s cat Tigger was stolen by a collector. The 54-year-old local government worker\u2019s former neighbour had a play shed for cats in her garden; she would feed them roast lamb. When Tigger disappeared, Sherlock did not suspect one of her neighbours could have taken him. But, one day, Sherlock went around to her neighbour\u2019s on an unrelated matter and was stunned to find Tigger on a rug in front of the fire. \u201cShe said: \u2018He\u2019s been living here for a while.

Her house was full of what she would call \u201cwaifs and strays\u201d, but could probably be more accurately described as \u201cother people\u2019s cats\u201d.

Anna used to feed the cat when her neighbours were at work, until things turned acrimonious. \u201cTheir child stands by the fence and shouts: \u2018You\u2019ve stolen my cat!

Really, it is not the cat\u2019s fault. They are just doing what is natural. Butcher tells me that about 50% of cats have a second home they frequent regularly. He has heard of four people believing they own the same cat. Cats are sensitive to changes in their home environment: new babies, flooring or pets may prompt them to relocate.</p> <p>It is a disobliging truth: cats do not obey humans. Their capriciousness is legendary, their cynicism ancient. There is probably a cave painting of a cat skulking away from its owner in search of a warmer fire. \u201cYou cannot reduce a cat to a possession, because it will not allow it to happen,\u201d says Butcher. \u201cIt\u2019s too wilful.\u201d</p> <p>You can never really own a cat, only rent its affections for a while. One day, it will slink out of the door: a heartless courtesan, in search of a better prospect.</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Forget teenagers with asbos or improperly demarcated boundary fences. Cats are the great neighbourhood menace of our age, as likely to rip apart once-harmonious communities as Japanese knotweed. They pad between homes, destroying civic feeling, pitting us against each other in our search for their devotion. Think politics creates division? Cats are worse. Last week, it was reported that a Hammersmith couple, John and Jackie Hall, had waged a legal battle to prevent a nearby resident, Nicola Lesbirel, from stealing their maine coon, Ozzy. The Halls accused Lesbirel of repeatedly feeding Ozzy, taking him into her house and replacing Ozzy\u2019s collar with one that had Lesbirel\u2019s phone number and the words \u201cMy home\u201d on it. As the situation escalated, emails were exchanged. \u201cHe is very loved and well cared for and he is very attached to his territory, and to me,\u201d Lesbirel wrote. \u201cSurely leaving him where he is determined to be and where you can be reassured he is settled and happy and healthy is the best thing for everyone involved, both feline and human.\u201d Jackie responded: \u201cHe is not your cat and we are not just giving him over to you.\u201d In a subsequent email to Lesbirel, she wrote: \u201c\u2018The question we all have asked ourselves year after year: why doesn\u2019t Nicola just get her own cat? Why can\u2019t she just leave ours alone?\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a sad case,\u201d says the Halls\u2019 barrister, Tom Weisselberg QC. \u201cIf she\u2019d seen sense, everyone\u2019s time and money would have been saved.\u201d He worked pro bono on the case, because the Halls are friends. There are few legal options for someone wanting to stop their neighbour stealing their cat. Technically, it\u2019s theft, but generally the police won\u2019t get involved. \u201cYou have to show that they intend to deprive you permanently of possession,\u201d Weisselberg says. \u201cThat\u2019s a high threshold to satisfy.\u201d When he was a junior barrister, Weisselberg worked on a legal dispute between Kuwait Airways and Iraqi Airways. The Kuwaitis argued, successfully, that the Iraqis had in effect stolen some Kuwaiti planes, because they had painted their own colours on them, thereby converting them. \u201cI said: \u2018Look, if the Kuwaitis can say the Iraqis converted their aircraft by putting different colours on the planes, why can\u2019t you say the defendant has converted your cat by changing its collar?\u2019\u201d Weisselberg planned to use this precedent in court but, at the courthouse door, Lesbirel agreed to a number of restrictions on contact with Ozzy. Ozzy isn\u2019t the only cat tearing communities asunder. \u201cWe thought it would be our forever home,\u201d sighs Lana, 49, a company director from London. In 2017, Lana, her husband, their children and their three cats moved to rural Scotland. It was a stretch to take on the mortgage, but it was the home they had always dreamed of and the neighbours were welcoming \u2013 at first. In October, however, the shooting season started. \u201cA neighbour said: \u2018I\u2019d keep your cats in. We know the groundskeeper has shot 12 cats to stop them taking the game birds.\u201d Lana and her husband were appalled, but thought that, if they reasoned with the local landowner, he would have his gamekeeper leave the cats alone. They were wrong. \u201cHe said: \u2018It\u2019s my land, I\u2019ll do what the hell I like. Who do you think you are? You\u2019re not even from round here!\u2019\u201d Once-friendly neighbours took his side. \u201cWe were shunned. He had a lot of influence in the community.\u201d Fearful for their cats\u2019 safety \u2013 they were worried the gamekeeper might shoot into their garden \u2013 they erected a six-foot fence. Being ostracised in a close-knit rural community took its toll. \u201cNo one would talk to us. You\u2019d go into the pub and people would turn their backs on you. From a mental health point of view, it impacted us a lot.\u201d They started finding rocks on their driveway. Eventually they sold up. They now live in a rented house in France, where their cats are free to roam again. Sam Francis\u2019s garden is constantly under attack. The assailant is an unneutered tom cat whom she has nicknamed Little Big Balls. \u201cAt first I thought he was quite cute,\u201d says the 43-year-old arts producer from Weston-super-Mare. \u201cThen the bullying started.\u201d Little Big Balls is a remorseless playground thug. \u201cHe would run across the garden and just go for my cat, Moustachio. If Moustachio was outside, Little Big Balls would attack him.\u201d Moustachio became too terrified to go outside. After doing some research, Francis bought a small water pistol; she would spray Little Big Balls when he swaggered into her garden. It seemed to be working \u2013 until his owner got wind of it. \u201cHe ripped into me,\u201d says Francis. \u201cSaying: \u2018You\u2019re terrorising my cat, you\u2019re obviously an animal hater.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m just trying to protect my cat,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Cats can go wherever they like!\u2019\u201d For a while, Francis and Moustachio mostly stayed indoors. Francis was avoiding her neighbour and Moustachio was fearful of Little Big Balls. But now Francis is venturing outdoors again. \u201cI can\u2019t be held hostage by a cat,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a flutter of discomfort when I\u2019m out in the garden.\u201d When Francis tries to shoo Little Big Balls away now, he doesn\u2019t even move. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care. He knows I\u2019m not a threat to him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s so naughty!\u201d says Gina Burnside, a 33-year-old payroll processor from Darlington, of her shorthair rescue cat, Hector. Naughty might be an understatement: Hector is one of the reasons Burnside moved house, after her relationship with the elderly couple who lived next door became unbearably tense. Why? Because Hector is about as expansionist as Napoleon, only more merciless. First there were the frogs. \u201cThey had a frog pond until Hector moved in,\u201d Burnside groans. \u201cHe caught every single one.\u201d Burnside apologised, but the couple were clearly annoyed. Dumping Hector back over the fence, they would make passive-aggressive remarks. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Here he is \u2013 again,\u2019\u201d Burnside says. \u201cBut I could tell it wasn\u2019t a joke.\u201d Things became so fraught that Burnside would watch their movements out of the window, so that she didn\u2019t put the bins out at the same time. Then came Hector\u2019s most aggressive move yet. \u201cMy husband came in one day and said: \u2018Hector\u2019s eating the chicken you left out for dinner. I said: \u2018We\u2019re not having chicken.\u2019\u201d Hector had stolen it from their table. \u201cWe tried to take it off him, but there was nothing we could do! He was tearing all over the garden with it.\u2019\u201d Burnside couldn\u2019t face the confrontation, so she did the sensible thing and sold the house. The neighbours didn\u2019t come to say goodbye. What\u2019s going on in a cat\u2019s brain when it maraudes into a neighbour\u2019s garden? \u201cIt could be hungry,\u201d muses Sheila Hamilton Andrews, a cat behaviour expert. \u201cIt could be cold. It could just feel like a bit of attention.\u201d I ask Andrews whether cats love their owners. \u201cHa!\u201d she says cheerily. \u201cThey become attached. You can interpret that as you will.\u201d Mike just avoids his neighbours. The 52-year-old from London says he worries that, if he sees them, \u201cI\u2019m going to lose my temper again\u201d. It all started when his cat, Bob, started disappearing for long stretches of time. He put up posters and posted notes through people\u2019s doors. Eventually, his neighbours called \u2013 Bob was living in their house, gaining access through a garden window. Mike went around. Could they please keep the window closed, so Bob would stop getting in? They refused. Mike lost it. \u201cThey were completely incapable of seeing how upsetting it was,\u201d he says. Bob continues to spend all his time at the neighbours, but returns to Mike to be fed. He doesn\u2019t know if they feed him. Mike offered the neighbours ownership of Bob, but changed his mind when they refused to put in a cat flap and went on holiday for a week, leaving Bob in their garden. The situation is at an all-time low: he has considered suing them, but worries the legal bills would be too expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s my cat,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d Mike\u2019s experience is not unique. \u201cIn the last three years, we\u2019ve dealt with more incidents of cat theft than ever before,\u201d says the pet detective Colin Butcher. His outfit, The Pet Detectives, specialises in returning cats to their owners. Butcher differentiates between \u201ccat seduction\u201d \u2013 which is when neighbours allow the cat into their home and feed it, but ultimately let it go \u2013 and outright theft. \u201cThe vast majority of cat-seduction cases will become theft if individuals are not stopped,\u201d Butcher warns. How can you tell if someone is interfering with your feline friend? He suggests that if your cat is gaining weight, returning home smelling unusual or is newly groomed, these are signs someone else has their eye on your pet. A lot of people don\u2019t realise they are stealing someone else\u2019s cat: they think they are taking in a stray. (There are few genuine strays.) But some are shameless. \u201cI\u2019ve had cases where we\u2019ve filmed people chucking a cat into the back of a removal van and moving down the road,\u201d Butcher says. \u201cWe stop them and they say: \u2018Oh, we have no idea how the cat got in!\u2019 But there are cat bowls and litter trays in there, so you know they planned the theft.\u201d Butcher, a retired police detective inspector, uses the skills he learned in 15 years on the force to cajole neighbours into returning the cats. \u201cI can be very persuasive,\u201d he says. He carries a letter around with him from Surrey police\u2019s chief constable, confirming that cat snatching is a crime. \u201cI show them the letter and say: \u2018You need to be sensible, now.\u2019\u201d Most cases end amicably: shamefaced neighbours return the cat, everyone moves on. But there are a few cases that haunt him. These involve so-called collectors: serial predators who trawl the streets, looking for cats to steal. \u201cThere\u2019s a crazy cat lady on every street,\u201d Butcher says seriously. \u201cThey are always women.\u201d The worst case he ever worked on involved a collector who had lured 16 cats from their owners and locked them in her attic. Carolyn Sherlock\u2019s cat Tigger was stolen by a collector. The 54-year-old local government worker\u2019s former neighbour had a play shed for cats in her garden; she would feed them roast lamb. When Tigger disappeared, Sherlock did not suspect one of her neighbours could have taken him. But, one day, Sherlock went around to her neighbour\u2019s on an unrelated matter and was stunned to find Tigger on a rug in front of the fire. \u201cShe said: \u2018He\u2019s been living here for a while. He likes the underfloor heating in our conservatory.\u2019\u201d Sherlock was angry. \u201cWe\u2019d looked for her for weeks and she hadn\u2019t had the courtesy to say: \u2018Your cat moved in with me!\u2019\u201d Tigger wasn\u2019t the only cat she had lured. Her house was full of what she would call \u201cwaifs and strays\u201d, but could probably be more accurately described as \u201cother people\u2019s cats\u201d. When Tigger died, the neighbour buried him in her garden. Butcher tries to see the humanity in cat snatchers. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re evil people 95% of the time; they really care about the cat,\u201d he says. For instance, there is Anna, a retiree from north Yorkshire. As we speak, she is watching her neighbour\u2019s cat shiver in her garden. Anna used to feed the cat when her neighbours were at work, until things turned acrimonious. \u201cTheir child stands by the fence and shouts: \u2018You\u2019ve stolen my cat! I want my cat back!\u2019\u201d Now Anna feels uncomfortable around the neighbours, but mostly sorry for the cat. \u201cIt breaks my heart that I can\u2019t let her in.\u201d It is easy to pin neighbourhood strife on cats.

First, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/xr-extinction-rebellion-listed-extremist-ideology-police-prevent-scheme-guidance\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that counter-terrorism police in south-east England have listed Extinction Rebellion (XR) and the youth climate strikes as forms of \u201cideological extremism\u201d. Then teachers and officials around the country reported that they had been told, in briefings by the anti-radicalisation Prevent programme, to look out for people expressing support for XR and Greenpeace.</p> <p>Then the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/17/greenpeace-included-with-neo-nazis-on-uk-counter-terror-list\" title=\"\">found</a> a Counter Terrorism Policing guide to the signs and symbols used by various groups. Alongside terrorists and violent extremist organisations, the guide listed Greenpeace, XR, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, CND, the Socialist party, Stop the War and other peaceful green and left organisations. Then the newspaper discovered that City of London police had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/19/extinction-rebellion-listed-as-key-threat-by-counter-terror-police\" title=\"\">listed</a> XR as a \u201ckey threat\u201d in its counter-terrorism assessment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/23/environmental-hypocrisy-climate-crisis-green-politics\">When calling out environmental hypocrisy is nothing but a cynical ploy | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a long history in the UK of attempts to associate peaceful protest with extremism or terrorism. In 2008, for example, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) produced a list of \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d. Among them was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/23/activists-conservation-police\" title=\"\">Dr Peter Harbour</a>, a retired physicist and university lecturer, who had committed the cardinal sin of marching and petitioning against an attempt by the energy company npower (then RWE npower) to drain a beautiful local lake and fill it with pulverised fly ash. Acpo sought to smear peace campaigners, Greenpeace and Climate Camp with the same charge.</p> <p>The police have always protected established power against those who challenge it, regardless of the nature of that challenge. And they have long sought to criminalise peaceful dissent. Part of the reason is ideological: illiberal and undemocratic attitudes infest policing in this country. Part of it is empire-building: if police units can convince the government and the media of imminent threats that only they can contain, they can argue for more funding.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another reason, which is arguably even more dangerous: the nexus of state and corporate power. All over the world, corporate lobbyists seek to brand opponents of their industries as extremists and terrorists, and some governments and police forces are prepared to listen. A <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/\" title=\"\">recent article</a> in the Intercept seeks to discover why the US Justice Department and the FBI had put much more effort into chasing mythical \u201cecoterrorists\u201d than pursuing real, far-right terrorism. A former official explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a bunch of companies coming forward saying \u2018I wish you\u2019d do something about these rightwing extremists\u2019.\u201d By contrast, there is constant corporate pressure to \u201cdo something\u201d about environmental campaigners and animal rights activists.</p> <p>We feel this pressure in the UK. In July, the lobby group Policy Exchange <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Extremism-Rebellion.pdf\" title=\"\">published</a> a report claiming that XR is led by dangerous \u201cextremists\u201d. Policy Exchange is an opaque organisation that refuses to disclose its donors. But <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ywagdx/policy-exchange-extinction-rebellion-funding\" title=\"\">an investigation</a> by Vice magazine revealed it has received funding from the power company Drax, the trade association Energy UK and the gas companies E.ON and Cadent.</p> <p>One of the two authors of the Policy Exchange report, Richard Walton, is a former police commander. A report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/02/stephen-lawrence-former-police-officer-avoids-charges-over-alleged-spying\" title=\"\">said</a> he would have had a misconduct case to answer had he not retired. The case concerned allegations about his role in the spying by undercover police on the family of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. The purpose of the spying operation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/23/stephen-lawrence-undercover-police-smears\" title=\"\">according</a> to one of the police officers involved, was to seek \u201cdisinformation\u201d and \u201cdirt\u201d on the family, and stop their campaign for justice \u201cin its tracks.\u201d</p> <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/priti-patel-defends-inclusion-of-extinction-rebellion-on-terror-list\" title=\"\">defended</a> the inclusion of XR on the police list of extremist ideologies. But it seems to me that people like Patel and Walton pose much greater threats to the nation, the state and our welfare than any green campaigners. Before she became an MP, Patel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/03/tory-cigarette-packaging-rebel-tobacco-lobbyist\" title=\"\">worked</a> for the company Weber Shandwick, as a lobbyist for British American Tobacco (BAT).

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not an \u201cerror\u201d or an \u201caccident\u201d, as the police now claim. It\u2019s a pattern. First, the Guardian revealed that counter-terrorism police in south-east England have listed Extinction Rebellion (XR) and the youth climate strikes as forms of \u201cideological extremism\u201d. Then teachers and officials around the country reported that they had been told, in briefings by the anti-radicalisation Prevent programme, to look out for people expressing support for XR and Greenpeace. Then the Guardian found a Counter Terrorism Policing guide to the signs and symbols used by various groups. Alongside terrorists and violent extremist organisations, the guide listed Greenpeace, XR, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, CND, the Socialist party, Stop the War and other peaceful green and left organisations. Then the newspaper discovered that City of London police had listed XR as a \u201ckey threat\u201d in its counter-terrorism assessment. There\u2019s a long history in the UK of attempts to associate peaceful protest with extremism or terrorism. In 2008, for example, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) produced a list of \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d. Among them was Dr Peter Harbour, a retired physicist and university lecturer, who had committed the cardinal sin of marching and petitioning against an attempt by the energy company npower (then RWE npower) to drain a beautiful local lake and fill it with pulverised fly ash. Acpo sought to smear peace campaigners, Greenpeace and Climate Camp with the same charge. The police have always protected established power against those who challenge it, regardless of the nature of that challenge. And they have long sought to criminalise peaceful dissent. Part of the reason is ideological: illiberal and undemocratic attitudes infest policing in this country. Part of it is empire-building: if police units can convince the government and the media of imminent threats that only they can contain, they can argue for more funding. But there\u2019s another reason, which is arguably even more dangerous: the nexus of state and corporate power. All over the world, corporate lobbyists seek to brand opponents of their industries as extremists and terrorists, and some governments and police forces are prepared to listen. A recent article in the Intercept seeks to discover why the US Justice Department and the FBI had put much more effort into chasing mythical \u201cecoterrorists\u201d than pursuing real, far-right terrorism. A former official explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a bunch of companies coming forward saying \u2018I wish you\u2019d do something about these rightwing extremists\u2019.\u201d By contrast, there is constant corporate pressure to \u201cdo something\u201d about environmental campaigners and animal rights activists. We feel this pressure in the UK. In July, the lobby group Policy Exchange published a report claiming that XR is led by dangerous \u201cextremists\u201d. Policy Exchange is an opaque organisation that refuses to disclose its donors. But an investigation by Vice magazine revealed it has received funding from the power company Drax, the trade association Energy UK and the gas companies E.ON and Cadent. One of the two authors of the Policy Exchange report, Richard Walton, is a former police commander. A report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission said he would have had a misconduct case to answer had he not retired. The case concerned allegations about his role in the spying by undercover police on the family of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence. The purpose of the spying operation, according to one of the police officers involved, was to seek \u201cdisinformation\u201d and \u201cdirt\u201d on the family, and stop their campaign for justice \u201cin its tracks.\u201d The home secretary, Priti Patel, has defended the inclusion of XR on the police list of extremist ideologies. But it seems to me that people like Patel and Walton pose much greater threats to the nation, the state and our welfare than any green campaigners. Before she became an MP, Patel worked for the company Weber Shandwick, as a lobbyist for British American Tobacco (BAT). One of her tasks was to campaign against the EU tobacco control directive, whose purpose was to protect public health. A BAT memo complained that the Weber Shandwick team as a whole \u201cdoes not actually feel comfortable or happy working for BAT\u201d. But it was pleased to note that two of its members \u201cseem quite relaxed working with us\u201d. One of them was Patel. In her previous government role, as secretary of state for international development, Patel held unauthorised and undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials, after which she broached the possibility of her department channelling British aid money through the Israeli army, in the occupied Golan Heights. After she was not candid with the prime minister, Theresa May, about further undisclosed meetings, she was forced to resign. But she was reinstated, in a far more powerful role, by Boris Johnson. Our government is helping propel us towards a catastrophe on a scale humankind has never encountered before: the collapse of our life-support systems. It does so in support of certain ideologies \u2013 consumerism, neoliberalism, capitalism \u2013 and on behalf of powerful industries. This, apparently, meets the definition of moderation. Seeking to prevent this catastrophe is extremism. If you care about other people, you go on the list. If you couldn\u2019t give a damn about humankind and the rest of life on Earth, the police and the government will leave you alone. You might even be appointed to high office.

Without extremists such as Emmeline Pankhurst, who maintained that \u201cthe argument of the broken window pane is the most valuable argument in modern politics\u201d, Patel would not be an MP. Only men with a certain amount of property would be permitted to vote. There would be no access to justice, no rights for workers, no defence against hunger and destitution, no weekends. In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King Jr, subjected to smears very similar to those now directed against XR and other environmental groups, noted: \u201cThe question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?

Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes, the Pulitzer-prize winning playwright \u2013 who wrote the book for Miranda\u2019s musical In The Heights, which is being adapted into a film, said the landscape has shifted for musical theatre in the US with more diverse writing bringing in new audiences to the genre, but only after decades of work. \u201cWhen we started in the studio system we couldn\u2019t gain traction, it was a very long path to get to Warner Brothers, which was finally willing to make the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cRather than saying \u2018We need to have X amount of big box office names or the movie is not viable\u2019, they were not prescriptive like that. In the past it had to have that or the movie would not be possible.\u201d Goold said the success of Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie, the musical about a teenage drag queen, which started life at the Sheffield Crucible before a West End transfer in 2017 and is now being adapted into a film, shows original musicals can be produced in the UK. Other recent British successes include Six, the \u201ctune-and-toe show about Tudor queens\u201d by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, the RSC\u2019s The Boy in the Dress and Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s School of Rock. Mark Herbert of Warp films, which is producing the movie adaptation of Jamie and has a reputation for gritty northern dramas, said there was no hesitation in taking on a musical. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been drawn to authentic stories about slightly complex outsiders. We did not want Jamie to feel gritty; we want it to feel magical. We want people to say: \u2018Oh, this is not La La Land.\u2019 It is Sheffield, and there is beauty in it.\u201d Hart, Goold and Herbert all said the negative critical response to Tom Hooper\u2019s film adaptation of Cats, which was hammered for its CGI and hard-to-follow narrative, would not stop the rise of musicals with several big-budget Hollywood adaptations planned for 2020, including Spike Lee\u2019s Prince of Cats, Leos Carax\u2019s Annette and Steven Spielberg\u2019s remake of West Side Story. Hart said: \u201cPeople love to hate certain things, and I\u2019ve always felt that \u2013 and Cats is a prime example of this for me \u2013 that musical theatre is about as experimental an art form as you can get, and it definitely leads to some pretty mad stuff.\u201d Goold said he believed two things would improve the situation in the UK: subsidising musical theatre becoming more acceptable and more joined-up thinking on cooperation between emerging commercial producers and subsidised houses. \u201cPeople want to feel joy and there\u2019s a real gap for that at the moment,\u201d said Goold. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the real rise of musicals in the 1930s came against the backdrop of the great depression, and there\u2019s definitely a space for that in Britain now\u201d. Stage and screen musicals to watch in 2020 Come from Away The surprisingly uplifting 9/11 musical about how Newfoundland took in thousands of diverted passengers after the World Trade Center attack is now on at the Phoenix in London. Typical of the new breed of North American musicals that fashion show-tunes out of unlikely material, it\u2019s been widely praised and has travelled well from its origins as a Canadian college show to Broadway and beyond. Everybody\u2019s Talking About Jamie Billy Elliot meets Kinky Boots in this big-screen transfer for the West End hit about a Sheffield teenage boy with a talent for drag. The film cast is mostly new to the production, from lead Max Harwood to supporting cast Richard E Grant, Sharon Horgan and Sarah Lancashire, but the show\u2019s creator and director, Jonathan Butterell, retains the reins. In the Heights While we wait for the Hamilton movie, here\u2019s the long-gestating movie proper of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s previous hit, starring Anthony Ramos. It was supposed to have come out in 2011, but behind-the-scenes cast changes \u2013 including a Weinstein association \u2013 delayed first curtain. West Side Story The spectre of Cats looms large and rabid over 2020\u2019s musical offerings, yet some of them are among the year\u2019s most major hopes. One such key release is this second film version of the Bernstein/Laurents/Sondheim classic, directed by Steven Spielberg and written \u2013 apparently more faithfully to the original stage show than the 1961 movie \u2013 by Tony Kushner, with whom Spielberg previously collaborated on Lincoln. Ansel Elgort is a nagging concern as Tony; schoolgirl discovery Rachel Zegler plays Maria. Oklahoma! \u201cHow is it that the coolest new show on Broadway in 2019 is a 1943 musical usually regarded as a very square slice of American pie?\u201d asked the New York Times critic Ben Brantley in his review of Daniel Fish\u2019s Oklahoma!, which stunned Broadway last year with its inventive reimagining of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic. Like Trevor Nunn and Susan Stroman\u2019s National Theatre version, Fish strips the production back and presents a darker version.",

      "bodyText": "The government is holding talks with the Turkish conglomerate Cengiz Holdings about stepping in to buy British Steel in the event that a planned sale to the Chinese industrial firm Jingye falls through. Officials remain confident that Jingye\u2019s \u00a350m purchase of British Steel, including the Scunthorpe steelworks, will go ahead in the next few weeks, saving about 4,000 jobs in the ailing industry. But the Guardian understands that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has also been examining a back-up plan involving Istanbul-based Cengiz, which enjoys close ties to the Turkish regime. A spokesperson for BEIS declined to comment on whether discussions had taken place. Jingye\u2019s preferred bidder status affords it the sole right to negotiate a deal with the official receiver, the government employee managing the sale alongside the accountancy firm EY. But BEIS is not bound by the exclusivity arrangement and is keen to limit the amount of time it continues to own a business that collapsed into insolvency eight months ago and is losing about \u00a31m a day. A sale to Jingye still faces several obstacles, including fraught negotiations with suppliers to British Steel and concern among trade unions at the prospect of cuts to jobs and employment benefits. The French government\u2019s approval is also required for the sale of British Steel\u2019s Hayange plant near the border with Luxembourg. While BEIS officials are confident that these hurdles can be overcome, they are still exploring alternative options, mindful of the fact that one potential buyer has already walked away. Jingye, led by the former Communist party official Li Ganpo, only became the preferred bidder after a deal with Ataer Holdings, a unit of the Turkish military pension fund Oyak, disintegrated. While Oyak has links to the Turkish government and military, the regime is understood to favour a deal involving Cengiz, which also has connections to the state. Its founder-owner, Mehmet Cengiz, is a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and his companies have won a host of major infrastructure projects. The company is overseeing the Black Sea coastal highway, Istanbul\u2019s new airport, a high-speed rail project, as well as work on dams and power generation. Any further discussions involving Cengiz could benefit from friendly relations between the UK\u2019s steel minister, Nadhim Zahawi, and the Turkish government. The register of MPs\u2019 interests reveals that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AK party paid for Zahawi to visit its party conference in Ankara in 2012, funding \u00a3338.85 in hotel costs and transport. Zahawi\u2019s flights, worth \u00a3625, were underwritten by a \u201cnon-registrable source\u201d. The Conservative MP also enjoys strong ties to Turkey\u2019s allies in the Kurdistan regional government that runs the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq. The Ankara-backed Kurdish regime sends most of its lucrative oil through pipelines across the border between the two countries. Zahawi, whose family are Iraqi Kurds, earned about \u00a3850,000 in less than three years as \u201cchief strategy officer\u201d for the Kurdistan-based oil firm Gulf Keystone Petroleum, a position he gave up in 2017 to focus on Brexit negotiations. A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cThe government remains completely committed to getting a good solution for British Steel\u2019s valued employees at Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and on Teesside. \u201cIn November the official receiver accepted a bid from Jingye for British Steel, which is an important step towards securing the future of the steelworks and its employees in the UK. \u201cThe sales process is ongoing and we will continue to work with the official receiver as he seeks to finalise a sale.\u201d The Guardian has approached Cengiz Holdings for comment. One other potential buyer, Liberty Steel, is also keeping close tabs on the situation and is waiting in the wings in case Jingye\u2019s bid falls away. The group, owned by the UK-based steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta, wants to convert part of the Scunthorpe steelworks from a blast furnace operation producing steel from scratch into an electric arc furnace plant that uses scrap steel.",

The full report of the panel inquiry, which has been criticised by the UN, was not made publicly available. It is not clear how many Rohingya were interviewed by the panel. An executive summary of the findings were released just days before the International Court of Justice, which is hearing a genocide case against Myanmar, is due to announce whether or not it will request for emergency measures to prevent further harm against Rohingya. In 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya people fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh following a military-led crackdown in Rakhine state in which villages were burned, women raped and thousands killed. A UN fact-finding mission later declared that the violence had \u201cgenocidal intent\u201d. The long-overdue report by the Myanmar-appointed inquiry stated that it did not travel to meet any of the more than one million Rohingya refugees living in refugee camps in Bangladesh, blaming the neighbouring country\u2019s government for failing to facilitate visits. The panel concluded that \u201cwar crimes and serious human rights violations, and violations of domestic law took place\u201d, and that there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to conclude members of the security forces among \u201cmultiple actors\u201d responsible. These acts included the \u201ckilling of innocent villagers and destruction of their homes\u201d, it said.

Among its findings, the panel inquiry stated that it had heard \u201cno credible statements on allegations of gang rape committed by Myanmar\u2019s security forces\u201d, and that no individuals interviewed by the panel alleged that they had been raped. Some female witnesses told the inquiry they had been searched by male Myanmar defence personnel as part of operations, the panel said, adding: \u201cThis behaviour may amount to constitute sexual violence.\u201d Yasmin Ullah, president of the Rohingya Human Rights Group, described the conclusions as a cover-up. \u201cThe fact that they have this very, very small section about rape, and sexual violence, whereas the history about ARSA [a Rohingya military group] and how it was formed are explained in pages of detail \u2013 as a woman, it is very painful,\u201d said Ullah.

Another ace takes the Serbian\u2019s power out of the equation but when Ito can\u2019t repeat the feat Djokovic slices his way back to deuce. Ito again serves powerfully to earn another game point but once more Djokovic reels him in in rally play, executing a superb disguised backhand crosscourt. </p> <p>Yet again Ito moves up a point with a strong serve wide to Djokovic\u2019s forehand and the champ is frustrated, threatening to damage his racket.

The world No 1 takes on Slovenian <strong>Polona Hercog</strong>, ranked 47 places beneath, in the second round on Rod Laver Arena. That match isn\u2019t far away at all and will be followed by second seed <strong>Novak Djokovic\u2019s</strong> clash with No 146-ranked Japanese <strong>Tatsuma Ito.</strong></p> <p>And, as ever during week one at the Happy Slam, there is plenty else on.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this afternoon session. A couple of hours from now the evening session liveblog will get underway and Tumaini Carayol will bring you up to speed on all the day\u2019s headlines. Thanks for joining us, we\u2019ll be back to do this all again very soon. On Melbourne Arena Stefanos Tsitsipas (6) was the beneficiary of a walkover after Philipp Kohlschreiber withdrew with injury. There were also wins for Julia Goerges and Coco Gauff. On court right now Milos Raonic (32) is up a set on Cristian Garin. Over on Margaret Court Arena, Grigor Dimitrov (18) has a fight on his hands against popular American rising star Tommy Paul. Paul won the opening set and we\u2019re on serve in the second. Earlier on there were wins for Osaka and Wozniacki. That\u2019s your lot from RLA this afternoon session. Straight sets wins to Kvitova, Barty and now Djokovic. Tonight? Just the small matter of Serena and Federer. \u201cTough conditions out here, very windy, quite unpredictable to know where the ball was going to go,\u201d explains Djokovic afterwards, not even sweating. \u201cServe from my side helped me get out of trouble.\u201d Far from vintage for the defending champion. He cruised through the opening set but then it all became a bit of a struggle. Some second set anxiety dissipated with an early break in the third but an unfamiliar volume of errors crept into Djokovic\u2019s performance. Conditions were not easy, especially as the gusts of wind grew in strength. Overall it can be chalked down as an early tournament work out. Preparation for tougher tests to come. Third set: Djokovic* 6-1 6-4 6-2 Ito (*denotes server): The opening couple of points are far from vintage - a net cord helping the champion then Ito dominating a point that ends with a forceful overhead. A couple of booming serves reassert Djokovic\u2019s authority, then he seals the deal with some neat serve-volley tennis. Just 95-minutes for the Djoker to complete his afternoon\u2019s work. Third set: Djokovic 6-1 6-4 5-2 Ito* (*denotes server): An experimental return game from Djokovic does not go well. Some attempted massive return winners miss the court then a trial run in Nadal territory back on the fence ends disastrously. Ito holds to love, a nice final memory for the Japanese of his once-in-a-lifetime experience of Rod Laver Arena. Third set: Djokovic* 6-1 6-4 5-1 Ito (*denotes server): Another steamroller hold looks on the cards but a double fault at 40-15 is followed up by a wayward backhand to allow Ito a rare deuce on the Djokovic serve. A second serve ace - the 15th ace of the match for Djokovic - settles everyone down, then Ito errs to slide one game away from defeat. Third set: Djokovic 6-1 6-4 4-1 Ito* (*denotes server): Ito\u2019s level has dropped this set, something he cannot afford to do to remain anywhere near an opponent of this calibre. He slips to 0-40 with a series of errors - making it 11-points in a row to Djokovic - before restoring some pride with a forehand too hot for Djokovic\u2019s slide to handle. The end comes soon afterwards though when a backhand glides just wide. Third set: Djokovic* 6-1 6-4 3-1 Ito (*denotes server): Four swings of Djokovic\u2019s racket is all it takes. Third set: Djokovic 6-1 6-4 2-1 Ito* (*denotes server): First time Ito\u2019s really faced the squeeze on his serve in some time, slipping tamely to 15-40. Another error gifts Djokovic a break of serve much more reminiscent of the first set than the past hour or so. Third set: Djokovic* 6-1 6-4 1-1 Ito (*denotes server): Ito has got over his first set stage fright and he\u2019s really testing Djokovic now. A fortunate opening point to Ito puts Djokovic on notice so when the Serbian levels the score he reaches for the roar once more like an alpha lion marking his territory. A couple of blistering serves continue Djokovic\u2019s ascendancy and he seals the hold with yet more mystifying defensive resilience. Third set: Djokovic 6-1 6-4 0-1 Ito* (*denotes server): There are many things to enjoy watching tennis: Federer\u2019s fluid movement, Barty\u2019s backhand slice, but watching Djokovic defend is as masterful as anything. He is just always there, always, wherever Ito hits, there\u2019s some green Asics sneakers and a white Lacoste polo shirt. It\u2019s unerring. Ito plays a solid game but is at his wits end to reach 30-30. From there an ace gives him an edge before he comes out on top of a long baseline exchange. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1 6-4 Ito (*denotes server): Djokovic is not comfortable in these changing gusty conditions and he\u2019s forced into many more shots than a normal service game for him. At 30-15 Ito has the point on his racket but nobody covers the court like Djokovic and somehow he made it to a forehand stretch in the baseline before sliding to cover a drop shot and return it at the acutest of angles for the winner. He raises his finger to the sky and briefly acknowledges his own greatness before thundering down an ace to seal a far from straightforward set. Amazing - 15-years-old and just setting the tennis world alight. Up next? Naomi Osaka, that should be a beauty. Second set: Djokovic 6-1 5-4 Ito* (*denotes server): Ito is a different player on his own serve, despite not being that big a server. For whatever reason starting the point seems to spark his aggression and he takes the game to Djokovic. He works hard to keep his nose in front all game, even forcing Djokovic to lose control of his racket in one exchange, but a double fault at 40-30 allows an opening at deuce. Djokovic asserts himself from the baseline to earn a break point, then defends brilliantly to force Ito to keep hitting shot after shot, eventually framing one wide. Djokovic celebrates the break with a full throated roar. Hitting practice has turned into something altogether more psychologically interesting for the seven-time champion. This has not been a vintage year for Team GB. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1 4-4 Ito (*denotes server): Hmmm. Djokovic cruises to 40-0 then out of nowhere the wind - which has been gusting all day - makes an entrance. Djokovic loses his ball-toss and looks a little rattled, slipping to 40-30. He then holds, but it continues the narrative of the Djoker not having a happy time of it this second set. Second set: Djokovic 6-1 3-4 Ito* (*denotes server):Djokovic again looks ruefully into the middle distance after he fails to convert his dominance of a rally at 0-15. He still earns a break point though, showing miraculous defence and the rubberiest ankles at 30-30 to force Ito to make one more shot, that he fails to execute. For the second time this set though Djokovic can\u2019t convert the break point. Another look to the invisible gods at deuce after a simple rally ends Ito\u2019s way following an error, then the game is ended with an ace. Djokovic is just struggling to find his mojo out there at present, on Ito\u2019s serve at least. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1 3-3 Ito (*denotes server): Ito is getting absolutely nowhere near Djokovic\u2019s serve. Three aces, one on the second serve, give the second seed another easy hold. Here\u2019s the full report on Ash Barty\u2019s progression into round three. Second set: Djokovic 6-1 2-3 Ito* (*denotes server): Ito is growing into his work, especially on serve, and he holds for the fourth game in a row. After cruising through the opening set Djokovic now has some work to do. And he doesn\u2019t look happy, showing signs of frustration, with himself, with the crowd. Not the happiest chappy. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1 2-2 Ito (*denotes server): Djokovic holds to love. Second set: Djokovic 6-1 1-2 Ito* (*denotes server): Point of the match so far for Ito, moving 15-0 up after trading crosscourt forehands with Djokovic then nailing the winner down the line. Classic Djokovic defence - elastic and always ready to counterpunch - forces a hat-trick of errors from his opponent to engineer a couple of break points. But Ito saves them both, first outlasting Djokovic then moving in aggressively and putting away the forehand volley. An ace at deuce continues the momentum Ito\u2019s way, but then Djokovic turns on the power, ripping a couple of huge forehands to make a statement. Another ace takes the Serbian\u2019s power out of the equation but when Ito can\u2019t repeat the feat Djokovic slices his way back to deuce. Ito again serves powerfully to earn another game point but once more Djokovic reels him in in rally play, executing a superb disguised backhand crosscourt. Yet again Ito moves up a point with a strong serve wide to Djokovic\u2019s forehand and the champ is frustrated, threatening to damage his racket. Ito retains his composure and finally sees off the game. Second set: Djokovic* 6-1 1-1 Ito (*denotes server): Ito\u2019s giving it his all at the start of this set. You can tell because the squeaks from Djokovic\u2019s sneakers on the blue rebound ace court are making an absolute racket. He is the master of the hardcourt slide and his footwork and movement are peerless. The 16-time grand slam champion holds to 15 - that point to Ito a double fault. Second set: Djokovic 6-1 0-1 Ito* (*denotes server): Ito\u2019s good form on serve continues, holding for the second time in a row, this time to love. Ito had a touch more pep in his strokes and Djokovic looked a tad lackadaisical, one backhand slice into the net in particular lacked intensity. First set: Djokovic* 6-1 Ito (*denotes server): Another service hold to love and Djokovic strolls to the first set. If this was boxing Ito\u2019s corner would be locating the white towel. Ons Jabeur, Jo Konta\u2019s conqueror continues her impressive tournament. First set: Djokovic 5-1 Ito* (*denotes server): Ito is on the board, much to the delight of RLA. An ace and some uncharacteristic errors from Djokovic mean the Japanese avoids the bagel. The retiring Wozniacki is one of the burgeoning stories of the tournament. 23rd seed Yastremska will not be missed by many. First set: Djokovic* 5-0 Ito (*denotes server): The TV commentators are already talking about Djokovic\u2019s plant based diet, there\u2019s so little to add to the tennis. The champ holds to love, almost apologetically. First set: Djokovic 4-0 Ito* (*denotes server): Ito has zero weapons, which is unfortunate against a defence as impenetrable as Djokovic\u2019s. The world No 2 has only made two winners so far but finds himself 4-0 up in no time at all. The Japanese player is a conservative grinder but when he has to expand to push Djokovic the strain tells and the error arrives. Teenager Coco Gauff has levelled at 1-1 against Sorana Cirstea. First set: Djokovic* 3-0 Ito (*denotes server): Djokovic is 3-0 up inside 10 minutes, barely getting out of exhibition pace. After his tough first round encounter this is just what the physio ordered. Incidentally, this is the first time these men have met in competition. Ito is currently ranked 146 in the world, with a career high of 60 back in 2012. First set: Djokovic 2-0 Ito* (*denotes server): Ito slips to deuce with a few soft errors, and if there\u2019s one man in the history of tennis you can\u2019t afford to gift points to it\u2019s Djokovic. The ultimate defender. The Serbian is playing within himself, focusing on technique and footwork, and just by keeping the ball in play he earns the break. This is unlikely to be a long or a dramatic contest. In case you didn\u2019t know it is hot (low 30s C), overcast and very very windy today at Melbourne Park. The wind isn\u2019t too much of a factor in the enclosed RLA but it is a pain on the outside courts. First set: Djokovic* 1-0 Ito (*denotes server): Simple hold for Djokovic, despite a double fault. He played with the air of man curious to know what his unheralded opponent might bring, offering him all manner of different strokes to respond to. Ito is 31, but this is only the fourth time he\u2019s ever passed the opening round of a grand slam. He\u2019s never reached round three. His career prize money doesn\u2019t match what Djokovic earned for winning here last year. Our attention now turns to Novak Djokovic against Tatsuma Ito of Japan. A greater mismatch you\u2019re unlikely to see all tournament. Elise Mertens (16) through to face Heather Watson in R2. Remember, if you want to join in, you can do so via email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com or Twitter @JPHowcroft. Speaking of Wozniacki, she is on the receiving end of some questionable tactics. Thank you very much Scott. A quick scoot around the courts to recap on the day so far: Rod Laver Arena: Straight sets wins for Petra Kvitova (7) and Ash Barty (1). Margaret Court Arena: A routine win for Naomi Osaka (3) and now an almighty rollercoaster affair between Caroline Wozniacki and Dayana Yastremska (23). The Dane is a set up but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s match. Retiring after the AO, it is potentially the last match in the 2018 champion\u2019s career. Melbourne Arena: Dangerous floater Julia Goerges upset 13th seed Petra Martic in three sets. Teenage sensation Coco Gauff is now on court but she\u2019s a set down to Sorana Cirstea. 1573 Arena: Massive upset earlier with Spanish veteran Carla Suarez Navarro downing 11th seed Aryna Sabalenka. Elise Mertens (16) is on court and on course for a routine win. Court 3: Sofia Kenin (14) and Ekaterina Alexandrova (25) are safely through. Benoit Paire (21) is currently a set down to the unseeded Marin Cilic. Court 8: Alison Riske (18) and Anett Kontaveit (28) eased through. The Estonia prevailed over Australian Astra Sharma. Diego Schwartzman (14) is up a set. Court 12: Heather Watson gave Team GB something to cheer by defeating Krystina Pliskova. Court 19: Dan Evans (30) is a set down to Yoshihito Nishioka. Updates throughout the afternoon... That was certainly a clinical display from Ashleigh Barty, who\u2019s safely through to the third round and palpably in great form. There\u2019s so much more on today at windy Melbourne Park, and I can\u2019t think of anyone better to bring it to you than Jonathan Howcroft. Over to you, Jonathan. Poetry in motion. But enough from me. It\u2019s over to Ashleigh Barty ... Today was really special. It\u2019s been incredible. Another clean match and I\u2019m glad to get out of that one. The wind played a massive factor. Polona has the ability to blow you off the court and it was just about me being able to take my opportunities. It\u2019s nice playing in front of a full crowd on this beautiful court. Thanks to everyone for your love and support, not just here but around the world. A cute lob shot gives Hercog two break points, but again Barty responds as a champion does. The Slovenian hits wide off a Barty serve and the Australian has won. The second set wasn\u2019t the stroll of the first, but it tested her in ways she\u2019ll likely appreciate. That was easy enough. Second set: Barty 6-1 5-4 Hercog* (*denotes server): Likely the longest rally of the match goes Barty\u2019s way as - you guessed it - an unforced error from Hercog decides the point. And that is all the opening Barty needs. Another unforced error - Hercog\u2019s 30th today - settles the game as Barty breaks. She is now just one game away from wrapping this up. Second set: Barty* 6-1 4-4 Hercog (*denotes server): Oh the scourge of the unforced error! Hercog will live to regret this chance, as gilt-edged as they come, holding two break points only to hit long and usher Barty back into the game. The Australian hits a deep winner, takes the game to deuce and holds. Second set: Barty 6-1 3-4 Hercog* (*denotes server): At 15-30, Barty looks ready to go for the jugular and break at an important stage of this second set. But Hercog holds her nerve, unfurls a forehand winner, and holds. Games still going to serve in this set. Second set: Barty* 6-1 3-3 Hercog (*denotes server): Unforced errors continue to be a blight on Hercog\u2019s game - or is merely playing the world No 1 pressure in itself? - and despite taking Barty to 40-30, she surrenders a half-chance to break serve as the Australian rips a brutal cross-court winner. Second set: Barty 6-1 2-3 Hercog* (*denotes server): A very watchable rally goes Barty\u2019s way - Hercog looked in control after yet another drop shot before Barty won the point from overhead - but the Slovenian stays true to her game, making Barty work with expansive groundstrokes, and she holds serve. Hercog\u2019s execution is very inconsistent but when it works, it works. Second set: Barty* 6-1 2-2 Hercog (*denotes server): Hercog controls Barty\u2019s serve, peeling off a deft drop shot en route to a volleyed winner and before you know it she holds a 0-30 lead. Great players, however, have gears, and Barty cranks up the pressure to snuff out any threat to her service game, winning the next four points. That\u2019s now 21 unforced errors for Hercog. Barty has eight. Second set: Barty 6-1 1-2 Hercog* (*denotes server): Hercog\u2019s first serve clicks as she races to a 40-0 lead, but a Barty winner and a fourth double fault from the Slovenian gives an opening to the Australian. But, growing into this game, Hercog controls her next serve to force Barty into a backhand error. Games going to serve in this second set. Second set: Barty* 6-1 1-1 Hercog (*denotes server): Better again from Hercog, who remains happy to engage Barty in baseline rallies before working the expanses of the court. She succeeds in making Barty run, taking the Australian\u2019s serve to deuce, but Barty is too good for this tactic to work all the time. An unforced error from Hercog, followed by a Barty ace, means the world No 1 holds all the same. Second set: Barty 6-1 0-1 Hercog* (*denotes server): Hercog manages deeper penetration with her first serve - and manages to get some of them in - and she holds in her best service game of the match. The Slovenian had been off for almost four months prior to this tournament, so perhaps she might be warming to her task. First set: Barty* 6-1 Hercog (*denotes server): When Hercog can get to Barty\u2019s backhand this is more of a match, but the world No 1 can afford to make the odd unforced error and still stroll through this first set. That was painless, bloodless and clinical: Barty takes the first set. In 25 minutes. First set: Barty 5-1 Hercog* (*denotes server): Hmmm. Hercog makes a clear effort to engage Barty in rallies - perhaps shelving the desire to go for winners - but this doesn\u2019t work, either. Barty seems happy to go shot-for-shot, knowing full well Hercog will most times make an unforced error first. And so it proves. Barty breaks again, this time to 15, and this is one-way traffic. First set: Barty* 4-1 Hercog (*denotes server): Speaking of trends, Barty again holds serve with ominous ease. Hercog is unable to place enough pressure on the Australian\u2019s serve, and that never bodes well in a tennis match. First set: Barty 3-1 Hercog* (*denotes server): A worrying trend is emerging here. Quite apart from Barty seeming the vastly superior player, Hercog can\u2019t get enough on her serve to maintain pressure and this is putting it on a platter for her opponent. It means Hercog will rely on winners to stay in this match - and she peels off a nice one down the line as the game goes to deuce before ripping one across court to set up the game. Hercog is, unconvincingly, off the mark. First set: Barty* 3-0 Hercog (*denotes server): Not quite the stroll of her first service game - a missed drop shot and an unforced error put Hercog in the game - but a crisp forehand winner closes the deal and Barty is off to a flyer. Over to you, Naomi ... First set: Barty 2-0 Hercog* (*denotes server): Hercog holds a 30-15 lead before an unforced error restores parity. A delightful cross-court forehand winner sets up game point but another unforced error - again into the net - sees the game go to deuce. A double fault gives Barty a sniff and no right-thinking person gives a world No 1 a sniff. Barty breaks serve and that is just the beginning she was after following a less-than-assured start to her match on Monday. First set: Barty* 1-0 Hercog (*denotes server): A nerveless start for the world No 1, who holds her serve to love and frankly never looks like losing a point. Barty will serve first ... Melbourne weather watch: Not quite the glorious summer day of yesterday. We\u2019re looking at a top of 32-34C but with gusty northerly winds. Tonight could be interesting - hazardous winds, a cool change, chance of thunderstorms and rain from 10pm is the forecast. Well, we will play the Australian Open in Melbourne. If that isn\u2019t enough sunshine in your day, this should brighten things up. Oh Caroline, we will miss ye. So what else is on today? In the early match on Margaret Court Arena, reigning champion Naomi Osaka was largely untroubled in seeing off China\u2019s Saisai Zheng, 6-2 6-4. Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s valedictory tour writes its next chapter against Dayana Yastremska (that match has just started) before the afternoon session on MCA concludes with Tommy Paul facing eighteenth seed Grigor Dimitrov. In the early match on Rod Laver Arena, seventh seed Petra Kvitova didn\u2019t have it her own way against Paula Badosa but did enough to emerge a 7-5 7-5 victor. Tonight, Serena Williams is in action against Tamara Zidansek, followed by Roger Federer\u2019s second-round encounter with Filip Krajinovic. We will have both matches covered live. And there\u2019s plenty happening on the outside courts, the pick of which will get a mention on these pages. But without further ado, it\u2019s time for some Alexander Zverev love. Good afternoon and welcome to day three of the Australian Open. How much do we love Ashleigh Barty? Let us count the ways: She\u2019s pretty good at tennis. She had the bravery and self-awareness to ditch tennis for cricket when the former sport \u201cbecame a bit of a slog for me\u201d. The rest, as they say, is history. Her idea of celebrating a year in which she scaled the heights of her sport was to have a few beers on the couch. Where some players see ball girls and boys as banana-peeling fodder, she sees them as human beings and treats them as such. She is, by all accounts known to humanity, a thoroughly good person. Luckily for us, Barty is in action today. The world No 1 takes on Slovenian Polona Hercog, ranked 47 places beneath, in the second round on Rod Laver Arena. That match isn\u2019t far away at all and will be followed by second seed Novak Djokovic\u2019s clash with No 146-ranked Japanese Tatsuma Ito. And, as ever during week one at the Happy Slam, there is plenty else on. If you\u2019d like yo have your say, get in touch on email or tweet @scott_heinrich.",

      "bodyText": "A restoration of one of the world\u2019s most famous paintings has been described as \u201ca shock for everybody\u201d after it revealed a depiction of a sheep with extremely human-like eyes. The Ghent Altarpiece, completed by Hubert and Jan van Eyck in 1432, is a 15th-century masterpiece in St Bavo\u2019s Cathedral in Belgium, widely considered to be the first major artwork to use oil paint. For centuries, its central panel \u2013 titled Adoration of the Mystic Lamb \u2013 featured a demure sheep (the Lamb of God) being sacrificed on an altar as a representation of Jesus Christ. The sheep was painted over by a different artist in 1550, but a multi-million-dollar restoration has now revealed the original, startling face of the titular ovine. Described by the Smithsonian Magazine as \u201calarmingly humanoid\u201d, the new Ghent lamb now sports larger, more vibrant eyes and a more detailed, flared pink nose. Images of the two faces side-by-side have been circulating on social media and described as nightmarish. Unlike other art restorations, such as the infamous botched Ecce Homo (also known as Monkey Christ), the Ghent lamb has in fact been professionally restored to how it originally looked. The head of restoration, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dubois, described the unveiled face as \u201ccartoonish\u201d and \u201ca shock for everybody\u201d in an interview with The Art Newspaper. \u201cNothing like this had ever been observed on early Netherlandish painting,\u201d Dubois said. Curators from Belgium\u2019s Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage used surgical scalpels and microscopes to remove old paint \u201ccentimetre by centimetre\u201d, over three years, to reveal the original sheep. \u201cThere are no words to express the result,\u201d they said in a statement on the royal institute\u2019s website. \u201cLiberated from the thick layers of yellow varnish and the coarser overpaints, we can discover the Van Eycks\u2019 sublime virtuosity in abundance.\u201d The institute said their restoration had \u201cbrought back the original vividness, richness of detail and brilliant colours for all to see\u201d, concluding that \u201cthe Adoration of the Mystic Lamb is overwhelmingly beautiful.\u201d Only 5% of the original paint was lost, curators said. The central panel featuring the lamb will be returned to the cathedral on 24 January, where it will be put on display for the public in an event titled \u201cThe return of the Lamb\u201d. The altarpiece is made up of multiple panels, and is 15 feet wide and 11 feet tall when fully opened. It is also one of the most frequently stolen paintings of all time. The restoration was completed in December but images of the sheep\u2019s original face went viral in January. The Ghent lamb now joins other shocking artistic works such as the bust of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo in Madeira in Portugal, the repainted statue of St George in Estella in Spain, and the baby Jesus statue in Ontario in Canada whose head was replaced with a completely differently-coloured material.",

      "body": "<p>The pressure on Bridget McKenzie over the government\u2019s sport grant program is far from subsiding.</p> <p>It\u2019s been seven days since the auditor general released his damning report, but the calls for McKenzie\u2019s resignation have only intensified.</p> <p>At this point, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves how we got here and why it all matters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/22/sport-grants-more-than-1m-given-to-nine-clubs-linked-to-coalition-mps\">Sport grants: more than $1m given to nine clubs linked to Coalition MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What is the sports grants program?</h2> <p>The scheme in question is the <a href=\"https://www.sportaus.gov.au/grants_and_funding/community_sport_infrastructure_grant_program\">community sport infrastructure program</a>, which was announced in 2018 and doled out up to $500,000 to fund to local sporting clubs to improve their facilities in the lead up to the 2019 election.</p> <p>The overarching aim was to boost participation in physical activity and sports.</p> <p>It\u2019s a worthy concept, and one that was welcomed by cash-strapped local clubs.</p> <p>So much so that the government was inundated with applications when the first of three funding rounds opened in 2018. Not everyone could be successful.</p> <h2>How was the money distributed?</h2> <p>In a perfect world, the government would have objectively and fairly worked out which clubs were most needy and where the money could be best spent. That\u2019s not what happened.</p> <p>The rough process for distributing the money went like this:</p> <p>1. An individual club applied for a grant, filling out forms and stating what it wanted to do with the money and why it was needed.</p> <p>2. Sport Australia, the government body administering the scheme, assessed the application against transparent and objective guidelines.</p> <p>3. Each application was awarded an overall score to reflect its merit. Successful projects, if things had gone as planned, would have needed a score of 74 and above.</p> <p>4. Recommendations were made by Sport Australia to the sport minister, who at that time was McKenzie.</p> <p>5. The sport minister made the final decision on which clubs would get money.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that Sport Australia did nothing wrong in all of this.</p> <p>The mess was created in that last step, when the minister\u2019s office became involved.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.anao.gov.au/work/performance-audit/award-funding-under-the-community-sport-infrastructure-program\">audit report released last week</a> found that McKenzie\u2019s office ran its own parallel assessment process that was separate to the guidelines Sport Australia had developed to objectively and fairly distribute the money.</p> <h2>Who received money under the scheme?</h2> <p>Grants were frequently directed to marginal seats, or seats the Coalition was targeting in the upcoming election. Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations were, in many cases, ignored. In the scheme\u2019s second and third rounds, 70% and 73% of the chosen projects went against Sport Australia\u2019s findings.</p> <p>This led to the complete politicisation of the scheme.</p> <p>Coalition MPs jostled and lobbied for money to go to their own electorates.</p> <p>Marginal seats like Hasluck and Indi were flush with cash. Candidates were gifted happy sport clubs, smiling faces, big cheques and great PR.</p> <p>Money also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/22/sport-grants-more-than-1m-given-to-nine-clubs-linked-to-coalition-mps\">found its way to clubs that had direct links</a> to Coalition ministers and senior MPs. One grant went to a shooting club that McKenzie herself was a member of. Other money went to clubs that had the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, as a patron, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, as a member and the assistant minister Sarah Henderson as a sponsor.</p> <p>And grants were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/21/upmarket-tennis-and-golf-clubs-among-recipients-of-major-sports-grants\">awarded for projects</a> that had questionable links to the program\u2019s overarching goal: boosting community participation in sport.</p> <p>One of Australia\u2019s best golf courses, the Royal Adelaide Golf Club, got $50,000 to install solar panels.

      "bodyText": "The pressure on Bridget McKenzie over the government\u2019s sport grant program is far from subsiding. It\u2019s been seven days since the auditor general released his damning report, but the calls for McKenzie\u2019s resignation have only intensified. At this point, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves how we got here and why it all matters. What is the sports grants program? The scheme in question is the community sport infrastructure program, which was announced in 2018 and doled out up to $500,000 to fund to local sporting clubs to improve their facilities in the lead up to the 2019 election. The overarching aim was to boost participation in physical activity and sports. It\u2019s a worthy concept, and one that was welcomed by cash-strapped local clubs. So much so that the government was inundated with applications when the first of three funding rounds opened in 2018. Not everyone could be successful. How was the money distributed? In a perfect world, the government would have objectively and fairly worked out which clubs were most needy and where the money could be best spent. That\u2019s not what happened. The rough process for distributing the money went like this: 1. An individual club applied for a grant, filling out forms and stating what it wanted to do with the money and why it was needed. 2. Sport Australia, the government body administering the scheme, assessed the application against transparent and objective guidelines. 3. Each application was awarded an overall score to reflect its merit. Successful projects, if things had gone as planned, would have needed a score of 74 and above. 4. Recommendations were made by Sport Australia to the sport minister, who at that time was McKenzie. 5. The sport minister made the final decision on which clubs would get money. It\u2019s important to note that Sport Australia did nothing wrong in all of this. The mess was created in that last step, when the minister\u2019s office became involved. The audit report released last week found that McKenzie\u2019s office ran its own parallel assessment process that was separate to the guidelines Sport Australia had developed to objectively and fairly distribute the money. Who received money under the scheme? Grants were frequently directed to marginal seats, or seats the Coalition was targeting in the upcoming election. Sport Australia\u2019s recommendations were, in many cases, ignored. In the scheme\u2019s second and third rounds, 70% and 73% of the chosen projects went against Sport Australia\u2019s findings. This led to the complete politicisation of the scheme. Coalition MPs jostled and lobbied for money to go to their own electorates. Marginal seats like Hasluck and Indi were flush with cash. Candidates were gifted happy sport clubs, smiling faces, big cheques and great PR. Money also found its way to clubs that had direct links to Coalition ministers and senior MPs. One grant went to a shooting club that McKenzie herself was a member of. Other money went to clubs that had the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, as a patron, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, as a member and the assistant minister Sarah Henderson as a sponsor. And grants were awarded for projects that had questionable links to the program\u2019s overarching goal: boosting community participation in sport. One of Australia\u2019s best golf courses, the Royal Adelaide Golf Club, got $50,000 to install solar panels. Royal Adelaide is a members-only golf course that costs a small fortune to join. Half a million dollars went to a rowing club in the affluent Sydney suburb of Mosman, while another golf club was given $190,000 to build a new foyer and install a lift, in part so it could attract more wedding bookings. Compare that, for example, to Coledale Waves football club, south of Sydney, which has no lights, a single field, and no women\u2019s change rooms, despite having 600 registered players. It missed out on a grant. \u201cDo we feel angry? Yes, probably \u2013 and disappointed that taxpayer money was spent in this way,\u201d Martin Smith, a coach at the club, said. OK, but why is it such a big deal? This is a pure example of pork-barrelling. Here we have a government found to have diverted and misused taxpayer money to further its political interests. It raises serious integrity issues. It also tells us that taxpayer money is not being used in the best way possible. But it goes further than that. Scandals like this fracture the already-damaged trust Australians have in their government. The government has also been caught red-handed by one of the few independent public watchdogs operating at a federal level. If the findings have no repercussions, it also raises questions about the power of our public watchdogs. Is this legal? The short answer: possibly not. The government says all of the projects that were given grants were eligible to receive them. That may be so. But questions about the lawfulness of the scheme arise in two other respects. The first is whether the laws underpinning the sport grant scheme actually gave authority to McKenzie to make decisions in the way that she did. The auditor general said he could not find the lawful authority on which McKenzie relied. Sport Australia, the brand name for the Australian Sports Commission, is a government agency with some degree of independence. The law bestows on McKenzie only a limited degree of involvement in its decision-making. She has the power to direct Sport Australia, but to do so she must follow a formal parliamentary process. The law says she must inform the agency in writing if she is considering issuing it a direction, give the chair an opportunity to respond, and then publish and table any directions she does issue in the lower house and Senate within 15 sitting days. That did not occur. Second, questions have been raised about whether the government has put itself in breach of the constitution by getting involved in local sports funding. A recent high court case against the federal government\u2019s chaplaincy scheme found the commonwealth can\u2019t spend money unless there is parliamentary authorisation and unless it was supported by the constitution. Anne Twomey, a leading constitutional expert, said the commonwealth would likely rely on its nationhood powers as a lawful basis for the powers. But that would require it to prove it was acting on a national emergency or doing something state governments couldn\u2019t do. \u201cWe know that the states can, and do, give out sports grants,\u201d Twomey said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t seem to fit either of those, which means there\u2019s a bit of a problem in terms of supporting this program.\u201d The attorney general, Christian Porter, is investigating the lawful basis for the scheme. Suggestions of a class action by unsuccessful applicants have also been made. So we\u2019re likely to hear more on the legal front soon. What is the government\u2019s defence? So far, the Coalition has backed in McKenzie. The refrain it uses in its defence is that the projects that won funding were all \u201celigible\u201d. The government is also claiming the grants are having a positive impact in their respective communities. Morrison said on Monday the program is \u201cdelivering very much-needed grants to local communities to build sporting facilities that I know those communities are very appreciative of\u201d. Where to next? Labor, far from a cleanskin in this area, is continuing to put pressure on McKenzie. Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese told Adelaide radio on Wednesday that it was \u201cjust red hot. This is just a rort. It fails the pub test. It fails every test.\u201d The media continues to dig through the long list of successful applicants, investigating who got grants and who missed out. Porter is investigating the lawfulness of the scheme and a possible class action waiting in the wings. There will be a host of worthy clubs that missed out, which will be watching this debate rage, unsure of whether to speak out publicly or not. The upshot? The headache is far from over for the Coalition.",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers acting for shareholders in a class action against James Packer\u2019s embattled casino empire, Crown Resorts, have lost a bid to crack open secrecy provisions in the contracts of company employees who were convicted of gambling promotion crimes in China. On Wednesday the federal court overturned a ruling last year that the lawyers for the shareholders, Maurice Blackburn, could take witness statements and collect documents from the 19 former employees, who include the whistleblower Jenny Jiang. Maurice Blackburn now faces the prospect of either calling the witnesses to the stand \u201ccold\u201d, without any preparation, or mounting a fresh attack on the confidentiality provisions of their employment contracts. Crown is also preparing to face public hearings in New South Wales into a range of allegations against the group, many of which were aired in Nine newspapers last year, and its fitness to hold a casino licence. The Nine reports included interviews with Jiang. Maurice Blackburn\u2019s head of class actions, Andrew Watson, said the full court\u2019s judgment \u201chighlights an absurdity in the law that needs to change\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that a whistleblower can tell their story to the media but they\u2019re prevented from talking to a lawyer to give a witness statement in a court proceeding,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what this decision means.\u201d In the class action, Maurice Blackburn claims Crown failed to inform the market that its lucrative high-roller business was at risk because of a crackdown by Chinese authorities on illegal gambling promotion on the mainland. Crown shares tumbled almost 14% when news of the employees\u2019 arrests broke in October 2016. In May last year, trial judge Bernard Murphy gave Maurice Blackburn permission to ignore confidentiality provisions in the employees\u2019 contracts so that they could take witness statements and collect documents in preparation for the trial, which is set for November. He said he had the power to do so under the Federal Court Act and there was \u201ca public interest in the fair, quick, inexpensive and efficient administration of justice\u201d. \u201cIn my opinion, if the orders are not made, it may have a serious adverse effect on the administration of justice,\u201d Murphy said. He said this outweighed \u201cthe public interest in maintaining the contractual obligations of confidence between Crown and its former employees\u201d. However, on Wednesday a panel of three judges \u2013 chief justice James Allsop, Michael Lee and Richard White \u2013 set aside Murphy\u2019s ruling following an appeal by Crown. The chief justice devoted much of his reasons to an attack on a ruling made by Victorian supreme court judge Jack Forrest allowing a similar waiver of confidentiality in a case run by Maurice Blackburn against Serco on behalf of people imprisoned at the Christmas Island immigration detention centre. Forrest\u2019s judgment was followed by Murphy when he heard the Crown class action. Allsop accused Forrest, one of the Victorian court\u2019s most highly regarded common law judges, of oversimplifying and mis-stating the case law, saying there was \u201cno basis in the authorities\u201d for the approach he took. The approach Forrest took was \u201cimpermissible and contrary to principle\u201d, Allsop said. Allsop said the question of whether confidentiality clauses in deeds signed by the employees could be set aside for another reason remained open. \u201cIt may be that it is for the applicants to show a prima facie case that Crown engaged in a systematic course of conduct contrary to, and known to be contrary to, the laws of China, or that the purpose and effect of the finalisation deeds and separation deed was to impede or hinder litigation in a court, or in this court,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the facts are sufficient to demonstrate such a prima facie case, it may be open to seek a declaration that the deeds and contracts, or their relevant provisions, were either void or unenforceable on that account as seeking to keep secret a course of criminal conduct by the laws of China which were the foundation of civil wrongs or of contravention of statute in Australia.\u201d Watson said the class action would go ahead as planned. \u201cWhile today\u2019s decision does not affect the confidence we have in our case, it remains disappointing nonetheless that the court has given credence to the continued efforts of Crown to prevent whistleblowers from speaking out in these proceedings,\u201d he said.",

The US president told the world\u2019s business leaders to stop listening to \u201cprophets of doom\u201d as he used a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum to attack the teenage activist Greta Thunberg over her climate crisis warnings. Asked about the comments, Turnbull replied that Trump had been \u201cquite a prophet of doom himself\u201d, citing his acceptance speech to the 2016 Republic convention in which Trump painted the picture \u201cof America threatened by crime and gangs [and] invasion from asylum seekers\u201d, which Turnbull labelled \u201cquite apocalyptic\u201d. \u201cHe uses the politics of fear when it suits him,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cTrump is the leading climate denier in the world.

Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, a move Australia has refused to follow despite the presence of climate change deniers or sceptics in the ruling Liberal-National Coalition. In the grip of an unprecedented season of bushfires, pressure has mounted for Australia to increase its emissions reduction targets or abandon the use of carryover credits for overperformance of Kyoto agreement targets. The current Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, re-elected in May 2019, has so far resisted pressure to increase the government\u2019s ambition, citing fears over economic cost and the possibility technology could help Australia reduce emissions without higher targets. Turnbull said \u201cthe fundamental problem that we face is that in too many places \u2013 the United States in particular and also in Australia \u2013 is that this issue of global warming, or global heating, has been turned into an ideological issue or values issue when it\u2019s simply a question of physics\u201d. \u201cThe more greenhouse gases you pump into the atmosphere, the more of the greenhouse effect you get, the warmer the planet gets,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThe consequences we are living with \u2013 hotter, drier climate, longer and more droughts, fiercer and more fires.\u201d Turnbull was also asked about former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s warning that the idea that the UK\u2019s trade with commonwealth countries could make up for exiting the European Union was \u201cutter bollocks\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A Great Barrier Reef conservation organisation has ended its partnership with bus company Greyhound just hours after Guardian Australia revealed the company\u2019s contract at the controversial Adani coal project in Queensland. Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation held an emergency board meeting at 8am today, where its chairman Alex de Waal, who is the chief executive of Greyhound Australia, resigned. Guardian Australia revealed that Greyhound had written to all its staff on 6 January, alerting them to the contract to transport workers constructing the Adani mine\u2019s railway that will move the coal from the Galilee Basin to Adani\u2019s Abbott Point coal port. The Adani mine, in Queensland\u2019s untapped Galilee Basin, has begun construction and will extract 10 million tonnes of coal a year for export to power stations. The coalmine is one of the most controversial resources projects in Australia\u2019s history, and campaigners fear the project could be the first of several to extract the region\u2019s huge coal reserves. Andy Ridley, chief executive of Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef, told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt was a clear conflict. We acted within hours and the decision was very clear. \u201cIt is a conflict in terms of us working with extractive resources industries and with thermal coal. That was a commercial decision by Greyhound but it clearly conflicts with what we believe is right for the Great Barrier Reef.\u201d De Waal resigned \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of the start of the board meeting. Ridley said the foundation had been unaware of Greyhound\u2019s contract with the Adani project until being contacted on Tuesday afternoon for comment. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Ridley. \u201cThe challenge is that we had a good partnership [with Greyhound] and we strongly supported them as a means of transport because of its low footprint and that 40,000 [of their customers] gave us a dollar. We will miss that funding.\u201d In the internal email sent to Greyhound staff, the company had defended its decision by promoting its partnership with Ridley\u2019s foundation. De Waal wrote: \u201cGreyhound could become one of many companies in the crossfire of the anti-Adani campaign.\u201d The email revealed the company, which has more than 600 staff, had won a three-month contract \u201cwith an opportunity for extension\u201d to move workers for construction firm BMD, which is building the mine\u2019s railway from the Galilee Basin to Abbot Point. \u201cThe project may create concerns to individual team members in light of the international political, environmental, social and economic debate about climate change under way in the media,\u201d the email read. A seperate public relations plan prepared for Greyhound, also seen by Guardian Australia, had produced a series of potential questions that could be aimed at the company\u2019s chief executive, and had offered media training to respond to them. One question that De Waal should be prepared to answer, the PR plan said, was: \u201cSurely you will resign as chairman of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef and/or Greyhound Australia given your conflict of interest?\u201d Greyhound Australia said it had no comment on the decision.",

Could it be the case that a David Luiz-shaped hole, the absence of David Luiz, is more defensively resilient than the actual, material David Luiz? Is the hypothetical David Luiz, an entity best expressed as (David Luiz \u2013 David Luiz) more effective as a defensive rallying point than the real thing?</p> \n<p>What is certain is that on a ground where Arsenal have in the past been alarmingly supine <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/21/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">they recovered</a> from losing a man, equalised twice and showed further signs of the kind of rigour Mikel Arteta has been working to instil.</p> \n<p>This is of course the real story here. Red cards aside, Arsenal\u2019s manager will be heartened by the performance in the final hour. Arteta played in the infamous 6-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge, the first of those gruelling collapses of the late-Wenger endgame. The future is still wide open but something was gained here, something cast off.</p> \n<p>It is a story that begins, as it must, with The Incident. David Luiz\u2019s game in numbers: 26 minutes, two fouls, four inaccurate long balls. Almost all of that time was taken up in a bruising duel with Tammy Abraham.</p> \n<p>David Luiz\u2019s first act was to punch and kick Abraham to the ground, leaving him clutching the small of his back. It is an underrated David Luiz trait, in among the crossfield punts, the dribbles, the flowing mane. He\u2019s also a solid B+ clogger.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For a while this was a good battle, one that favoured the younger man when he could stretch his legs and gallop free. And then it happened. Shkodran Mustafi was David Luiz\u2019s enabler. As the ball bounced in midfield Mustafi attempted a backpass. It was a truly terrible pass, not just badly executed, but badly conceived too, with Abraham reading it in an instant.</p> \n<p>The Chelsea man pounded off in pursuit. The Chelsea fans began to rise, feeling something strange, the inverse of all their own David Luiz moments, the other side of this thing. So this is how it feels. Thank you, thank you Shkodran, for this moment of healing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a81124cdf80a39076014faa2ac4c233032b6b02f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a81124cdf80a39076014faa2ac4c233032b6b02f/0_90_3500_2243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Luiz protests as he is given a red card by referee Stuart Attwell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Luiz protests as he is given a red card by referee Stuart Attwell.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elli Birch/IPS/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>David Luiz thundered back, Abraham nicked the ball around Bernd Leno. The tackle when it came wasn\u2019t cunning or \u201cprofessional\u201d. It was instead wholeheartedly doomed, a slide from behind that brought to mind one of those Hollywood westerns where some unsmiling sheriff splinters his way through the saloon doors with a single punch.</p> \n<p>Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot. Seconds later there was an even bigger cheer as the red card was brandished. In that moment the whole tableau almost felt a little obvious, a little cheesy, like an at-Wembley-stadium final tour bonanza, the Eagles creaking into their 10,000th calloused rendition of Hotel California. Really? This again?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/mikel-arteta-spirit-fight-leadership-arsenal\">Mikel Arteta hails \u2018spirit, fight and leadership\u2019 of 10-man Arsenal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a circularity too. David Luiz\u2019s last red card came here in a blue shirt in the same fixture three years ago. More notable, these are David Luiz\u2019s only two Premier League red cards. This is an extraordinary achievement given the sheer volume of fouls and oddities in that time.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s also evidence of some improvement as a defender. He was at least in the right place to hack his man down from behind.</p> \n<p>As Jorginho slotted away the penalty the narrative seemed set. The hope with David Luiz had always been that his best qualities \u2013 leadership, physicality, a winning mentality \u2013 could be soldered on to the Arsenal exoskeleton. At times it has seemed the opposite is happening. Arsenal-ness has been injected into the veins of David Luiz like some banned laboratory experiment, creating a potentially fatal super-David Luiz.</p> \n<p>Something has shifted though. True, this was David Luiz\u2019s third penalty concession of the season, more than any other player in the league. True, the teamsheet had suggested the depth of Arteta\u2019s task, a triple-bolt of David Luiz, Mustafi and Granit Xhaka promising all the impenetrable defensive resilience of a bead curtain. But there has been a sense of the stitching being pulled a little tighter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5306cde2-d552-4f8d-ae42-b9153a7c5d96\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Here Arteta was up on his feet repeatedly, screaming at his players for failing to track overlaps on the flanks. Arteta wants clarity, tight spaces, units playing in concert all over the pitch like men roped together on a mountain.</p> \n<p>And steadily they marched their way back into this game. Gabriel Martinelli ran 60 metres in a dead straight line and finished beautifully. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta scored after a moment of defensive brain fade, only for H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn to curl in an improbable equaliser with his left foot. Chelsea were poor at Stamford Bridge.</p> \n<p>But Arteta will take encouragement from the point; and from the feeling, once again, of shapes being formed, of a structure struggling to assert itself, solidifying here around that David Luiz-shaped hole.</p>",

Is the hypothetical David Luiz, an entity best expressed as (David Luiz \u2013 David Luiz) more effective as a defensive rallying point than the real thing? What is certain is that on a ground where Arsenal have in the past been alarmingly supine they recovered from losing a man, equalised twice and showed further signs of the kind of rigour Mikel Arteta has been working to instil. This is of course the real story here. Red cards aside, Arsenal\u2019s manager will be heartened by the performance in the final hour. Arteta played in the infamous 6-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge, the first of those gruelling collapses of the late-Wenger endgame. The future is still wide open but something was gained here, something cast off. It is a story that begins, as it must, with The Incident. David Luiz\u2019s game in numbers: 26 minutes, two fouls, four inaccurate long balls. Almost all of that time was taken up in a bruising duel with Tammy Abraham. David Luiz\u2019s first act was to punch and kick Abraham to the ground, leaving him clutching the small of his back. It is an underrated David Luiz trait, in among the crossfield punts, the dribbles, the flowing mane. He\u2019s also a solid B+ clogger. For a while this was a good battle, one that favoured the younger man when he could stretch his legs and gallop free. And then it happened. Shkodran Mustafi was David Luiz\u2019s enabler. As the ball bounced in midfield Mustafi attempted a backpass. It was a truly terrible pass, not just badly executed, but badly conceived too, with Abraham reading it in an instant. The Chelsea man pounded off in pursuit. The Chelsea fans began to rise, feeling something strange, the inverse of all their own David Luiz moments, the other side of this thing. So this is how it feels. Thank you, thank you Shkodran, for this moment of healing. David Luiz thundered back, Abraham nicked the ball around Bernd Leno. The tackle when it came wasn\u2019t cunning or \u201cprofessional\u201d. It was instead wholeheartedly doomed, a slide from behind that brought to mind one of those Hollywood westerns where some unsmiling sheriff splinters his way through the saloon doors with a single punch. Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot. Seconds later there was an even bigger cheer as the red card was brandished. In that moment the whole tableau almost felt a little obvious, a little cheesy, like an at-Wembley-stadium final tour bonanza, the Eagles creaking into their 10,000th calloused rendition of Hotel California. Really? This again? There was a circularity too. David Luiz\u2019s last red card came here in a blue shirt in the same fixture three years ago. More notable, these are David Luiz\u2019s only two Premier League red cards. This is an extraordinary achievement given the sheer volume of fouls and oddities in that time. Perhaps it\u2019s also evidence of some improvement as a defender. He was at least in the right place to hack his man down from behind. As Jorginho slotted away the penalty the narrative seemed set. The hope with David Luiz had always been that his best qualities \u2013 leadership, physicality, a winning mentality \u2013 could be soldered on to the Arsenal exoskeleton. At times it has seemed the opposite is happening. Arsenal-ness has been injected into the veins of David Luiz like some banned laboratory experiment, creating a potentially fatal super-David Luiz. Something has shifted though. True, this was David Luiz\u2019s third penalty concession of the season, more than any other player in the league. True, the teamsheet had suggested the depth of Arteta\u2019s task, a triple-bolt of David Luiz, Mustafi and Granit Xhaka promising all the impenetrable defensive resilience of a bead curtain. But there has been a sense of the stitching being pulled a little tighter. Here Arteta was up on his feet repeatedly, screaming at his players for failing to track overlaps on the flanks. Arteta wants clarity, tight spaces, units playing in concert all over the pitch like men roped together on a mountain. And steadily they marched their way back into this game. Gabriel Martinelli ran 60 metres in a dead straight line and finished beautifully. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta scored after a moment of defensive brain fade, only for H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn to curl in an improbable equaliser with his left foot. Chelsea were poor at Stamford Bridge. But Arteta will take encouragement from the point; and from the feeling, once again, of shapes being formed, of a structure struggling to assert itself, solidifying here around that David Luiz-shaped hole.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s cyber-defences are being endangered by the outdated Computer Misuse Act, which prevents investigators from dealing effectively with online threats while over-punishing immature defendants, according to a legal report. Thirty years after hacking became a criminal offence, a study by the Criminal Law Reform Now Network (CLRNN) calls for urgent revision of the legislation governing illegal access to computers, denial of service attacks and other digital crimes. The 144-page review, led by academic lawyers at Birmingham and Cambridge universities, argues that the 1990 Computer Misuse Act is \u201ccrying out for reform\u201d and must develop public interest defences for hacking. The report, Reforming the Computer Misuse Act, identifies problems of enforcement and legal obstructions that expose the UK\u2019s economy and critical infrastructure to \u201charm by cybercriminals and hostile nation states\u201d. Wide-ranging changes are needed, the report stresses, to create a legislative regime that is \u201cfit for purpose \u2013 allowing ethically motivated cyber defenders, security researchers and journalists to pursue their work with greater legal certainty, while improving the ability of the state to identify, prosecute and punish those acting against the public interest\u201d. The act exposes cybersecurity professionals to prosecution for carrying out intelligence research against cybercriminals and foreign state actors, it warns, leaving the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure at risk at a time when threats are growing. Simon McKay, a civil liberties and human rights barrister who was the project lead for the report, said: \u201cOne of our key recommendations is that a number of [legitimate] defences need to be built into the Computer Misuse Act to allow research, and integrity testing of systems. \u201cThe act does not even have any kind of defence for the way law enforcement carries out online work. They can only avoid prosecution through having a warrant and they have to stay within the confines of that.\u201d The report calls for a public interest defence to enable cyber-threat intelligence professionals, academics and journalists to explore networks to provide better protections against cyber-attacks and computer misuse. A standard research method involves using a so-called honeypot, a computer set up to appear attractive to hackers that can identify the computer sources of an attack and capture as much code as possible. If they strictly observe the law, the report says, researchers \u201cwould be very limited in probing the source of those attacks. This restricts the ability of security researchers to identify threats and pass vital information to public enforcement bodies.\u201d The report calls for greater flexibility in terms of punishments, the introduction of fines and specific guidelines for judges from the Sentencing Council when dealing with immature defendants or those diagnosed with autism or Asperger syndrome. Recent high-profile cases have involved attempts to extradite British suspects to the US for hacking \u2013 such as Lauri Love, who was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s. Dr John Child, a senior lecturer in criminal law at Birmingham University and co-director of CLRNN, said: \u201cThere\u2019s very little information for prosecutors or judges \u2026 You get some cases which have led to draconian outcomes for some youths.\u201d There should be schemes for \u201credirecting problem youths\u201d, he added. US legislators are looking at legalising \u201chack back\u201d laws that permit firms to retaliate to online attacks, Child said. The UK should not follow that example but instead create rules \u201cin line with international obligations which target the bad actors\u201d. Reports of hacking incidents to Action Fraud lines are often not investigated by police because of a shortage of resources, the report warns. Ollie Whitehouse, of NCC Group, said: \u201cThe government needs to take urgent action by updating and upgrading the Computer Misuse Act so our nation\u2019s cyber-defenders no longer have to act with one hand tied behind their backs, paralysed by the fear of being prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u201d The first recorded reports of computer crime date back to at least the 1970s when a US teenager used a computer terminal to order equipment that would be dropped off at a place of his choosing and then sold on.
