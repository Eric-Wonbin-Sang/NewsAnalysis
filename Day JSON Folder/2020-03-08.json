The private hospital sector is a great place to get things done. Taking out private health insurance actually relieves pressure on the public system. We are actually contributing to the health of other Australians by using that private choice.</p> <h2>Assuming younger people aren\u2019t taking out health insurance</h2> <p><em><strong>Matthew Koce:</strong></em> Younger people are in much greater numbers than the rest of the industry. More than 31,000 people aged under 40 have joined a Members Health fund since 2017. Our funds are attracting younger members; other funds are losing them.</p> <p>People also might not realise there are funds that are restricted to a particular industry or profession, and that many people would qualify for them. If you\u2019re with one of these funds, or another Members Health fund, you\u2019ve got access to a national hospital network, just like any other insurer.</p> <p>No matter how old or young you are, life can deliver some unpleasant surprises. For example, an injury on the sporting field may require elective surgery, and not having private health insurance could mean a very long and painful wait for treatment in a public hospital.</p> <h2>Not realising that pre-existing condition rules don\u2019t refer to whether the consumer already knew about the condition</h2> <p><em><strong>Ombudsman:</strong></em> Consumers may not realise that the pre-existing condition (PEC) rule relies on the signs and symptoms being present prior to joining an insurer, and not whether the consumer already knew about the condition or if the condition has already been diagnosed. Conditions deemed to be PEC are not covered in the first 12 months after joining or upgrading.</p> <h2>Thinking that if you\u2019re really sick you will end up going to a public hospital</h2> <p><em><strong>Michael Roff:</strong> </em>There\u2019s a common myth that if you\u2019re really sick, you\u2019ll end up going to a public hospital. That is not necessarily the case. About a third of all hospital beds in Australia are private, and private hospitals undertake about 40% of all episodes of care, and 60% of all surgery.</p> <p>The research we\u2019ve done shows people take out private hospital cover for peace of mind, and choice and access, but there\u2019s not a good understanding of what people are and aren\u2019t covered for. Understanding what is and is not in your product is very important, and you should continually monitor that as you go through different stages of life.</p> <h2><strong>Guardian: How do consumers get it wrong when trying to get the most out of their health funds?</strong></h2> <h2>Not asking the right questions before choosing their fund</h2> <p><em><strong>Ombudsman:</strong></em> Issues can arise when consumers find that they are not covered for a service or treatment that they had assumed was included in their cover, leaving them unable to access treatment or incurring large expenses to access the hospital treatment they need.</p> <p>Customers can avoid this challenge and choose the right health fund for them by asking the right questions.</p> <p>- If I go to hospital, will I have to pay an excess or make any co-payments?</p> <p>- Are there any treatments I won\u2019t get full hospital benefits for? Am I willing to take the risk of not being fully covered for those treatments?</p> <p>- Does the insurer have agreements with the private hospitals I might need to attend in my area?</p> <p>- How does the insurer\u2019s gap cover scheme work?</p> <p>- Will this policy exempt me from the Medicare levy surcharge? How much will this policy cost?</p> <h2>Buying on price point, not on need, and overreliance on comparison sites</h2> <p><em><strong>Michael Roff:</strong></em> People are buying on a price point rather than what they might need. We did some research recently that showed more than 40% of people didn\u2019t know whether their product had an exclusion.</p> <p>Consumers also need to be wary of commercial comparison websites. The government has <a href=\"https://www.privatehealth.gov.au/dynamic/search/start\" rel=\"nofollow\">a comprehensive site that covers every product</a>.</p> <p>Make sure you pick a level of cover that has all the services you need, and then compare different funds on price and service models.</p> <p><em><strong>Matthew Koce</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Comparison websites often receive commissions, which may influence who and what they recommend. They also do not always show every health fund in the market, nor every product available. That\u2019s why it is best to shop around by going directly to health fund websites and picking up the phone for a chat.</p> <p>Getting the right cover to fit with your lifestyle and health needs is really important. For families with kids, dental cover may be a key consideration. If you\u2019re into sports, physio, chiro and remedial massage may be a priority. Having chat with the experts at a <a href=\"http://membershealth.com.au/our-funds/find-a-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Members Health fund</a> can prove to be a very wise investment of your time.</p> <h2>Looking at price and not at restrictions, exclusions and excesses</h2> <p><em><strong>Matthew Koce</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Consumers should carefully consider restrictions, exclusions, excesses and co-payments when making their selection. Just going off the overall premium price can lead to some nasty surprises. If you do take out a policy with restrictions and exclusions, Members Health funds are very good at making sure you will be informed about what is covered, and more importantly, what is not.</p> <p>One of the things members get is really good advice. Before anyone is admitted to hospital, we always encourage them to ring their health fund and have a chat. Check out each of our member funds sites - <a href=\"http://membershealth.com.au/our-funds/find-a-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">links are found on our homepage</a> - then pick up the phone and talk to the experts.</p> <h2>A set and forget mentality</h2> <p><em><strong>Terry Barnes:</strong></em> A lot of people with private health insurance set and forget. With <a href=\"https://www.privatehealth.gov.au/health_insurance/phichanges/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">the government\u2019s changes to rules for tiers</a> you can sit down relatively easily and work out what\u2019s in your policy and what\u2019s not.</p> <p>It\u2019s up to you to keep checking and making sure your policy covers everything you and your family need. There are 35-odd health funds, so it\u2019s understanding the differences between what they offer, the levels of cover that you are interested in, and having a real sense of what you and your family\u2019s health needs are actually like to be over the next five, 10, 20 years.</p> <p>Be prepared to buy. You may not need the top level of cover now, but you may need it in future - you can always change as your needs change.</p> <p><em><strong>To learn more about Members Health and the funds that put people before profits, go to <a href=\"http://www.membershealth.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">membershealth.com.au</a>.</strong></em></p>",

We talked to four experts to find out how we could all be getting more from our cover. The panel: Guardian: What are the most common myths Australians believe about private health insurance? Thinking the public system will look after them Terry Barnes: The most common misconception is that people can rely on the public system to look after them - when they need it, where they need it and for what they need - and that\u2019s not always the case. The private hospital sector is a great place to get things done. Taking out private health insurance actually relieves pressure on the public system.

If you\u2019re with one of these funds, or another Members Health fund, you\u2019ve got access to a national hospital network, just like any other insurer. No matter how old or young you are, life can deliver some unpleasant surprises. For example, an injury on the sporting field may require elective surgery, and not having private health insurance could mean a very long and painful wait for treatment in a public hospital. Not realising that pre-existing condition rules don\u2019t refer to whether the consumer already knew about the condition Ombudsman: Consumers may not realise that the pre-existing condition (PEC) rule relies on the signs and symptoms being present prior to joining an insurer, and not whether the consumer already knew about the condition or if the condition has already been diagnosed. Conditions deemed to be PEC are not covered in the first 12 months after joining or upgrading.

Understanding what is and is not in your product is very important, and you should continually monitor that as you go through different stages of life. Guardian: How do consumers get it wrong when trying to get the most out of their health funds? Not asking the right questions before choosing their fund Ombudsman: Issues can arise when consumers find that they are not covered for a service or treatment that they had assumed was included in their cover, leaving them unable to access treatment or incurring large expenses to access the hospital treatment they need. Customers can avoid this challenge and choose the right health fund for them by asking the right questions. - If I go to hospital, will I have to pay an excess or make any co-payments? - Are there any treatments I won\u2019t get full hospital benefits for? Am I willing to take the risk of not being fully covered for those treatments? - Does the insurer have agreements with the private hospitals I might need to attend in my area? - How does the insurer\u2019s gap cover scheme work? - Will this policy exempt me from the Medicare levy surcharge? How much will this policy cost? Buying on price point, not on need, and overreliance on comparison sites Michael Roff: People are buying on a price point rather than what they might need. We did some research recently that showed more than 40% of people didn\u2019t know whether their product had an exclusion. Consumers also need to be wary of commercial comparison websites. The government has a comprehensive site that covers every product. Make sure you pick a level of cover that has all the services you need, and then compare different funds on price and service models. Matthew Koce: Comparison websites often receive commissions, which may influence who and what they recommend. They also do not always show every health fund in the market, nor every product available. That\u2019s why it is best to shop around by going directly to health fund websites and picking up the phone for a chat. Getting the right cover to fit with your lifestyle and health needs is really important. For families with kids, dental cover may be a key consideration. If you\u2019re into sports, physio, chiro and remedial massage may be a priority. Having chat with the experts at a Members Health fund can prove to be a very wise investment of your time. Looking at price and not at restrictions, exclusions and excesses Matthew Koce: Consumers should carefully consider restrictions, exclusions, excesses and co-payments when making their selection. Just going off the overall premium price can lead to some nasty surprises. If you do take out a policy with restrictions and exclusions, Members Health funds are very good at making sure you will be informed about what is covered, and more importantly, what is not. One of the things members get is really good advice. Before anyone is admitted to hospital, we always encourage them to ring their health fund and have a chat. Check out each of our member funds sites - links are found on our homepage - then pick up the phone and talk to the experts. A set and forget mentality Terry Barnes: A lot of people with private health insurance set and forget. With the government\u2019s changes to rules for tiers you can sit down relatively easily and work out what\u2019s in your policy and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s up to you to keep checking and making sure your policy covers everything you and your family need. There are 35-odd health funds, so it\u2019s understanding the differences between what they offer, the levels of cover that you are interested in, and having a real sense of what you and your family\u2019s health needs are actually like to be over the next five, 10, 20 years. Be prepared to buy. You may not need the top level of cover now, but you may need it in future - you can always change as your needs change.

He said the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia had risen to 74, including two members of the Australian defence force.</p> \n  <p>He also commented on the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70?page=with:block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e#block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e\">an 82-year-old man in Sydney</a>, one of the residents of the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, and the third person to die after testing positive to Covid-19 in Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a great loss to him, his family, to all of the community, which will feel this loss,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Hunt urged people to be \u201ctheir best selves\u201d</strong> in what seems to be an oblique reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">the toilet paper wars. </a></p> \n  <p>\u201cOnly two months ago, as a nation, we faced the great challenge of the bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we rose. We were our best selves, and this is the time to be our best selves and to let our better angels prevail.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd our job, working with the states and territory, but working with the community, is to make sure that we are not just prepared, but that we are unified.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd so there have been some things which have occurred in recent days which have not been our best selves. But it was only two months ago, as I say, that as a country, the spirit of the volunteer, the spirit of the CFA and the RFS and our emergency service.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Hunt returned to this point a lot, comparing the spirit required in response to the global coronavirus outbreak to that seen in response to the Australian bushfires. (You will recall the Australian government was heavily criticised for its management of that crisis.)</p> \n  <p>He also announced that the Australian government had secured an additional 54m face masks for its national reserve and said that no primary health network in Australia had exhausted its first round of masks.</p> \n  <p>So that means that, contrary to reports from GPs that they are struggling to get the appropriate personal protective equipment. Hunt said there may have been some miscommunications which meant that busy medical practices \u201cmay not have realised that they\u2019ve had that\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Hunt was asked to comment on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies\">a spat unfolding in Victoria between the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, and GPs</a>, who were incensed at her comments that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d a GP who was later diagnosed with Covid-19 had gone to work with cold- and/or flu-like symptoms.</p> \n  <p>Hunt drew on the bushfire analogy again: \u201cOver summer our firefighters and our emergency service workers were our heroes. In the coming months it will be our health and medical service workers who will be our national heroes.

Thanks for following - here\u2019s a summary of the latest coronavirus developments. The UK has announced its third death from the virus. He was a man in his 60s who had underlying health problems. The decree imposing a lockdown for more than a quarter of Italy\u2019s population was officially approved by the government and checkpoints are expected to appear at toll booths, stations and other points of entry to Lombardy. Five more people have tested positive in Northern Ireland, bringing the UK total to 278. The UK Department of Health is now advising anyone who has returned from the lockdown areas in northern Italy to self-isolate for two weeks, even if they do not have coronavirus symptoms. The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has risen from 233 on Saturday to 366, officials have said. The 57% increase is the steepest daily rise in fatalities since the outbreak came to light. Deaths from coronavirus in France rise from 11 to 19. French health officials have confirmed 1,126 cases of coronavirus. Israel declared on Sunday that it will close its border with Egypt, beginning 5pm local time. The Taba border crossing between Egypt\u2019s Sinai region and the Israeli town of Eilat is a popular crossing point for tourists. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has not been tested for coronavirus, but her symptoms are improving, the Free Nazanin campaign has said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, currently jailed in Iran, was taken to see a prison doctor earlier in the week who told her that her symptoms were consistent with coronavirus, the campaign said on Sunday evening. Five more people have tested positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said. The new cases bring the UK total to 278. A statement on the website said: \u201cTesting of patients in Northern Ireland has resulted in five new presumptive positive results for coronavirus (Covid-19) bringing the total to 12 since testing began. \u201cContact tracing from these five cases is being conducted by Public Health Agency staff. \u201cA more detailed update will be provided on the situation tomorrow, when this contact tracing work is at a more advanced stage.\u201d Budget airline easyJet is cancelling flights to parts of northern Italy affected by the coronavirus lockdown. A spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing a decree issued by the Italian authorities implementing further restrictions for anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces in Italy, easyJet in common with a number of other airlines is reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports for the period from now until April 3 2020. \u201cIn the short term, we will be cancelling a number of flights to and from these destinations on Monday March 9.\u201d The airline said affected passengers would be informed of cancellations by email and text message. \u201cCustomers on flights scheduled to operate to and from these airports will be given the option of a full refund or to change their flight,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe expect to continue to reduce the number of flights in and out of Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports in the period up to April 3 and will provide a further update on our schedule in due course.\u201d The Foreign Office says it is \u201cworking intensively\u201d with US authorities to arrange a flight for British nationals on the coronavirus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship, which is due to arrive in Oakland, California, on Monday. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain in close contact with the local authorities and will work with them on their plans. \u201cWe are also in contact with the Grand Princess\u2019 staff, and are ready to support any British nationals who need our assistance.\u201d A healthcare worker at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHSFT) has tested positive for coronavirus.

A statement on the UHSFT website said: \u201cThe small number of patients and staff who came into close contact with this individual have been informed and will be appropriately isolated. \u201cThe surgical high dependency unit is temporarily closed to new admissions. Any patient affected by the temporary closure will be contacted directly. \u201cThe trust is following Public Health England and NHS guidance in respect of the virus and all other services are operating normally. \u201cPatients and staff should continue to attend appointments normally and come into work unless advised not to.\u201d A man in his 60s, who had underlying health problems, has become the third patient to die after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK. The man, who died at North Manchester general hospital had recently returned from Italy, NHS England said. England\u2019s chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said: \u201cI am very sorry to report that a third patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their privacy is respected. \u201cThe patient, who was being treated at the North Manchester General Hospital, was over 60 years old and had significant underlying health conditions. \u201cThey had recently travelled from an affected area. Contact tracing is already under way.\u201d An inmate died on Sunday after a riot at a prison in Modena that broke out when detainees were informed that the new emergency decree bans visits and contacts between prisoners and their relatives in order to reduce infections. Other jail riots were also sparked in Salerno and Frosinone when the news of the draft decree banning visits from relatives spread among inmates. A group of British travellers quarantined on the Grand Princess cruise ship said they have no idea when they will be able to return to the UK. Although the ship is due to dock in Oakland, California, on Monday, only passengers requiring treatment and state residents will be allowed to disembark. It is not known what will happen to passengers from other countries. Justine Griffin, of Leicestershire, was on board with her husband Dave and friends Jan and Allen Duffin, and Sharon and Steve Lane, when it was placed into quarantine. She told PA news agency: \u201cWe won\u2019t be getting off tomorrow as we are at the bottom of the list. First the sick, then Californians, then any other Americans. \u201cThey have no plans for international passengers yet - rumours going round about Texas but nothing concrete yet.\u201d The couple, who renewed their vows on board for their 25th wedding anniversary, have not been tested for coronavirus but believe they will have to enter quarantine in the UK for two weeks when they return home. The Department of Health is now advising anyone who has returned from the lockdown areas in northern Italy to self-isolate for two weeks, even if they do not have coronavirus symptoms. Travel and health advice was updated on Sunday evening after the entire Lombardy region and 14 other provinces were placed in quarantine. Anyone returning from anywhere in Lombardy, which includes Milan and Como, should self-isolate, as should those returning from Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini (all in Emilia Romagna); Pesaro e Urbino (in Marche); Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola and Vercelli (all in Piedmont) and Padova, Treviso and Venice (in Veneto). For the latest advice click here. France has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people to try and contain coronavirus. It comes after the number of deaths rose from 11 on Saturday to 19 on Sunday, when officials also confirmed the number of cases had increased to 1,126. On Friday president Emmanuel Macron warned an epidemic was \u201cinevitable\u201d in the country. The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice for Italy after a backlash over a lack of clarity for people with holidays booked and those currently in locked-down areas. The department is now advising against all but essential travel to the whole of the Lombardy region, where 16 million Italians are in mandatory quarantine. British holidaymakers had been left confused because, hours after the quarantine was announced, it was still advising that it was safe to travel to anywhere apart from 11 towns where the outbreak originated. Travellers are now advised to check their flight details with airlines. The Foreign Office is also advising against travel to areas of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Piemonte and Veneto. For the full list of affected areas, click here. British nationals can still leave Italy without restriction. Portugal\u2019s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has cancelled his diary events for the next two weeks and will remain in quarantine at his residence after a case of the coronavirus was detected at a school whose students visited the presidential palace last Tuesday. A statement posted on the president\u2019s website on Sunday said the decision had been taken as a precaution even though neither the infected student or their class were among those who visited the Bel\u00e9m palace. \u201cHaving listened to health authorities, the president, who is not showing any symptoms of the virus, has decided to cancel all public engagements,\u201d the statement added. It said that while the president would continue to work from his private residence, he had decided to lead by example so as to underline the need for precautions during the outbreak. Twenty-five cases of the disease have been confirmed in Portugal, while the total over the border in Spain reached 617 on Sunday, which has recorded 13 deaths. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel is considering broadening entry restrictions to include travellers from all countries, a move that would effectively cut off foreign tourism. At a news conference, the prime minister said the measure, if taken, would require anyone arriving in Israel to go into home quarantine for two weeks. A decision will be made on Monday. Israel already requires self-quarantine for travellers arriving from 15 countries in Europe and Asia. Over in the US, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said his campaign was gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health experts say could be breeding grounds for coronavirus. As the virus hits more states, health officials have been advising older people and those with medical conditions to avoid crowded spaces. Music and arts festivals around the country have been cancelled as a result. Supermarkets have started rationing items to try and prevent people from stockpiling. Shelves across the country have been stripped of items after Public Health England urged members of the public to \u201cplan ahead\u201d in case they had to self-isolate for a couple of weeks. Read this by Helen Pidd for the full story. The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has risen from 233 on Saturday to 366, officials have said. The 57% increase is the steepest daily rise in fatalities since the outbreak came to light. The total number of confirmed cases in the country now stands at 7,375 - up from 5,883 on Saturday. French health officials have confirmed 1,126 cases of coronavirus, with the death toll increasing from 11 on Saturday to 19 on Sunday. The death toll in the northern Italian region of Lombardy has risen over the past day to 257 from 154, a local official has said. The latest national death toll figures are due to be released later on Sunday. On Saturday, the country-wide tally stood at 233. Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly has more on the latest from Germany after the first German death from coronavirus was announced earlier today: A 60-year-old man who travelled to Egypt a week ago has died of the illness, the Egyptian health ministry said. As the number of cases in Germany climbed to 1,028 on Sunday (Robert Koch Institute, 1.54pm local time), Germany\u2019s Bundesliga was forced to react to health minister Jens Spahn\u2019s recommendation that events drawing more than 1,000 participants, including football matches, conferences, trade fairs and concerts, should be cancelled. As Germany has a federal system, Spahn does not have the power to call off events, but his advice is likely to be taken seriously and has been welcomed by many who had complained the government\u2019s response to the virus has so far been too laid-back. Germany\u2019s football league, the DFL has said it will be in touch with all clubs to discuss how to deal with the current situation. \u201cThe coronavirus is bringing the entire society and with it, the game of football, into a difficult situation,\u201d DFL\u2019s manager, Christian Seifert, told German media. The DFL\u2019s leadership is due to meet shortly and will then meet with each club individually, Seifert said. He added, the aim had to be \u201cto find an appropriate middle way between justified precaution and exaggerated caution,\u201d Seifert said. But he said it was \u201cwithout question\u201d that the football season needed to carry on until mid May, when it is due to end. Peter Liese, health spokesman for the leading Christian Democrats said he was in favour of games being played in empty stadiums, the next scheduled one being a rearranged fixture between M\u00f6nchengladbach and Cologne on Wednesday. \u201cThe danger of contagion does not just apply to the stadium itself but to the full trains bringing the spectators to the match,\u201d he said. Announcing his recommendation on Sunday following an emergency government meeting, Spahn said he was depending on each individual to make sensible decisions. \u201cI encourage each and every individual to weigh up what\u2019s important to you in your own daily life, which you really cannot do without in the next two to three months, whether it\u2019s visiting a club, a birthday party with friends or an association meeting,\u201d he added. More countries will adopt Italy\u2019s measures \u2013 Austrian leader Here is my colleague Jon Henley\u2019s full report on comments made by Austria\u2019s chancellor Sebastian Kurz earlier today. The chancellor said other European countries will be forced to adopt containment measures as drastic as Italy\u2019s, after Rome placed a quarter of the population in lockdown in an effort to halt the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Egypt has reported its first death from coronavirus. The deceased is a German national, according to the Egyptian health ministry. In the UK, a number of supermarkets have placed restrictions on items including pasta, anti-bacterial wipes and hand soap in a bid to prevent shoppers from stockpiling. PA Media reports that the brands to restrict purchases so far include: Tesco: a five-item limit on a number of items including pasta, anti-bacterial wipes, gels and sprays, and long-life milk Waitrose: restrictions on certain anti-bacterial soaps and wipes when shopping online Asda: hand sanitiser restricted to two per person both in-store and online. No food restrictions. Many anti-bacterial products out of stock online. Sainsbury\u2019s, Lidl and Morrisons have no restrictions at the moment. Aldi and Ocado have not yet confirmed any restrictions. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said there is \u201cabsolutely no reason\u201d for the British public to panic buy. Airline Alitalia is reorganising air services at Milan and Venice airports from Monday following the Italian government\u2019s coronavirus measures. It will operate only domestic flights to and from Milan Linate airport and serve international routes from Rome airport. All national and international flights will be suspended to and from Milan Malpensa airport. \u2022 Italy has been plunged into chaos after details of a plan to quarantine more than 16 million people in the north amid an escalating coronavirus outbreak were leaked to the press, sending thousands into panic as they tried to flee south. The whole of Lombardy, including its financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, have been shut down until 3 April as Italy grapples to contain the spread of a virus that has so far killed 233 people and infected 5,883. Thousands crowded train stations in Lombardy or jumped into their cars after details of a draft decree banning people from leaving or entering the region were revealed by Corriere della Sera late on Saturday afternoon. \u2022 As Italy\u2019s sports minister called for the cancellation of matches in Italy\u2019s topflight Serie A division, cycling authorities have postponed this month\u2019s Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo races because of the coronavirus outbreak. The decision, which includes rescheduling the Tour of Sicily at the start of April, follows the Italian government\u2019s decision to suspend all sporting events that cannot be held in a closed arena until 3 April. \u2022 Britain\u2019s health secretary has insisted the UK government will do \u201ceverything in its power\u201d to delay and mitigate the coronavirus threat as the number of people in the country to test positive for Covid-19 rose from 209 to 273. Matt Hancock set out plans contained in emergency legislation to deal with the impact of the virus, as GPs warned hospitals will have to cut back on work not related to coronavirus in order to tackle the outbreak. The bill, which is likely to go through parliament by the end of the month, is expected to include measures to allow some court proceedings to be conducted via telephone or video. \u2022 Among other countries reporting increases in the number of cases, Spain confirmed 589, along with 17 deaths, while Iraq said there had been two further deaths on top of previous four. In the US, the number of people in New York state who have tested positive for the coronavirus has increased to 105 as of Sunday, up from 89 the day before, governor Andrew Cuomo told a news briefing. An EasyJet flight from Porto to Lyon was diverted to Toulouse airport this afternoon after a suspected coronavirus case on board. Passengers were confined to the aircraft for several hours and emergency services were called. Some interesting points about the usefulness of the latest UK figures, now up to 273, are made by one expert in epidemiology, who says it\u2019s going to be important to know if new cases are forming clusters. Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) said the numbers on their own are not very informative now. We need to know if these new cases are forming clusters or can be traced to known cases in other ways (such as imports from Italy) to understand if we have moved out of the initial containment stage. If they are clusters, we are sampling contacts of cases sufficiently and understanding the outbreak dynamics. If they are apparently randomly distributed, then we know there are more cases than are being reported and we can expect rapid increases in numbers over the coming days and weeks. The Department of Health says it ill be providing a regional breakdown later today. A number of International Women\u2019s Day events were cancelled across Asia in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus, with several events called off in South Korea, the country with the most severe outbreak outside of China. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t be physically together, our minds for realising gender equality are stronger than ever,\u201d the country\u2019s gender equality minister Lee Jung-Ok said in a video message. A women\u2019s marathon set to take place in India was also postponed over fears that it could facilitate the spread of infection. However, marches went ahead in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, whilst Chinese state broadcaster CCTV used the occasion to highlight the work of female medics tackling coronavirus. Events continued across the world, although many participants, particularly in Iraq, could be seen wearing face masks. While much of Italy remains in lockdown, the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, released a video message in which he expressed his disappointment at the need to avoid large-scale gatherings. He said he was giving \u201ca grateful thought to the women \u2013 and there are many \u2013 who are working in hospitals ... in the red [quarantine] zones to fight the spread of the virus that worries us today.\u201d Israel declared on Sunday that it will close its border with Egypt, beginning 5pm local time. The Taba border crossing between Egypt\u2019s Sinai region and the Israeli town of Eilat is a popular crossing point for tourists. Egypt announced 33 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday on a cruise ship that travelled between the southern cities of Aswan and Luxor, bringing the total number on board to 45. Reports indicate the ship has since been quarantined, with infected passengers and crew flown to an isolation camp near the town of Marsa Matruh. Matt Swider, a passenger on board the Asara cruise ship named as the site of the COVID-19 outbreak tweeted his account as he and 32 others were flown by military plane to a hospital for quarantine. \u201cI was told I tested negative and then there was a mistake and I\u2019m positive for coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my home in Egypt for the foreseeable future, until I am cleared of #coronavirus,\u201d he added, including a picture of his hospital bed. Separately, Egypt\u2019s Minister of Health said Sunday that the first Egyptian to contract COVID-19 is now \u201cin a critical condition.\u201d The 44-year old is an Egyptian citizen who displayed symptoms of the virus after they returned home from a trip to Serbia. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK is going to double every few days, according to a British health expert who was reacting to the news earlier that a total of 273 people have now tested positive. Prof Tom Solomon, Walton Centre NHS foundation trust, and Institute of Infection &amp; Global Health, University of Liverpool, said 67 new cases in the UK was not that big an increase nor unexpected given it was likely the number of cases would double every few days. He added: As the numbers continue to grow we are moving from a phase of containment, where we hoped we could stop the outbreak completely, to one of delay. This means all our efforts are aimed at slowing the outbreak down. Ultimately perhaps 50 to 80% of the population may get infected with this virus. Currently about 5% of patients are needing hospitalisation. If all these people become infected in a short time window, eg a few weeks, then we will have a very large number who need to go to hospital all at the same time. And the health services will really struggle. However, If we can spread the outbreak over many months, the health services will be able to cope better with the same number of patients, because not everyone will need to care at the same time. The BBC have meanwhile carried this interview with a Briton who contracted coronavirus after travelling to northern Italy recently. The man said that he had a dry cough over the weekend and then suddenly had a headache and a fever, as well as \u201cstrange chills\u201d which seemed to reverberate around the body. It\u2019s worth stressing of course that most health experts have stressed that most people will not need to be hospitalised. Large numbers of people arriving in Israel for the Jewish holiday of Pessach could be affected by an Israeli government announcement later today on whether new arrivals will have to self-quarantine, reports the journalist Anshel Pfeffer A total of 150 cases of coronavirus in Singapore, which announced 12 new ones today, include one which health authorities there say is is likely to be an \u201cimported case\u201d involving a 37-year-old woman who had visited from 23 February to 27 February. The woman, a permanent resident in Singapore, was confirmed to have the disease on 6 March. Egypt is rushing to protect its important tourism sector and reassure travellers it is safe to visit after an outbreak of the coronavirus on a cruise ship on the River Nile. Officials said on Saturday the coronavirus had been detected in 45 people, including foreign tourists, after the vessel reached the southern city of Luxor. Until then, Egypt had reported only three confirmed cases of the virus. Reuters reports that the ministers of tourism, health and civil aviation toured a temple on Sunday in central Luxor, across the Nile from the Valley of the Kings where pharaohs were buried in tombs carved into rock. \u201cWe are here to respond to rumours saying that there are no tourists and people are afraid of coming. Thank God, people are here,\u201d Khaled al-Anani, the tourism and antiquities minister, told state television before the camera panned across to show tourists queuing to enter the site. The cruise boat struck by the virus has been towed outside Luxor and placed under quarantine, state media reported. Those who tested positive were flown by military plane for quarantine in northern Egypt. Football matches in Italy\u2019s topflight Serie A division have kicked off inside empty grounds this afternoon despite a call by the Italian Minister of Sport, Vincenzo Spadafora, for the cancellation of all games until further notice. Spadafora said that it made no sense to put at risk the health of players, officials, fans and others. The news filtered through as players from Parma and Spal were already on the pitch in their clash in Parma today. They were invited to return dressing room and the game has been delayed. The match eventually kicked off at 1.45 pm. Milan versus Genoa and Sampdoria vs Verona have instead started at 3 pm. The \u2018derby of Italy\u2019 between Juve and Inter is set to be played on Sunday night. Britain\u2019s National Health Service needs more money to deal with coronavirus as a total of 18 people test positive for coronavirus in Scotland, Scotland\u2019s First Minister has said. \u201cI think it is pretty much inevitable that we will need additional resources for our National Health Service,\u201d Nicola Sturgeon told \u2018Sophy Ridge on Sunday\u2019 on Sky News. She added that \u201cthe pressures that are likely to come from coronavirus in the weeks ahead means that we will need to see additional resources so I very much hope that the budget has positive things to say about that.\u201d A total of 18 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of one since yesterday. Health authorities have carried out a total of 1957 tests by Sunday 8th March. Sturgeon said that \u201ca wealth of preparation\u201d is underway to deal with the outbreak in Scotland: \u201cWe are prepared, we are preparing all the time\u2026 there is a wealth of preparation underway, looking at how we better support vulnerable people, people who might be asked to self-isolate and who will be in a position of not being paid for the work that they\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cIt is a serious situation we face and that\u2019s true of all of the governments across the UK but we\u2019re taking it seriously and we\u2019re doing everything possible to mitigate it as far as we possibly can.\u201d At least two people people being held in a UK immigration facility have been tested for coronavirus and have tested negative, according to the campaign group Detention Action, which says that detention centres will not be able to cope with the virus. All public events with more than 1,000 participants should be called off, Germany\u2019s Health Minister, Jens Spahn, has said. Adding that up until now organisers had been too reluctant to do this, he told news agency DPA: \u201cGiven how fast things are developing, that should change quickly.\u201d Under Germany\u2019s federal system, the health minister does not have the power to call off individual events, but a strong lead from the federal government typically encourages federal states to follow suit. Spahn also called for European collaboration on a bulked up centre for research into the identification, surveillance and prevention of infectious diseases, similar to Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute. Spain has also called for a similar EU initiative. One of five new cases of coronavirus in Peru includes a patient who had recently travelled to London, Peruvian health authorities have said. Peru\u2019s Ministry of Health (Minsa) confirmed that cases of the disease had risen to six in less than 48 hours and the patients were under home isolation, Health Vice Minister Nancy Zerpa announced. They include a case in the city of Arequipa, a 29-year-old Peruvian student who arrived from London on February 29 without presenting symptoms The decree imposing a lockdown for more than a quarter of Italy\u2019s population has now been officially approved by the government and checkpoints are expected to appear at toll booths, stations and other points of entry to Lombardy. It also provides for measures for all of Italy. Weddings and funerals are suspended throughout the country Movement in and out of Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces is prohibited. People will be allowed in and out for serious reasons, including work reasons, upon the authorisation of local authorities. The decree also puts a ban on all public events, the closure of cinemas, theatres and gyms. However, the effects of the decree on flights and trains are still not yet clear. Under the new general guidelines, local judicial authorities could decide whether to suspend flights. At the moment, it is still possible to travel by train and plane to Lombardy but, in the next few hours, checkpoints should be placed at toll booths, stations and airports. Public transport within the cities will instead remain guaranteed. A total of 273 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, health authorities have said in their latest figures, updating a number which had stood at 209. A total of 23,513 people had been tested by 9am on Sunday morning. Two people have died. The Department of Health says it ill be providing a regional breakdown later today A group of people released from quarantine after returning from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship have praised by Britain\u2019s Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has for setting a \u201cgood example\u201d to the public. The group of 30 Britons and two Irish nationals were released from isolation at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral today after having been given the all-clear from infection. They were repatriated from Japan last month having been passengers on the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. Around 700 people caught the illness while the ship was held in quarantine for several weeks - more than a quarter of the 2,600 people on board. Thanking Arrowe Park\u2019s staff and the quarantined group, Mr Hancock said: \u201cTackling coronavirus is a national effort and they have set a good example for the rest of the public as more people may need to self-isolate themselves at home. \u201cPublic safety is our top priority and we all have a part to play in containing the spread of the virus.\u201d Tens of tourists who flew from London to Hanoi last week are being quarantined across Vietnam over fears they may have been exposed to the coronavirus, report the Guardian\u2019s Rebecca Ratcliffe and Lam Le in Hanoi A British traveller, who is among those being isolated, said that he and his luggage had been sprayed with disinfectant and quarantined in a hotel room. He said was not sure how long he would be required to stay in the room, but that he is awaiting a test. It was hoped that Vietnam, which hadn\u2019t reported any new cases for several weeks, had managed to contain the virus, but several cases linked to a flight from London have emerged over recent days. On Friday, officials confirmed that a 26-year-old Vietnamese woman had tested positive after returning from a trip to London, Milan and Paris. A relative and her driver have since tested positive, as have 10 passengers who were also on the flight, according to Vietnamese media. This includes, six British, a Mexican and an Icelandic citizen. Authorities have since reportedly quarantined tens of passengers from the flight, as well as a further 127 contacts who may have been exposed. This includes 40 foreign citizens who are being isolated in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam province, home to tourism hot spot H\u1ed9i An, an ancient riverside town, as well as several people being quarantined in Ho Chi Minh city, Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf province, Hai Phong city and Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a province. In H\u1ea1 Long, a popular tourist destination apparently visited by 52 passengers from the flight, around 300,000 residents have been told to undergo a health check and complete a health declaration. Most of the travellers from the flight are understood to have since left, though those remaining have been placed in isolation at hotels. The US Army has decided to restrict travel to and from Italy and South Korea due to coronavirus outbreaks, and will also prohibit foreign troops from participating in US exercises, exchanges and visits in the most affected nations. The decision, described to Reuters by an Army spokeswoman, follows the confirmation on Saturday that two additional US service personnel have tested positive for the virus: a sailor in Italy and a Marine at Fort Belvoir, Virginia - an important military base in a Washington DC suburb. The NHS \u201calmost certainly does\u201d need more money to deal with coronavirus, the chair of Britain\u2019s Royal College of GPs has said. Martin Marshall told \u2018Sophy Ridge on Sunday\u2019 on Sky News earlier: It almost certainly does. This is a significant crisis for the health service, the health service is already under pressure as we know and if we are going to continue doing what we are doing in the health service and deal with coronavirus, it requires a significant amount of resource. More likely I suspect we will cut down on some of the routine work that is done by the health service to allow the NHS to focus on dealing with the coronavirus. He added that bringing retired doctors back into work was \u201ca good idea as long as we do it carefully\u201d: I think it is a good idea as long as we do it carefully. People are estimating that maybe 20% of the workforce might be out of action at any one time when the crisis reaches its peak\u2026 If that happens then we do need to expand the workforce in whatever way we can. Cycling authorities have postponed this month\u2019s Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo races because of the coronavirus outbreak. The decision, which includes rescheduling the Tour of Sicily at the start of April, follows the Italian government\u2019s decision to suspend all sporting events that cannot be held in a closed arena until 3 April. The Tirreno-Adriatico had been due to start on 11 March, with Milan-San Remo on 21 March but organisers are looking for alternative dates later in the year. Teams including CCC, Astana, Ineos and Mitchelton-Scott had already withdrawn from a number of races. Meanwhle, in golf, next week\u2019s European Tour event in Nairobi and the Asian Tour\u2019s Royal\u2019s Cup 2020 in Thailand have been postponed indefinitely. The event in Nairobi has been called off after the Kenyan government decided to postpone all international meetings and conferences in the country for at least a month. Italian football\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak was thrown into further confusion on Sunday when Parma\u2019s home match against Spal was delayed by 75 minutes following an intervention by Italy\u2019s sports minister. Both teams\u2019 players were standing in the tunnel at the Stadio Tardini, preparing to start the game behind closed doors, when the referee called them back into the dressing room, having received the call that the minister for sport, Vincenzo Spadafora, and the Italian FA (FIGC) were considering a total suspension of the Serie A season. Instead, after a 35-minute delay, it was announced the game would go ahead along with, it is assumed, the rest of this weekend\u2019s fixture list. The game kicked off at 12.45pm GMT. Spadafora had said he supported a call from the Italian footballers association president, Damiano Tommasi, to avoid putting players at risk from the virus outbreak. It is only a matter of time until more European countries adopt the kind of aggressive steps that Italy is taking to combat the spread of the coronavirus, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has said. Italy, Austria\u2019s southern neighbour, imposed a virtual lockdown across a swathe of its wealthy north on Sunday including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic new attempt to try to contain a rapidly growing outbreak. Kurz told broadcaster ORF the situation in Austria - where health authorities have reported 104 confirmed coronavirus cases so far - was under control and the measures it has adopted were proper, although probably not the final steps required. Here\u2019s footage of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announcing a range of tough new measures in the early hours of Sunday to try to contain Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, including the virtual lockdown of the country\u2019s wealthiest and most populous region. We\u2019re speaking to people living in the lockdown zone but would also like to hear from people who are on holiday there. If you are in the second group you can get in touch by responding to our calloutor via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Rishi Sunak, the man in charge of the British government\u2019s purse strings as Chancellor of the Exchequer, has promised to give the NHS \u201cwhatever it needs\u201d to tackle the coronavirus crisis, as he looks at loosening the fiscal rules to allow for more borrowing and spending. Before this week\u2019s budget, Sunak did not say how much in additional resources the NHS would get, but indicated the government was potentially willing to write a blank cheque to help the health service cope with a pandemic. Sunak refused to deny several times that he was looking at getting rid of the fiscal rules from the Conservative election manifesto, which commits him to balancing the books on day-to-day spending midway through this parliament. There is speculation that the coronavirus crisis gives the government a reason to throw out the fiscal rules set just a few months ago by Sunak\u2019s predecessor Sajid Javid. Sunak told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI can say absolutely categorically the NHS will get whatever resources it needs to get us through this and to respond to the health crisis.\u201d Saudia Arabia has announced a temporary lockdown on the Qatif region, the kingdom\u2019s state news agency reports. The mayor of the South Korean city hardest hit by that country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak expressed cautious hope on Sunday that the numbers of new cases may be dropping, after the rate of increase slowed to its lowest in 10 days, Reuters reports. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Sunday 272 new coronavirus cases, for a total of 7,313 in the country. Two further deaths took the toll to 50, it added. The increase in cases was lower than the same period a day before, though health officials have warned that numbers could fluctuate as more tests are processed. In the city of Daegu, which accounts for as much as 75% of all of South Korea\u2019s confirmed cases, mayor Kwon Young-jin told reporters the number of new cases has dropped below 300 for the first time since Feb. 29, Yonhap news agency reported. Police and officials have been waiting at southern Italian transport hubs people who have been travelling south from Lombardy, the region which is due to become subject to a lockdown, according to the Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo. The Corriere della Sera newspaper has footage of officials in Hazmat suits testing people near buses. However, there do not appear to be any checks on people moving by car and the police checks were apparently not in force this morning. The announcement about Serie A football matches and coronavirus was made by the Italian sports minister in a Facebook post in which he said that it did not make sense to put players, referees and fans at risk while the authorities were asking citizens to make \u201chuge sacrifices\u201d to stem the contagion. Until now Italy\u2019s soccer association FIGC has said Serie A matches could be played without spectators, adding that any events would be stopped should any player test positive for the virus. All matches in Italy\u2019s topflight Serie A division should be cancelled until further notice, the Italian Minister of Sport has said minutes before Serie A games were due to resume in empty stadiums. Vincenzo Spadafora said that it made no sense to put at risk the health of players, officials, fans and others. The news filtered through as players from Parma and Spal were already on the pitch in their clash in Parma today. They were invited to return dressing room and the game has been delayed. Five Serie A matches were scheduled for Sunday, beginning with Parma and Spal at 12:30 local time and concluding with Juventus versus Inter Milan at 8:45 p.m. The wife of South Africa\u2019s first novel coronavirus patient tested positive on Sunday becoming the third confirmed case in the country, the health authority said. The AFP news agency reports that all three of South Africa\u2019s confirmed cases were in a group of 10 people who had travelled to Italy. Spain has now confirmed 589 cases of the coronavirus - a rise of 159 from Saturday - along with 13 deaths, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Jones reports from Madrid On Sunday morning, the regional government of the southeastern region of Murcia reported its first case of the illness in a 27-year-old woman who had recently travelled to Madrid. The area in and around the capital has so far logged 175, cases - the highest regional count in the country. Residents in parts of the small town of Haro in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja remain in lockdownafter health authorities ordered them to stay at home following the discovery that 39 people in La Rioja had contracted the virus after attending a funeral in the nearby Basque country a fortnight ago. The regional and central government have deployed police to Haro to make sure that people in affected neighbourhoods observe the isolation protocol. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, sought to play down suggestions that parts of Haro were in quarantine when he provided an update on Sunday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no quarantine in Haro,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat there is is an important number of people under active vigilance in their homes.\u201d Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health alerts and emergencies, said that the situation remained under control, pointing out that 60% of cases of the virus were confined to just three of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions, while 70% were in four. Sim\u00f3n also said that Italy\u2019s drastic lockdown of million of people in the north of the country would help contain the spread of the virus. \u201cSo far, we don\u2019t have uncontrolled transmission chains in the majority of the situations. The only risk areas are the Basque country and Madrid, but investigations to date suggest that transmission isn\u2019t rising or that if it is, it\u2019s related to focal points that have already been detected.\u201d Ikea is reopening nine of its stores in China this weekend after reopening five last week. The furniture company closed all 30 in the country in January due to the coronavirus outbreak. Amid some criticism of the Italian government\u2019s handling of the situation in the north of the country, there is support for its actions from the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Ghebreyesus. He also points out today is the first time that 100 countries around the globe are reporting cases of the new virus. A major political row is breaking out in Italy, where the authorities fear people fleeing from Lombardy, formally locked down by decree but still not subject to a full enforcement, may spread the virus further. The Governor of Puglia, Michele Emiliano, has signed an order today, which obliges all inhabitants of Puglia, arriving from Lombardy in the coming hours, to quarantine. \u2018\u2019Get off at the first train station, don\u2019t take planes to Bari and Brindisi, go back by car, get off the bus at the next stop,\u2019\u2019 wrote Emiliano on Facebook, addressing Apulians, living in Lombardy. \u201cDo not bring the Lombard, Venetian and Emilian epidemic to your Puglia. You are carrying the virus into the lungs of your brothers and sisters, your grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents.\u201d Thousands of people are literally at risk of getting stuck in northern cities. \u2018\u2019My brother went to Brescia to look for work, a month ago,\u2019\u2019 says Primo Giarratano, a 32-year-old Sicilian. \u201cWe lived together. We rented a house in Brescia. I then returned to Sicily because I had finished my job, but he remained there, alone. And now he can\u2019t come back. We don\u2019t know what to do\u201d Like other states, the official travel advice from Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) still does not warn against all travel to Lombardy, the northern region of Italy that has been entirely \u2018locked down\u2019 but we\u2019re told that the guidance to travellers remains under review today. The FCO page currently states: \u201cThe FCO advise against all but essential travel to 10 small towns in Lombardy (Codogno, Castiglione d\u2019Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano) and one in Veneto (Vo\u2019 Euganeo), which have been isolated by the Italian authorities due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).\u201d Authorities have banned activities in Romania involving more than 1,000 people, according to Romanian media reports. The restrictions come into force today and are valid until March 31, when a new assessment will be made. The number of confirmed cases in the country is 13. Raed Arafat, Romania\u2019s secretary of state, reiterated a call to Romanians in Italy not to come home for a holiday period if they are in risk areas. Iran\u2019s health ministry has said that total coronavirus cases have risen to 6,566, while the death toll has reached 194, according to state television. On the other side of the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia\u2019s authorities have recorded four news cases of the coronavirus, taking the total of infections to 11, the kingdom\u2019s health ministry said on Twitter on Sunday. The new four individuals, which include three women, have interacted with another case reported previously who had been in Iran but did not disclose his travel details to the authorities. The individual traveled from Iran via the United Arab Emirates, the ministry said. A student at Oxford University student has tested positive for the new coronavirus, the institution\u2019s vice chancellor has told staff and students in an email. In an email, which someone has kindly passed on to me, Louise Richardson wrote to students and colleagues on Saturday to say that the English national public health agency, Public Health England (PHE), had confirmed the student had tested positive after returning from travel overseas. She added that she was constrained in what she could say but the student was currently self-isolating and did not attend any university or college events after they fell ill. \u201cAs a result, PHE has advised that the risk to other students and to staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue. They have also advised that we do not need to take any additional public health actions in light of this case. \u201cIt is important to bear in mind that PHE does not consider individuals infectious until they develop symptoms. Colleagues have been working with PHE to ensure that anyone who was in contact with the student after they fell ill has been notified and is able to gain access to both information and support. The university had anticipated this eventuality and had been preparing for it for some weeks now, added Richardson. \u201cMoreover, given the rate of infection across the country, there will in all likelihood be other cases. I know this news will be upsetting to some of you. Support will be available through Student Welfare and through Colleges and Departments.\u201d It\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day and participants in events on the streets largely don\u2019t seem to be letting coronavirus get in the way. You can follow our coverage here of a separate liveblog as millions of women around the world march and gather to protest against gender inequality and gender-based violence. In France, activists from the women\u2019s movement FEMEN in Paris, France, appeared to reference the outbreak of coronavirus in their demonstration. Many held placards comparing the virus to gender inequality, with slogans reading \u201cstop the patriarchal virus\u201d and \u201cstop the patriarchal pandemic\u201d, whilst dressed in outfits which resemble hazmat suits. IWD has taken place each year on March 8 since 1977, when the UN General Assembly invited member states to announce the day as the UN Day for women\u2019s rights and world peace. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cI am Generation Equality: Realizing women\u2019s rights\u201d. It is still unclear if flights to and from Lombardy will be banned but the Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo has more detail now on the Italian government decree that has locked down more than a quarter of its population in a bid to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. It will allow people to enter and exit the red zones for serious reasons, bans all public events and closes cinemas, theatres and gyms. Religious ceremonies such as funerals and weddings will be banned. Discos and pubs remain closed throughout the country. Anyone who violates the restriction on entering select provinces of northern Italy faces three months in jail. In all the areas covered by the decree, including towns in the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont, schools will be closed at least until 3 April, as will museums, gyms and swimming pools. Leave is cancelled for all healthcare workers. The decree includes using the armed forces for border control and access points such as train stations and motorway entrances and exits in the region. So far the decree has been signed by the prime minister, but it will not be an official executive order until the council of ministers approves it. Further details on train and air service will be released in the coming hours. Conte signed the decree In the early hours of Sunday, enacting forced quarantine for the region of Lombardy \u2013 home to more than 10 million people and the financial capital, Milan \u2013 and 14 other provinces, totalling around 16 million residents. Thousands of people left Lombardy on Saturday night, before the decree was made official, crowding the motorways and train stations in the region, which will be locked down until 3 April. Indonesia confirmed on Sunday that two more people had tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the total of confirmed cases in the country to six. One of the Indonesians is a 36-year-old male, a crew member on the Japan-docked Diamond Princess cruise ship where he contracted the virus, Health Ministry official Achmad Yurianto told a news briefing, according to Reuters. The other Indonesian, a 55-year-old male, contracted the virus locally in Jakarta, Yurianto said. \u201cBoth of them are in stable condition. They do not have fever, don\u2019t need intravenous drip, oxygen, are not coughing, and don\u2019t have a cold,\u201d he said. Countries responding to a coronavirus outbreak should be prioritising support for their health workers, a World Health Organisation (WHO) doctor has said. Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cThey should be your number one priority. All your health staff, your nursing staff, your allied professionals, the people cleaning the wards. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor myself, but it\u2019s not just the doctors who need special treatment, special consideration. \u201cThey need all the protective equipment, they also need training, they also need access, to know how to do the swab, when to do the swab, where the testing comes from. \u201cAnd they need back-up, they need other people to come and do the shifts. If they\u2019re working massively, they are tremendously at risk.\u201d Flights appear to be operating as normal from Milan\u2019s Linate Airport, the third international airport of the city. Ben Roeves, who is travelling back to the UK today from Italy and cleared security a little earlier at the airport, was able to change his British Airways flight in order to come back to the UK earlier than his scheduled flight later this evening after seeing the news this morning about the lockdown of Lombardy. He told me he had seen more airport staff, security and military than passengers although the numbers on the security front were no more than normal in comparison to other trips. Another reader, a retired teacher, 69, living in Milan with his wife, 68, has got in touch to say that their niece travelled to her family home in Naples yesterday and said that the train was so crowded that people were sitting and lying in the corridors. \u201cPanic in Milan does not seem to be widespread, however. While relatively few people can be seen on the streets, probably due to the fact that cinemas, theatres and museums, doctors\u2019s surgeries, even churches, are all closed, while caf\u00e9s and restaurants have limited opening hours, other signs of general panic (hoarding in supermarkets, etc) seem to have abated, thanks also to well-organised home delivery offered by several food chains, who are not suffering from any shortages.\u201d He was more concerned about the preoccupation with the risk of damage to the economy, rather than fear of the virus, which appears to be really dangerous mainly for elderly people with other health complications. Iran has stopped all flights to Europe, Iran\u2019s IRNA news agency reports. Customers can get refunds on their tickets. Here\u2019s a tweet from Iran\u2019s ISNA news agency announcing the suspension Speaking at a televised press conference on Friday, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s health ministry said the authorities had confirmed 4,747 cases of the virus, a rise of 1,234 on the day before. While he did not elaborate on the threat to use force, the spokesman acknowledged that the virus was present in all of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces. The British government is being urged by a transport union to convene an emergency transport sector summit on tackling the coronavirus outbreak and consider overnight \u201cdeep cleans\u201d of trains. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to call for a co-ordinated response across the public transport network on how the threat posed by the virus is tackled. Cortes said the aim of the summit would be to put in place measures to reassure transport workers and passengers to keep trains, buses, trains and trams running. He said: \u201cWe want to ensure our transport networks are resilient in the face of a possible epidemic and urgently need consistent advice and a proactive plan of action for public transport.\u201d He also asked the Government to look into prevention measures across public transport, including the possibility of cleaning teams conducting overnight deep cleans of train carriages and stations, focusing on frequent touch areas such as handrails and ticket machines. The first confirmed case of someone with coronavirus on the Balearic island of Menorca is a doctor at the Mateu Orfila hospital, according to authorities quoted in local news reports. Across Spain, El Pais reports that at least 523 people have been infected, while two new deaths in Vitoria and Madrid raised the number of deaths to ten on Saturday. In the town of haro, northern Spain, the Civil Guard has been deployed to watch over the home isolation of several infected people after they attended a funeral held two weeks ago in Vitoria. In Italy, a big question mark remains today over flights and trains from Lombardy, the region which has gone into lockdown. The Italian government has formally locked down more than a quarter of the population after prime minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree enacting forced quarantine for the region of Lombardy \u2013 home to more than 10 million people and the financial capital, Milan \u2013 and multiple other provinces, totalling around 16 million residents. Guardian readers have been getting in touch to ask about that and we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on developments in relation to transport. While the decree has been signed by PM but it needs the approval by the Council of ministers and those issues have not been detailed. People last night were tweeting images and video meanwhile of what they said were members of the public rushing to catch trains out of the region. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking after Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, told Sky News that his upcoming budget on May 11 would have new resources, to assist the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS). Sunak didn\u2019t give much away in terms of specific details, adding: \u201cFirst and foremost, supporting public services but also helping vulnerable people and also businesses to get through anything that might be coming our way... we stand ready to give the NHS whatever it needs.\u201d He said that he would say outline measures this week support businesses that may face \u201ccash flow\u201d problems due to the outbreak. A report that the UK faces a potential coronavirus death toll as high as 100,000 is based on \u201cworst case scenarios\u201d rather than forecasts, according to Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon had been asked by Sophie Ridge on Sky News about a Sunday Times report today that UK Ministers are preparing for a potential coronavirus death toll as high as 100,000. The newspaper reports that officials in Whitehall last week began describing a 100,000 figure as the \u201ccentral estimate\u201d of the potential death toll, according to a source involved in the preparations, rather than the previously publicised worst case scenario of 500,000 deaths if 80% of the population were infected. Sturgeon, who will take part tomorrow in another meeting of the British government\u2019s Cobra emergency planning committee, chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said: \u201cThese kinds of figures are broadly in terms of the worst case scenario that we face but they are not forecasts.\u201d The death toll from the collapse of a hotel in China which was being used to quarantine people suspected to have coronavirus has rised to 10, Reuters reports, quoting Chinese state media. Earlier, the Ministry of Emergency Management said that six of 43 victims pulled from the rubble had died, with all but one of the remainder requiring treatment in hospital, and that rescuers were still searching for 28 more people. Chinese state media later revised the death toll to seven. The Xinjia Express Hotel in the city of Quanzhou, Fujian province, collapsed suddenly around 7:30pm on Saturday, with more than 750 medics and rescuers and 20 ambulances responding to the disaster. Grandparents are expected to come under pressure to step in to provide childcare if schools shut as a result of the coronavirus, but this could increase their already heightened risk of contracting the illness. Boris Johnson last week played down the prospect of widespread school closures, saying they should stay open \u201cif possible\u201d. But Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has warned that in the event of a major epidemic, schools may have to shut \u2013 and if they do it will be \u201cfor quite a long period of time, probably more than two months\u201d. Schools are making plans for online lessons in the event of closures, but for working parents the crucial issue will be childcare. Many are likely to ask grandparents to help, which would be risky for older people, for whom the impact of the illness is greater. Justine Roberts, founder and chief executive of the online parents\u2019 forum Mumsnet, said there would be a \u201cmassive knock-on effect, with many parents simply unable to go to work\u201d if schools closed. There just isn\u2019t enough childcare capacity in the system to cope with hundreds of thousands of school-age children, not to mention not enough capacity in parents\u2019 wallets to pay for it. And of course large childcare settings would carry the same risks as schools when it comes to spreading the virus. This is Ben Quinn picking up the live blog from London, from where we will be covering developments in the UK and around the world. As usual you can email me at ben.quinn@guardian.co.uk with any news tips or tweet me at @BenQuinn75 Britain\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, is speaking today about his plans for upcoming budget, which has been overshadowed by planning for the outbreak, while Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister is also on the airwaves later. Elsewhere, a major spotlight continues to fall on Italy, where a lockdown decree is affecting millions of people in Lombardy. A busy few hours. An area containing about 16 million people is now facing lockdown in Italy, after the prime minister, Guiseppe Conte, signed a decree ordering the quarantining of the entire Lombardy region and 14 provinces. Anyone who breaks the lockdown on entering select provinces of northern Italy faces three months in jail. The legislation is expected to be approved later on Sunday, the head of the civil protection agency said earlier, after the number of infections rose by more than 1,200 in the past 24 hours. In all the areas covered by the decree, including towns in the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont, schools will be closed at least until 3 April, all museums, gyms and swimming pools will be also shut and leave is cancelled for all healthcare workers. Organisers of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, said an attendee at its annual Washington-area conference last month has tested positive for coronavirus. The conference was attended by Donald Trump and Mike Pence. A US man in Washington DC in his 50s has tested positive, with no immediately identifiable point of contact with the virus. US authorities are tracking another cruise ship for potential infections. The ship may have shared crew with the Grand Princess. Asked about the development later on Saturday, Trump told reporters in Florida he was not concerned and planned to continue to hold political rallies. All experts in Australia, from the chief medical officer and the prime minister down, have reassured people that panic buying is not necessary and they are at no risk of running out of essential supplies such as toilet paper. North Korea has reportedly released more than 3,600 people who were quarantined over coronavirus. At least seven people have died in the collapse of the Xinjia Express Hotel, which was being used as a quarantine centre in eastern China. The number of people who have died from the coronavirus in the United States has climbed to 19, with about 400 confirmed cases. Colombia, the Holy See, Peru, Serbia, Togo and Bulgaria have reported their first cases of Covid-19. A Middle East markets update via the AP: Stock markets in the Mideast suffered sharp drops in early trading Sunday over fears about the new coronavirus and falling demand for crude oil amid a failure by Opec and allied nations to cut production. The Dubai Financial Market saw stocks drop by over 8% in a steep selloff. Boursa Kuwait stopped trading as shares fell below 7%. The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange dropped by 6%. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul stock exchange fell more than 6% as the market opened. Opec and key ally Russia failed to agree on a cut to oil production on Friday. That saw crude oil prices, the bedrock commodity of the Mideast, drop. Benchmark Brent crude sold on Sunday for around $45 a barrel, down some 11% from the year prior. The demand for oil has dropped as air travel has been affected by the outbreak of the virus. Professor Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong, has been advising authorities on control measures in the city. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, Yuen said the worry for mainland China and Hong Kong was reverse-imported cases, even as the situation there improved as they moved towards Summer. \u201cWe think the epidemic will probably not come to an end,\u201d Yuen said. \u201cThere will be what we call reversed imported cases. In the beginning other countries feared us, now we fear them [for bringing in the virus].\u201d Yuen urged Hong Kongers to avoid travelling for the rest of the year at least, and to continue to practise good hygiene. \u201cIf everyone washes his or her hand, wears a mask all the time and maintains social distancing, the risk of infection will be lowered. It\u2019s a matter of compliance,\u201d Yuen said. \u201cWe cannot guard against the virus forever, but the longer we delay its spread, the higher the chances of getting a vaccine in time.\u201d Protesters are gathering in a Hong Kong suburb, demonstrating against the setting up of a treatment facility for Covid-19 cases, according to Hong Kong Free Press. There is a live stream of the rally, where riot police have just ordered people to disperse, here. From Reuters: The Maldives has curbed movement on several resort islands, authorities said on Sunday, after the country reported its first two cases of coronavirus. The two infected people, who are both staff at the Kuredu Island Resort, tested positive late on Saturday. They are believed to have caught the disease from an Italian tourist who has returned to Italy and tested positive there. There are more than 1,400 people on the island, split equally between guests and staff, according to the tourism ministry. \u201cThese two cases which tested positive are from a resort. They are employees of the resort and are now quarantined,\u201d said Ali Waheed, the tourism minister of the island nation, the economy of which is heavily dependent on foreign tourists. \u201cThe period for the temporary restrictions will be decided by the medical teams. Right now, we have identified people who were in contact with the patients and they are in self-isolation along with secondary contacts. At this time we can say that these individuals will be monitored for 14 days.\u201d Waheed said the country was still deciding whether tourists who were not in contact with the patients would be allowed to leave. It has banned passengers originating from or who had transited through or spent any time in Italy in the preceding 14 days, effective from Sunday. Australia\u2019s federal minister for industry, science and technology, Karen Andrews, has just given an update on efforts by Australian scientists to create a vaccine. The country was the first outside of China to be able to replicate the virus, Andrews said. \u201cWe are now working as hard and fast as we can to develop a vaccine that\u2019s currently undergoing testing at our specialised laboratories in Victoria.\u201d She said they\u2019d fast track it as much as possible, but they need to make sure the vaccine is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Other nations, such as the US, are also working on vaccines. She also urges Australians to stop panic-buying items, especially toilet paper. \u201cYou do not need to go out and buy toilet paper,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are adequate stocks and adequate manufacturing capacity in Australia. That is not going to be an issue.\u201d Andrews said there were concerns for industry, including logistics in getting (other) products in from China, and government departments were working to minimise impacts. \u201cMany of our food manufacturers have an inventory of four weeks plus, and have increased the level of their manufacturing over the last week in particular.\u201d Reuters is reporting six people are now confirmed to have died in the collapse of the Xinjia Express Hotel, which was being used as a quarantine centre. The Ministry of Emergency Management said 43 people had been retrieved from the rubble. It said six people had died, 36 were taken to hospital, and one required no treatment. Authorities were still searching for 28 people, the ministry said, giving a figure higher than the earlier reported figure of 19 missing. According to state media outlet Xinhua, the owner of the building had been summoned by police. Some keen eyes have noticed discrepancies in the advice on the World Health Organization website about how not to treat Covid-19. Tens of millions of students are stuck at home because their schools have been closed due to the virus spread. Many of them are doing online lessons run by their schools, and on this unprecedented mass scale there are a huge variety of new technologies and apps being used. And according to this report, students in Wuhan have found a way to exploit one. A 12th diagnosis has been confirmed in the Australian state of Victoria, in a woman from Indonesia aged in her 50s, health authorities have said. She flew from Jakarta to Perth on 27 February, feeling well, and began developing symptoms two days later. On 2 March the woman flew to Melbourne on Virgin Australia flight VA682, and saw a GP on 6 March. The GP ordered Covid-19 tests, which confirmed her as positive on Saturday. The woman is well, and is in self-isolation being cared for by family. She had also visited a Vietnamese restaurant in Melbourne. These are the areas covered by the Italian lockdown. The gates at Milan\u2019s main train station were closed ahead of the order to lock down Lombardy and 11 northern provinces, including the cities of Milan and Venice, in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus. North Korea has reportedly released more than 3,600 people who were quarantined over coronavirus, according to reports. More on this from AFP: Pyongyang has imposed strict restrictions and closed its borders to try to prevent an outbreak and insists it has not had a single case of Covid-19. About 3,650 people quarantined in Kangwon and Chagang provinces were released as of Thursday, North Korea\u2019s state radio reported, according to Yonhap news agency. It follows the official KCNA news agency stating on Friday that 221 out of 380 foreigners who were under \u201cstrict medical monitoring\u201d had been discharged from isolation. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, warned last month of \u201cserious consequences\u201d if the virus reaches his country, which has banned tourists and suspended international trains and flights. Pyongyang, subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, has a weak medical infrastructure and analysts say prevention is its only option. Kim sent a personal letter to the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, on Thursday to \u201ccomfort\u201d South Koreans fighting the coronavirus outbreak raging in the country. South Korea \u2013 which reported 93 new cases on Sunday \u2013 has the largest number of cases in the world outside China, with 7,134. Two more people died, bringing the death toll to 50, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New toilet paper limit in Australia due to panic buying Coles supermarket in Australia has introduced a new limit for toilet paper in response to widespread panic buying, which resulted in a number of scuffles in supermarket toilet paper aisles and two women being charged for fighting over roles. Last week the supermarket chain introduced a four packs per customer limit. As of Sunday, that limit has been lowered to one pack. In a statement, Coles said: We have asked our suppliers to focus on increasing production of larger pack sizes and we are prioritising the delivery of these packs to our stores, as a pack of 30 rolls should last an average family for around three weeks. The AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone, referred to the toilet paper wars in comments he made in Melbourne a short time ago about misinformation and inconsistent messaging causing panic around coronavirus: We have had situations around considerable amount of panic this week. Unexplained panic, hysteria bordering at times. We cannot have a situation where people are fighting in supermarket aisles for toilet paper and then at the same time look at the inconsistencies in messaging. We need to reassure the public and the community as a whole that the coronavirus is a virus with mild symptoms, largely. It is for small proportion of the population that is going to be a risk of any further complications. Meanwhile in Melbourne, the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, is addressing reporters in support of a Melbourne doctor who saw 70 patients in the week before he tested positive for Covid-19. The doctor had what he described as a mild cold when he returned from the US to Australia last Saturday and was still getting over that when he returned to work on Monday. He tested himself on Thursday, despite there being no requirement for people returning from the US to isolate themselves or test for coronavirus, and tested positive. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, had said she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d that a doctor would work with flu-like symptoms, given the global coronavirus outbreak, and suggested the medical regulator should review the doctor\u2019s actions. Dozens of doctors have since called for her to resign. Bartone said the doctor acted \u201cwithin good faith and informed clinical judgment to ensure he did not expose or did not cause any undue risk to the patients he was treating\u201d. So we have a doctor acting completely within the guidelines at the time. We have a doctor who made a decision in a good faith about the needs of his patients and we have a doctor here who acted within the available information at the time. It is clearly very unfortunate and disappointing that the minister saw fit to make the comments she made yesterday. He said the minister should apologise, and that the advice to Australian doctors was \u201cinconsistent\u201d. It is not yet clear what the Italian lockdown will mean for the Formula One season, which is due to open with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne next weekend. Organisers of the Australian event have been adamant that the race would go ahead despite travel concerns around the Ferrari team, which is headquartered in Maranello, about 18km outside Moderna, within the area covered by the lockdown. Reuters has some more details: The Italian government will adopt tough measures to try to contain the spread of coronavirus, including telling people not to enter or leave the hardest-hit region of Lombardy, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. So far only a few limited areas of northern Italy, known as \u201cred zones\u201d, have been quarantined, but in a dramatic escalation the draft tells people not to enter or leave Lombardy or 11 provinces in other regions. The legislation is expected to be approved later on Saturday, the head of the civil protection agency said earlier, after the number of infections rose by more than 1,200 in the past 24 hours. In all the areas covered by the decree, including towns in the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont, schools will be closed at least until 3 April, all museums, gyms and swimming pools will be also shut and leave is cancelled for all healthcare workers. The lockdown confirmed by the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, applies to Lombardy, the capital of which is Milan, as well as areas around Venice, Parma, Moderna and other major northern cities and alpine ski resorts. Anyone who breaks the lockdown on entering select provinces of northern Italy faces three months in jail. There are reports the lockdown includes all public activities, including weddings and funerals. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced early on Sunday that the entire region of Lombardy and a number of provinces in other regions were put into lockdown as the coronavirus continued to spread throughout the country. Earlier reporting said the decree would ban all public events, closing cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs. The new measures will apply to more than a quarter of the Italian population \u2013 about 16m people \u2013 and will be in force at least until 3 April. The region of Lombardy is home to more than 10m people. Italy has confirmed 5,883 cases, with more than 1,200 reported in a single 24 hours. The spread shows no sign of slowing. The northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto are the hardest hit, representing 85% of cases and 92% of recorded deaths. On Chinese social media the hashtag #when will Hubei be unblocked has been read more than 100m times. From AFP: For days now, several cities at the heart of China\u2019s deadly coronavirus epidemic have not recorded any new infections, so residents such as factory worker Tang Wushan have a message for the authorities: it\u2019s time to lift their quarantine. Tang lives in central Hubei province, whose nearly 60m residents have been under lockdown since late January as the government rushed to put a lid on a virus that first emerged in the regional capital, Wuhan. He has not stepped out of his home in rural Xiangyang for more than 40 days. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long,\u201d the 30-year-old said, adding that he felt like he was \u201cgoing to have a breakdown\u201d. On Sunday there were no new cases in the province for a third consecutive day except in Wuhan, which recorded 41 fresh infections. It is the first time that has happened since daily figures were released in January. There have been no new cases in Xiangyang for 12 consecutive days. Xianning city and Shennongjia forest district have not had new confirmed patients for 15 straight days. \u201cThere are some areas with no virus cases since the start of the outbreak. I think these areas could gradually reopen,\u201d Tang said. At least two people have been killed in the hotel collapse in eastern China overnight. The building was being used as a quarantine facility for people infected with Covid-19. AFP earlier provided further details. (It appears the two dead are in addition to the 48 rescued, and there are still 19 unaccounted for.) Rescuers are still searching for 19 people who remain trapped in rubble, state media reported. A total of 48 people have been rescued out of the 67 initially trapped when the building first crumbled, state broadcaster CCTV said Sunday. Footage circulating on Twitter-like Weibo showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city in the dark as they reassured a woman trapped under heavy debris and carried wounded victims into ambulances. Other footage published by local media, purportedly from security cameras across the street, showed the entire hotel collapsing in seconds. The hotel\u2019s facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground, exposing the building\u2019s steel frame, and a crowd gathered as the evening wore on. China\u2019s ministry of emergency management said about 200 local and 800 Fujian province firefighters had been deployed, with 11 search and rescue teams and seven rescue dogs, according to Xinhua. Quanzhou authorities said ambulances, excavators and cranes had also been rushed to the site. Representatives from Beijing are also en route to Quanzhou, Xinhua reported. In the US, via Reuters: a man in his 50s has tested positive, with no immediately identifiable point of contact with the virus. A person in Washington, DC, has had a \u201cpresumptive positive test\u201d for the coronavirus, mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter on Saturday. In a news conference later on Saturday, Bowser said the affected person is a male in his 50s who is a resident of the district. He began exhibiting conditions in late February although he appears to have no record of international travel or close contact with persons known to have the virus, Bowser said. He remains in hospital. \u201cWith his test yielding a presumptive positive, DC health has begun investigating in keeping with the CDC\u2019s guidelines,\u201d Bowser said. The DC government is also aware of another unnamed person who recently visited DC and was diagnosed with the virus at a Maryland hospital. That case is also being investigated by health professionals to understand the person\u2019s exposure to other residents. \u201cOur message to DC residents continues to be: help us prevent the spread of germs and stay informed,\u201d she said. Also in DC, a marine at Virginia\u2019s Fort Belvoir became the first military case of coronavirus reported inside the US. The marine was being treated at Fort Belvoir community hospital, south of Washington, and had recently returned from an overseas assignment, a Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said on Twitter. A man who tested positive for Covid-19 in Tasmania, Australia, ignored an instruction to self-isolate after being tested at the Royal Hobart hospital on Friday, local media is reporting. Instead he went to public places and worked his Saturday shift at the Hotel Grand Chancellor. The man, aged in his 20, arrived in Hobart on 26 February after travelling from Nepal and Singapore and returned a positive test to the virus on Saturday. Authorities are working to determine if any of his colleagues need to self-isolate. In the US, via Reuters: Organisers of the conservative political action conference, or CPAC, said an attendee at its annual Washington-area conference last month has tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cA New Jersey hospital tested the person, and CDC confirmed the positive result,\u201d said a statement by the American Conservative Union, the host of the event. The conference was attended by numerous high-profile conservative political figures, including the US president, Donald Trump, and vice president Mike Pence. The organiser said the affected person had \u201cno interaction\u201d with Trump or Pence and did not attend events in the conference\u2019s main hall. The conference took place on 26-29 February in Fort Washington, Maryland, just outside the District of Columbia. Asked about the development later on Saturday, Trump told reporters in Florida he was not concerned and planned to continue to hold political rallies. AFP reports Bulgaria has confirmed its first cases of the virus: a 27-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman. Neither had travelled recently or been in contact with anyone who had returned from a country with a coronavirus outbreak, Bulgaria\u2019s chief state health inspector, Angel Kunchev, said. \u201cSamples from two patients \u2013 a man from the northern town of Pleven and a woman from the central town of Gabrovo \u2013 tested positive,\u201d the director of the national centre of infectious and parasitic diseases, Todor Kantardzhiev, said. Both were tested as a preventive measure after being hospitalised several days ago with severe respiratory problems. Their condition has improved and both will undergo further tests overnight to verify the result. Authorities said they had already tracked down and started testing anyone who had been in contact with the pair \u2013 about 40 people in total \u2013 to identify a possible \u201cpatient zero\u201d. US authorities are tracking another cruise ship for potential infections, according to vice-president Mike Pence, who is leading the US\u2019s response. The ship that may have shared crew members with a ship carrying people who tested positive for Covid-19, Pence said on Saturday. \u201cWe are tracking at this point a ship that may have shared crew with the Diamond Princess or the Grand Princess and we\u2019ve taken decisive action to hold until we do a full medical assessment of the crew on that ship,\u201d Pence said after a meeting with cruise line industry officials. He did not identify the ship being tracked. A 64-year-old man died in Argentina as a result of the new coronavirus, the first such death in Latin America, health authorities announced on Saturday. South Korea reported 93 new cases of the virus on late Saturday, bringing the total to 7,134. It is the largest outbreak outside of mainland China. Edit: This post was updated to clarify the 93 new cases were in addition to cases earlier reported for Saturday. The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, has just addressed the media in Frankston, a suburb of Melbourne. He said the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia had risen to 74, including two members of the Australian defence force. He also commented on the death of an 82-year-old man in Sydney, one of the residents of the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, and the third person to die after testing positive to Covid-19 in Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s just a great loss to him, his family, to all of the community, which will feel this loss,\u201d he said. Hunt urged people to be \u201ctheir best selves\u201d in what seems to be an oblique reference to the toilet paper wars. \u201cOnly two months ago, as a nation, we faced the great challenge of the bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we rose. We were our best selves, and this is the time to be our best selves and to let our better angels prevail. \u201cAnd our job, working with the states and territory, but working with the community, is to make sure that we are not just prepared, but that we are unified. \u201cAnd so there have been some things which have occurred in recent days which have not been our best selves. But it was only two months ago, as I say, that as a country, the spirit of the volunteer, the spirit of the CFA and the RFS and our emergency service.\u201d Hunt returned to this point a lot, comparing the spirit required in response to the global coronavirus outbreak to that seen in response to the Australian bushfires. (You will recall the Australian government was heavily criticised for its management of that crisis.) He also announced that the Australian government had secured an additional 54m face masks for its national reserve and said that no primary health network in Australia had exhausted its first round of masks. So that means that, contrary to reports from GPs that they are struggling to get the appropriate personal protective equipment. Hunt said there may have been some miscommunications which meant that busy medical practices \u201cmay not have realised that they\u2019ve had that\u201d. Hunt was asked to comment on a spat unfolding in Victoria between the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, and GPs, who were incensed at her comments that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d a GP who was later diagnosed with Covid-19 had gone to work with cold- and/or flu-like symptoms. Hunt drew on the bushfire analogy again: \u201cOver summer our firefighters and our emergency service workers were our heroes. In the coming months it will be our health and medical service workers who will be our national heroes. So we need to support them equally.\u201d Still in Australia, authorities are asking people who travelled on two flights between Canberra and Sydney on 28 February and sat in particular rows to self-isolate and call the public health line on 1300 066 055. Flight one: 6.45am QF1509 Sydney to Canberra, rows 2-6 Flight two: 2.35pm VA651 Canberra to Sydney, rows 3-7 \u201cAnyone else travelling on these flights in other rows are not considered to be close contacts and should monitor their health until 13 March and to contact their GP for assessment and testing if they develop any symptoms.\u201d On Sunday health authorities in mainland China reported 44 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and 27 deaths (all in the Hubei province). The previous day had seen 99 new cases and 28 deaths. China has now reported 80,695 confirmed cases, and 3,097 deaths since the start of the outbreak. A 38-year-old woman who recently travelled from London to Queensland via Dubai has been diagnosed with Covid-19. Health authorities in Gympie say the woman has been transferred to an isolation unit at a hospital. While other passengers are at low risk, authorities are tracing people who were on board her flight and sitting in the two rows in front and behind her, on Qantas flight QF2 departing on 29 February from London to Singapore, then QF52 from Singapore arriving in Brisbane on 2 March. They are also doing the same for passengers on the flight of another man since diagnosed, Thai Airways flight from Thailand to Brisbane TG473 on 26 February. The University of Oxford has revealed its first case of a student testing positive for Covid-19. Louise Richardson, Oxford\u2019s vice chancellor, announced to staff on Saturday evening (UK time) that a student has tested positive for the virus but ruled out closing any university facilities or accommodation. \u201cI am writing to let you know that Public Health England has confirmed that one of our students has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) after returning from travel overseas,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI am constrained in what I can say at the moment but I am glad to report that the student self-isolated as soon as they developed symptoms and did not attend any university or college events after they fell ill. As a result, PHE has advised that the risk to other students and staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue.\u201d Richardson said PHE advised the university not to take \u201cany additional public health actions\u201d as a result of the student\u2019s positive test. Last week Richardson warned that \u201cmany of our Chinese and other Asian students and staff have felt isolated or even suspect, especially when wearing face masks\u201d in Oxford. \u201cThis is a time for us to come together as a community and to support not shun one another,\u201d she said. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the blog for the next few hours. Thanks to Calla for bringing us all the earlier updates. Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking reports, says there have been 105,939 confirmed cases across 95 countries, with 3,559 deaths. More than 58,300 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation\u2019s dashboard has some slightly different numbers:103,168 cases of Covid-19 and 3,507 deaths. Italian authorities have announced they will lock down the whole region of Lombardy in their latest bid to stop the spread of Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of the virus. The northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto are the hardest hit, representing 85% of cases and 92% of recorded deaths. So far 5,883 people have been infected in the country and 233 have died. The number of cases jumped by more than 1,200 in 24 hours at the weekend. Australia\u2019s death toll has risen to three, with more than 70 confirmed cases of Covid-19. Five new countries \u2013 Colombia, the Holy See, Peru, Serbia, and Togo \u2013 have reported their first cases. Late last night a hotel in south-eastern China used as a quarantine centre for holding people who have arrived from coronavirus-hit regions collapsed, trapping dozens, according to the local government. The number of people who have died in the US has climbed to 19, with about 400 confirmed cases. There are fears for thousands of people on a cruise ship held off San Francisco where 21 people have been diagnosed with the illness. Police in New South Wales have charged two women over an altercation at a supermarket at Chullora in Sydney yesterday. The women allegedly fought over some of the supermarket\u2019s dwindling supplies of toilet paper. Toilet paper has been selling out across Australia in a wave of panic buying over coronavirus. Stocks of dried pasta, hand soap, and over-the-counter painkillers are also rapidly selling out. Here\u2019s the NSW police statement: Just after 7am (Saturday 7 March 2020), police were called to a Chullora supermarket following reports of an altercation in an aisle over toilet paper. Staff intervened, separating the women and police were notified. Officers from Bankstown police station attended and spoke to a 49-year-old woman, who had allegedly been assaulted. She was uninjured. About 8pm, two women attended Bankstown police station and spoke with investigators. Today (Sunday 8 March 20120), two Bankstown women, aged 23 and 60, were issued court attendance notices for affray. Both are due to appear at Bankstown local court on Tuesday 28 April 2020. All experts in Australia, from the chief medical officer and the prime minister down, have reassured people that panic buying is not necessary and they are at no risk of running out of essential supplies. If required to self-isolate for 14 days, the Red Cross and other organisations can deliver essential supplies to the homes of people who may not have two weeks worth of food and toilet paper on hand. We are only just starting to see the scale of the economic effect that the coronavirus will have on the tourism industry. Aaron Smith filed this report on what is happening on the ground in Cairns, a Queensland town that relies heavily on international tourism, particularly Chinese tourists. One travel agent told him: Without a doubt everyone is feeling the pinch of the coronavirus, 100%. I don\u2019t have any figures but just from conversations with people they are all suffering, a lot of suppliers are having problems. You just have to look at the number of specials businesses are offering at the moment. That tells you straightaway numbers are down and that people are struggling ... A lot of the hotels here are doing it tough. I know of one large hotel that is running at under 10% occupancy. This is normally a quiet time of year, but it\u2019s not normally this quiet. You can read Aaron\u2019s full story here. A not surprising phenomenon: A vaccine for Covid-19 is, at the most hopeful estimates, about 18 months away from being available for public use. But you can get a flu vaccine and you should. It could prevent you from having the double whammy of influenza and coronavirus at the same time, and will also help relieve pressure on the health system. There is not a lot of detail around about the second confirmed case of Covid-19 in Tasmania. Tasmanian public health authorities confirmed the case on Saturday, and said the patient had been admitted to the Royal Hobart hospital. The first case, a man who travelled to Launceston from Iran, was reported on Monday, and about 50 suspected contacts of his have been tested for the virus. Here\u2019s the full update: AAP reports that the man who died was a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home in Macquarie Park who tested positive after an outbreak at that centre was discovered last week. That makes him the second resident from that home to die after testing positive to coronavirus. A 95-year-old woman who resided in the same part of the home also died. Here is the report from AAP: A NSW man in his 80s has died after contracting coronavirus in his Sydney aged care home, taking the nationwide death toll to three. On Wednesday the 82-year-old was confirmed to have Covid-19 after he picked up the virus from an infected aged care worker in her 50s at Baptist Care\u2019s Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park. He died overnight in hospital, the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said. The man\u2019s death follows that of a 95-year-old woman and fellow Dorothy Henderson Lodge resident and a 78-year-old man in Perth. As of Friday, four residents and three staff members at the aged care home had tested positive for the virus. In a statement on Saturday night, BaptistCare, which runs Dorothy Henderson Lodge, said: There are currently no new cases of Covid-19 at Dorothy Henderson Lodge. Daily reviews of infection control procedures continue to be in place. The residents and staff members currently hospitalised with Covid-19 are reported as being in a stable condition. NSW Health confirmed one more case associated with \u2013 but not in \u2013 the lodge outbreak on Sunday morning. That is a female health care worker at Ryde hospital in her 30s, who \u201cis a contact of a previously confirmed case from an aged care facility\u201d. Health authorities in New South Wales have confirmed that a man in his 80s has died in hospital after testing positive to coronavirus. It is the third death of a person with the virus in Australia, and occurred as the number of people who have tested positive to Covid-19 in Australia grows to more than 70. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, passed on her sympathies to the man\u2019s family. This is how the situation stands on Sunday morning: New South Wales has announced two new confirmed cases of coronavirus. They are a female health worker in her 30s, who appears to have caught the virus as a result of the outbreak at the Dorothy Henderson aged care home in north west Sydney; and a woman in her 50s who is a contact of a previously confirmed case. A man in his 80s in hospital in NSW has become the third confirmed death of a person who has tested positive to Covid-19. Tasmania has reported its second confirmed case, reporting that the patient has been admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital. A Melbourne GP who treated 70 patients before testing positive to Covid-19 has demanded an apology from the Victorian health minister, who said his decision to work with \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and should be investigated by the regulator. The number of people who have died from the coronavirus in the United States has climbed to 19, with about 400 confirmed cases. Five new countries \u2014 Colombia, the Holy See, Peru, Serbia, and Togo \u2014 have reported cases of COVID-19. The number of cases globally, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures, is 101,927.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThat\u201d European Tour has delivered once again. A week after Paul Azinger caused an international incident with snippy comments about the ability or otherwise of Europe\u2019s best players to prevail in the United States, Tyrrell Hatton offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/06/tiger-woods-masters-defence-doubt-players-championship-withdrawal\" title=\"\">the perfect response</a>. On yet another gruelling afternoon at Bay Hill, Hatton claimed the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the biggest cheque \u2013 just short of $1.7m (\u00a31.3m) \u2013 of his career. This marked the fifth win in succession of this tournament by a non-American; three of whom are European. A penny for Azinger\u2019s thoughts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/05/ian-poulter-europe-zinger-paul-azinger-european-tour-golf\">Ian Poulter and Europe speak as one after zinger from Paul Azinger | Ewan Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nobody can claim Hatton did this the easy way. The Englishman triumphed by a shot, at four under par, after what developed into a battle with Marc Leishman. \u201cTyrrell never gave up,\u201d said Leishman. \u201cHe did what he needed to do there.\u201d</p> <p>Hatton had wobbled with a double bogey at the 11th, where shades of his old, petulant nature were visible. He found water off the tee and duffed a chip which did not make it to the green but steadied himself sufficiently to reel off seven pars from there. Hatton was bold when it counted; his tee shot into the tricky par-three 17th was wonderfully nerveless. Leishman, 73 against Hatton\u2019s 74, could not do enough.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible feeling to win at such an iconic venue,\u201d said Hatton, who was playing in only his second tournament since wrist surgery. \u201cI grew up watching this event on TV; to be sitting here with the trophy is amazing.\u201d Hatton duly described his caddie, Scotsman Michael Donaghy, as a \u201cnational treasure\u201d.</p> <p>Sungjae Im, who was a constant threat to Hatton, finished third at two under. Bryson DeChambeau, at minus one, completed the quartet that broke par. Keith Mitchell, Joel Dahmen and Danny Lee earned Open Championship spots courtesy of top-10 finishes.</p> <p>As Rory McIlroy birdied the 4th, thereby tying the lead, he appeared set for a meaningful tilt at the trophy he won in 2018. Instead, and strangely, he hit reverse gear from there. He bogeyed the 5th, hardly a disaster, but took seven at the par-five 6th. An opening nine of 40 \u2013 McIlroy whacked his tee shot out of bounds at the 9th \u2013 meant he required snookers to win. McIlroy remains a model of consistency and will shortly reach 100 weeks combined as the world No1 but falling short, naturally, will sting. His 76 left him four short of Hatton in a share of fifth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing what I expect myself to do every week, which is giving myself a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cI give myself a chance most weeks and more weeks than not it\u2019s not going to happen. That\u2019s just the way golf is.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThat\u201d European Tour has delivered once again. A week after Paul Azinger caused an international incident with snippy comments about the ability or otherwise of Europe\u2019s best players to prevail in the United States, Tyrrell Hatton offered the perfect response. On yet another gruelling afternoon at Bay Hill, Hatton claimed the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the biggest cheque \u2013 just short of $1.7m (\u00a31.3m) \u2013 of his career. This marked the fifth win in succession of this tournament by a non-American; three of whom are European. A penny for Azinger\u2019s thoughts. Nobody can claim Hatton did this the easy way. The Englishman triumphed by a shot, at four under par, after what developed into a battle with Marc Leishman. \u201cTyrrell never gave up,\u201d said Leishman. \u201cHe did what he needed to do there.\u201d Hatton had wobbled with a double bogey at the 11th, where shades of his old, petulant nature were visible. He found water off the tee and duffed a chip which did not make it to the green but steadied himself sufficiently to reel off seven pars from there. Hatton was bold when it counted; his tee shot into the tricky par-three 17th was wonderfully nerveless. Leishman, 73 against Hatton\u2019s 74, could not do enough. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible feeling to win at such an iconic venue,\u201d said Hatton, who was playing in only his second tournament since wrist surgery. \u201cI grew up watching this event on TV; to be sitting here with the trophy is amazing.\u201d Hatton duly described his caddie, Scotsman Michael Donaghy, as a \u201cnational treasure\u201d. Sungjae Im, who was a constant threat to Hatton, finished third at two under. Bryson DeChambeau, at minus one, completed the quartet that broke par. Keith Mitchell, Joel Dahmen and Danny Lee earned Open Championship spots courtesy of top-10 finishes. As Rory McIlroy birdied the 4th, thereby tying the lead, he appeared set for a meaningful tilt at the trophy he won in 2018. Instead, and strangely, he hit reverse gear from there. He bogeyed the 5th, hardly a disaster, but took seven at the par-five 6th. An opening nine of 40 \u2013 McIlroy whacked his tee shot out of bounds at the 9th \u2013 meant he required snookers to win. McIlroy remains a model of consistency and will shortly reach 100 weeks combined as the world No1 but falling short, naturally, will sting. His 76 left him four short of Hatton in a share of fifth. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I expect myself to do every week, which is giving myself a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cI give myself a chance most weeks and more weeks than not it\u2019s not going to happen. That\u2019s just the way golf is. I think my win percentage on tour is like 10% and that\u2019s pretty high for anyone not being Tiger Woods. \u201cI\u2019ve had chances and I wish I had converted one of them over the last few weeks but I\u2019m still in good form. I\u2019m playing some good golf. And hopefully, if I just keep putting myself in those positions, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d Matt Fitzpatrick, playing early, had an outside chance of taking the title when five under par for his round and one under in total by the 17th tee. A very costly double bogey followed for the Yorkshireman. His 69 meant a share of ninth and he can be counted among those who approve of the Bay Hill set-up. \u201cI would so much rather play it like this every week, where it\u2019s a battle and you\u2019ve got to go work hard and grind instead of wide open fairways,\u201d he said. Brooks Koepka\u2019s sentiment was more profound. The four-times major winner, short of form in 2020, signed off with a 71, 10 strokes fewer than on Saturday. So how would Koepka describe his golf? \u201cStill shit,\u201d he replied.",

 <h2 class=\"quiz__correct-answers-title\">Solutions</h2>\n    <p class=\"quiz__correct-answers\">1:D - On multi-lane roads where the speed limit is 80km/h or more, you can only drive in the right-hand lane under certain circumstances, including these. Failing to do so attracts two demerit points and a $50 fine., 2:C - Cyclists are vulnerable road users. If you\u2019re driving faster than 60km/h, you must increase your passing distance to 1.5 metres. Motorists should only overtake cyclists when there\u2019s a clear view of the road ahead and enough space to pass., 3:D - You must give way to pedestrians at most intersections. There are some exceptions, including roundabouts or when a pedestrian is crossing directly in front of the driver and there are no road markings or traffic controls requiring the driver to give way. Pedestrians have a responsibility to be safe, too - there\u2019s a $50 fine for crossing on a red pedestrian light at an intersection., 4:A - It\u2019s almost always against the rules to cross a continuous (unbroken) white line, unless you\u2019re turning right or making a U-turn. You can also cross the line to pass a cyclist or avoid an obstruction, as long as it\u2019s safe to do so., 5:C - Even if an emergency vehicle is using its lights and alarm, breaking the road rules is still against the law., 6:D - When you\u2019re using a roundabout, it\u2019s important to let other drivers know what you\u2019re doing. Use your indicator, enter when it\u2019s safe to do so, know when to give way and only exit from the right lane., 7:C - Tailgating is dangerous in any conditions. You should travel at least two seconds behind the car in front. To figure it out, watch them pass a landmark such as a tree or sign, then count how long it takes you to reach the same landmark. If it\u2019s less than two seconds, you\u2019re too close. If the weather or road conditions are poor, leave even more room., 8:B - Just stopping isn\u2019t enough \u2013 you must park legally and turn off your engine before holding your phone. You can use your phone to receive a call or hang up if it\u2019s in a mounting affixed to the vehicle, or if you don\u2019t have to touch the phone, for example if you\u2019re using voice activation, a hands-free car kit or headset. It\u2019s illegal to create, send or look at text messages, video messages or emails, even if the phone is in a secure mounting., 9:B - Gradually slowing down is the safest way to pass an emergency services vehicle and keep first-response personnel safe.

But for Indigenous homeowners, the impacts reach far beyond this, as Kylie and Naomi have discovered.</p> <h2><strong>Home ownership builds stronger financial literacy</strong></h2> <p>Before Kylie moved into her own home, she was missing a place of belonging. She and her partner wanted a place to call their own, but coming from a place of hardship meant their financial history wasn\u2019t a good fit for a mainstream bank.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a clean past,\u201d Kylie says. \u201cI had outstanding debts. Putting it all down on paper, we had a lot of hard work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Kylie was able to secure financing through <a href=\"https://www.iba.gov.au/homes/iba-housing-loans/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indigenous Business Australia (IBA)</a>. After she was first rejected, IBA helped Kylie understand how to bolster her application and get it over the line.</p> <p>\u201cIt was around budgeting, financing, a lot of things that were really foreign,\u201d Kylie says. \u201cIt was structured and about IBA walking with us every step of the way: this is what you need to do first, this is what you need to have in the bank. All that stuff we didn\u2019t understand. At first it seemed really daunting, but IBA just pushed through.\u201d</p> <p>For Kylie, this restored hope for a life she never thought she would have. \u201cI felt like somebody believed in me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt made me feel like achieving this dream is really within reach.\u201d</p> <p>As well as having a place to call her own, Kylie has gained financial literacy skills that will help her stay ahead for the rest of her life. She says IBA helped her learn a \u201cnew language\u201d to better manage her money.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been an educational process as well,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know what it is to be saving. I\u2019ve started looking at what my super projection is, how I can have a really nice retirement fund. We\u2019re doing renos, and we\u2019re going to redo our financing on the house. We\u2019re doing all these things that make everything worthwhile.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Now my kids will go on to get an education and know they have a place.\"</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The impact of home ownership flows into Kylie\u2019s work. She\u2019s a community development manager, working with rough sleepers and people who are marginalised. She says having her own home gives her a place to recharge, so she can be great at what she does, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/indigenous-business-australia-building-communities/2019/dec/20/new-research-shows-funding-indigenous-australians-home-ownership-benefits-us-all\">that helps everyone</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt gives me this intense level of gratitude,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving a place means that I turn up to work every day. It means I\u2019ve been employed. I\u2019m valued in my field of work. I work alongside my community, and I get to go home and turn off and realise how lucky I am, because that was my story not too long ago.\u201d</p> <p>But for Kylie, the happiest outcome has been having her kids at home with her. As research from Deloitte shows, this has lasting flow-on effects. One-third of Indigenous homeowners surveyed said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/indigenous-business-australia-building-communities/2019/dec/20/new-research-shows-funding-indigenous-australians-home-ownership-benefits-us-all\">their children had become more interested in further education</a>.</p> <p>\u201cNow my kids will go on to get an education and know they have a place,\u201d says Kylie, whose son recently finished high school and has been accepted to university. Kylie was able to attend his orientation, to see him on his way into the world.</p> <p>\u201cWe would not have had this if we didn\u2019t have IBA,\u201d she says. \u201cAll that stuff, it\u2019s because I have a place of being. Now I\u2019m a role model.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Indigenous home ownership can stand up against cycles of inequity</strong></h2> <p>In her job, Naomi, a proud Aboriginal (Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay) and Torres Strait Islander (Erub/Darnley Island) woman, encourages her staff to engage in <a href=\"https://www.iba.gov.au/homes/iba-housing-loans/loan-products/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the IBA home ownership program</a> and helps them apply. \u201cWe know it is a game-changer,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know it makes generational change.\u201d</p> <p>Naomi has seen the value of the program first-hand. She says she had previously been pre-approved for a vehicle loan, but when she went into a branch and was asked about her Aboriginality, the loan application was declined. Banks didn\u2019t feel like a safe place for her. \u201cIt made me afraid to deal in the mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>She found out about the home ownership program through her parents. Unlike the banks, IBA treated her \u201clike family\u201d throughout the application process.</p> <p>\u201cI remember getting the advice that we\u2019d been pre-approved and could look for a house. It almost makes you feel like you\u2019ve won the lottery. There was support for what to look for in a home and the kinds of things that would need to happen when we found it. It was a really helpful, holistic process.\u201d</p> <p>Once the application was finalised, Naomi bought her first home.

      "bodyText": "Joe Marler will discover on Monday if he faces punishment for grabbing Alun Wyn Jones\u2019s genitals during England\u2019s Six Nations victory over Wales. Eddie Jones could also find himself in hot water for his stinging criticism of the referee, Ben O\u2019Keeffe, over Manu Tuilagi\u2019s red card. The citing commissioner, Peter Ferguson, has until evening to bring disciplinary action against Marler. Already Tuilagi must appear before a disciplinary hearing, most likely on Tuesday, for his dangerous tackle on George North while Courtney Lawes may face a sanction for a second-half tackle on Jones. The Wales captain called on World Rugby to act after the bizarre incident with Marler during the first half of England\u2019s 33-30 victory but the governing body considers it a matter for the Six Nations. It is understood Ferguson took the unusual step of going into the visitors\u2019 changing room after the match and spoke with Jones and the Wales coaches, suggesting a citing is likely. After the match Jones said: \u201cI\u2019ve got 138 Tests for my country. If I react, I get a red card. It\u2019s tough, isn\u2019t it? Hopefully World Rugby have a look at it. Joe\u2019s a good bloke, lots of things happen on a rugby field. It\u2019s difficult as a captain these days because you can\u2019t speak to a ref about anything, it feels.

      "bodyText": "At some stage in the next fortnight Eddie Jones will sit down for dinner with the Rugby Football Union\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, to discuss the future. There will be no shortage of agenda items, not least the fall-out from a tempestuous Anglo-Welsh contest which at times was more like rollerball than rugby. England may have collected a triple crown but, not for the first time, the hosts won few awards for grace or diplomacy. Does it matter how a national team behaves as long as it wins? Jones has never been over-burdened by such considerations but over the coming months the RFU has a fundamental decision to make. Does it stick with the devil it knows and renew its vows with a man increasingly threatening Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s position as the country\u2019s prickliest coach? Or does it take a more holistic view, decide a less Marmite personality will improve the squad\u2019s 2023 World Cup prospects and tell Jones his contract will not be renewed when it expires next year? This truncated Six Nations campaign \u2013 as yet it remains to be seen when England\u2019s final game in Italy will take place \u2013 has yielded evidence to support both arguments. On the one hand Jones has unquestionably made England a tougher, fitter team; on the other his side underperformed horribly in Paris and owe Scotland a large beer for breathing fresh life into the Six Nations title race. Of further concern to his employers, unquestionably, will be the rancour and antagonism that is now a recurring theme in the Jones era.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I don\u2019t do buses,\u201d says Shuntelle. She works for an international accountancy firm and enjoys first class air travel. There\u2019s a woman \u2013 I think, after an admittedly brief acquaintance \u2013 who appreciates high thread counts and trolleyed room service.</p> <p>What she is doing in the second series of Race Across the World (BBC Two), in which backpackers are tasked with travelling from one end of Latin America to the other in cattle class or worse is beyond me.</p> <p>Michael, by contrast, is ex-army. He looks like he not only does buses, but could fold them into his backpack and skip over the Andes. He actually likes camping, which is the definition of absurdity. He\u2019s your go-to guy if you need someone to catch, kill and skewer a squirrel in the kind of extreme survival scenarios people such as Shuntelle and myself have spent our lives avoiding.</p> <p>Shuntelle, 40, and Michael, 47, are one of five teams competing against each other to travel from Mexico City to the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia in Argentina, with the fastest pair bagging a \u00a320,000 prize. The appeal of this series has nothing to do with the Mayan temples, natural infinity pools and other Instagrammable blah that the contestants visit. Moreover, its quest is not to discover if the teams can survive jungles, tooled-up bandits and camera crews in their faces 24/7, but each other. Jean-Paul Sartre was wrong or at least imprecise when he claimed hell is other people. Hell is backpacking with other people who smell.</p> <p>Air travel is forbidden, and taxis folly, given that their daily budget is \u00a326. At the outset, the contestants are stripped of phones and credit cards, given \u00a31,400 cash and sent out into Latin America with Britain\u2019s two greatest gifts to the world \u2013 negligible Spanish and winning smiles.</p> <p>Hats off to the production team for finding a bunch of people in crisis. Every pairing is in compelling peril. Will Emon and his nephew, Jamiul, renew the close friendship they had before what John Hannah describes in his voiceover as \u201ca family estrangement\u201d? Will the oldest contestant, Jo, be able to cope with her own type 1 diabetes and her son Sam\u2019s attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to celebrate her 55th birthday in the rainforest \u2026 or will she die on the million steps up to that photogenic church? Can the siblings Dom and Lizzie rekindle their childhood bond? How will the couple Jen and Rob cope with Rob\u2019s recent hearing loss, which has left him understandably miserable?</p> <p>My money is on Shuntelle and Michael to win because they get the first row of the adventure under their belts. As you know, the first row of a holiday is as bracing as makeup sex, but less fun. Long-unexpressed resentments, mingled with new niggles about who packed what and why, result in things being said that can\u2019t be unsaid. And yet, by airing these resentments while other guests cover their mouths in shock, couples develop something like emotional scar tissue, bonding them more strongly than hitherto. Unless they murder each other first.</p> <p>Shuntelle and Michael\u2019s row happens like this. They have just broken their journey on an island paradise off Belize. But, while Shuntelle is looking forward to checking her bags and kicking back in plush accommodation, Michael goes off and books a pitch for their tents. Without asking her. Rookie mistake. \u201cDo I look,\u201d she asks him rhetorically, \u201clike someone who has slept outside in my life?\u201d</p> <p>How did this odd couple get together? \u201cWe met on Tinder,\u201d says Shuntelle. \u201cWe swiped.\u201d It\u2019s possible they swiped right meaning to swipe left. And yet their relationship has survived for three years, overcoming such setbacks as when Michael rocked up in a camper van he had bought, suggesting that he and Shuntelle could go travelling in it together. One look at its ludicrous floral curtains should have told him he was living in a fool\u2019s paradise.</p> <p>Near the end, Michael ramps up the jeopardy to the max. There are two possible outcomes from this race to the bottom of the world, he tells us. Either Shuntelle and he will split up or they will get married.</p> <p>If their relationship doesn\u2019t make it to Argentina, it will be because of the real star of the show. It\u2019s a little thing that even older readers may have forgotten existed. It\u2019s called a map. Divorce courts used to teem with couples citing irreconcilable map-folding differences. How lovely to have it back, ruining relationships like it used to do.</p>",

The appeal of this series has nothing to do with the Mayan temples, natural infinity pools and other Instagrammable blah that the contestants visit. Moreover, its quest is not to discover if the teams can survive jungles, tooled-up bandits and camera crews in their faces 24/7, but each other. Jean-Paul Sartre was wrong or at least imprecise when he claimed hell is other people. Hell is backpacking with other people who smell. Air travel is forbidden, and taxis folly, given that their daily budget is \u00a326. At the outset, the contestants are stripped of phones and credit cards, given \u00a31,400 cash and sent out into Latin America with Britain\u2019s two greatest gifts to the world \u2013 negligible Spanish and winning smiles. Hats off to the production team for finding a bunch of people in crisis. Every pairing is in compelling peril. Will Emon and his nephew, Jamiul, renew the close friendship they had before what John Hannah describes in his voiceover as \u201ca family estrangement\u201d? Will the oldest contestant, Jo, be able to cope with her own type 1 diabetes and her son Sam\u2019s attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to celebrate her 55th birthday in the rainforest \u2026 or will she die on the million steps up to that photogenic church? Can the siblings Dom and Lizzie rekindle their childhood bond? How will the couple Jen and Rob cope with Rob\u2019s recent hearing loss, which has left him understandably miserable? My money is on Shuntelle and Michael to win because they get the first row of the adventure under their belts. As you know, the first row of a holiday is as bracing as makeup sex, but less fun. Long-unexpressed resentments, mingled with new niggles about who packed what and why, result in things being said that can\u2019t be unsaid. And yet, by airing these resentments while other guests cover their mouths in shock, couples develop something like emotional scar tissue, bonding them more strongly than hitherto. Unless they murder each other first. Shuntelle and Michael\u2019s row happens like this. They have just broken their journey on an island paradise off Belize. But, while Shuntelle is looking forward to checking her bags and kicking back in plush accommodation, Michael goes off and books a pitch for their tents. Without asking her. Rookie mistake. \u201cDo I look,\u201d she asks him rhetorically, \u201clike someone who has slept outside in my life?\u201d How did this odd couple get together? \u201cWe met on Tinder,\u201d says Shuntelle. \u201cWe swiped.\u201d It\u2019s possible they swiped right meaning to swipe left. And yet their relationship has survived for three years, overcoming such setbacks as when Michael rocked up in a camper van he had bought, suggesting that he and Shuntelle could go travelling in it together. One look at its ludicrous floral curtains should have told him he was living in a fool\u2019s paradise. Near the end, Michael ramps up the jeopardy to the max. There are two possible outcomes from this race to the bottom of the world, he tells us. Either Shuntelle and he will split up or they will get married. If their relationship doesn\u2019t make it to Argentina, it will be because of the real star of the show. It\u2019s a little thing that even older readers may have forgotten existed. It\u2019s called a map. Divorce courts used to teem with couples citing irreconcilable map-folding differences. How lovely to have it back, ruining relationships like it used to do.",

At about 8pm, the Department of Health advice about who should self-isolate for 14 days on their return was updated to include all those who had been to the locked-down area, rather than just the original 11 affected towns.</p> \n<p>Airlines servicing the region follow Foreign Office advice. Late on Sunday night budget airline easyJet announced that it was cancelling some flights to and from areas of Italy affected by the lockdown.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson said easyJet, \u201cin common with a number of other airlines\u201d, was reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona until 3 April. The number of flights is expected to continue to decrease until then.</p> \n<p>The airline said affected passengers would be informed of cancellations by email and text message, and would be offered a full refund or a change of flight. </p> \n<p>However, flights on other airlines were still being advertised after the updated advice was published. Return flights to Milan on some budget airlines were advertised at less than \u00a340 on some aggregator websites. It means some holidaymakers have been left not knowing whether they can claim compensation from their insurance companies if they want to cancel.</p> \n<p>Italy\u2019s lockdown plan emerged on Saturday night as the country continues to grapple with the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe, which has killed 366 people and infected at least 7,375.

They had just checked in at their hotel as information about the Lombardy-wide quarantine emerged on social media.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe trip is now blown, which is a bit of shame,\u201d Vaughan Bellamy-Williams said. \u201cThe train was pretty much empty from the French-Italian border. They must have thought we were the only ones mad enough to go to Milan.\u201d</p> \n<p>The pair were due to travel to the southern Italian town of Bari but have decided to turn back home to London. They have booked a British Airways flight for 8pm on Sunday, which their insurer has said it will cover. Milan remains calm but they feared potential unrest and food shortages, they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe both take daily medication and its not a good environment to be enjoying a relaxing holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have to self-quarantine for two weeks but I would rather do that in my own home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Language teacher Adam Preston, from Scotland, was at a pub with two colleagues in the northern Italian town of Romano di Lombardia on Saturday night when the announcement of the decree appeared on the television.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe saw the word \u2018quarantine\u2019 but wondered exactly what that meant in practice. I suppose I hoped the headline was hyperbolic,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cI am still waiting to see what it means \u2014 if I can just take my British passport and get on a plane.\u201d</p> \n<p>Preston said that the announcement does not yet appear to have had much effect in the town of roughly 20,000 people.</p> \n<p>\u201cGyms are closed, swimming pools are closed. Supermarkets are kind of bare \u2014 people are bulk-buying,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>For now he plans to remain in place and decide tomorrow whether he will try to journey home. His school is still open but was closed for a fortnight last month.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office faced a backlash on Sunday over its lack of clear advice for British people with holidays booked in northern Italy and those currently in quarantine as a result of the region\u2019s escalating coronavirus crisis. Hours after a decree was approved to lock down the Lombardy region, the department was still advising that it was safe to travel anywhere in Italy except for 11 towns where the outbreak originated. The advice was updated later on Sunday to warn against \u201call but essential\u201d travel to the whole Lombardy region, including its capital, Milan, as well as areas of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Piedmont and Veneto, including Venice. British holidaymakers had been left confused about whether they could still go to Lombardy and whether those already there could find themselves trapped in the quarantine zone. In the updated advice, the Foreign Office urged travellers to check flight details with airlines and said there were no restrictions on people leaving Italy. At about 8pm, the Department of Health advice about who should self-isolate for 14 days on their return was updated to include all those who had been to the locked-down area, rather than just the original 11 affected towns. Airlines servicing the region follow Foreign Office advice. Late on Sunday night budget airline easyJet announced that it was cancelling some flights to and from areas of Italy affected by the lockdown. A spokesperson said easyJet, \u201cin common with a number of other airlines\u201d, was reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona until 3 April. The number of flights is expected to continue to decrease until then. The airline said affected passengers would be informed of cancellations by email and text message, and would be offered a full refund or a change of flight. However, flights on other airlines were still being advertised after the updated advice was published. Return flights to Milan on some budget airlines were advertised at less than \u00a340 on some aggregator websites. It means some holidaymakers have been left not knowing whether they can claim compensation from their insurance companies if they want to cancel. Italy\u2019s lockdown plan emerged on Saturday night as the country continues to grapple with the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe, which has killed 366 people and infected at least 7,375. It was put into effect on Sunday afternoon. Labour and the Lib Dems called on the Foreign Office to clear up confusion and worry among British travellers. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \u201cSince the very start of the coronavirus outbreak, the Foreign Office have been consistently behind the curve in terms of issuing up to date travel and evacuation advice to keep British nationals safe in the highest-risk countries, and we are now in the alarming position where \u2014 for unexplained reasons \u2014 they appear to be taking a more relaxed attitude than the countries concerned. \u201cDominic Raab needs to get a grip of this crisis, and pull out all the stops to keep our people safe.\u201d Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman, also called on the Foreign Office to give clearer advice to people travelling to or trapped in Italy. He said: \u201cPeople are increasingly worried about the spread of coronavirus and the government must be providing informed and accurate guidance, especially up-to-date travel advice to all those who could be affected.\u201d Those arriving in the quarantined region in Italy \u2014 or planning to travel back \u2014 said they had been given no guidance. Crew members of one of the first British Airways flights to depart from Lombardy after the region announced the plans for a lockdown were seen wearing masks onboard, but took them off 15 minutes after take-off. Those onboard included Ben Roeves, who had been able to change his British Airways flight in order to come back to the UK earlier than his scheduled flight later on Sunday after seeing the news about the lockdown of Lombardy. At Milan Linate airport, he said, he had seen more airport staff, security and military than passengers \u2014 although the numbers on the security front were no more than normal in comparison with other trips. After landing at London Heathrow, he disembarked at the gate and joined the normal flow of passengers from other flights. British Airways has been approached for comment. Vaughan and Richard Bellamy-Williams, aged 40 and 55, arrived in Milan by train from Paris on Saturday night in the latest leg of their abridged \u201cPhileas Fogg\u201d tour around Europe. They had just checked in at their hotel as information about the Lombardy-wide quarantine emerged on social media. \u201cThe trip is now blown, which is a bit of shame,\u201d Vaughan Bellamy-Williams said. \u201cThe train was pretty much empty from the French-Italian border. They must have thought we were the only ones mad enough to go to Milan.\u201d The pair were due to travel to the southern Italian town of Bari but have decided to turn back home to London. They have booked a British Airways flight for 8pm on Sunday, which their insurer has said it will cover. Milan remains calm but they feared potential unrest and food shortages, they said. \u201cWe both take daily medication and its not a good environment to be enjoying a relaxing holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have to self-quarantine for two weeks but I would rather do that in my own home.\u201d Language teacher Adam Preston, from Scotland, was at a pub with two colleagues in the northern Italian town of Romano di Lombardia on Saturday night when the announcement of the decree appeared on the television. \u201cWe saw the word \u2018quarantine\u2019 but wondered exactly what that meant in practice. I suppose I hoped the headline was hyperbolic,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cI am still waiting to see what it means \u2014 if I can just take my British passport and get on a plane.\u201d Preston said that the announcement does not yet appear to have had much effect in the town of roughly 20,000 people. \u201cGyms are closed, swimming pools are closed. Supermarkets are kind of bare \u2014 people are bulk-buying,\u201d he added. For now he plans to remain in place and decide tomorrow whether he will try to journey home. His school is still open but was closed for a fortnight last month.",

      "bodyText": "Here is Suzanne Wrack\u2019s report. Bye. Ellen White is focused on discussing momentum, which the win gives them going into the Spain game. \u201cIt\u2019s about a cleansheet and a win for us.\u201d Neville says there\u2019s been a lack of respect for Ellen White in recent days, adding that Beth England was fantastic in the first-half. Neville thinks winning will bring greater togetherness for England. He does admit that England\u2019s failure to take more chances was frustrating. How to finish ... There is no doubting that England were the better team for the majority of the game even though they never really got going. Beth England diid a good job up top but her poor finishing could have cost England. White came on and scored with her chance. It helped that Japan were pretty poor opposition, rarely testing Roebuck and even then it was from distance, eventually gifting England the goal. Hopefully, Neville has learned something about his team but I am not particularly sure what. 90 mins: Three minutes added on. 89 mins: Parris lifts in a cross to Duggan who fails to get a shot on target from a good position, due to poor control. 87 mins: What has Neville found out tonight? Mainly that White needs to be his main forward and she is the best finisher by far. 85 mins: Duggan cuts in from the right and whacks a fearsome shot across goal but Ikeda gets down well and holds on. Some utterly incompetent passing from Japan, sees the ball played straight to Duggan 20 yards from goal, she crosses for White who slots it into the corner. Finally some decent finishing! 81 mins: Duggan is taken down after playing a through ball to earn England a free-kick 30 yards from goal. Staniforth lifts in the free-kick but it is cleared. 79 mins: There have been a lot of subs and it has had a negative impact on the quality of the match. 77 mins: Parris is up and fine. 75 mins: Staniforth\u2019s free-kick is headed out to Nobbs 25 yards from goal but her first-time shot heads into orbit. Parris goes down in her own half and lets out a horrendous scream - she is not getting up. 73 mins: Nakajima sends a corner towards the box but it goes straight out of play. Mary Waltz provides some analysis: \u201cPhil, keep your attack going towards Endo. She looks out of place at her position.\u201d 71 mins: Ueki cuts in from the left and tries to curl a shot into the top corner but the shot has absolutely no pace on it and Roebuck catches it without fuss. 69 mins: Nobbs plays an ambitious cross for England but it is a little bit in front of her and the striker has to chase it down, before playing it back. That\u2019s England\u2019s last action and is being replaced by White. Staniforth is also coming on for Stanway, who did not have her best game. 67 mins: Williamson has slotted in front of the back four, where Walsh was playing. She operated there for Arsenal last week. Due to her being excellent on the ball, she could fit the role perfectly but would be a loss at centre-back. 65 mins: England have been playing at a higher tempo since making the changes but need to make an impact where it matters soon. 63 mins: Duggan chips the free-kick top to the back of the box for Houghton to volley at goal but she only succeeds in hitting it straight up in the air. 61 mins: Oh, it is time for subs. Walsh, Hemp and Kelly are replaced by Duggan, Parris and Williamson. Parris makes an immediate impact by bursting past Sugita who drags her down to stop the winger getting into the box. 59 mins: England play a short corner, which is eventually lifted into the box but the header is straight at the goalkeeper. Time for a sub or two, Phil? 57 mins: England is played through once again and beats the goalkeeper to the ball but then miss-controls it and Ikeda collects. Not the day England was hoping for, especially after her two goals in the Continental Cup final last week. She has played well until finding a decent finish. 55 mins: Kelly goes into the book for cleaning out Nakajima when trying to prevent giving Japan a goal kick. 53mins: The mistakes keep on coming. Hopefully the errors will stop and a good game will break out soon. 51 mins: England earn a corner, which Kelly lifts straight into the arms of the goalkeeper. 49 mins: England fail to clear a free-kick, allowing Japan to come back at them but Momiki\u2019s shot goes well over the bar from 20 yards. Sugita the ball 30 yards from and England gets the ball in the area but her shot is blocked. 47 mins: The main difference so far is that even more of the pitch is covered in shade. It would be very helpful if the England players could put bibs on. Here we go again! One missed chance ... There are no shortage of attacking potions on the bench for England. Maybe could see Ellen White come on to show some composure in front of goals. Some halftime reading ... If England had shown a degree of composure they would be ahead. Sadly, their finishing has been pretty poor. Not much to write home about in general. 45 mins: Japan finally make their sub as Endo comes on for Shimizu. 44 mins: Mary Waltz emails in: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t paid off yet but I love Hemp\u2019s aggression as he weaved her way down the flanks at a full sprint.. She seems fearless with the ball at her feet.\u201d 42 mins: Shimizu tries to walk around to prove she can carry on but she does not look comfortable and a sub is being prepared. 40 mins: Shimizu is down in pain after performing a fine tackle on Kelly in the box, allowing everyone to have a little breather. She seems to have knacked her ankle. 38 mins: Daly takes the ball forward and lays it off to Nobbs who decides that is the right moment to fall over. A long ball is played into the channel for Tanaka, who controls it gets it out of her feet and fires at the near post but Roebucks reads it well and palms it wide. 36 mins: The game has slowed down a little bit more as both teams looks to take control but fail. 34 mins: Obviously, this is all quite confusing with England having a striker named England but you\u2019ll just have to stick with me. A ball is lifted over the top for Tanaka to chase but Bright uses her strength to stop the Japan player reaching the pass and Roebuck comes out to collect. 32 mins: England get the advantage when Kelly is taken out of the halfway line. Nobbs takes the ball forward and slips it into England, who fires a shot across goal but Ikeda stops it with her feet. Far more like it from England. Phil Neville now shouting: \u201cLove it! Love it! Love it!\u201d 30 mins: There has not been much rhyme or reason to much happening on the pitch. England have been very sloppy and a bit slow in possession but have still created a few fine chances that should have been taken. 28 mins: Another mistake in the middle of the park, this time from England, allows Tanaka to dribble at the defence and fire a shot from 20 yards, which is deflected wide. 26 mins: Nobbs releases England down the right, she holds it up, before playing it inside to Stanway who cuts inside but her shot from the edge of the box is blocked. It is very quiet inside the stadium, so much so one can hear Phil Neville\u2019s instructions, including \u201cJump Jordan, jump!\u201d. 24 mins: Jordan Nobbs tells the assistant referee to \u201cfuck off\u201d after being adjudged to be offside. Unfortunately, for Nobbs, she was very much offside. 22 mins: England very much focused on the slow buildup here and it really is not working. They need to up the tempo or Japan will get on top of them here. 20 mins: Passing the ball around the back four and goalkeeper is a lovely plan but when it results in a panicked long ball to no one, it really is a waste of time. There are three central midfielders for England who have barely had a kick. 18 mins: Nakajima whips in a corner from the left, Roebuck comes to bunch but completely misses it, which won\u2019t do much for her confidence. Hemp is waiting behind her and whacks it clear, to relief of all in red. 16 mins: Nobbs lifts in a delicious cross to the back post for Hemp to attack but Shimizu positions herself well and flicks it clear. 14 mins: Another poor finish means the scores are still level. A mistake from Japan allows England to run through the middle, until one-on-one with Ikeda but she hits it straight at the goalkeeper who palms it away. England should be two goals ahead already. 12 mins: Japan look the more comfortable with the ball at their feet and are controlling possession as England chance shadows. Some find buildup play is ruined by Shimizu whacking a shot from 25 yards out high and into the stands. 10 mins: Roebuck gets down superbly to her left to palm Sugita\u2019s low drive from 25 yards onto the post and away for a corner. Not particularly surprising, but the ground in New Jersey is very quiet. Japan and England not a significant draw in USA. 8 mins: A long ball from Japan is headed down by Houghton but straight into the path of Tanaka who whacks her shot a long way over the bar from 20 yards. Houghton really needs to be more decisive when clearing the ball. 6 mins: England are trying to pass the ball out of the back, but are struggling to get it into midfield, as play keeps breaking down before it really gets going. 4 mins: Hemp should have put England ahead. England does well to snatch the ball in the middle of the park and play Hemp through after getting the better of a defender but when one-on-one her shot is tame and diverted wide. 2 mins: Japan\u2019s kit is pretty loud and there is a lot of shade covering the pitch, which is not helping the view in certain areas. England have made a few sloppy passes in the opening stages. Both teams need to sharpen up here. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The teams are coming out onto the pitch. Japan\u2019s players are all wearing massive coats. How cold is it there? Supposedly, we should have kicked off by now but instead we\u2019re looking at people in the stands. Hurry up, people! More Hemp ... Roebuck is in goal today. And our very own Rachel Brown-Finnis says she should be England\u2019s No 1. Will she prove it today? Neville says he wants his team to be on the front foot today against Japan and the energy and pace of his front three, in addition to the midfielders can give them the requisite thrust. England\u2019s best player, Lucy Bronze, is missing the tournament, which is a huge blow for Neville. On the upside, it is intriguing to see how they cope without her at right-back. Daly is given the job today, as Neville wants someone who can get forward in a similar man to Bronze. A chance to shine for Beth England. England: Roebuck, Daly, Houghton, Bright, Stokes, Walsh, Nobbs, Stanway, Kelly, England, Hemp Japan: Ikeda, Shimizu, Mayo, Miyagawa, Miyake, Miura, Sugita, Iwabuchi, Nakajima, Momiki, Tanaka Good evening! England are looking to bounce back from defeat to USA in their opening fixture against Japan. Beth England gets her chance to impress up top for England and will be aiming to build on her Chelsea form at international level. Japan also started with defeat, downed by Spain in their opening fixture, so there will be plenty of wound licking in New Jersey tonight, as both teams look to get their campaign going. Let\u2019s hope for a fine game. Here is some pre-match reading:",

      "body": "<p>If there were numerous questions to be asked about England\u2019s future under Phil Neville, then this narrow victory did little to answer them. A late tap-in from Ellen White, after a defensive howler, secured a desperately needed win against a Japan side they convincingly beat at the World Cup last summer. There will be relief in the dressing room but once again the Lionesses looked unable to get the better of a team that appeared to have nullified the attacking threat posed by Neville\u2019s side.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for everybody to feel the win,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWinning will give us the ability to build a new team spirit, a new togetherness. You can\u2019t manufacture togetherness.\u201d</p> <p>Neville had been heavily criticised for his team selection in the SheBelieves Cup opener, a tepid defeat by the USA. That 2-0 loss, their sixth defeat in nine games, heaped pressure on the games to follow and, when the teamsheet arrived, there was a buzz in the air. The 19-year-old Lauren Hemp, who impressed against the world champions, was again entrusted with a place out wide. She was joined by Everton\u2019s 22-year-old Chloe Kelly on the opposite flank and Chelsea\u2019s top scorer, Beth England, up top. It was a fighting move from the publicly stoic England manager and one fans and critics alike have been crying out for: to play the in-form young players ahead of the less convincing stalwarts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/05/england-usa-shebelieves-cup-match-report\">Lionesses outclassed by imperious USA in SheBelieves Cup opener</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey did really well,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThere was a freshness and an unpredictability.\u201d Neville\u2019s is a tough position for any manager. Phasing out an old guard that have given so much to the game without disrupting the dressing room is no easy task. The inexperienced group began brightly against a Japanese team that had, until their defeat by Spain in Orlando, won all their games since their World Cup exit. But with Keira Walsh alone in front of the back line, Japan\u2019s tricky attacker Mina Tanaka and best forward Mana Iwabuchi found success between the lines of England\u2019s 4-1-4-1.</p> <p>After a frantic start Hemp got the better of the right-back Risa Shimizu but her shot was low and too close to Sakiko Ikeda, who palmed wide. With half an hour gone a neat backheel from Jordan Nobbs enabled England to force a fine save from Ikeda before Georgia Stanway\u2019s follow-up was blocked. \u201cLove it! Love it!\u201d shouted Neville from the sidelines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97e3e366801e926ddbe27f9a44fc111bd903bb89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97e3e366801e926ddbe27f9a44fc111bd903bb89/0_269_5467_3281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Neville speaks to his players after the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Neville speaks to his players after the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron for The FA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The longer the Lionesses went without a goal, though, the more nervy proceedings became. Pressing harder and higher after the break proved fruitful but on the hour mark Neville reverted to a much more conservative line-up with the lively Kelly and Hemp swapped out for Toni Duggan and Nikita Parris, while Leah Williamson, played somewhat cruelly at right-back against the USA, came on for an overworked Walsh in central midfield.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the senior ones came on at the end they had that game knowledge and game management that we need along the journey,\u201d said Neville. That was one take. An alternative was that, when push came to shove, he copped out of entrusting his young charges to find the winner in the dying, intense minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/julie-ertz-summons-late-winner-for-us-in-shebelieves-cup-victory-over-spain\">Julie Ertz summons late winner for US in SheBelieves Cup victory over Spain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Less than 10 minutes later England found herself taken off for White. It was a strange move when anything less than a win would likely see England plummet further down the world rankings, having occupied third place before the World Cup.</p> <p>For Chelsea England has scored 14 goals and performed well in a front two with the Australian Sam Kerr. While White is more used to leading the line alone, playing a lone forward seems an odd hill for the manager to die on. \u201cWe do play a system where we don\u2019t play two out-and-out centre-forwards,\u201d said Neville, before he conceded that it would be something they could \u201clook to integrate into our future planning\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The substitutions took the sting out of England\u2019s tail. With seven minutes remaining, though, White lifted the pressure a little. Shiori Miyake conceded the ball to Duggan just inside the box on the right and the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forward chipped a neat pass into the feet of the striker, who poked home.</p> <p>There was palpable relief in the familiar goggles celebration, and from the bench, but this was a much tougher and laboured win than it should have been against a team ranked four places below them. It was a victory Neville needed but it was not a pretty one.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If there were numerous questions to be asked about England\u2019s future under Phil Neville, then this narrow victory did little to answer them. A late tap-in from Ellen White, after a defensive howler, secured a desperately needed win against a Japan side they convincingly beat at the World Cup last summer. There will be relief in the dressing room but once again the Lionesses looked unable to get the better of a team that appeared to have nullified the attacking threat posed by Neville\u2019s side. \u201cIt\u2019s good for everybody to feel the win,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWinning will give us the ability to build a new team spirit, a new togetherness. You can\u2019t manufacture togetherness.\u201d Neville had been heavily criticised for his team selection in the SheBelieves Cup opener, a tepid defeat by the USA. That 2-0 loss, their sixth defeat in nine games, heaped pressure on the games to follow and, when the teamsheet arrived, there was a buzz in the air. The 19-year-old Lauren Hemp, who impressed against the world champions, was again entrusted with a place out wide. She was joined by Everton\u2019s 22-year-old Chloe Kelly on the opposite flank and Chelsea\u2019s top scorer, Beth England, up top. It was a fighting move from the publicly stoic England manager and one fans and critics alike have been crying out for: to play the in-form young players ahead of the less convincing stalwarts. \u201cThey did really well,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThere was a freshness and an unpredictability.\u201d Neville\u2019s is a tough position for any manager. Phasing out an old guard that have given so much to the game without disrupting the dressing room is no easy task. The inexperienced group began brightly against a Japanese team that had, until their defeat by Spain in Orlando, won all their games since their World Cup exit. But with Keira Walsh alone in front of the back line, Japan\u2019s tricky attacker Mina Tanaka and best forward Mana Iwabuchi found success between the lines of England\u2019s 4-1-4-1. After a frantic start Hemp got the better of the right-back Risa Shimizu but her shot was low and too close to Sakiko Ikeda, who palmed wide. With half an hour gone a neat backheel from Jordan Nobbs enabled England to force a fine save from Ikeda before Georgia Stanway\u2019s follow-up was blocked. \u201cLove it! Love it!\u201d shouted Neville from the sidelines. The longer the Lionesses went without a goal, though, the more nervy proceedings became. Pressing harder and higher after the break proved fruitful but on the hour mark Neville reverted to a much more conservative line-up with the lively Kelly and Hemp swapped out for Toni Duggan and Nikita Parris, while Leah Williamson, played somewhat cruelly at right-back against the USA, came on for an overworked Walsh in central midfield. \u201cWhen the senior ones came on at the end they had that game knowledge and game management that we need along the journey,\u201d said Neville. That was one take. An alternative was that, when push came to shove, he copped out of entrusting his young charges to find the winner in the dying, intense minutes. Less than 10 minutes later England found herself taken off for White. It was a strange move when anything less than a win would likely see England plummet further down the world rankings, having occupied third place before the World Cup. For Chelsea England has scored 14 goals and performed well in a front two with the Australian Sam Kerr. While White is more used to leading the line alone, playing a lone forward seems an odd hill for the manager to die on. \u201cWe do play a system where we don\u2019t play two out-and-out centre-forwards,\u201d said Neville, before he conceded that it would be something they could \u201clook to integrate into our future planning\u201d. The substitutions took the sting out of England\u2019s tail. With seven minutes remaining, though, White lifted the pressure a little. Shiori Miyake conceded the ball to Duggan just inside the box on the right and the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forward chipped a neat pass into the feet of the striker, who poked home. There was palpable relief in the familiar goggles celebration, and from the bench, but this was a much tougher and laboured win than it should have been against a team ranked four places below them. It was a victory Neville needed but it was not a pretty one.",

For the last two months there have been rumours of the rebirth of the Manchester United midfield, of gears beginning to clunk into place, those oddly assembled component parts finding their rhythms. The Manchester United midfield? Yeah, I remember that. Oh no, it\u2019s been years now.</p> <p>Well, look again. At a damp and increasingly boisterous Old Trafford, Fernandes produced a central midfield performance that seemed to go against the tide of the last decade or so. So often United\u2019s declining fortunes have been characterised by something ponderous at the heart of the team, a club drained not just of success, but of spirit and invention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report-derby\">McTominay embarrasses Ederson in Manchester United's derby win over City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, though, was something else. United were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report-derby\" title=\"\">deserved 2-0 winners against Manchester City</a> at Old Trafford. In the middle of which Fernandes produced surely the best midfield display any United player has mustered up against City since the balance of power swung decisively.</p> <p>Midfield has been a painful place at times against the passing sprites of City\u2019s better teams. But for the first time in some time United shed the inferiority complex and came here to play.</p> <p>It all sprung from Fernandes, who has been that rare thing in the last two months: not just an expensive, talented player, but the expensive, talented player United actually needed, bringing craft and skill but also something expressive and extrovert. Imagine a Paul Pogba who actually wants to be there. Well, here he is.</p> <p>Fernandes had played in seven instalments of United\u2019s 10-game unbeaten streak before this game.

      "bodyText": "For Bruno Fernandes this must have felt a bit like a coronation. For the last two months there have been rumours of the rebirth of the Manchester United midfield, of gears beginning to clunk into place, those oddly assembled component parts finding their rhythms. The Manchester United midfield? Yeah, I remember that. Oh no, it\u2019s been years now. Well, look again. At a damp and increasingly boisterous Old Trafford, Fernandes produced a central midfield performance that seemed to go against the tide of the last decade or so. So often United\u2019s declining fortunes have been characterised by something ponderous at the heart of the team, a club drained not just of success, but of spirit and invention. This, though, was something else. United were deserved 2-0 winners against Manchester City at Old Trafford. In the middle of which Fernandes produced surely the best midfield display any United player has mustered up against City since the balance of power swung decisively. Midfield has been a painful place at times against the passing sprites of City\u2019s better teams. But for the first time in some time United shed the inferiority complex and came here to play. It all sprung from Fernandes, who has been that rare thing in the last two months: not just an expensive, talented player, but the expensive, talented player United actually needed, bringing craft and skill but also something expressive and extrovert. Imagine a Paul Pogba who actually wants to be there. Well, here he is. Fernandes had played in seven instalments of United\u2019s 10-game unbeaten streak before this game. This, though, was a step-up, a visit from the great colonising force of the European midfield, a team created by a man who dreams of turning the whole world a shade of midfield and whose teams will spend every second trying to run and pass and move you to death in the centre of the pitch. Over to you then, Bruno. He began just ahead of the double-pivot of Fred and Nemanja Matic. It is the most varied and balanced-looking midfield United have been able to put out in some time: one to give it, one to wander around like a decommissioned Dalek, one to offer a sense of creative promise. Clearly Fernandes and Fred have something going on. There was a nice fizzed exchange early on, one of several moments when they seemed to be just enjoying themselves, bantering the ball about between them, enjoying the repartee. Teams are often quite simple things. This stuff is important. On 15 minutes there was a slick, high-speed Fred-to-Fernandes link-up that fed Daniel James for a shot that was straight at Ederson, the shot of a player who hasn\u2019t scored since August, 36 games ago. And between them they made the opening goal shortly afterwards. First Fernandes won a free-kick on the left, drawing a very fine touch from Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, enough to activate the familiarly acute Portuguese pain threshold. Fernandes collapsed with a howl of pain. City\u2019s players protested. They have presumably been watching for the last 20 years or so. Fernandes sprung up and stood with Fred over the free-kick. Was it a planned move? Possibly, given the talk of Fernandes\u2019 extreme dedication to training and prep. First there was the lovely little sheen of misdirection as Fernandes raised his right arm and looked vaguely the other way, distracted by idle thoughts of a back-post hoof, a whip, a punt, a sideways roll. Martial darted in behind the blue line. As he began to move Fernandes swung a leg back like a golfer measuring his chip to the green and played a beautiful, impudent little back-spun dink over the retreating blue shirts, the ball seeming to float, to stop for a moment, before dipping into Martial\u2019s path. Planning is one thing, execution is another, and this was a moment of cold, hard technical brilliance in the middle of all that noise.

The connection between fans and players and the team. What a day they\u2019ve had today, both the players and the fans. Of course they made us defend, that\u2019s the type of players they are, but if our fans can see players with attitude and commitment and desire, then we\u2019ve done our job as coaches today. I think we at times pressed them and pushed them back, we tried to be aggressive with the full-backs, so when we hit the press I think we made them make mistakes. I can\u2019t put my finger on anything [negative], but at times you\u2019d like to defend with the ball in the team sometimes, but I\u2019m not going to complain.</p> <p>It\u2019s a privilege to be a manager of a squad and players with this attitude. They give us absolutely everything they\u2019ve got every time they play and you can\u2019t ask for more. We\u2019re going to improve, they\u2019re going to improve as players. There\u2019s two or three times today, head up and we score a goal. There\u2019s twice Dan James could square it, once for Bruno, once for Anthony, Anthony could square it for Bruno. Those little things, they\u2019ll come. </p> <p>Well of course it\u2019s a derby, the fans love it, the players love it. For our players to beat the team that\u2019s Man City, with the problems that we\u2019ve had as well, it\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m just delighted for them. We played against an absolute top, top team.

United were simply far more dangerous than a strangely toothless opponent and were deserving victors in this 182nd derby that ended in the kind of jubilant scenes not witnessed at Old Trafford for a while. The three points keep United in fifth, and firmly in the hunt for a Champions League berth, while making it 10 matches unbeaten.

Here\u2019s McTominay\u2019s post-match reaction. He does speak remarkably quickly, so I haven\u2019t quite caught everything:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That was such a sweet moment. Credit to the boys they were top drawer today. They had a sticky first 15-20 minutes, but you can see how much it means to the boys to win the derby again, that\u2019s three times this year. I read the goalkeeper, and you give yourself half a chance because they\u2019re rushing. It\u2019s such a beautiful feeling in front of our fans. These games, your Liverpools, your Arsenals, your Man Citys, they\u2019re special. You can see with the run of games we\u2019ve been on, with my injury I was desperate to get back because I could see the progression of the team.

The previous three (and the one before that for good measure, and six of the last seven for that matter) ended in away wins. This fits with the long-term trend: since the day in October 2011 when City went to Old Trafford and won 6-1 there have been 14 away wins in this fixture and only six home wins, which is quite the turnaround - before that there had been one away win in nine. So, in short, Manchester City will probably win today, which is the outcome all this recent history suggests is more likely, and is also supported by the fact that, for all that United are on a Bruno Fernandes-inspired nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions and enjoying what Pep Guardiola called \u201ctheir best moment of the season\u201d, they have a significantly better football team.</p> <p>True fact: the only Manchester derby to be played on 8 March was in 1969, when City won 1-0 at Old Trafford. <br></p> <p>Here\u2019s some pre-match reading, courtesy of Jonathan Liew:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/manchester-derby-united-city-business\">United and City ensure Manchester derby is not just about the football | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, an excellent, tense and dramatic derby concludes. City missed Kevin de Bruyne badly and were well below their best, looking like a team that would happily give up on this season\u2019s league campaign right now given half a chance. United were a little overdefensive in the second half, and adopted a worrying strikerless formation for a while, but they were excellent in the first half, competitive throughout, and looked like a team that boasts potential, unity, commitment and decent coaching, none of which are things that they have been widely associated with them of late. And what\u2019s more, it was another excellent result for Liverpool. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer doesn\u2019t take credit for United\u2019s opening goal, saying that Martial and Fernandes \u201chave hit it off\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201cseen them do it before\u201d, but not suggesting that he played any part in their free-kick routine. Also, he says Fred should have had a penalty in the first half, and he also says this generally very happy stuff: The desire, attitude, commitment. The connection between fans and players and the team. What a day they\u2019ve had today, both the players and the fans. Of course they made us defend, that\u2019s the type of players they are, but if our fans can see players with attitude and commitment and desire, then we\u2019ve done our job as coaches today. I think we at times pressed them and pushed them back, we tried to be aggressive with the full-backs, so when we hit the press I think we made them make mistakes. I can\u2019t put my finger on anything [negative], but at times you\u2019d like to defend with the ball in the team sometimes, but I\u2019m not going to complain. It\u2019s a privilege to be a manager of a squad and players with this attitude. They give us absolutely everything they\u2019ve got every time they play and you can\u2019t ask for more. We\u2019re going to improve, they\u2019re going to improve as players. There\u2019s two or three times today, head up and we score a goal. There\u2019s twice Dan James could square it, once for Bruno, once for Anthony, Anthony could square it for Bruno. Those little things, they\u2019ll come. Well of course it\u2019s a derby, the fans love it, the players love it. For our players to beat the team that\u2019s Man City, with the problems that we\u2019ve had as well, it\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m just delighted for them. We played against an absolute top, top team. Of course we had to defend and they had possession, but we\u2019re delighted with the outcome. Bernardo Silva disagrees with his manager: It was a bad game for us. In my opinion not acceptable. But yeah, a very bad day. We didn\u2019t start very bad the game, I think we were playing quite well until we conceded the goal. But we know how United play, how good they are on the counter-attack, how aggressive they are defensively, and as I said, not a good performance and not acceptable from us. We have to watch the game, we have to listen to what Pep has to see. Now it\u2019s too close to see what lacked. But a team like ours cannot lose this many games in the Premier League as we have this season. We have to check what\u2019s not going right and then try not to make so many mistakes. Pep Guardiola has a chat. His takehome message is that \u201cwe played so good\u201d: Good game. We played good. We miss a little bit, especially in the first half, when we arrived in positions to be a little bit more aggressive. We conceded a goal, we should avoid it. Second half was good, and congratulations United. We were a little bit more aggressive in the second half, but in terms of the way we play we played good in both halves. Ederson saved one or two. He\u2019s an exceptional keeper. I\u2019m not here to judge my players for making mistakes. It\u2019s part of the game, he will recover and he\u2019s an exceptional goalkeeper. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report: Manchester United have a first league double for a decade over Manchester City in a further sign that the faith shown by the board in Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is being repaid. United made their crosstown rivals appear the tamest City side brought here during Pep Guardiola\u2019s four years in charge. United were simply far more dangerous than a strangely toothless opponent and were deserving victors in this 182nd derby that ended in the kind of jubilant scenes not witnessed at Old Trafford for a while. The three points keep United in fifth, and firmly in the hunt for a Champions League berth, while making it 10 matches unbeaten. City, though, will be dethroned as champions and Liverpool crowned before the Merseysiders play again if Guardiola\u2019s side lose their next two matches: against Arsenal and Burnley. Much more here: On that second United goal, I\u2019m not sure how McTominay managed to cover so much ground to reach the ball before Mendy, who had half the distance to cover and can\u2019t exactly claim tiredness, both players having come on with 13 minutes to go. Here\u2019s McTominay\u2019s post-match reaction. He does speak remarkably quickly, so I haven\u2019t quite caught everything: That was such a sweet moment. Credit to the boys they were top drawer today. They had a sticky first 15-20 minutes, but you can see how much it means to the boys to win the derby again, that\u2019s three times this year. I read the goalkeeper, and you give yourself half a chance because they\u2019re rushing. It\u2019s such a beautiful feeling in front of our fans. These games, your Liverpools, your Arsenals, your Man Citys, they\u2019re special. You can see with the run of games we\u2019ve been on, with my injury I was desperate to get back because I could see the progression of the team. We\u2019ve won a game today, fantastic, but it\u2019s the next one, and the next one. City play Arsenal at home on Wednesday and Burnley at home on Saturday. Assuming they win both of those Liverpool still need two victories to seal the title, and if they win the derby would wrap it up with success against Crystal Palace in less than a fortnight, which depending on virus progression might be before a Premier League stadium fan ban. There were two sides to this United performance: threat and endeavour in the first half, determination in the second. City had 72% of possession but they created few clear chances, and United had more goalscoring threat and six shots on target to their four. For all that, Ederson was at fault for both goals. 90+8 mins: It\u2019s all over! 90+7 mins: Fred\u2019s overhit pass runs through to Ederson, who picks it up on the right-hand corner of the area and bowls it out. McTominay runs 40 yards to reach the first, and passes it into a still-empty net! An absolute howler from Ederson, and a 50-yarder from McTominay! 90+6 mins: United hack the ball clear. Probably another minute to go. 90+5 mins: It looks like Jesus has just been booked for grumpiness, as the clock ticked with Matic grounded. 90+4 mins: McTominay is down and feeling an ankle, while not two yards away Matic is down and struggling with cramp. 90+3 mins: Ighalo\u2019s hold-up play has improved United immeasurably. He keeps the ball for a while on the halfway line, ghosting past a couple of opponents and earning delighted Ol\u00e9\u2019s from the crowd. 90+3 mins: James leads a break, but delays his pass infield to Fred long enough for Otamendi to turn up and dispossess him. 90+1 mins: There will be five minutes of stoppage time, or thereabouts. 90 mins: This time Cancelo\u2019s cross runs to Sterling, just outside the area, but his shot is poor, and bounces feebly through to De Gea. 89 mins: Mendy\u2019s overhit cross goes out of play. They don\u2019t seem to be offering much except crosses, and often not very good ones. 88 mins: Bruno Fernandes is going off, and Ighalo coming on. \u201cFernandes is an intelligent player who obviously elevates Man U. What I\u2019m having trouble sussing out is if he\u2019s really excellent or if United have just been middling in tactics and inspiration for so long that anyone looks an improvement,\u201d says Ray. I think he\u2019s an excellent player: clearly extremely fit, but he makes good runs and good decisions, stretching defences and offering options. 87 mins: Cancelo\u2019s overhit cross goes out of play, and United\u2019s defence remains unbreached. Ighalo is going to come on for the last few minutes. 84 mins: Jesus bursts into the box, and Wan-Bissaka and Maguire both attempt sliding tackles. The former succeeds, the latter just steamrollers both Jesus and Wan-Bissaka and really should have stayed on his feet. Anyway, and just about, corner. 82 mins: James gets the ball, and attempts a solo break. Fernandes tries to offer him an option, but his run is covered and James just has to struggle on alone. He does so manfully before eventually spying a route to Fernandes and passing, only for the offside flag to go up. 80 mins: In the last 10 minutes, City have had 86% of possession. I\u2019m not sure this front-none formation is going to work out for United. 79 mins: United now have James on his own in attack. In other words, they have abandoned all thoughts of attacking. 77 mins: United make two substitutions, bringing Eric Bailly and Scott McTominay on while Williams and Martial trudge off. City meanwhile make their final change, bringing Benjamin Mendy on for Zinchenko. 75 mins: What a miss! Mahrez crosses low from the right and Sterling runs onto it in the middle. It looks like a tap-in, but somehow he taps well wide! So wide in fact that Jesus keeps it in, turns back, executes a number of ostentatious stepovers and then slams in a low shot that De Gea saves! 73 mins: Luke Shaw is on the floor. The physio rushes on, but swiftly gives the bench a thumbs up and doesn\u2019t seem to be administering anything more significant than a drink. 71 mins: United\u2019s wide players essentially need to realise that after they burst into the box Bruno Fernandes is always perfectly placed infield, and stop having optimistic shots from unpromising angles. 70 mins: United nearly score on the break! Wan-Bissaka plays the ball down the right, and James takes on Otamendi, goes past him easily, but then doesn\u2019t see the easy pass infield to Bruno Fernandes and instead blasts a shot towards the near post, which Ederson saves. 69 mins: Mahrez takes on Williams, beats him twice and then sends the ball across the United goal, where nobody is on hand to turn it in. 66 mins: For the first time, United are under sustained pressure - and they are starting to creak. City win another corner, though they seemed to actively avoid attempting to score with it, passing it back 50 yards, playing it from left to right and then giving it away. 63 mins: Then City go down the other end, and Foden, who has moved infield following Mahrez\u2019s introduction, shoots high from 22 yards or so. 63 mins: City are pushing forward much more now, which of course gives United opportunities to break. They pass out to James, who roars down the right and crosses, too high for Martial. 61 mins: City have another corner, this time from the left. Gundogan crosses, and Otamendi heads over the bar from the corner of the six-yard box. 59 mins: A double substitution for City, who take off Aguero and Bernado Silva and bring on Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez. 58 mins: Williams goes past Cancelo, just outside his own penalty area, with almost insulting ease, and is brought down in retribution. Cancelo is booked. 55 mins: Foden wins a corner on the right. It\u2019s taken short and eventually worked to Foden, now central, whose 25-yard left-footer is tipped ovrer the bar by De Gea. 51 mins: Back to that offside decision, and it was wafer-thin. De Gea made not attempt to save the shot, and would have looked exceedingly foolish had Aguero\u2019s left shoulder turned out to be an inch or two further back when Sterling prodded the ball through. 50 mins: If Martial had been as desperate to get to that ball as Ederson was, he would surely have scored. He didn\u2019t fling out his leg, though, and that gave Ederson a chance to recover. 49 mins: Ederson nearly hands United a goal! He takes a terrible touch when controlling a back-pass, and it looks like Martial will prod the loose ball over the line, but the Brazilian slides across to clear. Martial however does end up in the net, via the post, and is hurt. 48 mins: VAR is certainly having a good look at this. It looks like Shaw might have been playing Aguero onside there. 48 mins: Aguero is played in by Sterling and thumps the ball into the net, but the offside flag is raised. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! City get the second half started. The players are back out and ready to rock. No changes that I can see. Keane and Richards also think it should have been a penalty, the latter unenthusiastically. \u201cThe turnaround time by VAR for the penalty shout was alarmingly quick,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cThey haven\u2019t looked at it properly. When you consider the decision re Bournemouth\u2019s goal yesterday you could be forgiven for thinking VAR is getting quietly sidelined.\u201d \u201cLee Dixon disagrees with you about Fernandes being fouled leading to the free kick and goal,\u201d reports JR. On Sky, Micah Richards and Roy Keane agree with Dixon. \u201cAfter watching multiple replays he insisted it was never a foul on Fernandes. He then tried for a couple minutes to get inside the mind of Mike Dean but admitted he couldn\u2019t do it. Can\u2019t say he\u2019s alone on that score.\u201d 45+3 mins: That\u2019s all for now. City started well, but have done nothing of note in attack for half an hour or more, have looked feeble in defence, and the goalkeeper\u2019s let in a stinker. 45+1 mins: There will be about two minutes of stoppage time at the end of this first half. 45 mins: United continue to dominate. Fred and Fernandes in particular have been excellent, as well as Wan-Bissaka on the right. \u201cIt\u2019s massively early days but I have not seen City look so shaky for so long a spell recently,\u201d says Mary Waltz. 44 mins: That penalty call gets weirder the more I see it. \u201cHe\u2019s having a nightmare,\u201d says Gary Neville of Otamendi. 42 mins: Fred goes down in the area, and is booked for simulation. Replays suggest Otamendi kicked him in the shin, but VAR doesn\u2019t seem interested. 41 mins: Manchester United are 7-1 up on shot count. 40 mins: Matic lifts the ball over City\u2019s defence to Martial, but instead of holding up off the turf it bounces through to Ederson. \u201cWhy don\u2019t more keepers use their feet, like De Gea? Seems like diving to get a shot that\u2019s right at your side isn\u2019t a very efficient approach,\u201d wonders Joe Pearson. 39 mins: Wan-Bissaka ghosts between Zinchenko and Sterling with a lovely bit of skill. Lovely, but completely unnecessary: you could have driven a double-decker bus through the space the two City players were leaving. 38 mins: Wan-Bissaka runs into Otamendi inside the penalty area and goes down hard, but no foul is given. 37 mins: Shaw barges into Cancelo, conceding a free-kick. United are being quite physical in their challenges, all over the pitch. So far this seems to be annoying City a lot more than it\u2019s annoying the referee. 34 mins: Looking at replays, I do think that Fernandes was fouled before the goal. At full speed it looked like Gundogan just kicked the ball, but I think he kicked the United player\u2019s foot first. 33 mins: Looks like Rodri was also booked for dissent, either before or immediately after the goal. 32 mins: Another chance for United! Williams crosses from the left, but Fernandes misjudges its flight and in the end has to stop and jump backwards, and pays the price in both power and accuracy. And they score from the free-kick! Fernandes chips it over the defence, Martial runs onto it and volleys goalwards, and Ederson flops limply over the ball as it skews underneath him and inside the near post! 29 mins: Fernandinho gets booked, after City players react furiously to the generous award of a free-kick to United after Fernandes goes down over Gundogan\u2019s not exactly forceful challenge. 28 mins: Great chance for United! Martial beats Fernandino wide on the United left and cuts into the area. Fernandes is available just to his right for what would have been a fabulous shooting chance, but instead Martial shoots poorly from the left of goal, straight at Ederson. I\u2019m all for players backing their ability, but that\u2019s terrible decision-making. 27 mins: United have dominated the last 10 minutes or so, pushing mainly down the flanks. City haven\u2019t kept the ball at all well. 25 mins: Fernandes tries a shot, but hits only the wall. 24 mins: James runs down the right, cuts infield and is brought down by Otamendi a yard outside the area. United have themselves a fine crossing/shooting opportunity here. 22 mins: Williams lifts the ball into the City area, and Martial controls excellently, but he then hits his shot into Otamendi. This isn\u2019t a full-throttle, helter-skelter stereotypical British derby, but it is quite engrossing. 18 mins: Sterling goes down under Fred\u2019s challenge, wants a free-kick and doesn\u2019t get it. A few moments later and about 40 yards upfield Fred goes down under Rodri\u2019s challenge, wants a free-kick and doesn\u2019t get it. 16 mins: Save! United mount their first attack of note, and Fernandes prods through to James, who could have crossed to Martial at the far post, but instead shoots too close to Ederson. 13 mins: Ederson\u2019s clearance is headed limply to Sterling by Maguire. Sterling passes to Aguero, who nudges past Maguire - who throws himself recklessly into a challenge and bursts into the box, but Lindelof comes to the recue. 10 mins: Save! Aguero and Shaw battle for the ball from the centre circle and down the right flank. The City striker wins the tussle and centres, and Sterling controls and curls a shot towards the far post that wasn\u2019t very firmly struck, giving De Gea a chance to fling himself to the left and push it away. 9 mins: Martial jumps in front of Fernandinho, and goes down clutching the back of his head. He did get a forearm in the back, but I didn\u2019t see any head-related issues. 7 mins: Gundogan tries to play in Foden on the right, and though Williams gets there first he is sufficiently spooked to send a 50-yard clearing hoik into touch for a corner. 4 mins: Zinchenko\u2019s poor pass from the left almost plays in Martial, who reacts slowly and doesn\u2019t seem to run with any pace as Joao Cancelo overtakes him and plays it back to Ederson. 3 mins: The first big cheer from the home fans comes when Ederson, in clearing the ball, slips and falls over. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Fernandes takes the kick-off, and this game is on! The players come out, and walk past each other without dangerous handshaking. \u201cNewcastle fans reading Pep Guardiola\u2019s pre-match musings must be chuffed to learn that their team is in a final,\u201d notes Peter Oh. The players are gathering in the tunnel. Bruno Fernandes seems to be sniffing some kind of nasal stick-type sinus-clearing device. Pep Guardiola calls the games against Real Madrid and Newcastle \u201cour finals\u201d, suggesting that the league is now No3 on their list of priorities: I think they\u2019ll play five at the back, 5-2-1-2, the same set-up they had against Chelsea when they won 2-0. So ti doesn\u2019t matter, they can change it, they can play 4-2-3-1, a diamond. United was in the recent past more on the break, but now I think they have the quality to play. When a team defends so deep they have the quality to break this. Or they maybe thought to break, but I think they\u2019ll be aggressive, to make high pressing. We\u2019re going to try to impose our game and make chances. In the next three games everybody\u2019s going to play, to try to arrive against Madrid and Newcastle with fresh legs, to play our finals in the best physical condition and everybody fit. \u201cI find many things amusing,\u201d writes JR, \u201cand one of those things is that they have banned pre-match handshakes and yet after the game all the players and everyone around them are hugging, kissing, shaking hands and doing all sorts. You\u2019ve got to laugh.\u201d Yeah, laugh now while you\u2019ve got the chance. Fast forward a few weeks, though, and you\u2019ll probably have to cough, splutter and wheeze. Foden is the second-youngest player in the starting line-ups today, with United\u2019s Brandon Williams about three months younger. Mason Greenwood, who is on the bench, is 13 months younger still. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a chat: We just have to concentrate on getting enough points. Today\u2019s a big task, playing against a huge team, but it\u2019s important for us to keep picking up points. We\u2019ve played this set-up before. Bruno is new, obviously, but we\u2019ve had a few decent performances with it. You can\u2019t [play like they did at the Etihad] at home. You\u2019ve got to try to get after them. We have to try to press them, because if you give them easy possession they\u2019re the best team. We\u2019ve got to go up there and press, see if we can take the sting and the rhythm out of their game and try to dominate themselves. The messages have been quite clear, about what we want from them in this game, and they\u2019re all looking forward to it. Here\u2019s PA Media on the teams: Manchester City were without playmaker Kevin de Bruyne for their derby against rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford. With the second leg of their Champions League tie against Real Madrid coming up next week, City decided not to risk the Belgian, who landed awkwardly on his shoulder in the Carabao Cup final last Sunday. De Bruyne did not even make the bench but the Wembley man of the match, Phil Foden, was handed a starting place. Ederson returned in goal and Joao Cancelo was preferred to Kyle Walker at right-back. United made seven changes from Thursday\u2019s FA Cup win against Derby. Harry Maguire recovered from an ankle injury to skipper the side at Old Trafford, where Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James also overcame knocks to start. I don\u2019t know if these are freshly-installed or if they\u2019ve been there a while, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be particularly popular today. The team sheets are in, and the headlines are that Harry Maguire is back to captain United while Kevin de Bruyne is nowhere to be seen: Manchester United: De Gea, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Wan Bissaka, Matic, Fred, Williams, Bruno Fernandes, James, Martial. Subs: Bailly, Mata, Romero, Ighalo, Greenwood, Tuanzebe, McTominay. Manchester City: Ederson, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Zinchenko, Bernardo Silva, Rodri, Gundogan, Foden, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Bravo, Walker, Gabriel Jesus, Silva, Mendy, Mahrez, Garcia. Referee: Mike Dean. Hello world! It\u2019s the fourth Manchester derby of the season! This fixture truly is the gift that keeps on giving, or at least the gift that keeps on being given. The previous three (and the one before that for good measure, and six of the last seven for that matter) ended in away wins. This fits with the long-term trend: since the day in October 2011 when City went to Old Trafford and won 6-1 there have been 14 away wins in this fixture and only six home wins, which is quite the turnaround - before that there had been one away win in nine. So, in short, Manchester City will probably win today, which is the outcome all this recent history suggests is more likely, and is also supported by the fact that, for all that United are on a Bruno Fernandes-inspired nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions and enjoying what Pep Guardiola called \u201ctheir best moment of the season\u201d, they have a significantly better football team. True fact: the only Manchester derby to be played on 8 March was in 1969, when City won 1-0 at Old Trafford. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading, courtesy of Jonathan Liew:",

The number of infections, meanwhile, swelled to more than 550, scattered across 30 states, with Kate Brown, the governor of Oregon, the latest to declare a state of emergency on Sunday afternoon after 14 cases were confirmed there.</p> <p>Passengers aboard the Grand Princess holed up in their rooms awaiting news, with crew members wearing masks and gloves delivering food in covered plates on trays left outside cabin doors.</p> <p>Grant Tarling, chief medical officer for Carnival Corporation, said it is believed a 71-year-old Northern California man who later died of the virus was probably sick when he boarded the ship for a 11 February cruise to Mexico.</p> <p>The passenger visited the medical center the day before disembarking with symptoms of respiratory illness, he said. Others in several states and Canada who were on that voyage also have tested positive.</p> <p>The passenger likely infected his dining room server, who also tested positive for the virus, Tarling said, as did two people traveling with the man. Two passengers now on the ship who have the virus were not on the previous cruise, he said.</p> <p>Some passengers who had been on the Mexico trip stayed aboard for the current voyage \u2013 increasing crew members\u2019 exposure to the virus.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the US president, was playing golf near his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida on Sunday as the crisis continued to escalate. Earlier in the week he said he would prefer not to allow the passengers on to American soil but would defer to experts.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers [of US cases] double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Trump said Friday while touring CDC headquarters in Atlanta. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t the fault of the people on the ship either. And they are mostly American, so I can live either way with it.\u201d</p> <p>Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure.</p> <p>Hundreds of Americans aboard that ship were flown to military bases in California and other states for two-week quarantines. Some later were hospitalized with symptoms.</p> <p>An epidemiologist who studies the spread of virus particles said the recirculated air from a cruise ship\u2019s ventilation system, plus the close quarters and communal settings, make passengers and crew vulnerable to infectious diseases.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not designed as quarantine facilities, to put it mildly,\u201d said Don Milton of the University of Maryland.</p> <p>Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people and killed more than 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of passengers stranded aboard a cruise ship stricken by coronavirus have been told they can expect to finally dock in the port of Oakland, California, on Monday, as authorities ordered its sister ship to wait off the coast of Florida until two crew members were tested. The Grand Princess has been circling off California for four days having been refused permission to land in San Francisco amid evidence that the vessel was the breeding ground for a cluster of more than 20 cases that resulted in at least one death. Its captain, John Smith, told the 3,500 passengers from 54 countries that Princess Cruises, the ship\u2019s owners, had arranged for it to dock tomorrow. \u201cAn agreement has been reached to bring our ship into the port of Oakland,\u201d he said in a loudspeaker announcement late Saturday recorded by passengers. \u201cAfter docking, we will then begin a disembarkation process specified by federal authorities that will take several days.\u201d That process was expected to include passengers being taken into quarantine and crew members staying aboard. Meanwhile in Florida, the Regal Princess was refused permission to dock in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday morning pending results of tests on two crew members who transferred recently from the Grand Princess. Princess Cruises did not respond immediately to questions about how many passengers were on board or what measures were being taken as the ship stayed at sea between Fort Lauderdale and Miami, but travelers aboard posted social media pictures of what appeared to be a US Coast Guard cutter taking virus testing kits ashore. \u201cThe Coast Guard transmitted a no-sail order and information order issued by Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian in a written statement that did not confirm the ship\u2019s identity. \u201cThis morning a Coast Guard Miami small boat crew, in support of that order, transported test kits to a vessel offshore southern Florida. We will assist health officials to ensure the safety and health of all passengers and crew aboard, and will continue to collaborate with our interagency and industry partners as the whole of US government responds and mitigates risk of coronavirus.\u201d The Miami Herald reported that the ship, which has a capacity of 3,500 passengers and 1,300 crew, was returning to Port Everglades from a 14-day Caribbean cruise but was ordered to stay at sea. The newspaper said passengers were awakened by a 5.30am announcement on Sunday informing them that the ship was being held while federal health authorities tested two crew members who joined from the Grand Princess at the beginning of the voyage. It reported that the crew members being tested had not shown symptoms of the virus that infected 21 people aboard the Grand Princess, 19 of them crew, and that the testing was expected to be completed within a few hours. A cruise by the Regal Princess scheduled to depart Port Everglades on Sunday was already canceled. The US death toll from the virus rose to 21 on Sunday, with most victims in Washington state. The number of infections, meanwhile, swelled to more than 550, scattered across 30 states, with Kate Brown, the governor of Oregon, the latest to declare a state of emergency on Sunday afternoon after 14 cases were confirmed there. Passengers aboard the Grand Princess holed up in their rooms awaiting news, with crew members wearing masks and gloves delivering food in covered plates on trays left outside cabin doors. Grant Tarling, chief medical officer for Carnival Corporation, said it is believed a 71-year-old Northern California man who later died of the virus was probably sick when he boarded the ship for a 11 February cruise to Mexico. The passenger visited the medical center the day before disembarking with symptoms of respiratory illness, he said. Others in several states and Canada who were on that voyage also have tested positive. The passenger likely infected his dining room server, who also tested positive for the virus, Tarling said, as did two people traveling with the man. Two passengers now on the ship who have the virus were not on the previous cruise, he said. Some passengers who had been on the Mexico trip stayed aboard for the current voyage \u2013 increasing crew members\u2019 exposure to the virus. Donald Trump, the US president, was playing golf near his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida on Sunday as the crisis continued to escalate. Earlier in the week he said he would prefer not to allow the passengers on to American soil but would defer to experts. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers [of US cases] double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Trump said Friday while touring CDC headquarters in Atlanta. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t the fault of the people on the ship either. And they are mostly American, so I can live either way with it.\u201d Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure. Hundreds of Americans aboard that ship were flown to military bases in California and other states for two-week quarantines. Some later were hospitalized with symptoms. An epidemiologist who studies the spread of virus particles said the recirculated air from a cruise ship\u2019s ventilation system, plus the close quarters and communal settings, make passengers and crew vulnerable to infectious diseases. \u201cThey\u2019re not designed as quarantine facilities, to put it mildly,\u201d said Don Milton of the University of Maryland. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people and killed more than 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.",

      "bodyText": "Simon Jenkins gives a list of \u201cscares\u201d that have not reached the predicted body count (Let them wash your hands, but not your brain, Journal, 7 March). He does not discuss HIV/Aids and the 1918 flu epidemic, which had devastating consequences. All the medical experts he speaks to are \u201ccalm\u201d. Yet the World Health Organization is demanding immediate dramatic action. It cites the actual experience of China moving from 40 cases on 1 January to 3,000 a day in February. Its government was only able to limit this spread by the imposition of a quite astonishing level of social control, including closing all schools and universities, the strict quarantining of whole populations and the use of mass surveillance to track those infected. As the WHO says, this is not a drill and the \u201ccarry on as normal\u201d approach is inviting catastrophe. Prof Greg Philo Glasgow University \u2022 Re Simon Jenkins\u2019 article, both awareness and balance are possible. Every day, newspapers and websites are filled with pictures of people wearing unnecessary face masks on our city streets (The essential guide: What do we know? How should we react?, 7 March). If even some of these images were replaced by pictures of people washing their hands, as the World Health Organization recommends, the message about hand hygiene might reach more people around the world. This message is both simple and life-saving, and it bears infinite repeating. Prof Brendan Kelly Trinity College Dublin \u2022 Isn\u2019t it time the government dug out some second world war posters? \u201cCoughs and sneezes spread diseases, trap your germs in your handkerchief.\u201d And we could cheer ourselves up with the wartime phrase \u201cfor the duration\u201d. The poster applicable to fight climate emergency, \u201cIs your journey really necessary?\u201d, could also be revived. Penelope Putz Exeter \u2022 Your experts advise that in the event of emergency time off to look after a self-isolated child \u201cmost people would \u2026 just work from home\u201d (Coronavirus: Holidays, pensions events, jobs: what it means for you, Money, 7 March). Really? Cleaners, bus drivers, factory workers, retail staff, nurses, care home staff, fire and rescue service staff, police? I could go on. Adam Rennie Edinburgh \u2022 I wonder if Albert Camus found inspiration for his novel La Peste (Doom-laden plague novels fly off shelves, 6 March) in the documented story of Eyam, the Derbyshire village whose inhabitants chose isolation and certain death during the Great Plague of 1665-66? Its moving history was the subject of a play by Don Taylor, The Roses of Eyam, that I first heard on Radio 4 some years ago. My own adjective for such narratives is Wyndhamesque. Nigel Linford Eastbourne, East Sussex \u2022 If the government now self-isolates in the new phase of coronavirus, will it fall to Dominic Cummings to arrange the masque for their entertainment, or perhaps more appropriately, should he only appear at the end? Ben Ashford Shrewsbury, Shropshire \u2022 It is just as well that Britain\u2019s reservoirs are all full at the moment, given the extra water that will be used as millions of households follow the government\u2019s advice to carry out repeated hand-washing rituals. As the water companies are so flush, perhaps they could be persuaded to grant customers a modest rebate off the next metered bill. How about it, Wessex Water (and others)? Hilary Veale Weymouth, Dorset \u2022 Guardian readers seeking a more appropriate tune to hum while washing their hands (Letters, 6 March) could do worse than to sing the first verse and chorus of Billy Bragg\u2019s version of the Internationale. Doing so allows ample time both for a thorough cleansing and to reflect on the congruence between the sentiments of the song, reminding us of our common humanity regardless of national borders, and the actions of the coronavirus, which equally shows such artificial boundaries complete disrespect. Martin Pennington Leicester \u2022 In our household we wash our hands to The Red Flag. Charles Fearnley Farnham, Surrey \u2022 The Guardian can publish as many articles as it likes about coronavirus (pages 1, 2, 6-15, 40-43, main section, and pages 1, 2, 3, 5, Journal, 7 March), but I\u2019m afraid that the general population will not take it seriously until it is mentioned in The Archers and somebody has to self-isolate or worse. By the way, is it safe to use Italian lemons in my marmalade? Richard Keal Houghton on the Hill, Leicestershire \u2022 The people who are panic-buying toilet roll (Report, 5 March) and hand sanitisers (Report, 7 March) have got it all wrong. They should be buying pizzas. Then they can keep safe when feeding family members who are self-isolating simply by sliding their food under the door. Philip Collier Bolton \u2022 We really will be up shit creek if a consequence of a toilet paper shortage is a parallel outbreak of norovirus facilitated by millions of suboptimally wiped bottoms. Stephen Benyunes London \u2022 I am stockpiling the Guardian just in case. Mike Lowcock Sandbach, Cheshire",

      "body": "<p>Slogans can win elections. But slogans won\u2019t cut it in government. Three months ago, Boris Johnson powered to a general election victory endlessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/boris-johnson-sets-out-plans-for-first-100-days-if-he-wins-election\" title=\"\">promising</a> to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and deliver on \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d. But this prime minister does not merely campaign in slogans. He tries to govern in them too. After last month\u2019s reshuffle, the first cabinet meeting began with a demeaning to-and-fro exchange about the hospitals, police officers and nurses the new ministers were pledged to deliver. Every week, Mr Johnson breezes through prime minister\u2019s questions with a similarly vacuous recitation. Having taken Britain out of the European Union (although this is emphatically not the same as getting Brexit done), Mr Johnson now tries to give the impression that restoring Britain\u2019s public services also requires nothing more than a quick collective chant by him and his ministerial courtiers.</p> <p>Democratic politics deserves better than this. Fortunately, events are starting to force Mr Johnson\u2019s hand. The onward spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus clearly demands a different level of national leadership from the facetious version that the prime ministers has offered so far.

      "bodyText": "Slogans can win elections. But slogans won\u2019t cut it in government. Three months ago, Boris Johnson powered to a general election victory endlessly promising to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and deliver on \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d. But this prime minister does not merely campaign in slogans. He tries to govern in them too. After last month\u2019s reshuffle, the first cabinet meeting began with a demeaning to-and-fro exchange about the hospitals, police officers and nurses the new ministers were pledged to deliver. Every week, Mr Johnson breezes through prime minister\u2019s questions with a similarly vacuous recitation. Having taken Britain out of the European Union (although this is emphatically not the same as getting Brexit done), Mr Johnson now tries to give the impression that restoring Britain\u2019s public services also requires nothing more than a quick collective chant by him and his ministerial courtiers. Democratic politics deserves better than this. Fortunately, events are starting to force Mr Johnson\u2019s hand. The onward spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus clearly demands a different level of national leadership from the facetious version that the prime ministers has offered so far. The continuing impact of the winter floods, which found Mr Johnson wanting, presents a similarly long-term challenge for the government across the stricken regions of Britain. Next month, he may also face a more effective opposition leader than Jeremy Corbyn can ever manage to be in his lame duck phase. Most importantly of all, there is Wednesday\u2019s budget. The budget marks the moment when the government must make \u2013 and be judged on \u2013 some intelligent strategic choices about its priorities, spending levels, borrowing and taxation policies.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor is under pressure from industry groups to resist the temptation to fund coronavirus spending with tax hikes on business when he delivers the budget on Wednesday. The RAC said a majority of drivers wanted Rishi Sunak to freeze fuel duty for the 10th year following intense speculation that he plans to increase the duty on petrol and diesel by 2p a litre. A poll of 3,200 motorists indicated that 59% wants Sunak to reinvest 2p from every litre of petrol and diesel sold, while keeping duty at current levels. Twenty-six percent of respondents said they would like to see fuel duty reduced, while just 10% were in favour of an increase. Sunak is looking at ending the fuel duty freeze as the government looks to encourage motorists to switch to electric cars and other more sustainable transport. With new car sales significantly lower than just a year ago and many drivers switching to electric vehicles, the Treasury faces the prospect of falling revenues unless it increases the duty quickly. The Treasury fears a tax hike could be met by street protests in the same vein as the gilets jaunes riots in France last year, which were triggered by increases in fuel duty. But strategists in No10 believe this would be unlikely in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. RAC head of policy, Nicholas Lyes, said: \u201cThe chancellor might be interested to discover that more than twice the proportion of drivers want to see it kept at its current level compared to those who want to see it cut. \u201cWe believe the only hope for getting the UK\u2019s local roads up to a standard fit for the 21st century is by ringfencing a small proportion of the tax drivers already have to pay every time they fill up.\u201d The demand comes as business lobby groups seek to prevent tax rises they say will reduce incentives for firms to expand and increase employment. The Federation of Small Businesses has warned the chancellor that a Tory manifesto commitment to scrap entrepreneurs tax relief, saving an estimated \u00a32.6bn, would harm the UK\u2019s reputation as a business-friendly economy. Rishi is know to be sympathetic to abolishing the tax break after it emerged it benefited just 5,200 people, most of them among the richest in Britain. Meanwhile, a group of MPs \u2013 including those on the all-party parliamentary wine and spirit group (APPG) \u2013 has written to the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, Kemi Badenoch, urging a cut to wine duty in the budget. Highlighting \u201cthe impact of unfair wine taxes\u201d on consumers, it says duty on wine has increased significantly more than on spirits and beer over recent years \u2013 by 12% since the scrapping of the duty escalator in 2014, compared with 2% for spirits and a decrease of 0.2% for beer. The UK has among the highest wine taxes in Europe: a flat rate of \u00a32.23 on a 75cl bottle of still, unfortified wine. The letter cites new analysis by the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA) and the campaign group Wine Drinkers UK, which predicts that the average price of a bottle of wine is expected to exceed \u00a36 in 2020 for the first time on record, in part due to duty increases. Data from Kantar shows the price rise risks alienating 9.7 million \u2018budget\u2019 wine shoppers \u2013 more than half of those who buy the tipple \u2013 who say they don\u2019t buy wine priced over \u00a36.",

      "body": "<p>Wigan returned to the top of Super League and underlined their early-season position as the team to beat, although they were given a stern test by an injury-hit, resilient Hull KR side. Two tries for the Man of Steel, Jackson Hastings, were among the five Wigan scored to see off the Robins but this was far from a straightforward afternoon\u2019s work for the Warriors.</p> <p>Hull KR were without eight first-team regulars and several other key players were injured as the afternoon went on.</p> <p>It was much to the visitors\u2019 credit that the Super League leaders never really looked comfortable until well into the final quarter.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the important games to win over the course of a season,\u201d said the Wigan coach, Adrian Lam, after watching his side register their fifth win of the season.</p> <p>It took them until May in his first season in charge last year to reach that mark, underlining the transformation in fortunesunder his tenure.</p> <p>This victory swung on a number of pivotal moments. With the game finely poised at 12-12 in the minutes before half-time, a superb break from Bevan French led to a magnificent try finished by Hastings.

      "bodyText": "Wigan returned to the top of Super League and underlined their early-season position as the team to beat, although they were given a stern test by an injury-hit, resilient Hull KR side. Two tries for the Man of Steel, Jackson Hastings, were among the five Wigan scored to see off the Robins but this was far from a straightforward afternoon\u2019s work for the Warriors. Hull KR were without eight first-team regulars and several other key players were injured as the afternoon went on. It was much to the visitors\u2019 credit that the Super League leaders never really looked comfortable until well into the final quarter. \u201cThese are the important games to win over the course of a season,\u201d said the Wigan coach, Adrian Lam, after watching his side register their fifth win of the season. It took them until May in his first season in charge last year to reach that mark, underlining the transformation in fortunesunder his tenure. This victory swung on a number of pivotal moments. With the game finely poised at 12-12 in the minutes before half-time, a superb break from Bevan French led to a magnificent try finished by Hastings. From there Wigan led for the remainder of the game, despite stubborn resistance from their opponents. The quality from the likes of Hastings and French at crucial junctures was decisive. Earlier tries from Hastings and Liam Farrell had levelled the game after Ethan Ryan and Greg Minikin claimed deserved scores for the visitors. Injuries, however, contributed to Hull KR\u2019s second-half downfall. \u201cWe had one fit player left on the bench for the final 30 minutes,\u201d said Tony Smith, whose side remain in the early-season battle at the bottom. \u201cI can\u2019t question my players\u2019 effort though; we bent our backs and held our own against a very good team for large periods.\u201d Lam rightly pointed out that this was a game Wigan may have lost last year, and when Ryan Brierley reduced their lead to just two an upset seemed plausible. However, with Will Maher and Joe Keyes leaving the field due to injuries, the Robins\u2019 gameplan, and their resistance, unravelled. Tries from Sam Powell and Liam Marshall either side of the hour mark \u2013 both converted by Zak Hardaker \u2013 opened up a three-score lead and, in the end, this was always going to be enough to see off the Robins\u2019 spirited threat.",

Shelves across the country have been stripped of such goods after Public Health England urged members of the public to \u201cplan ahead\u201d in case they had to self-isolate for a couple of weeks. However, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has said there is \u201cabsolutely no reason\u201d for the British public to panic-buy. Tesco has almost sold out of its own-brand dried pasta and tinned tomatoes online and has now limited many high-demand items to five per shopper.

Ocado, the online supermarket, was rationing toilet rolls on Sunday evening, with customers able to buy a maximum of two 12-roll packs of Andrex. Commenting on reports of people panic-buying, Boris Johnson said on Sunday: \u201cWe\u2019ve had no advice from the scientific advisers or medical officers that there\u2019s any need for people to buy stuff in.\u201d As of 10pm on Sunday, 278 people in the UK had been diagnosed with Covid-19, an increase of 69 from the 209 cases confirmed on Saturday. It represents the largest day-on-day increase in diagnoses. On Sunday evening it was announced a third patient had died in the UK of coronavirus. Coronavirus concerns appear to have created an international rush for toilet paper.

The New Departures Quartet, a jazz group formed to improvise with Horovitz and Brown, emerged in 1961 with Morgan on drums, Wellins on tenor sax, Tracey on piano and Jeff Clyne on bass. Morgan joined the new National Theatre in 1964 as a resident percussionist and eventually became assistant musical director, staying until 1976 and working on productions by directors such as Laurence Olivier and Franco Zeffirelli. In the 80s he taught music in north London schools and began his long trio partnership with Quail and Goode, which extended beyond Dingwalls to the Stapleton Tavern in Finsbury Park and the King\u2019s Head in Crouch End. In the 80s he rented a bowling club pavilion in Crouch End for a Sunday afternoon residency that evolved into summertime mini-festivals on the lawns, attracting musicians of all generations and persuasions. He continued playing and hosting gigs until 2012, when he and Betty retired to Sussex. In 2013, Gearbox Records reissued a live 1962 New Departures concert featuring Morgan (Blues for the Hitchhiking Dead), with liner notes by Horovitz and Brown. Early recordings with Dankworth, Alan Dean\u2019s Beboppers and others are preserved in archive material on the Jasmine and Proper Records labels. He is survived by Betty, their sons, Simon and Paul, and daughter, Dinah. \u2022 Lawrence Morgan, musician, born 4 September 1926; died 5 February 2020",

We also have a wealth tax, nuanced different from hers but the same principle at a time of massive income and wealth inequality.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reached out, we\u2019re looking and asking for the support of Senator Warren\u2019s supporters, and hope they come onboard.\u201d</p> <p>The Vermont senator, 78, also picked up one notable endorsement on Sunday, that of Jesse Jackson, the veteran civil rights leader who won the Michigan caucuses in his unsuccessful 1988 run at the Democratic presidential nomination.</p> <p>\u201cA people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path,\u201d Jackson said in a statement. \u201cThe most progressive social and economic path gives us the best chance to catch up and Bernie Sanders represents the most progressive path.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders, who raced to an early lead in the Democratic nomination process with successes in Nevada and New Hampshire, but fell behind last week in Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/03/joe-biden-super-tuesday-victory-democratic-primary\">extraordinary Super Tuesday comeback</a>, cannot afford to lose more ground this Tuesday when primary voters in the delegate-rich midwestern states of Michigan and Missouri, plus Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota and Washington go to the polls.</p> <p>On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press<em> </em>on Sunday, Sanders addressed concerns expressed by Warren two days ago over \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/06/warren-sanders-maddow-bullying/\">online bullying and organized nastiness</a>\u201d by his supporters, but did not directly answer if he thought Warren was holding back her support because of it.</p> <p>\u201cI am concerned about the kind of ugliness that exists on the internet and the Twitter world in general, it is very ugly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I will not deny for a second that we have some people who claim to be supporters, although I have a hard time understanding why they think they can support me and make vicious personal attacks against people. That\u2019s not what our campaign is about.\u201d</p> <p>Asked by host Chuck Todd if he thought he could win the nomination without Warren\u2019s support, Sanders replied: \u201cOf course we can. We can win this because we are going to win the support of working people all over this country.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders had two rallies planned on Sunday in Michigan, the rust belt state he won narrowly from Hillary Clinton in a 2016 Democratic primary upset, but in which he trails Biden by almost nine points in <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/michigan/\">FiveThirtyEight\u2019s latest polling</a>.</p> <p>With an eye to securing the support of working class voters, Sanders attacked Biden\u2019s policies and voting record on trade. \u201cIn Michigan the people here have been devastated, in Flint, in Detroit, by these disastrous trade agreements that Joe Biden voted for,\u201d he said on CNN, referring to the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement and deals with China, which he said cost millions of American jobs.</p> <p>He also criticized Biden for supporting the Wall Street bailout, and said the vice-president had overplayed his role in the Obama-era $80bn rescue package for the struggling American auto industry that kept production plants open in Michigan and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWell the auto bailout was done by the Obama administration and it was a step forward, but I sometimes think Joe is taking credit as vice-president for initiatives that were led by President Obama and by many members of Congress,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf Joe is the candidate, believe me, Trump will and has already talked about Joe\u2019s record on trade. We have a voting record that speaks to the needs of working families. If you\u2019re going into the industrial base of the United States of America, the heartland of America, and you voted for agreements that have devastated communities like Flint and Detroit it\u2019s hard to make [a] case when Trump has made trade such an important part of his agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders did, however, pledge his support to Biden if he won the nomination. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything possible to defeat Trump. I\u2019ll support Joe if he wins, he\u2019ll support me if I win,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Biden, 77, was planning to appear at rallies in Grand Rapids and Detroit on Monday to help secure the majority of the Michigan\u2019s 125 delegates to the Democratic national convention in July that will determine the nominee. Nationally, he leads Sanders 664-573 in delegates pledged so far, with 1,991 needed to win outright.</p> <p>The two will go head to head on 15 March in Arizona in their first televised debate since Warren\u2019s withdrawal made it a two-person race.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders made a pitch for the backing of Elizabeth Warren and her supporters on Sunday in an attempt to reverse his rival Joe Biden\u2019s surging momentum towards the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination. In a series of appearances on political talk shows two days before crucial primary votes in Michigan, Missouri and four other key states, Sanders highlighted the alignment of his progressive policies on a range of issues to those of the liberal Massachusetts senator, who dropped out of the race on Thursday and who has yet to announce an endorsement. His move came on the same day as another former rival, the California senator Kamala Harris, announced that she was backing Biden to win the nomination and beat Donald Trump in November, adding to other candidates who have dropped from the race and swung their support to the former vice-president, including Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Mike Bloomberg. \u201cWe would love to have Senator Warren\u2019s support, we would love to have the millions of people who supported Senator Warren,\u201d Sanders said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cSenator Warren talked about a wealth tax, something I think is enormously important. We also have a wealth tax, nuanced different from hers but the same principle at a time of massive income and wealth inequality. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached out, we\u2019re looking and asking for the support of Senator Warren\u2019s supporters, and hope they come onboard.\u201d The Vermont senator, 78, also picked up one notable endorsement on Sunday, that of Jesse Jackson, the veteran civil rights leader who won the Michigan caucuses in his unsuccessful 1988 run at the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cA people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path,\u201d Jackson said in a statement. \u201cThe most progressive social and economic path gives us the best chance to catch up and Bernie Sanders represents the most progressive path.\u201d Sanders, who raced to an early lead in the Democratic nomination process with successes in Nevada and New Hampshire, but fell behind last week in Biden\u2019s extraordinary Super Tuesday comeback, cannot afford to lose more ground this Tuesday when primary voters in the delegate-rich midwestern states of Michigan and Missouri, plus Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota and Washington go to the polls. On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, Sanders addressed concerns expressed by Warren two days ago over \u201conline bullying and organized nastiness\u201d by his supporters, but did not directly answer if he thought Warren was holding back her support because of it. \u201cI am concerned about the kind of ugliness that exists on the internet and the Twitter world in general, it is very ugly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will not deny for a second that we have some people who claim to be supporters, although I have a hard time understanding why they think they can support me and make vicious personal attacks against people. That\u2019s not what our campaign is about.\u201d Asked by host Chuck Todd if he thought he could win the nomination without Warren\u2019s support, Sanders replied: \u201cOf course we can. We can win this because we are going to win the support of working people all over this country.\u201d Sanders had two rallies planned on Sunday in Michigan, the rust belt state he won narrowly from Hillary Clinton in a 2016 Democratic primary upset, but in which he trails Biden by almost nine points in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s latest polling. With an eye to securing the support of working class voters, Sanders attacked Biden\u2019s policies and voting record on trade. \u201cIn Michigan the people here have been devastated, in Flint, in Detroit, by these disastrous trade agreements that Joe Biden voted for,\u201d he said on CNN, referring to the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement and deals with China, which he said cost millions of American jobs. He also criticized Biden for supporting the Wall Street bailout, and said the vice-president had overplayed his role in the Obama-era $80bn rescue package for the struggling American auto industry that kept production plants open in Michigan and elsewhere. \u201cWell the auto bailout was done by the Obama administration and it was a step forward, but I sometimes think Joe is taking credit as vice-president for initiatives that were led by President Obama and by many members of Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Joe is the candidate, believe me, Trump will and has already talked about Joe\u2019s record on trade. We have a voting record that speaks to the needs of working families. If you\u2019re going into the industrial base of the United States of America, the heartland of America, and you voted for agreements that have devastated communities like Flint and Detroit it\u2019s hard to make [a] case when Trump has made trade such an important part of his agenda.\u201d Sanders did, however, pledge his support to Biden if he won the nomination. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything possible to defeat Trump. I\u2019ll support Joe if he wins, he\u2019ll support me if I win,\u201d he said. Biden, 77, was planning to appear at rallies in Grand Rapids and Detroit on Monday to help secure the majority of the Michigan\u2019s 125 delegates to the Democratic national convention in July that will determine the nominee. Nationally, he leads Sanders 664-573 in delegates pledged so far, with 1,991 needed to win outright. The two will go head to head on 15 March in Arizona in their first televised debate since Warren\u2019s withdrawal made it a two-person race.",

The prime minister arrived on the banks of the River Severn in Bewdley on Sunday afternoon, and was taken to view flood defences by Environment Agency staff. However, some members of the public heckled Johnson in fury that he has stayed away from the affected areas until now \u2013 instead spending the half-term break in one of the government\u2019s grace-and-favour mansions in Kent. Johnson told residents he would \u201cget Bewdley done\u201d and said he was \u201cso sorry to hear it\u201d when he was told that some homes had been overwhelmed by as much as 2ft of water. He later tweeted a video of him surrounded by well-wishers and those who wanted selfies. As he walked around the town, many asked to shake his hand and shouted friendly greetings, but one person heckled him with \u201cdo your fucking job\u201d. After speaking to the Environment Agency officials, he said they discussed \u201cwhat permanent defences can we put in and what\u2019s the business case\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we are doubling the funding for flood defences to \u00a35.2bn, and we\u2019re also going to be looking at all the things we can do upstream.\u201d The extra money for flood defences is due to be announced at Wednesday\u2019s budget by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor.

However, Johnson\u2019s reluctance to visit flood-hit areas himself has led to criticism from Labour that he is a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d. Last week, the prime minister claimed he had been advised to stay away by emergency services in case he got in the way. Speaking to ITV\u2019s This Morning, he said: \u201cThey [the emergency services] said to us: \u2018All you\u2019ll do is distract us and disrupt the business of helping people with the immediate crisis.\u2019 So what I was doing was directing operations \u2026 Obviously, I\u2019m working around the clock on various things, as indeed is the government.\u201d Critics have pointed out that he found time to visit flooded areas of the north of England during the election campaign when he was seeking votes.",

      "bodyText": "Women\u2019s safety advocates have accused the Morrison government of ignoring the advice of experts when it comes to protecting women and children from domestic and family violence, instead \u201cre-announcing\u201d an already controversial scheme. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, used International Women\u2019s Day to announce the government would put $20m into a no-interest loan scheme, which provides loans of up to $2,000 to people fleeing violent situations. The microloans were part of a package announced by the then families minister Paul Fletcher and former minister for women Kelly O\u2019Dwyer in 2018, but faced criticism from advocates concerned about the ongoing costs for vulnerable women as they attempt to rebuild their life already behind financially. Hayley Foster, the chief executive officer of Women\u2019s Safety NSW, said the government had failed to commit to \u201cany serious action in addressing domestic violence across the nation\u201d. \u201cThis $20m could be going directly into the specialist frontline domestic violence services which support women and children to escape and recover from violence,\u201d Foster told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut instead, it\u2019s being funnelled to a separate agency that women would have to negotiate with and be case managed by in order to access the funds and then repay them. \u201cWith respect, whoever has developed this policy has not consulted with, or thought about the actual experience of women escaping domestic violence and the services whose job it is to support them through this process.\u201d Foster said advocates were not consulted over the funds, and their advice on where money needed to be directed was ignored. \u201cWhat is really inexcusable is that we have a national body set up to advise the Council of Australian Governments on reducing violence against women and their children under the National Plan \u2013 the Australian Women Against Violence Alliance [AWAVA], and the federal government has spent this $20m on this initiative without even going through this advisory body,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the point of a national advisory body made up of women\u2019s safety experts from across the nation if the government is going to just dismiss, ignore and bypass it? \u201cWe know that in order to address this enormous social problem of men\u2019s violence against women and children in our society, we are going to have to be very smart about how we use our resources. Bypassing the expert body in the making of these decisions is therefore not just disrespectful, it\u2019s also irresponsible.\u201d Women in Australia are nearly three times as men to experience violence from an intimate partner, while one woman a week, on average, is killed by her current or former partner. After the shocking murder of Hannah Clarke and her three children, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said all levels of government and the legal system needed to reflect on how the family was failed. \u201cI believe state, territory and national governments, all of us, and our agencies and importantly the judiciary, we must all reflect again on these terrible murders,\u201d he told parliament last month. \u201cWe must reflect on how and where the system failed Hannah and her children, as it has failed so many others. It is so frustrating. It\u2019s so devastating.\u201d The issue was raised at the Council of Australian Governments\u2019 meeting, where women\u2019s safety ministers once again met to discuss changes that could be made to the system. Experts have repeatedly called for increased funding to services and for those affected to have access to financial help that will not cost them down the track, as well as more counselling, accommodation and a more coordinated national response. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, repeated his calls for a national summit on domestic and family violence on Sunday. \u201cWe need to make sure that there\u2019s a comprehensive plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does require finance. But it also requires listening to the experts.\u201d Ruston told Sky News on Sunday that while governments were working to address the scourge of violence against women, the community also needed to step up. \u201cWe should be ashamed of ourselves in Australia that we have the kind of domestic violence perpetration that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut until we can convince everybody in Australia that they have a role to play in stamping out domestic violence \u2013 that\u2019s not just the federal government or state and territory governments, it\u2019s the community, it\u2019s individuals and really encourage men particularly as role models to start stepping up to the plate. \u201cAnd if you see something that you think is disrespectful behaviour towards women then actually go and call it out for what it is.

He has been electric in the opening stages here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54aa709cd4e6901e3e842f329e8d65eec2554c90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54aa709cd4e6901e3e842f329e8d65eec2554c90/0_0_5169_3313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willian charging forward.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willian charging forward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T14:36:08.419Z\">at 2.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e65006c8f087df56e4c4856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T14:27:19.579Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Calvert-Lewin fluffs his lines!

As for Everton, three changes from their 1-1 draw with Manchester United, with Lucas Digne, Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and Bernard back in Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s starting XI. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e64e9ec8f085f0b8d94461b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T13:02:35.370Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The teams!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Chelsea (4-3-3): </strong>Kepa; Azpilicueta, R\u00fcdiger, Zouma, Alonso; Barkley, Gilmour, Mount; Willian, Giroud, Pedro</p> <p><em>Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Tomori, James, Broja, Anjorin, Batshuayi</em></p> <p><strong>Everton (4-4-2): </strong>Pickford; Sidib\u00e9, Holgate, Keane, Digne; Sigurdsson, Gomes, Davies, Bernard; Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison</p> <p><em>Subs: Stekelenburg, Baines, Mina, Iwobi, Walcott, Kean, Gordon</em></p> <p><em>Referee: Kevin Friend</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T13:08:46.747Z\">at 1.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e64d4828f087df56e4c470a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T12:47:29.407Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome to the Carlo Ancelotti/Ross Barkley derby, though it is Billy Gilmour who graces the front cover of the Chelsea programme.

      "bodyText": "Read Jacob Steinberg\u2019s match report: Now, do join Simon Burnton for the Manchester derby: Some Chelsea reaction from Billy Gilmour, who was ruddy brilliant in midfield on his league debut. \u201cIt was amazing, a dream come true to make my full debut in the Premier League on my debut. I found out I was playing this morning in the team meeting.\u201d Giroud adds: \u201cHe\u2019s done very well again today, he\u2019s got a great maturity and he\u2019s got a nice future in front of him if he stays like that.\u201d After making so many positive strides in recent weeks, this afternoon Everton were absolutely atrocious from start to finish. In the end the scoreline almost flattered Everton, but try telling that to Carlo Ancelotti, who has just suffered his joint-heaviest league defeat as a manager, with this equalling a 4-0 defeat against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as Real Madrid manager in February 2015. Kevin Friend finally puts Everton out of their misery. A resounding victory for Chelsea, with Mount, Pedro, Willian and then Giroud on the scoresheet. Ross Barkley was brilliant against his former club, while Billy Gilmour again belied his years with a masterful, mature performance in midfield. The 18-year-old oozes class. Chelsea remain fourth, within a point of third-placed Leicester. 90+2 min: ... Michael Keane heads clear Reece James\u2019s free-kick. 90+1 min: Holgate is booked for something of a reducer on the teenage substitute Broja. Chelsea get another opportunity to whip the ball into the box ... 90 min: There will be three added minutes. Chelsea are knocking the ball around for fun, the home crowd very much lapping it up. Everton? Not so much. 88 min: Chelsea are coasting. 86 min: Olivier Giroud is withdrawn to a standing ovation and receives a warm embrace from his manager, Frank Lampard. On in Giroud\u2019s place is the 18-year-old forward Armando Broja, who enters for his Premier League debut. 84 min: Pickford, who has been horribly exposed by some dreadful Everton defending, pulls off another save, this time to prevent C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta from getting in on the act. Again, it was Barkley at the heart of things, with the midfielder stroking the ball across to the Chelsea skipper, who arrowed a shot towards a crevice of Pickford\u2019s goal. But the Everton goalkeeper was alert and pushed the ball to safety. Pickford\u2019s goal has been peppered. 81 min: Chelsea should have added a fifth, but Djibril Sidib\u00e9 intervenes in the nick of time, just as Tino Anjorin was about to pull the trigger. Anjorin was slid in by the brilliant Billy Gilmour, who has been masterful in midfield. Anjorin is clean through on goal but dallied a little and that allowed the Everton defender to steal in. Gilmour had easily brushed a tired Andr\u00e9 Gomes aside. 78 min: Kepa smothers after Everton break! Reece James superbly blocks Richarlison\u2019s effort after the ball dropped in the 18-yard box. The ball cannoned to Djibril Sidib\u00e9, who played a marvellous through ball into Walcott. The Everton substitute delivered a low cross into the six-yard box but the Chelsea goalkeeper was on hand to gobble it up and take the sting out of a rare attack. 76 min: Dominic Calvert-Lewin is replaced by 19-year-old Everton academy graduate Anthony Gordon. Calvert-Lewin, like the rest of the Everton side, has had an off day. 72 min: Anjorin wellies one into Row L with his first touch! 71 min: Willian is withdrawn after a decent day\u2019s work; Willian has been directly involved in 10 goals in the Premier League this season (five goals and five assists);, one more than he managed in the whole of last season in the competition. The 18-year-old Tino Anjorin, wearing the No 55, is on for his league debut. 68 min: Everton supporters jeered Ross Barkley\u2019s every breath at the start of this mismatch, but the Chelsea midfielder has certainly had the last laugh, weighing in with two assists, and he almost helped himself to a goal a moment ago, firing a low drive at Pickford from an acute angle. Barkley, Gilmour and Mount, who has since departed as a precaution, have won the midfield battle 10 times over, totally nullifying Sigurdsson and co. 65 min: Sigurdsson flashes in a cross , Kepa flaps it and it drops in the six-yard box ... but the assistant referee flags to indicate the ball had gone out of play; replays show the ball flickered out of play. Indeed, so Chelsea launch the subsequent goal-kick upfield. 62 min: Barkley slips in Gilmour, who darts into a pocket of space unmarked. He tries to pick out Pedro, but Everton clear the ball for a corner. R\u00fcdiger meets it but his header canons into Giroud. 59 min: Mount is withdrawn after picking up a knock at the start of this second half. He gets a hearty reception, walking off untroubled to be replaced by wing-back Reece James. 58 min: Kean replaced Tom Davies a moment ago. 57 min: Pickford denies Pedro! Willian rushes towards the byline, cuts the ball back for Barkley \u2013 who appears to be fouled in the box by Sidib\u00e9 \u2013 but it runs kindly for the winger. Pedro lets fly and Pickford requires two hands to palm the ball beyond his right post. It\u2019s a case of damage limitation for Everton at present. 56 min: Doesn\u2019t look like Walcott\u2019s introduction nor Ancelotti\u2019s half-time team-talk has had the desired effect. Meanwhile, a bit of housekeeping: Andr\u00e9 Gomes picked up a booking a moment ago for dissent. Ancelotti is readying another change, with 20-year-old Moise Kean stripped and ready for action. Chelsea are having a field day. Giroud applies the finishing touch after eluding Holgate and Sigurdsson at the back post. It stemmed from a well-worked corner, with Willian playing a simple give-and-go with Gilmour. When Willian received possession back, he whipped in a first-time cross towards Giroud, who did the rest. 53 min: Pedro scoops over after good work by Giroud! A rocket from distance by Willian. Barkley nudges the ball across to the Brazilian, who is beckoned to shoot by Digne and Holgate, neither of whom charge him down. Invited to take aim, Willian wellies it into the bottom corner from 20 yards. 47 min: A touch of class from Mason Mount, who toys with Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and Tom Davies before coolly laying the ball off. Mount jinked past the latter with ease. Everton are seeing a bit more of the ball but, other than that, Chelsea are still very much in pole position. Walcott is yet to have a whiff. 46 min: Theo Walcott replaces Bernard at the break. Goals by Mason Mount and Pedro give a commanding Chelsea a deserved lead. Everton have been very accommodating, lukewarm at best. Food for thought for Ancelotti but Frank Lampard will be delighted by his team\u2019s bossy performance. Billy Gilmour, Ross Barkley and Mount have been running midfield. \u201cSomething I\u2019m noticing about Gilmour is that he drops so deep to get the ball,\u201d emails Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cThe de Jong-esque dynamism of that movement seems to be dragging one Everton midfielder forward and out of position, thus leaving Mount and Barkley to team up on the remaining one to dominate and link play through the midfield. There\u2019s a lot of promising balance in that midfield ... although Everton have, as you\u2019ve said, made it awfully easy for them.\u201d 45 min: There will be one added minute for Everton to endure. 44 min: Right on cue, Willian gifts the ball to Calvert-Lewin, leading to a sea of groans around Stamford Bridge, but Chelsea survive. Willian quickly raises his right hand to apologise. He knows he almost landed his team in the muck. 41 min: Sidib\u00e9 is not having his best game in an Everton shirt. Giroud wins a header to flick the ball on, allowing Willian to pile pressure on the Everton defender. Sidib\u00e9 seems to have the upper hand but then the Brazilian gets across the right-back to make life difficult, blocking his pass upfield. Clever play by Giroud and fine defensive work by Willian, who normally wreaks havoc in the opposite direction. Ancelotti and co just want half-time now. 39 min: ... Everton clear their lines, but from the subsequent goal-kick Andr\u00e9 Gomes gets off the hook after dawdling on the ball 25 yards from his own goal. Giroud was sniffing around and the striker nicked possession from the Everton midfielder, but the referee Kevin Friend deemed his challenge a little overzealous. That sums up Everton\u2019s toils this half, in truth. 37 min: Pedro crosses for Giroud, but the striker ends up on the turf, adamant that Mason Holgate hauled him to the floor. It looked a little clumsy by the Everton defender, who was at play with the dark arts. Moments before that, Giroud had a tame shot saved by Pickford. Everton have been dire, and now they have a corner to defend after Holgate clears Pedro\u2019s cross from the left ... 34 min: Moments before Chelsea wasted that free-kick, Ancelotti pulled Tom Davies over for a quick word. The Italian seemed to be signalling for a change of system. To say Everton have been overrun in midfield would be an understatement. Gilmour, Barkley and Mount have been finding acres of space. Something has to change \u2013 and fast \u2013 for the visitors. 32 min: Sidib\u00e9 gives away a cheap free-kick after a clumsy foul on Pedro. Mount has a chance to swing it in from the left flank, 25 yards out ... but it is too high, too deep and Pickford gathers. 30 min: \u201cThis is an enjoyable start to the game,\u201d says Lee Madden, via email. \u201cChelsea\u2019s central midfield is relatively inexperienced but bring a lot of intensity and attacking mindset to compliment the experience up front. That said, it looks like Chelsea\u2019s front three today won\u2019t be here next season, which gives the whole team a very much \u2018work in progress\u2019 feel.\u201d Keep them coming ... 28 min: Back to Willian for a moment. The Chelsea winger is in a bit of a contract stand-off with his club, who are reluctant to offer the Brazilian any kind of lengthy deal at this stage of his career. But the way the 31-year-old sped past Holgate a little earlier suggests Willian, for now at least, still very much possesses that lightning pace. He has been electric in the opening stages here. 26 min: Calvert-Lewin fluffs his lines! Richarlison pickpockets Zouma, who foolishly tries to dribble upfield. Zouma gets caught out on halfway and Richarlison drives forward before laying the ball on for Calvert-Lewin. The striker bears down on Kepa but scoops it painfully wide; he got his angles all wrong. Everton pass up a golden goalscoring opportunity at Stamford Bridge. 24 min: Ancelotti has put the hood up on his raincoat but he could do with a blindfold; Everton have been atrocious. Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin anonymous. Barkley is running midfield. Pedro rattles in another \u2013 and it\u2019s another brilliant Chelsea move. Gilmour springs a pass into Giroud, who nudges the ball into Barkley\u2019s path. Barkley then slides a wonderfully weighted first-time pass in behind Keane and Sidib\u00e9 for Pedro to latch on to. The finish was effortless. Everton are all over the shop. 19 min: Pickford denies Willian! Barkley releases the Brazilian into the right channel, where Willian has a ponderous Mason Holgate on toast. Willian arrows his shot across goal but Pickford gets a strong hand to it. Barkley gathered an aimless header by Michael Keane and effortlessly lifted the ball into Willian\u2019s path. And the Chelsea winger did well to test Pickford from such a tight angle. 18 min: That\u2019s Mount\u2019s first goal since December. It had been coming. A wonderful drilled finish to round off a beautiful Chelsea move. Billy Gilmour rolls the ball into Mount on halfway, Mount drives forward with it before spraying it wide to Pedro, who cuts inside Djibril Sidib\u00e9 before handing back possession to Mount. Then Mount instinctively swivels and drives the ball home, with his low strike squeezing just inside Pickford\u2019s right post. On the touchline, Ancelotti has his hands in his pockets. Everton have been sluggish at best, carved open far too easily. 11 min: Calvert-Lewin fouls Antonio R\u00fcdiger on halfway. Mount wallops it towards the back post, where R\u00fcdiger is lurking, but the move breaks down. Everton get a chance to compose themselves. 9 min: Pedro has a go at goal, but it\u2019s tame and Keane snuffs it out. Everton are yet to really get going, with Chelsea very much in the ascendency. Now, for some more Giroud talk. \u201cI have always been a Giroud sceptic,\u201d begins Mary Waltz. \u201cBut his response to demotion has been pitch perfect. No whiny leaks to the press, bided his time, quality performance when given a chance. Class act.\u201d 7 min: Pickford superbly denies Mount! Giroud nods the ball into the path of Willian, who gallops towards the byline before supplying a neat cross for the onrushing Mason Mount. The Chelsea midfielder gets plenty of power on his strike \u2013 but Pickford gets his body behind it and keeps it out. Nice move. 5 min: Keane\u2019s flailing arm inadvertently catches Giroud and the Chelsea man is briefly grounded, but he\u2019s fine to carry on. On the subject of Giroud, Charles Littleton declares his love for the striker. \u201cYes, I am a proud supporter of the Giroud fan club AND I am a Gunner no less,\u201d he emails. \u201cWhen he was with us, he always seemed to be popping up with last minute goals that salvaged games \u2013 we drew 3-3 with Bournemouth at the last minute thanks to him. I always thought he was underappreciated at Arsenal and then for some reason we sold him to our rivals, just when we were hitting the skids. I don\u2019t want to blame our present malaise just on that, though. Many, many other things to complain about.\u201d 2 min: Gilmour rolls the ball back to Kepa as Tom Davies lets the Chelsea teenager know he is on the beat. Willian then darts beyond Sigurdsson to the byline but Everton manage to shepherd away possession. Chelsea throw-in on the right flank. 1 min: Barkley takes hold of the ball on halfway and is immediately jeered by the travelling Everton supporters. Lovely stuff. Sigurdsson, in Everton\u2019s salmon strip, gets us under way at Stamford Bridge. Before kick-off, a warm embrace between Ancelotti and Lampard, who resisted the handshake. The Liquidator rings out as the teams trudge out on to the pitch ... A gentle reminder Ancelotti will be on the touchline: Believe it or not, it has taken almost 54 minutes for this afternoon\u2019s first mention of coronavirus. \u201cFor all the talk of preventing Covid-19 spreading, it\u2019s rather bemusing watching 40k cram into Stamford Bridge and 50k in Hamburg last night, while watching the Danish league play to empty stadiums,\u201d Kaspar Larsen says, getting in touch on Twitter. says. Do get in touch on Twitter or email. Anyone else a massive Olivier Giroud fan? The 33-year-old has started Chelsea\u2019s past four matches and, as much as injuries have afforded the Frenchman more game-time, he seems to Lampard\u2019s flavour of the month. \u201cI just spoke with the manager and I believed what he said, that I would get my chance and he has given me my chance. I have basically tried to give his confidence back on the pitch. My confidence is getting higher and higher because I am playing more games. I don\u2019t know how long Tammy [Abraham] will be out for. When he comes back, I will need him to be ready and then we can have a good competition again.\u201d Roy Keane, for one, has been waxing lyrical about Billy Gilmour: I was sitting at home with a cup of tea and a bit of chocolate in front of me and I didn\u2019t have the volume on. As the game started, I got out of my seat and I thought: \u2018Who is this kid in midfield?\u2019 He was fantastic, he looked like a world-class player. There are certain traits you want from a midfielder: quality on the ball, intelligence, composure \u2013 he had everything \u2013 it was one of the best performances I\u2019ve seen in a long, long time. The downside for the kid now is he\u2019s got to back it up. Everything he did throughout the game had quality written all over it. This is likely to turn into a bit of a Billy Gilmour love-in so, with that in mind, here\u2019s a wondrous stat, courtesy of Opta: Billy Gilmour is the first Scottish outfield player to start a Premier League match for Chelsea since Steve Clarke in May 1998, with that match taking place more than three years before Gilmour was born. As for Everton\u2019s revival under Carlo Ancelotti, things are looking pretty rosy; since the Italian\u2019s first game in charge on Boxing Day, only Liverpool (30) and Manchester City (19) have won more Premier League points than Everton. Lampard reckons former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti is in for a warm welcome, and, frankly, why wouldn\u2019t he? \u201cHe\u2019s very well respected in-house and by the fans,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe is a gentleman, a great man-manager. On a personal level, he\u2019s great at striking up relationships. He\u2019s good tactically and has a great manner. I keep in touch with him now and again.\u201d As expected, Billy Gilmour makes his first Premier League start. The Scottish teenager helped Chelsea dump Liverpool out of the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge in midweek and is rewarded for his performance with another outing. \u201cHis family were here for the game,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cKnowing Billy, even at a young age he\u2019s a very determined young lad, he\u2019s very smart. He\u2019ll understand it was a very good game for him but that the hard work starts now. I think he should quite rightly enjoy the moment, and I\u2019m delighted for him. But in terms of how I\u2019ve seen him around the place, it\u2019s the same attitude, training, ethics, quality; so all good.\u201d Team news news: so ... Kepa Arrizabalaga and Billy Gilmour stay put from the Chelsea starting lineup against Liverpool on Tuesday, with Willian also in from the off after passing a late fitness test. Armando Broja, an 18-year-old forward who joined Chelsea as an under-nine, is in a matchday squad in the Premier League for the first time, alongside another teenager, midfielder Tino Anjorin. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who continues to step up his return to fitness, and Christian Pulisic, are both absent despite Lampard hinting they could play a part. As for Everton, three changes from their 1-1 draw with Manchester United, with Lucas Digne, Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and Bernard back in Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s starting XI. Chelsea (4-3-3): Kepa; Azpilicueta, R\u00fcdiger, Zouma, Alonso; Barkley, Gilmour, Mount; Willian, Giroud, Pedro Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Tomori, James, Broja, Anjorin, Batshuayi Everton (4-4-2): Pickford; Sidib\u00e9, Holgate, Keane, Digne; Sigurdsson, Gomes, Davies, Bernard; Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison Subs: Stekelenburg, Baines, Mina, Iwobi, Walcott, Kean, Gordon Referee: Kevin Friend Welcome to the Carlo Ancelotti/Ross Barkley derby, though it is Billy Gilmour who graces the front cover of the Chelsea programme.

The whole of Lombardy, including the financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, have been shut down until 3 April as Italy grapples to contain the spread of a virus as deaths rose from 233 to 366, a rise of more than 50% in 24 hours, with the total number of cases so far at 7,375. Thousands crowded train stations or jumped into their cars after a draft decree banning people from leaving or entering the region was revealed by Corriere della Sera late on Saturday afternoon.

      "body": "<p>A 64-year-old who only took up rowing six years ago has become the oldest woman to row an ocean after crossing the Atlantic in 86 days. Sara Brewer achieved the feat alongside her rowing partner, Ann Prestidge, 35.</p> \n<p>The pair completed the Talisker Whisky Atlantic challenge on just two meals a day after running out of food. The race took them more than a fortnight longer than they had anticipated after they battled 20-metre (65ft) high waves, fought through numerous storms, suffered broken oars and injuries.</p> \n<p>The pair set off from La Gomera, the Canary Islands, on 12 December last year, rowing 3,000 miles (4,828km) to reach the shores of Antigua on 7 March \u2013 just in time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/08/international-womens-day\">International Women\u2019s Day</a>.</p> \n<p>They were the final crew to arrive successfully, a month and a half after the fastest crew, an all-male quartet.</p> \n<p>Until they set sail before Christmas, their longest previous rowing expedition had been just 150 miles long.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe never anticipated it would take us this long \u2013 we were hoping to finish in mid-February \u2013 so the extended row has been tough both mentally and physically,\u201d Brewer said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were rowing 1.5 hours each in rotation, 24 hours a day, seven days a week to finish before running out of food. For the past three weeks, we\u2019ve been surviving on two meals a day and next to no sleep. We\u2019re delighted to finally set foot on dry land.\u201d</p> \n<p>Brewer became obsessed with taking on the challenge after reading The Crossing, Ben Fogle and James Cracknell\u2019s book about rowing 3,000 miles across the Atlantic, and only picked up her oars six years ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would like to say that I finally decided to row the Atlantic Ocean after carefully considering at least some of the facts \u2013 including some of the obvious dangers and difficulties associated with such an endeavour \u2013 but that would not be strictly true, in fact it would not be true at all,\u201d she said <a href=\"http://www.rowoffthewall.com/thecrew/\">on her website</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat is true is that I read the opening pages of the Ben Fogle and James Cracknell book, The Crossing, and knew that I had to do it. It was an overwhelming compulsion that simply would not go away and I finally broached the subject with my husband, whose reaction is still seesawing between being proud and petrified for me \u2013 I am truly sorry, John, to put you through this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Their efforts have raised more than \u00a345,000 for the <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/\">Alzheimer\u2019s Society</a> and <a href=\"https://www.streetleague.co.uk/\">Street League</a>.</p> \n<p>Brewer, who is the personal assistant to the group chairman at HSBC Holdings, met Prestidge at the Poplar, Blackwall and District rowing club in London in 2013. Before rowing the Atlantic, the pair had only rowed a marathon, the Thames and one sea row around Hayling Island.</p> \n<p>The longest row they had ever done was still 2,850 miles short of the distance across the Atlantic.</p> \n<p>Brewer said people had been sceptical that she could finish the race, with some predicting it would take them \u201c60, maybe 70\u201d days.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you say: \u2018I\u2019m going to row the Atlantic,\u2019 some people say: \u2018That\u2019s nice, dear.\u2019 Some people say: \u2018You\u2019re mad.\u2019 And some people say: \u2018From where to where?\u2019\u201d </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.taliskerwhiskyatlanticchallenge.com/2019-race-entrants/\">Thirty-five crews</a> entered the race.

      "bodyText": "A 64-year-old who only took up rowing six years ago has become the oldest woman to row an ocean after crossing the Atlantic in 86 days. Sara Brewer achieved the feat alongside her rowing partner, Ann Prestidge, 35. The pair completed the Talisker Whisky Atlantic challenge on just two meals a day after running out of food. The race took them more than a fortnight longer than they had anticipated after they battled 20-metre (65ft) high waves, fought through numerous storms, suffered broken oars and injuries. The pair set off from La Gomera, the Canary Islands, on 12 December last year, rowing 3,000 miles (4,828km) to reach the shores of Antigua on 7 March \u2013 just in time for International Women\u2019s Day. They were the final crew to arrive successfully, a month and a half after the fastest crew, an all-male quartet. Until they set sail before Christmas, their longest previous rowing expedition had been just 150 miles long. \u201cWe never anticipated it would take us this long \u2013 we were hoping to finish in mid-February \u2013 so the extended row has been tough both mentally and physically,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cWe were rowing 1.5 hours each in rotation, 24 hours a day, seven days a week to finish before running out of food. For the past three weeks, we\u2019ve been surviving on two meals a day and next to no sleep. We\u2019re delighted to finally set foot on dry land.\u201d Brewer became obsessed with taking on the challenge after reading The Crossing, Ben Fogle and James Cracknell\u2019s book about rowing 3,000 miles across the Atlantic, and only picked up her oars six years ago. \u201cI would like to say that I finally decided to row the Atlantic Ocean after carefully considering at least some of the facts \u2013 including some of the obvious dangers and difficulties associated with such an endeavour \u2013 but that would not be strictly true, in fact it would not be true at all,\u201d she said on her website. \u201cWhat is true is that I read the opening pages of the Ben Fogle and James Cracknell book, The Crossing, and knew that I had to do it. It was an overwhelming compulsion that simply would not go away and I finally broached the subject with my husband, whose reaction is still seesawing between being proud and petrified for me \u2013 I am truly sorry, John, to put you through this.\u201d Their efforts have raised more than \u00a345,000 for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society and Street League. Brewer, who is the personal assistant to the group chairman at HSBC Holdings, met Prestidge at the Poplar, Blackwall and District rowing club in London in 2013. Before rowing the Atlantic, the pair had only rowed a marathon, the Thames and one sea row around Hayling Island. The longest row they had ever done was still 2,850 miles short of the distance across the Atlantic. Brewer said people had been sceptical that she could finish the race, with some predicting it would take them \u201c60, maybe 70\u201d days. \u201cWhen you say: \u2018I\u2019m going to row the Atlantic,\u2019 some people say: \u2018That\u2019s nice, dear.\u2019 Some people say: \u2018You\u2019re mad.\u2019 And some people say: \u2018From where to where?\u2019\u201d Thirty-five crews entered the race. A four-man team, Fortitude IV, won the 2019 edition, crossing in 32 days, 12 hours, and 35 minutes.",

Ask around the City, and it\u2019s difficult to find many people who have come across him. Those who have talk of a \u201cvery bright\u201d, \u201cpolite\u201d and considered financier who had little of the ego associated with that trade. \u201cHe is always very, very well turned out,\u201d said one, but few can give details of a City career that Sunak had left by his early 30s.</p> <p>Sunak is the eldest son of a Hindu family who immigrated from India (both sets of his grandparents with their children), and Sunak\u2019s parents went on to carve out professional careers: his father worked as a GP and his mother as a pharmacist, who acquired her own pharmacy business. Sunak showed an early interest in the mechanics of trade by doing her bookkeeping.</p> <p>Sunak went on to become head boy at Winchester College before going on to study philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Oxford University. But despite gaining a first in the traditional politician\u2019s degree, he rejected student politics and instead devoted his spare time to his fascination with money, becoming president of the Oxford University Investment Society, where members received talks from real-life bankers and competed in financial trading games.</p> <p>Almost inevitably, that led him to the Square Mile in 2001 and the most revered \u2013 some say hated \u2013 of investment banks, Goldman Sachs, effectively working as a graduate trainee for three years.</p> <p>Sunak left there to do an MBA at Stanford in the US, where he met his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of NR Narayana Murty, the billionaire founder of the global IT firm Infosys. Then it was back to the City, with Sunak moving into hedge funds by joining the Children\u2019s Investment (TCI) Fund, which proved a controversial choice.</p> <p>The fund, created by one of the City\u2019s best-known managers, Sir Christopher Hohn, is set up like many hedge funds, including basing its funds in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. But it is also regarded as an \u201cactivist\u201d investor, meaning it often tries to use its financial muscle to force companies to change their management or strategy.</p> <p>Most infamously, TCI launched a campaign against the Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, which resulted in its sale to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/21/royal-bank-of-scotland-a-timeline-of-events\">The deal loaded RBS with crippling debt and led to a \u00a345.5bn government bailout</a>. The Treasury says Sunak played no role in that deal, but as chancellor he is now ultimately responsible for managing the taxpayer holding in the bank.</p> <p>Sunak was directly involved in other activist campaigns, including a bitter one against the US rail freight group CSX, which ended up with TCI being criticised for its lack of disclosure about its interest in the firm, in a judgment that was then successfully appealed against. His time as a junior partner at the fund would have meant he was very well paid, although nowhere near the levels of more senior partners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"877cac99cb67b6a8b73a113b3e04e8f4d3029637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/877cac99cb67b6a8b73a113b3e04e8f4d3029637/0_46_632_379/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak\u2019s Georgian home in North Yorkshire.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s Georgian home in North Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: unknown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But around the time of the financial crisis, TCI split. Patrick Degorce, a co-founder with Hohn, left to start his own fund called Th\u00e9l\u00e8me Partners, taking Sunak with him to work in America, where he <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1511881/000091957412001349/0000919574-12-001349.txt\">invested in companies including News Corp</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1511881/000091957411003359/0000919574-11-003359.txt\">US hospital group Community Health Systems</a>.</p> <p>Like Hohn, Degorce proved to be a controversial boss. In 2013 he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/01/hedge-fund-boss-tax-ruling\">forced to part with millions of pounds in tax</a> after a ruling concerning a personal investment in a complex film financing scheme, which sought to shelter earnings of almost \u00a319m. The Treasury minister at the time, David Gauke, said the structure was a \u201cdubious avoidance scheme\u201d.</p> <p>Still, Sunak appears to know his own mind when picking investments in this sector. Before he became an MP, Catamaran Ventures \u2013 an investment firm he founded with his wife \u2013 acquired a stake in a company called <a href=\"http://www.acamarfilms.com/\">Acamar Films, which makes the children\u2019s TV programme Bing for the BBC</a>.</p> <p>A fellow shareholder is the comedian Jimmy Carr \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/21/jimmy-carr-apologises-error-tax\">who is no stranger to tax controversies himself</a> \u2013 and the company has benefited from investments made by people receiving tax breaks via the government\u2019s Enterprise Investment Scheme.</p> <p>However, unlike Degorce\u2019s efforts, the tax breaks on the Acamar investment look to have had a proper purpose, with the company now employing 67 people. It is an investment that appears consistent with Sunak\u2019s view of the world \u2013 one that appears traditionally Tory, with tax breaks seen as a pragmatic method to encourage trade.</p> <p>That is a theme that shaped Sunak\u2019s initial policy work, as well as his early backing of Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2016 he wrote a <a href=\"https://www.cps.org.uk/research/the-free-ports-opportunity/\">paper for the free-market thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies</a>, advocating the use of freeports, in which he argued for the UK to establish a series of free-trade zones around the country where components can be imported, used to manufacture finished goods, which are then exported without incurring domestic duties.</p> <p>Tellingly, the paper was full of references to what is now called \u201clevelling up\u201d and entitled The Free Ports Opportunity: how Brexit could boost trade, manufacturing and the north.</p> <p>The north was by then an obvious focus, after Sunak had won the former seat of another former Tory rising star \u2013 William Hague\u2019s Richmond in North Yorkshire \u2013 where Sunak has joked that his family now accounted for the constituency\u2019s entire intake of immigrants.</p> <p>Despite not drinking alcohol and not eating beef, which might have caused the odd eyebrow to arch among local beef farmers, he seems to have been a popular choice with the local party, which respects what is said to be a healthy work ethic.</p> <p>One local Conservative said: \u201cHe won it on his merits.

      "bodyText": "For those fretting that the UK economy is about to crash in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, there is some solace. Rishi Sunak has a history of staying up all night worrying about his charges\u2019 financial wellbeing. The new chancellor, who is preparing to deliver his first budget this week, is now running a \u00a32tn economy in which every member of the country has a stake. But the 39-year-old claims that mere hundred-million-pound decisions once caused him sleepless nights in his former life as a hedge fund manager, as he attempted to stem his clients\u2019 losses during the financial crisis. The stress Sunak admits to during his time in the City is instructive as \u2013 alongside Star Wars films, former Southampton football Matthew Le Tissier and Yorkshire Tea \u2013 the chancellor says finance is among his main loves. \u201cYou are highly accountable. That\u2019s what I like about it,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Political Thinking podcast last year as he related tales from his time in the City. \u201cYou are responsible for your investments and either they\u2019re good or they\u2019re bad \u2026 There are not many other people to blame, there\u2019s nowhere to hide.\u201d Yet despite his insistence that his career is on display, Sunak has hidden from sight incredibly effectively. When appointed chancellor last month, he was widely said to have risen without trace. Ask around the City, and it\u2019s difficult to find many people who have come across him. Those who have talk of a \u201cvery bright\u201d, \u201cpolite\u201d and considered financier who had little of the ego associated with that trade. \u201cHe is always very, very well turned out,\u201d said one, but few can give details of a City career that Sunak had left by his early 30s. Sunak is the eldest son of a Hindu family who immigrated from India (both sets of his grandparents with their children), and Sunak\u2019s parents went on to carve out professional careers: his father worked as a GP and his mother as a pharmacist, who acquired her own pharmacy business. Sunak showed an early interest in the mechanics of trade by doing her bookkeeping. Sunak went on to become head boy at Winchester College before going on to study philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Oxford University. But despite gaining a first in the traditional politician\u2019s degree, he rejected student politics and instead devoted his spare time to his fascination with money, becoming president of the Oxford University Investment Society, where members received talks from real-life bankers and competed in financial trading games. Almost inevitably, that led him to the Square Mile in 2001 and the most revered \u2013 some say hated \u2013 of investment banks, Goldman Sachs, effectively working as a graduate trainee for three years. Sunak left there to do an MBA at Stanford in the US, where he met his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of NR Narayana Murty, the billionaire founder of the global IT firm Infosys. Then it was back to the City, with Sunak moving into hedge funds by joining the Children\u2019s Investment (TCI) Fund, which proved a controversial choice. The fund, created by one of the City\u2019s best-known managers, Sir Christopher Hohn, is set up like many hedge funds, including basing its funds in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. But it is also regarded as an \u201cactivist\u201d investor, meaning it often tries to use its financial muscle to force companies to change their management or strategy. Most infamously, TCI launched a campaign against the Dutch bank ABN Amro in 2007, which resulted in its sale to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The deal loaded RBS with crippling debt and led to a \u00a345.5bn government bailout. The Treasury says Sunak played no role in that deal, but as chancellor he is now ultimately responsible for managing the taxpayer holding in the bank. Sunak was directly involved in other activist campaigns, including a bitter one against the US rail freight group CSX, which ended up with TCI being criticised for its lack of disclosure about its interest in the firm, in a judgment that was then successfully appealed against. His time as a junior partner at the fund would have meant he was very well paid, although nowhere near the levels of more senior partners. But around the time of the financial crisis, TCI split. Patrick Degorce, a co-founder with Hohn, left to start his own fund called Th\u00e9l\u00e8me Partners, taking Sunak with him to work in America, where he invested in companies including News Corp and the US hospital group Community Health Systems. Like Hohn, Degorce proved to be a controversial boss. In 2013 he was forced to part with millions of pounds in tax after a ruling concerning a personal investment in a complex film financing scheme, which sought to shelter earnings of almost \u00a319m. The Treasury minister at the time, David Gauke, said the structure was a \u201cdubious avoidance scheme\u201d. Still, Sunak appears to know his own mind when picking investments in this sector. Before he became an MP, Catamaran Ventures \u2013 an investment firm he founded with his wife \u2013 acquired a stake in a company called Acamar Films, which makes the children\u2019s TV programme Bing for the BBC. A fellow shareholder is the comedian Jimmy Carr \u2013 who is no stranger to tax controversies himself \u2013 and the company has benefited from investments made by people receiving tax breaks via the government\u2019s Enterprise Investment Scheme. However, unlike Degorce\u2019s efforts, the tax breaks on the Acamar investment look to have had a proper purpose, with the company now employing 67 people. It is an investment that appears consistent with Sunak\u2019s view of the world \u2013 one that appears traditionally Tory, with tax breaks seen as a pragmatic method to encourage trade. That is a theme that shaped Sunak\u2019s initial policy work, as well as his early backing of Brexit. In 2016 he wrote a paper for the free-market thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies, advocating the use of freeports, in which he argued for the UK to establish a series of free-trade zones around the country where components can be imported, used to manufacture finished goods, which are then exported without incurring domestic duties. Tellingly, the paper was full of references to what is now called \u201clevelling up\u201d and entitled The Free Ports Opportunity: how Brexit could boost trade, manufacturing and the north. The north was by then an obvious focus, after Sunak had won the former seat of another former Tory rising star \u2013 William Hague\u2019s Richmond in North Yorkshire \u2013 where Sunak has joked that his family now accounted for the constituency\u2019s entire intake of immigrants. Despite not drinking alcohol and not eating beef, which might have caused the odd eyebrow to arch among local beef farmers, he seems to have been a popular choice with the local party, which respects what is said to be a healthy work ethic. One local Conservative said: \u201cHe won it on his merits. People often unfairly say in these situations that he was pushed by Central Office, parachuted in because he was a BAME candidate, or whatever. It was just not true in his case in Richmond. They love him there.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s Manchester\u2019s first ever Grubby Comedy night. The sold-out audience at the Red Bank Project, a recently renovated arts space, is ready to watch a lineup of local acts, including Edinburgh Comedy award-nominated sketch duo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/27/delightful-sausage-funniest-things\">The Delightful Sausage</a>, aka Amy Gledhill and Chris Cantrill.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to be in a city where there is this appetite for alternative stuff,\u201d says Gledhill. Four years ago, Gledhill (originally from Hull) and Cantrill (Bradford) relocated from London to Manchester. The Delightful Sausage began as the name of their DIY comedy night, a precursor to Grubby. \u201cOne of us would dress up as a sausage and the other would dress up as a butcher,\u201d Gledhill says. \u201cIt was mad, but really different.\u201d</p> <p>That will be no surprise to anyone who has seen the pair\u2019s hilarious show Ginster\u2019s Paradise, a visit to a twisted British holiday camp, where silliness meets darkness as they \u201cchannel Brexit anxiety\u201d, says Cantrill. When they first paired up, they were even more abstract. \u201cA big part of our first show was yeast: there was a yeast businessman, we won some yeast, yeast could cure stuff,\u201d Gledhill says. \u201cWe just thought yeast was funny.\u201d</p> <p>Cantrill and Gledhill both do standup, but Manchester gave them the space to collaborate on weirder stuff. They soon met other alternative acts. Many had also created their own nights: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shambodie4lyf/\">Sham Bodie</a>, an experimental mixed bill from John Stansfield and Ben Tonge; Flim Nite, where performers create sets based on famous movies; and offerings from some of Grubby\u2019s lineup \u2013 character-heavy night Quippodrome with Jack Evans and Jain Edwards, and Jim John Harkness\u2019s open mic Entertainment Club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68533290ddf52fade8ceaf962067c568a5848b72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68533290ddf52fade8ceaf962067c568a5848b72/0_0_5952_3960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Delightful Sausage get surreal on Grubby Comedy night at Red Bank Project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Delightful Sausage get surreal on Grubby Comedy night at Red Bank Project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Darcey/J Darcey Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even if you\u2019re baffled by experimental comedy, Manchester has something for you. The MEN Arena and <a href=\"https://thelowry.com/whats-on/types/show/\">Lowry</a> theatre host TV-famous names, while the <a href=\"https://thecomedystore.co.uk/manchester/\">Comedy Store</a> and the <a href=\"https://frogandbucket.com/\">Frog and Bucket</a> provide big weekend shows and amateur nights. Meanwhile, Toby Hadoke\u2019s long-running XS Malarkey \u201cbridges the gap between alternative DIY and glossy Saturday-night comedy,\u201d Gledhill says.In Manchester, big names share bills with newcomers, says Bethany Black, who\u2019s been doing standup in the city for two decades and grew up in nearby Chorley. \u201cReally quickly you\u2019d end up working with people you\u2019d seen on telly.\u201d A few gigs in, she\u2019d played alongside Alan Carr and Jason Manford.</p> <p>Standup <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/Rachel-Fairburn-534268440092936/events/?ref=page_internal\">Rachel Fairburn</a> grew up in north Manchester and began her comedy career here around 10 years ago with a course at the Comedy Store. She\u2019s played pretty much every gig in the city, including \u201cunsung hero\u201d <a href=\"https://comedyballoon.wordpress.com/\">The Comedy Balloon</a> \u2013 a weekly open mic run by Jason Cooke for 20 years. \u201cThe Manchester scene should big it up more because it\u2019s always been good,\u201d Fairburn says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You come on after a meat raffle and people are tutting because they wanted a tribute act instead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like any workplace, Fairburn says, the comedy scene has its politics \u2013 the community\u2019s small enough that everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business \u2013 but people like Cooke consistently support Manchester acts.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s Manchester\u2019s first ever Grubby Comedy night. The sold-out audience at the Red Bank Project, a recently renovated arts space, is ready to watch a lineup of local acts, including Edinburgh Comedy award-nominated sketch duo The Delightful Sausage, aka Amy Gledhill and Chris Cantrill. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to be in a city where there is this appetite for alternative stuff,\u201d says Gledhill. Four years ago, Gledhill (originally from Hull) and Cantrill (Bradford) relocated from London to Manchester. The Delightful Sausage began as the name of their DIY comedy night, a precursor to Grubby. \u201cOne of us would dress up as a sausage and the other would dress up as a butcher,\u201d Gledhill says. \u201cIt was mad, but really different.\u201d That will be no surprise to anyone who has seen the pair\u2019s hilarious show Ginster\u2019s Paradise, a visit to a twisted British holiday camp, where silliness meets darkness as they \u201cchannel Brexit anxiety\u201d, says Cantrill. When they first paired up, they were even more abstract. \u201cA big part of our first show was yeast: there was a yeast businessman, we won some yeast, yeast could cure stuff,\u201d Gledhill says. \u201cWe just thought yeast was funny.\u201d Cantrill and Gledhill both do standup, but Manchester gave them the space to collaborate on weirder stuff. They soon met other alternative acts. Many had also created their own nights: Sham Bodie, an experimental mixed bill from John Stansfield and Ben Tonge; Flim Nite, where performers create sets based on famous movies; and offerings from some of Grubby\u2019s lineup \u2013 character-heavy night Quippodrome with Jack Evans and Jain Edwards, and Jim John Harkness\u2019s open mic Entertainment Club. Even if you\u2019re baffled by experimental comedy, Manchester has something for you. The MEN Arena and Lowry theatre host TV-famous names, while the Comedy Store and the Frog and Bucket provide big weekend shows and amateur nights. Meanwhile, Toby Hadoke\u2019s long-running XS Malarkey \u201cbridges the gap between alternative DIY and glossy Saturday-night comedy,\u201d Gledhill says.In Manchester, big names share bills with newcomers, says Bethany Black, who\u2019s been doing standup in the city for two decades and grew up in nearby Chorley. \u201cReally quickly you\u2019d end up working with people you\u2019d seen on telly.\u201d A few gigs in, she\u2019d played alongside Alan Carr and Jason Manford. Standup Rachel Fairburn grew up in north Manchester and began her comedy career here around 10 years ago with a course at the Comedy Store. She\u2019s played pretty much every gig in the city, including \u201cunsung hero\u201d The Comedy Balloon \u2013 a weekly open mic run by Jason Cooke for 20 years. \u201cThe Manchester scene should big it up more because it\u2019s always been good,\u201d Fairburn says. Like any workplace, Fairburn says, the comedy scene has its politics \u2013 the community\u2019s small enough that everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business \u2013 but people like Cooke consistently support Manchester acts. At the Frog and Bucket, Jessica Toomey, who helps run Manchester\u2019s Women in Comedy festival, recently took over from her dad, founder Dave Perkin, and has been diversifying lineups. \u201cShe\u2019s booking more women, there\u2019s lots more variation in acts,\u201d says Black. Manchester\u2019s universities have given the comedy circuit many graduates. Fairburn\u2019s All Killa No Filla podcast co-host Kiri Pritchard-McLean and her sketch group Gein\u2019s Family Giftshop went to Salford University, whose alumni include Peter Kay and Peter Slater.

The group, including further education colleges and universities, is calling for the British government to make clear that continued Erasmus membership is a high priority in its talks with the EU. Britain\u2019s membership of the EU-wide exchange scheme known as Erasmus+ is to expire at the end of this year, alongside membership of the EU. The government\u2019s negotiating outline offered scant hope of continued full membership, saying only that it \u201cwill consider options for participation in elements of Erasmus+ on a time-limited basis, provided the terms are in the UK\u2019s interests\u201d. Universities UK International (UUKI), the umbrella group representing higher education providers, said membership of Erasmus gave a bonus to the British economy worth \u00a3243m a year, after subtracting membership costs from the \u00a3420m generated by EU students visiting the UK under the programme. It also said the 17,000 British students and young people who use Erasmus for work placements and study would also lose out, particularly students from disadvantaged backgrounds who would struggle to fund their travel and expenses without it. Joe Fitzsimons, the head of education and skills policy at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cMany employers deeply value the kind of international experience the Erasmus scheme helps foster. Given the benefits it can bring students and businesses, maintaining access to Erasmus and wider EU research and education partnerships has been a priority for the IoD from the off.\u201d Emma Meredith, international director at the Association of Colleges (AoC), representing further education, said its data showed 85% of colleges were using Erasmus+ to find work placements that were not available with local employers, particularly for students in vocational subjects such as construction and social care. \u201cFor college students in some of the most deprived parts of the country, Erasmus+ helps to level up opportunity, experience and aspiration as well as ensuring that we are viewed as an open, tolerant and welcoming country to the rest of the world,\u201d she said. An AoC survey found more than 90% of colleges would be unable to fund work placements for further education students if Erasmus is not extended or replaced. The director of UUKI, Vivienne Stern, said: \u201cWe know that disadvantaged and disabled students have the most to gain from an international experience. They will be the students who will lose the most if Erasmus+ falls by the wayside. \u201cYet I am worried that government isn\u2019t committed to keeping the UK in Erasmus. Now is the time to commit to this unique programme that boosts not only students\u2019 prospects, but those of businesses and the economy.\u201d The Department for Education has previously said the government \u201cis committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so\u201d. The UK\u2019s post-Brexit membership of Erasmus is likely to hinge on the EU\u2019s stance on the cost of continuing membership, and whether the EU ties it to another top priority: continued access for UK universities to the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 research programme, which is worth billions of euros. Losing access to either the Horizon or Erasmus programmes would be a further blow for universities struggling with student recruitment difficulties, including potentially huge losses in international tuition fees caused by the coronavirus disruption. A new report by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) also suggests that the UK government will struggle to meet its targets for national research spending if universities suffer cuts to domestic or international fee income. \u201cIf the UK university sector is to continue thriving, then it is crucial that the chancellor recognises the interdependencies between teaching and research in the budget and subsequent spending review,\u201d said Nick Hillman, the HEPI\u2019s director and the author of the report. \u201cUniversities roughly break even on teaching home students but make a big loss on research.

      "bodyText": "The World Bank is to pay for Guyana\u2019s oil laws to be rewritten by a legal firm that has regularly worked for ExxonMobil, just as the US producer prepares to extract as much as 8bn barrels of oil off the country\u2019s coast. The World Bank has pledged not to fund fossil fuel extraction directly, but it is giving Guyana millions of dollars to develop governance in its burgeoning oil sector, as the south American country prepares for an oil rush led by ExxonMobil and its partners. Guyana\u2019s government was in charge of hiring US law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth to revise its Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Act, the environment and rights campaign group Urgewald found. The World Bank reviewed the procurement and found no problems with the process. The Washington-based bank will fund the work with a grant worth $1.96m (\u00a31.5m). Hunton Andrews Kurth has acted for ExxonMobil for 40 years, including multiple cases involved in climate impacts, such as an action by native Americans in the Alaskan village of Kivalina who argued that the climate crisis was threatening their way of life. \u201cThe World Bank claims to be striving for \u2018good governance\u2019 in revising Guyana\u2019s legal framework for oil development,\u201d said Heike Mainhardt, senior advisor on multilateral financial institutions at Urgewald. \u201cHowever, they are hiring the law firm who counts among their major clients ExxonMobil \u2013 the company leading the oilfield development in Guyana. \u201cThis is \u2018good governance\u2019 for the oil companies, not for the people of Guyana or the global climate. The World Bank is causing a conflict of interest, in effect undermining good governance.\u201d The World Bank has already faced criticism over its involvement in the oil sector. It garnered praise from environmental campaign groups in 2017 when it pledged to stop investment in \u201cupstream oil and gas\u201d. However, the Guardian previously reported it had earmarked $55m to improve governance in the oil and gas sector in Guyana. ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, announced in December it had started production off Guyana\u2019s coast, less than five years after oil was first discovered there. At the end of January, ExxonMobil increased its estimates of the size of the discovery to 8bn barrels of oil equivalent. That made it one of the world\u2019s biggest finds in recent years and a key part of ExxonMobil\u2019s plans to extract more fossil fuels, even as other oil producers look at reducing their environmental impacts. Rystad Energy, an energy consultancy, has said that Guyana\u2019s oil production could reach 1.2m barrels per day by the end of the decade, lifting total annual oil revenues well above $20bn at current prices. The International Monetary Fund estimates Guyana\u2019s GDP will grow by 85.6% this year \u2013 potentially transforming the lives of its 785,000 citizens, who voted in a new government this week.

His situation was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/16/fijian-soldier-army-filimone-lacanivalu\">only resolved</a> when the then home secretary, Theresa May, intervened 48 hours before his scheduled deportation to Fiji.</p> <p>The current action involves eight former soldiers, who were all recruited to the army from Fiji, but the lawyers believe hundreds of ex-service personnel are similarly affected.

Afraid of detention and deportation, he left the company and has been doing occasional cash-in-hand jobs as he attempts to resolve his situation. \u201cI served Her Majesty\u2019s armed forces for nine years and suffered the psychological impact of my experiences to this day. I feel that the least the army could have done is to have briefed me about what I needed to do to apply to remain in the UK after being discharged,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This sense of betrayal was echoed by a third claimant, who said: \u201cIt is so unfair for veterans to have to suffer the indignity of being vulnerable to being forcibly removed from the country that we so loyally served, especially when we are in this situation because of oversights on the part of army during the discharge process.\u201d</p> <p>An outline of proposed litigation has been delivered to the government, alleging that both departments failed to follow their own guidance and duties at discharge, with instances of incorrect immigration advice being given to the soldiers. Departing Commonwealth soldiers were given \u201cvery little guidance on the steps required\u201d to obtain legal immigration status in Britain, it says. Moreover, \u201cthe extortionate and unaffordable costs of the Home Office fees have prolonged the state of limbo that our clients and other veterans have endured\u201d, the summary states.</p> <p>Vinita Templeton, the lawyer bringing the action on behalf of eight men, who has been working on this issue for eight years, said: \u201cI have seen unimaginable suffering by servicemen. Their state of limbo since learning that their immigration status is actually unresolved, sometimes years later, has brought about loss of jobs, fear of accessing public services, and for some, homelessness.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony Metzer QC, who is working with Templeton, said: \u201cOur clients have been severely let down by the MoD and the Home Office\u201d. Lawyers want the government to acknowledge that the alleged failings occurred and grant the veterans indefinite leave to remain for free. </p> <p>A government spokesperson said there would be no comment on ongoing legal proceedings, but added: \u201cThe Ministry of Defence make clear to foreign and Commonwealth recruits into the forces the process by which they and their families can attain settlement in the UK, and the costs involved.</p> <p>\u201cThe government highly values the service of all members of the armed forces, including Commonwealth nationals. We are committed to upholding our obligations under the armed forces covenant, to ensure that no one who is serving, or who has served, or their family members are disadvantaged as a result of their service.\u201d</p>",

His situation was only resolved when the then home secretary, Theresa May, intervened 48 hours before his scheduled deportation to Fiji. The current action involves eight former soldiers, who were all recruited to the army from Fiji, but the lawyers believe hundreds of ex-service personnel are similarly affected. The armed forces employ about 4,500 Commonwealth citizens; recruitment in Commonwealth countries has recently been stepped up \u201cto build on the long-held links Britain\u2019s military has with Commonwealth countries\u201d, according to the MoD. \u201cI gave the British army nearly 13 years of my life and I fought in war-torn zones. We were given reason to expect that we could remain indefinitely after four years of service,\u201d said one of the claimants, who are not being named. \u201cThe careless way in which HM Forces treated me and many foreign national soldiers is very unfair and completely without any regard to the service we have given to this country.\u201d His immigration uncertainty has left him feeling fearful for years. \u201cThis has been an undignified existence that is so contrary to the immense pride with which I once served Queen and country.\u201d Another claimant who served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, where he nearly died, worked for National Rail on discharge, until he was told that immigration checks were going to made be on all staff and realised his papers were not in order. Afraid of detention and deportation, he left the company and has been doing occasional cash-in-hand jobs as he attempts to resolve his situation. \u201cI served Her Majesty\u2019s armed forces for nine years and suffered the psychological impact of my experiences to this day. I feel that the least the army could have done is to have briefed me about what I needed to do to apply to remain in the UK after being discharged,\u201d he said. This sense of betrayal was echoed by a third claimant, who said: \u201cIt is so unfair for veterans to have to suffer the indignity of being vulnerable to being forcibly removed from the country that we so loyally served, especially when we are in this situation because of oversights on the part of army during the discharge process.\u201d An outline of proposed litigation has been delivered to the government, alleging that both departments failed to follow their own guidance and duties at discharge, with instances of incorrect immigration advice being given to the soldiers. Departing Commonwealth soldiers were given \u201cvery little guidance on the steps required\u201d to obtain legal immigration status in Britain, it says. Moreover, \u201cthe extortionate and unaffordable costs of the Home Office fees have prolonged the state of limbo that our clients and other veterans have endured\u201d, the summary states. Vinita Templeton, the lawyer bringing the action on behalf of eight men, who has been working on this issue for eight years, said: \u201cI have seen unimaginable suffering by servicemen. Their state of limbo since learning that their immigration status is actually unresolved, sometimes years later, has brought about loss of jobs, fear of accessing public services, and for some, homelessness.\u201d Anthony Metzer QC, who is working with Templeton, said: \u201cOur clients have been severely let down by the MoD and the Home Office\u201d. Lawyers want the government to acknowledge that the alleged failings occurred and grant the veterans indefinite leave to remain for free. A government spokesperson said there would be no comment on ongoing legal proceedings, but added: \u201cThe Ministry of Defence make clear to foreign and Commonwealth recruits into the forces the process by which they and their families can attain settlement in the UK, and the costs involved. \u201cThe government highly values the service of all members of the armed forces, including Commonwealth nationals. We are committed to upholding our obligations under the armed forces covenant, to ensure that no one who is serving, or who has served, or their family members are disadvantaged as a result of their service.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been a long, wet winter. Everybody has got colds, and now we are braced for a coronavirus epidemic. Boosting our immune system has rarely felt more urgent, but, beyond eating more tangerines and hoping for the best, what else can we do?</p> <p>Sheena Cruickshank, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, has a \u201cshocking cold\u201d when we speak at a safe distance, over the phone. To know how to take care of your immune system, she says, first you need to understand the weapons in your armoury \u2013 a cheeringly impressive collection, it turns out.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you come into contact with a germ you\u2019ve never met before,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got various barriers to try to stop it getting into your body.\u201d As well as skin, we have mucus \u2013 \u201csnot is a really important barrier\u201d \u2013 and a microbiome, the collective noun for the estimated 100tn microbes that live throughout our bodies, internally and externally. Some of these helpful bugs make antimicrobial chemicals and compete with pathogens for food and space.</p> <p>Beneath these writhing swamps of mucus and microbes, our bodies are lined with epithelial cells which, says Cruickshank, \u201care really hard to get through. They make antimicrobial products including, most relevant to coronavirus, antiviral compounds that are quite hostile.\u201d</p> <p>If a pathogen breaches these defences, it has to deal with our white blood cells, or immune cells. One type, called macrophages, inhabit all our body tissue and, says Cruickshank, \u201chave all these weapons ready to go, but they\u2019re not terribly precise\u201d. They report to the cleverer, adaptive white blood cells known as lymphocytes. They are the ones that remember germs, \u201cso if you meet that germ again,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cthey\u2019ll just deal with it probably without you even knowing. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve got immunity and is the basis of vaccination. It\u2019s trying to bypass all the early stuff and create the memory, so you don\u2019t have to be sick.\u201d</p> <p>Our immune systems may have blind spots. \u201cThis might mean that our immune response doesn\u2019t recognise certain bugs,\u201d she says, \u201cor the bugs have sneaky evasion strategies. Personally, my immune system is not necessarily very good at seeing colds.\u201d But a healthy lifestyle will ensure your defences are as good as they get.</p> <p>Seeing as our bodies contain more cells belonging to microbes, such as bacteria and yeasts, than human ones, let\u2019s start with the microbiome. \u201cWe live in a symbiotic relationship with our gut bacteria,\u201d says Prof Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society for Immunology and a professor at University College, London. \u201cHaving the right ones around, that we evolved with, is best for our health. Anything we do that alters that can be detrimental.\u201d</p> <p>Not only do our microbes form protective barriers, they also programme our immune systems. Animals bred with no microbiome have less well developed immune responses. Older people, and those with diseases that are characterised by inflammation, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, tend to have less varied gut microbiomes.</p> <p>To feed your gut flora, Cruickshank recommends \u201ceating a more varied diet with lots of high-fibre foods\u201d. Being vegetarian isn\u2019t a prerequisite for microbiome health, but the more plant foods you consume, the better. \u201cThe microbiome really likes fibre, pulses and fermented foods,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Kefir yoghurt and pickles such as sauerkraut and kimchi are among the fermented delicacies now fashionable thanks to our increasing knowledge of the microbiome. But the evidence for taking probiotic supplements, she says, \u201cis mixed\u201d. It\u2019s not a dead cert that they will survive the journey through your digestive tract, or that they will hang around long enough if they do. \u201cIt\u2019s more effective to change your diet,\u201d says Cruickshank.</p> <p>The skin microbiome is important, too, but we know less about it. High doses of ultraviolet light (usually from the sun) can affect it negatively, weakening any protective functions (as well as triggering immune suppression in the skin itself). Overwashing with strong soaps and using antibacterial products is not friendly to our skin microbiomes. \u201cCombinations of perfumes and moisturisers might well also have an effect,\u201d says Cruickshank.</p> <p>To be immunologically fit, you need to be physically fit. \u201cWhite blood cells can be quite sedentary,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cExercise mobilises them by increasing your blood flow, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy in other parts of the body.\u201d The NHS says adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (hiking, gardening, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (running, swimming fast, an aerobics class).</p> <p>The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. \u201cAnything\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d says Akbar. But a lifetime\u2019s exercise could significantly slow your immune system declining with age. In 2018, a <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2018/03/regular-exercise-slows-down-ageing.aspx\" title=\"\">study</a> by University of Birmingham and King\u2019s College London found that 125 non-smoking amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79 still had the immune systems of young people.</p> <p>The other side of the coin, says Akbar, \u201cis elite athletes who become very susceptible to infections because you can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system.\u201d This problem is unlikely to affect most of us unless, says Cruickshank, \u201cyou\u2019re a couch potato and suddenly try and run a marathon, this could introduce stress hormones and be quite bad for your immune system\u201d.</p> <p>One of the many happy side-effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can compromise immune function, a common example of which, says Akbar, is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. \u201cDuring periods of stress,\u201d he says, \u201cit can reactivate again and we get shingles.\u201d</p> <p>Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. \u201cSome studies have suggested that the first-line-of-defence macrophages are not as effective in people who have had a lot of alcohol,\u201d says Cruickshank. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been suggestions that high alcohol consumption can lead to a reduction of the lymphocytes as well. So if the bug gets into you, you\u2019re not going to be as good at containing and fighting it off.\u201d</p> <p>Cruickshank says that vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. \u201cIt is used by our macrophages, and is something that people in Britain can get quite low on in the winter.\u201d Necking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for well-fed westerners.

One <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324432\" title=\"\">study</a> last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of a type of lymphocyte called T cells, and research is demonstrating the importance of our natural biorhythms overall.</p> <p>Janet Lord, a professor at the University of Birmingham, recently showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/26/morning-flu-jabs-could-save-thousands-of-lives-study-suggests\" title=\"\">vaccinating people</a> in the morning is more effective than doing so in the afternoon. \u201cYour natural biorhythms are, to some extent, dictated by sleep,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything\u2019s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you\u2019ve got problems.\u201d</p> <p>The seriousness of an infection largely depends on the dose you are hit with, which could in turn depend on how contagious the carrier is when they cough near you. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly exposed to germs, and we only get sick from a handful of those,\u201d says Cruickshank.</p> <p>If you\u2019re reasonably young and healthy, says Akbar, the mild benefits you may achieve from being extra good probably won\u2019t fend off a severe dose of coronavirus or flu.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a long, wet winter. Everybody has got colds, and now we are braced for a coronavirus epidemic. Boosting our immune system has rarely felt more urgent, but, beyond eating more tangerines and hoping for the best, what else can we do? Sheena Cruickshank, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, has a \u201cshocking cold\u201d when we speak at a safe distance, over the phone. To know how to take care of your immune system, she says, first you need to understand the weapons in your armoury \u2013 a cheeringly impressive collection, it turns out. \u201cWhen you come into contact with a germ you\u2019ve never met before,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got various barriers to try to stop it getting into your body.\u201d As well as skin, we have mucus \u2013 \u201csnot is a really important barrier\u201d \u2013 and a microbiome, the collective noun for the estimated 100tn microbes that live throughout our bodies, internally and externally. Some of these helpful bugs make antimicrobial chemicals and compete with pathogens for food and space. Beneath these writhing swamps of mucus and microbes, our bodies are lined with epithelial cells which, says Cruickshank, \u201care really hard to get through. They make antimicrobial products including, most relevant to coronavirus, antiviral compounds that are quite hostile.\u201d If a pathogen breaches these defences, it has to deal with our white blood cells, or immune cells. One type, called macrophages, inhabit all our body tissue and, says Cruickshank, \u201chave all these weapons ready to go, but they\u2019re not terribly precise\u201d. They report to the cleverer, adaptive white blood cells known as lymphocytes. They are the ones that remember germs, \u201cso if you meet that germ again,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cthey\u2019ll just deal with it probably without you even knowing. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve got immunity and is the basis of vaccination. It\u2019s trying to bypass all the early stuff and create the memory, so you don\u2019t have to be sick.\u201d Our immune systems may have blind spots. \u201cThis might mean that our immune response doesn\u2019t recognise certain bugs,\u201d she says, \u201cor the bugs have sneaky evasion strategies. Personally, my immune system is not necessarily very good at seeing colds.\u201d But a healthy lifestyle will ensure your defences are as good as they get. Seeing as our bodies contain more cells belonging to microbes, such as bacteria and yeasts, than human ones, let\u2019s start with the microbiome. \u201cWe live in a symbiotic relationship with our gut bacteria,\u201d says Prof Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society for Immunology and a professor at University College, London. \u201cHaving the right ones around, that we evolved with, is best for our health. Anything we do that alters that can be detrimental.\u201d Not only do our microbes form protective barriers, they also programme our immune systems. Animals bred with no microbiome have less well developed immune responses. Older people, and those with diseases that are characterised by inflammation, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, tend to have less varied gut microbiomes. To feed your gut flora, Cruickshank recommends \u201ceating a more varied diet with lots of high-fibre foods\u201d. Being vegetarian isn\u2019t a prerequisite for microbiome health, but the more plant foods you consume, the better. \u201cThe microbiome really likes fibre, pulses and fermented foods,\u201d she adds. Kefir yoghurt and pickles such as sauerkraut and kimchi are among the fermented delicacies now fashionable thanks to our increasing knowledge of the microbiome. But the evidence for taking probiotic supplements, she says, \u201cis mixed\u201d. It\u2019s not a dead cert that they will survive the journey through your digestive tract, or that they will hang around long enough if they do. \u201cIt\u2019s more effective to change your diet,\u201d says Cruickshank. The skin microbiome is important, too, but we know less about it. High doses of ultraviolet light (usually from the sun) can affect it negatively, weakening any protective functions (as well as triggering immune suppression in the skin itself). Overwashing with strong soaps and using antibacterial products is not friendly to our skin microbiomes. \u201cCombinations of perfumes and moisturisers might well also have an effect,\u201d says Cruickshank. To be immunologically fit, you need to be physically fit. \u201cWhite blood cells can be quite sedentary,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cExercise mobilises them by increasing your blood flow, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy in other parts of the body.\u201d The NHS says adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (hiking, gardening, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (running, swimming fast, an aerobics class). The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. \u201cAnything\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d says Akbar. But a lifetime\u2019s exercise could significantly slow your immune system declining with age. In 2018, a study by University of Birmingham and King\u2019s College London found that 125 non-smoking amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79 still had the immune systems of young people. The other side of the coin, says Akbar, \u201cis elite athletes who become very susceptible to infections because you can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system.\u201d This problem is unlikely to affect most of us unless, says Cruickshank, \u201cyou\u2019re a couch potato and suddenly try and run a marathon, this could introduce stress hormones and be quite bad for your immune system\u201d. One of the many happy side-effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities.

Our shared disgust at Jessica letting the dog drink red wine from her glass was just one standout moment in the social media discourse. At a time when so much divides us, this bizarre series \u2013 even if just for a moment \u2013 bonded us together. I\u2019m a fan of reality television. I don\u2019t attempt to diagnose why I love the chaos it provides \u2013 I just know I have a subscription to hayu, a streaming platform solely dedicated to grade-A trash reality television. I, like many seasoned reality binge-watchers, am used to a certain level of closure at the end of a particularly good season. So while this first season of Love Is Blind sent a drug-like euphoria punching through my veins, the show\u2019s reunion episode left me lukewarm, as I sought the kind of reality star scrutiny maybe only Andy Cohen, the creator of the Real Housewives and Married to Medicine franchises, is equipped to provide. On reuniting a year later, much was still left unsaid. I wanted Jessica and Amber, two contestants who were feuding over the same mediocre man, to really have it out. After fiances Carlton and Diamond had a viral-moment fight, during which he lost his temper and called her a bitch, I wanted someone to secure the fulsome apology she deserved. Simultaneously, it felt sad that the argument was sparked by him coming out as bisexual \u2013 and I wanted someone to wrap their arms around Carlton and tell him it wasn\u2019t his fault the show didn\u2019t cater to the complexity of his sexuality. I was shocked but not surprised by the way the fight played out, because black women are often treated as collateral damage, even as others rightly grapple with their own self-realisation. We\u2019ll have to wait and see whether Netflix can reproduce the success of this first season of Love Is Blind. But like much good reality TV, it\u2019s clear that we can get on board with this bizarre format as long as the resulting show is packed full of characters we can root for, those who leave us arguing and conflicted \u2013 and others we collectively agree we dislike. \u2022 Daniell\u00e9 Dash is a TV development executive and writes about race, gender and popular culture \u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2020. An earlier version had included a photo captioned as being of Cameron [Hamilton] and Lauren [Speed], but which was in fact of fellow contestants Amber Pike and Matt Barnett.

You are not allowed to use a plane and your phone \u2013 full of navigational apps \u2013 has been confiscated. With limited cash, you use the cheapest and most uncomfortable forms of transport imaginable. Not only are you unfamiliar with the race\u2019s destination \u2013 Ushuaia, at the bottom of Argentina \u2013 but also you are relying on directions from members of the public, who speak a language \u2013 or languages \u2013 you don\u2019t. This is the scenario in which the contestants find themselves at the start of the second series of Race Across the World.</p> <p>The first series of the BBC Two show \u2013 a sleeper hit buried in the weekend schedules \u2013 challenged teams to race between London and Singapore, mixing leisurely escapism with anxiety-inducing endurance. We can expect further emotional peaks and troughs in the second outing.</p> <p>If you think the contestants must have found the experience exhausting, consider the crew. Each team of two was accompanied for the entire race by two members of the production crew, who stayed at each hostel and travelled alongside them on every mode of transport. \u201cWe did a 28-hour bus, then had an hour in a bus station, then went straight on to a 21-hour bus,\u201d says Charlotte Jacobs, an assistant producer. \u201cThree weeks into it, a 12-hour bus journey seemed quite short.

The crew were not allowed to interfere with or influence the team\u2019s routes, either \u2013 even if they were making a mistake, which they often did. One team did not realise that they had also crossed a time zone and nearly missed a vital connection. In the first episode, two contestants took the wrong bus when leaving the Mayan ruins at Palenque in Chiapas state, southern Mexico, and almost ended up on a six-hour detour. </p> <p>The production team stresses that safety was a priority \u2013 a local fixer and a security adviser followed each team, but kept enough distance to make the trip felt authentic.</p> <p>However, filming in Latin America posed a unique set of challenges. Venezuela was out of bounds before the race even began, due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/20/one-million-children-left-behind-those-who-stay-venezuela-amid-exodus\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/20/one-million-children-left-behind-those-who-stay-venezuela-amid-exodus\">political and economic crisis in the country</a>. Guatemala, Chile and Ecuador all declared states of emergency whilst the race was in progress. Teams still visited the countries, but were rerouted to avoid certain parts of each. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/bolivia-crisis-what-happens-next-evo-morales\">Riots in Bolivia</a>, following a contentious presidential election, resulted in all the teams being forced to leave the country by a certain date. Cameras were stolen from crew members, while two contestants lost a pouch containing a significant amount of their budget.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b46d3e037d036a3e15868ab086a2bd9a3b4fd2d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b46d3e037d036a3e15868ab086a2bd9a3b4fd2d8/0_276_4292_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We get bored if things are going too smoothly\u2019 ...

Five out of the seven checkpoints had to be relocated \u2013 checkpoints that were long arranged and located at suitable hotels, to give everyone an opportunity to recharge. The contestants were already on their way to the first location when a change was forced upon them. \u201cThat was pretty hard, but I think it ended up being one of the most exciting checkpoints of the series. And certainly one of the more peaceful,\u201d says the series producer, Lucy Curtis. \u201cWe joke that whenever things are going smoothly we get a bit bored!\u201d</p> <p>To ensure that the race was feasible in the first place, two members of the production team completed the whole journey in advance of filming. The recce (which was also undertaken for the first series) was even more arduous than the race itself, as there were only two people \u2013 only one of whom knew where they were supposed to be going. \u201cThe other person has no idea and that person is in charge of making the decisions,\u201d explains Curtis.</p> <p>On the recces, the team had constant nightmares with money. Foreign exchanges were few and far between, because locals tended to use bank cards. \u201cWe want to test how long it would take if you were someone who goes into it blind. They are a bit stir crazy at times, stuck on boats and buses and trains for days on end, but it\u2019s an amazing job.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, for all of the stresses, racing across the world always proves to be a joyful experience. It has transformative effects on the contestants, all of whom are at a crossroads in their lives or are trying to get closer to their teammate. It is life-affirming for those who travel with them, too. Jacobs has put herself forward to accompany another team for a further series, still high from the last experience. \u201cNow I\u2019m thinking about it, I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh no!\u2019\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWhat have I let myself in for?\u201d</p> <p><em>Race Across The World returns tonight, 8pm, BBC Two</em></p>",

Not only are you unfamiliar with the race\u2019s destination \u2013 Ushuaia, at the bottom of Argentina \u2013 but also you are relying on directions from members of the public, who speak a language \u2013 or languages \u2013 you don\u2019t. This is the scenario in which the contestants find themselves at the start of the second series of Race Across the World. The first series of the BBC Two show \u2013 a sleeper hit buried in the weekend schedules \u2013 challenged teams to race between London and Singapore, mixing leisurely escapism with anxiety-inducing endurance. We can expect further emotional peaks and troughs in the second outing. If you think the contestants must have found the experience exhausting, consider the crew. Each team of two was accompanied for the entire race by two members of the production crew, who stayed at each hostel and travelled alongside them on every mode of transport. \u201cWe did a 28-hour bus, then had an hour in a bus station, then went straight on to a 21-hour bus,\u201d says Charlotte Jacobs, an assistant producer. \u201cThree weeks into it, a 12-hour bus journey seemed quite short. It\u2019s amazing how much you can do on no sleep.\u201d For the crew, overnight journeys also meant alarms blaring out several hours into their sleep, to remind them to change and recharge their camera batteries so that they could film the next day\u2019s action. The crew were not allowed to interfere with or influence the team\u2019s routes, either \u2013 even if they were making a mistake, which they often did. One team did not realise that they had also crossed a time zone and nearly missed a vital connection. In the first episode, two contestants took the wrong bus when leaving the Mayan ruins at Palenque in Chiapas state, southern Mexico, and almost ended up on a six-hour detour. The production team stresses that safety was a priority \u2013 a local fixer and a security adviser followed each team, but kept enough distance to make the trip felt authentic. However, filming in Latin America posed a unique set of challenges. Venezuela was out of bounds before the race even began, due to the political and economic crisis in the country. Guatemala, Chile and Ecuador all declared states of emergency whilst the race was in progress. Teams still visited the countries, but were rerouted to avoid certain parts of each. Riots in Bolivia, following a contentious presidential election, resulted in all the teams being forced to leave the country by a certain date. Cameras were stolen from crew members, while two contestants lost a pouch containing a significant amount of their budget. These crises also had knock-on effects on the various checkpoints that each team had to pass. Five out of the seven checkpoints had to be relocated \u2013 checkpoints that were long arranged and located at suitable hotels, to give everyone an opportunity to recharge. The contestants were already on their way to the first location when a change was forced upon them. \u201cThat was pretty hard, but I think it ended up being one of the most exciting checkpoints of the series. And certainly one of the more peaceful,\u201d says the series producer, Lucy Curtis. \u201cWe joke that whenever things are going smoothly we get a bit bored!\u201d To ensure that the race was feasible in the first place, two members of the production team completed the whole journey in advance of filming. The recce (which was also undertaken for the first series) was even more arduous than the race itself, as there were only two people \u2013 only one of whom knew where they were supposed to be going. \u201cThe other person has no idea and that person is in charge of making the decisions,\u201d explains Curtis. On the recces, the team had constant nightmares with money. Foreign exchanges were few and far between, because locals tended to use bank cards. \u201cWe want to test how long it would take if you were someone who goes into it blind. They are a bit stir crazy at times, stuck on boats and buses and trains for days on end, but it\u2019s an amazing job.\u201d Indeed, for all of the stresses, racing across the world always proves to be a joyful experience. It has transformative effects on the contestants, all of whom are at a crossroads in their lives or are trying to get closer to their teammate. It is life-affirming for those who travel with them, too. Jacobs has put herself forward to accompany another team for a further series, still high from the last experience. \u201cNow I\u2019m thinking about it, I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh no!\u2019\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWhat have I let myself in for?\u201d Race Across The World returns tonight, 8pm, BBC Two",

Let\u2019s face it, most of us buy a big TV with all the internet streaming and programme guide functionality we can afford and kick back in front of it. Beyond the initial tuning in of stations and maybe adjusting the colour to our taste, there\u2019s not much configuration tweaking that goes on \u2013 which is a mistake when both privacy and security issues are in the picture. TVs nowadays connect to the internet, have web browsers, run apps, and can be controlled by your voice; automatic content recognition (ACR) watches what you see, from TV programmes to games, and the resulting data can target you for personalised advertising and produce viewing recommendations \u2013 often across various platforms. You probably agreed to ACR being used when you were setting up your new telly. To disable it \u2013 although this varies from TV to TV \u2013 head for the general or advanced settings and look for a \u201cviewing information\u201d or \u201cviewing data\u201d option. This will stop some \u201csmart\u201d things like recommendations, and even some voice activation functions, from working properly, so bear in mind that ACR data is anonymised before heading for the off button.</p> <h2><strong>Reduce the smart speaker </strong><strong>\u2018threat surface\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Smart speakers and digital assistants come in many guises; what they all have in common is that, by necessity, they are always listening. Recent research suggests that <a href=\"https://mobilemarketingmagazine.com/59-per-cent-of-smart-speaker-users-have-privacy-concerns-report-\" title=\"\">59% of smart speaker users</a> have privacy concerns, with unwanted listening and data collection being front and centre.</p> <p>Of course, only you can determine whether having a voice-controlled \u201c<em>Star Trek</em> computer\u201d in your home outweighs those privacy concerns. It is possible, however, to retain the smart performance while minimising the privacy \u201cthreat surface\u201d. To prevent the Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant account holder from being able to view any requests you\u2019ve made or questions you\u2019ve asked, you can tell Alexa to \u201cdelete what I just said\u201d and Google Assistant to \u201cdelete my last conversation\u201d. This does require the account holder to have enabled the \u201cdelete by voice\u201d option in their settings, though. If you are the account holder, you can use the \u201cvoice match\u201d function for Google Assistant to prevent your results from being available to anyone who simply asks for them. You can manage how Amazon uses your data by opening the Alexa app and heading for Settings | Alexa Privacy and toggling the \u201chelp improve Amazon services\u201d option off along with the \u201cuse messages to improve transcriptions\u201d setting. Google Assistant users can use the Home app via Settings | More Settings | Your Data to pause collection of any more voice recordings. However, Google warns that this can \u201climit or disable\u201d more personalised experiences across Google as a result.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When hackers can get spyware into your home via a\u00a0lightbulb, maybe it\u2019s\u00a0time to\u00a0take smart home privacy issues\u00a0seriously</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>Ring the </strong><strong>changes for your smart doorbell</strong></h2> <p>A home security surveillance system requires video cameras to record what\u2019s going on. When those security cameras are connected to, and accessible from, the internet, questions about who is watching the watcher come to the fore. When those connected cameras can be found in everything from your doorbell to the baby monitor in the nursery, privacy issues cannot be ignored. Amazon-owned Ring is perhaps most famous for its video doorbells and in the US Congress, Amazon is <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/congress-demands-answers-from-ring-on-police-partnerships/\" title=\"\">facing questions</a> about the sharing of Ring data (including video footage) with more than 900 police departments.</p> <p>Moreover, following investigations that found Ring had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51281476\" title=\"\">shared information</a> with the likes of Facebook and Google, <a href=\"https://blog.ring.com/2020/02/18/extra-layers-of-security-and-control/\" title=\"\">the company has said</a> it doesn\u2019t sell personal information to anyone and has suspended the use of most third-party analytics services in Ring apps while it works to provide greater ability to opt out in its new Control Center. This already lets users manage privacy and security options such as two-factor authentication, sharing information with third parties for personalised advertising, and managing any shared users. Clicking on the authorised client devices option will show all the devices that can access your Ring account, and therefore your videos. This will show the device and whether it\u2019s logged into your account. To remove any you don\u2019t recognise, remove all authorised client devices as one and then re-enrol them individually.</p> <h2><strong>Is your central heating a threat to your privacy?</strong></h2> <p>That we are even talking about privacy concerning your thermostat is, frankly, pretty nuts. But fears around central heating technology and privacy are a reality. In the case of the Google-owned Nest thermostat, however, those fears are ill founded. Despite some news reports to the contrary, your Nest thermostat has neither a camera nor a microphone inside. On the other hand, thermostats such as the Alexa-supporting <a href=\"https://www.ecobee.com/ecobee4/\" title=\"\">ecobee</a><a href=\"https://www.ecobee.com/ecobee4/\" title=\"\">4</a>, do have microphones. The latter also has a privacy mode that can be activated once the thermostat is installed: tap the microphone icon at the bottom right of the thermostat screen and select voice control off. You won\u2019t then be able to use Alexa to control the thermostat, but nor will it listen continuously for wake words or send recorded messages to Amazon. Both ecobee4 and Nest users can have all their personal information removed upon request, but this deletes their account and disables the remote access and \u201csmart\u201d connected functionality you bought the device for. A Nest thermostat will collect data such as your setup information, environmental data from its sensors, heating and cooling usage.</p> <h2><strong>Shedding light on smart bulb security</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this year, security researchers confirmed that a vulnerability could <a href=\"https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/02/05/the-dark-side-of-smart-lighting-check-point-research-shows-how-business-and-home-networks-can-be-hacked-from-a-lightbulb/\" title=\"\">enable a hacker to launch an attack</a> on your home computer network, and therefore your data, by way of a <a href=\"https://www2.meethue.com/en-gb?origin=rHzPFKJg&amp;pcrid=314095778836%7cmckv%7csrHzPFKJg_dc%7cplid%7c%7cslid%7c%7c&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiaWfvtf-5wIVj0TTCh2VYwIbEAAYASAAEgL1GPD_BwE\" title=\"\">Philips Hue</a> smart lightbulb. The vulnerability, without getting too technical, was actually in a low-power wireless protocol used to control many different Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices. Philips was quick to issue a new firmware update that fixed the problem before it was publicly disclosed. You can make sure your lightbulbs are protected by opening the Philips Hue app and heading to Settings | Software Update. This will alert you if an update is needed, but to prevent any further checking, you can enable the \u201cautomatic update\u201d option on the same page. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2020 to give the correct name of the University of Chicago, which we had referred to as Chicago University.</p>",

This already lets users manage privacy and security options such as two-factor authentication, sharing information with third parties for personalised advertising, and managing any shared users. Clicking on the authorised client devices option will show all the devices that can access your Ring account, and therefore your videos. This will show the device and whether it\u2019s logged into your account. To remove any you don\u2019t recognise, remove all authorised client devices as one and then re-enrol them individually. Is your central heating a threat to your privacy? That we are even talking about privacy concerning your thermostat is, frankly, pretty nuts. But fears around central heating technology and privacy are a reality. In the case of the Google-owned Nest thermostat, however, those fears are ill founded. Despite some news reports to the contrary, your Nest thermostat has neither a camera nor a microphone inside. On the other hand, thermostats such as the Alexa-supporting ecobee4, do have microphones. The latter also has a privacy mode that can be activated once the thermostat is installed: tap the microphone icon at the bottom right of the thermostat screen and select voice control off. You won\u2019t then be able to use Alexa to control the thermostat, but nor will it listen continuously for wake words or send recorded messages to Amazon. Both ecobee4 and Nest users can have all their personal information removed upon request, but this deletes their account and disables the remote access and \u201csmart\u201d connected functionality you bought the device for. A Nest thermostat will collect data such as your setup information, environmental data from its sensors, heating and cooling usage. Shedding light on smart bulb security Earlier this year, security researchers confirmed that a vulnerability could enable a hacker to launch an attack on your home computer network, and therefore your data, by way of a Philips Hue smart lightbulb. The vulnerability, without getting too technical, was actually in a low-power wireless protocol used to control many different Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices. Philips was quick to issue a new firmware update that fixed the problem before it was publicly disclosed. You can make sure your lightbulbs are protected by opening the Philips Hue app and heading to Settings | Software Update. This will alert you if an update is needed, but to prevent any further checking, you can enable the \u201cautomatic update\u201d option on the same page. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 March 2020 to give the correct name of the University of Chicago, which we had referred to as Chicago University.",

Instead, after a 35-minute delay, it was announced the game would go ahead along with, it is assumed, the rest of this weekend\u2019s fixture list. The game kicked off at 12.45pm GMT. Spadafora had said he supported a call from the Italian footballers association president, Damiano Tommasi, to avoid putting players at risk from the virus outbreak. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense right now, when we\u2019re requesting enormous sacrifices of our citizens in order to stop the spread of contagion, to put at risk the health of the players, referees, coaches and fans \u2013 who will surely get together to watch the games,\u201d Spadafora said. \u201cI think [the FIGC president, Gabriele] Gravina should have some additional consideration without waiting for the first case of contagion, before assuming this serious responsibility.\u201d Five Serie A matches were scheduled for Sunday, beginning with Parma v Spal and concluding with the big Juventus v Internazionale at 7.45pm GMT. All of the matches had already been postponed from last weekend. Italy announced a sweeping quarantine early on Sunday for its northern regions, igniting travel chaos as it restricted the movements of a quarter of its population in an attempt to halt the new coronavirus\u2019s spread across Europe. Shortly after midnight, the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, signed a decree affecting 16m people in the country\u2019s north, including the Lombardy region and at least 14 provinces in neighbouring regions. The measures will be in place until 3 April. Italy on Saturday reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases since its outbreak began on 21 February. The number of infected people rose 1,247 in the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 5,883. Italys death toll rose to 233.",

The news puts at risk what had been built up as the most exciting race this week, the much anticipated clash of Altior, Defi Du Seuil and Chacun Pour Soi in Wednesday\u2019s Champion Chase. Altior, winner of the race for the past two years, had been favourite at 2-1 but was immediately pushed out to 3-1 and those odds looked set to lengthen. Henderson said that Might Bite\u2019s participation in the cross-country chase was also in doubt, as he expects the going, currently soft, to be too testing for the horse. Envoi Allen has been committed to the Ballymore Novice Hurdle on the Festival\u2019s second day after his trainer, Gordon Elliott, walked the track on Sunday morning. The Irishman spoke last week of his concerns, based on wet weather, that he would find the going to be heavy, in which case the horse would have been switched to the shorter Supreme Novice Hurdle on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful ground,\u201d Elliott told the Guardian as he watched some of his horses stretch their legs at the track at 8.30am. \u201cIt\u2019s probably soft, it would be yielding to soft in Ireland. \u201cThere\u2019s a lovely covering of grass, track\u2019s in great condition. The whole team have the place in good condition for the weather they\u2019ve had and I\u2019ll not be complaining.\u201d Elliott conceded that the wet winter might still mean the ground presents a significant test, at least for the first-day action on Tuesday. But he added: \u201cObviously, there\u2019s some want it better, some want it softer. But the way it is, it is. We\u2019re here now, we won\u2019t complain.\u201d Envoi Allen was 11-8 favourite for the Ballymore after Elliott\u2019s announcement, made through Twitter. The horse had gone out to 5-2 on Betfair\u2019s exchange after the note of caution struck by the trainer at a preview evening on Thursday night. Elliott has a small group of horses stabled at Cheltenham already, including the five horses he said he would declare for Tuesday\u2019s races \u2013 Abacadabras, Elwood, Coeur Sublime, Galvin and Ravenhill. Envoi Allen and Tiger Roll are among a second wave of his horses expected to arrive on Sunday night. Of Tiger Roll, the even-money favourite for Wednesday\u2019s cross-country race, Elliott told RacingTV: \u201cHe\u2019s in great nick, I couldn\u2019t be happier with him. Hopefully he won\u2019t be far away.\u201d Tiger Roll is trying to win at the Festival for the fifth time, on his way to Aintree next month where connections hope he can win a third Grand National. The official going is soft all round, backed up by a GoingStick reading of 5.6 taken on Sunday morning, lower and therefore softer than last Wednesday\u2019s 6.2. There was 4mm of rain overnight into Sunday and the same again is expected before Tuesday but the forecast from then is for drying weather, with strong winds and rising temperatures.",

      "body": "<p>Friday night, 11pm. I am snapping a selfie in the bedroom mirror. Not for Instagram I hasten to add \u2013 no one over 40 should do that \u2013 but for my \u201cBest Dressed\u201d folder of outfits. Next to me on a chair is a mountain of clothes that have been lying fallow in my wardrobe for more than a year. Some haven\u2019t seen the light of day for as much as a decade. I must wear them all within a week or drag them kicking and screaming to the charity shop. This is all part of a Radical Wardrobe Edit that I\u2019m racing to complete, as decreed by <a href=\"https://www.fashionpsychologysuccess.com/\" title=\"\">Dawnn Karen</a>, a fashion psychologist, whose new book <em>Dress Your Best Life</em> promises to \u201charness the power of clothes to transform your life\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cnew\u201d outfits I\u2019ve unearthed from this growing pile are pinging me pleasing little hits of dopamine, delivering the kind of euphoric high I might ordinarily experience on the <a href=\"https://www.ganni.com/en-gb/home\" title=\"\">Ganni</a> website, but the thought of jettisoning a silver vintage dress brings me out in a cold sweat, even though I know there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever again fit into it and would, in any case, rarely have an occasion to wear it.</p> <p>What lies behind this unnatural attachment? I\u2019m about to find out as I\u2019ve booked a fashion therapy session with Karen who, though based in New York, is available to deal with wardrobe hang-ups from afar by phone or FaceTime.</p> <p>Fortunately, when Karen pops up on my phone screen radiating a joyous positivity, all worries of a brutal wardrobe cull quickly evaporate. Less draconian stylist, more softly-softly wardrobe whisperer, Karen is the salve for all your fashion anxieties, whether you\u2019re looking to revive your sartorial swagger after a heartbreaking divorce or wrestling with your body image. Or perhaps, like me, you\u2019ve hit midlife and simply need coaxing out of a style rut.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the type to tell you what to wear; I can get a little prescriptive, but only after you\u2019ve told me who you are,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to tell you, \u2018You must get rid of this dress you love.\u2019 But if we had more sessions, I would unpack why you\u2019re holding on to it,\u201d she tells me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb4f2b452e1d5cf5aad12facb37cac64d97978a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4f2b452e1d5cf5aad12facb37cac64d97978a9/0_758_4512_5577/809.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon in a sparkly silver dress and heels holding up a pair of party shoes in each hand and with multiple pairs of shoes lined up behind her\" width=\"809\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have the wardrobe of a fashionista at a permanent cocktail party, whereas in reality I am a 54-year-old mother of two.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Goldsmith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not to be confused with a personal shopper, who will prescribe a \u201clook\u201d and likely persuade you to invest in a heap of new outfits, Karen is a qualified therapist with a master\u2019s degree in counselling psychology from Columbia University. And if you haven\u2019t heard of the role of fashion psychologist before now, that\u2019s because Karen, 31, invented it. It does seem like the perfect marriage of her skill sets. A former model with a lifelong passion for clothes, she is the first black female psychology professor at the <a href=\"https://www.fitnyc.edu/\" title=\"\">Fashion Institute of Technology</a> in New York. So Karen knows fashion. But she is also sceptical of \u201cstyle rules, flash-in-the-pan trends and paint-by-numbers styling advice\u201d.

I am, and I\u2019m almost embarrassed to admit this, something of a sequin addict. And not just sequins. My wardrobe is bursting with silver lam\u00e9, silks, satins, flowing lace and plentiful gold pleats. If it twinkles like a disco ball or says \u201cparty\u201d, I <em>must</em> have it. I have 40 pairs of shoes, few of which I can walk in, and dresses\u2026 so many dresses. Essentially, I have the wardrobe of a fabulous fashionista at a permanent cocktail party, whereas in reality I am a 54-year-old mother of two who works from home in jeans and trainers. When I have a work meeting I panic and reach for the same boring black dress. It\u2019s a serious case of fashion dissonance.</p> <p>Karen might conclude that I have a \u201cRepetitious Wardrobe Complex\u201d and I wonder if it\u2019s something I should strive to fix. I know from her book that I\u2019m far from alone in shopping for a fantasy life. It\u2019s a common affliction among her clients and the reason so many of us peer into a wardrobe bursting at the seams, only to wail, \u201cBut I have nothing to wear.\u201d The question is, what should I do about it? I\u2019d like my signature style to be cool, understated elegance \u2013 the epitome of Jackie O glamour \u2013 but fear that it\u2019s more English eccentric\u2019s garden party. </p> <p>\u201cA lot of my clothes are still from my 30s and 40s,\u201d I say, showing her the blue and lilac devor\u00e9 skirt bought before my daughter, now 19, was born, that I\u2019ve paired with a silky polka-dot top, inspired by Karen\u2019s own penchant for clashing patterns.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes, I love it, I love it!\u201d she says beaming a smile that could light up a football pitch. (Karen is not the kind of therapist, thank God, to sit silently nodding as you howl into the void.) Next, I show her my \u201cgrey rock\u201d dress \u2013 a grey rock outfit, according to Karen, is one you use to blend in \u2013 the long, black, tent-like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/14/yohji-yamamoto-designer-v-and-a\" title=\"\">Yohji Yamamoto</a>-esque dress from Zara that I wear to work meetings, because I think it makes me look serious.</p> <p>Perhaps it is time to invest in more black statement pieces like this. I want my work clothes to say \u201cprofessional\u201d, not shout \u201cbonkers\u201d. But Karen is not convinced my wardrobe needs to grow up. She is all for my whimsical style \u2013 sequins, the lot; not because I\u2019m on trend this season (seriously, when were sequins ever not in fashion?) but because she feels I should be myself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab0330b99c0062faf719cc1cb8bf013892446e72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab0330b99c0062faf719cc1cb8bf013892446e72/0_0_4616_6831/676.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Walker in a bold floral kimono-type dress and high red shoes opening her wardrobe and looking round at the camera\" width=\"676\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opening up: \u2018It becomes apparent that digging deep into my wardrobe is every bit as revealing as that classic analyst question: So tell me about your mother.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Goldsmith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou are that girl who wears bold colours, so I would actually have you wear those as that comes across better. It\u2019s more authentic and people will feel it. That would make for a more successful meeting. The number one key to confidence is when you align your attire with your attitude,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The dreaded midlife makeover also gets short shrift. Karen thinks I have a \u201cyoung energy\u201d, which works with my 30-something wardrobe. \u201cI would not have you throw away the clothes you bought in your 30s and 40s. That would be painstaking and exhausting, and a shock to the system. We\u2019re not about casting away items that matter to you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Rather than reining in my natural flamboyance, Karen is more interested in where my penchant for party frocks might have originated \u2013 my \u201cfashion awakening\u201d as she calls it in her book.</p> <p>As I guide Karen through my outfits, unravelling my style story, it quickly becomes apparent that digging deep into my wardrobe is every bit as revealing as that classic analyst question: \u201cSo tell me about your mother.\u201d Before I know it, I\u2019m telling her a story about how, when I was nine, my father took me shopping for the first time, just before visiting my mother in hospital. He wanted to do something nice to cheer me up and the dress we bought was beautiful: deep, soft velvet, trailing the floor, hugely impractical and ruinously expensive. It delivered a kind of Ugly Duckling transformation, because in my sadness I\u2019d also grown fat. I tried it on for my mum and that was the last time I saw her. She died later that month.</p> <p>\u201cThat princess dress was your first introduction to how to deal with trauma, so that could have been the start of this whimsical brand you have now,\u201d Karen ponders. \u201cIt could be that on an unconscious level you\u2019re drawn to this kind of look.\u201d Suddenly the abundance of lavish fabrics and dresses in my wardrobe doesn\u2019t seems so flippant.</p> <p>Even the tiny silver dress and an old leather mini skirt, both the size of a postage stamp, get to stay. \u201cIf an item holds psychological value or weight, you need to hold on to it,\u201d she explains. \u201cTraditional makeover people are all about throwing something away and putting on something new, but they\u2019re not thinking about the psyche. These (too small) pieces are like ideal versions of ourselves. If we had longer, I would continue unravelling and unpacking.\u201d No doubt this \u201cunpacking\u201d would turn up some unresolved issues around weight and body image.</p> <p>Among her clients she has helped a dishevelled divorcee recover his self-esteem by using mindfulness as he got dressed in the morning. \u201cTaking the time to pull his appearance together offered a tangible way to move through his crisis,\u201d she explains. Another client came to her hoping to break out of her colour rut, as she always wore black and dark-grey clothing. \u201cOnce we started talking about her life we realised her attachment to dark colours began a decade earlier after her husband had died. I was surprised that she had never consciously made that connection before.\u201d She was able to acknowledge her grief and her need for the dark clothes, but also started incorporating pops of colour into her wardrobe. And as for me, now I\u2019ve understood my party dress addiction I can shop more mindfully and perhaps think twice before shopping in a crisis and reaching for yet another party-frock pick-me-up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35bfac54f6437b81e22763f450972ead604c32a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35bfac54f6437b81e22763f450972ead604c32a1/0_1108_5504_6731/818.jpg\" alt=\"Dawnn Karen in a red cocktail dress\" width=\"818\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If an item holds psychological value or weight, you need to hold on to it\u2019: Dawnn Karen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Dorsa/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no doubt that Karen\u2019s hunch that clothes could be used as a form of therapy stems from her own history of using clothes to self-medicate. As a teen she loved fashion and hungrily absorbed her cousin\u2019s designer-label castoffs, before finding her own style. But it was only later at college that everything changed. She was the victim of a sexual assault, and found herself traumatised, unable to eat or get out of bed. \u201cI barely moved,\u201d she writes in her book. \u201cThen on Monday morning, I woke up and opened my closet.\u201d Her chosen armour against the world and her feelings? \u201cA body-skimming 1950s-style dress, reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn\u2019s iconic Givenchy silhouettes.\u201d She thinks of this episode now as a kind of power dressing. \u201cI was dressing up my pain. I was shoring myself up to face the world. Dressing well was my first step to reclaiming my life.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t enough, of course \u2013 there\u2019s only so far strappy sandals will take you when it comes to dealing with trauma of that magnitude, but the clothes got her to a place where she could talk about it. Eventually, she sought counselling and later defined her way of dressing to lift her mood as \u201cMood Enhancement Dressing\u201d, which now forms a cornerstone of her therapy.</p> <p>In our one-off therapy-cum-interview there\u2019s no time to delve too deep, but in less than an hour I\u2019ve seen first-hand how clothes can have huge emotional resonance. But what about that pile of clothes I need to wear within the week? The Radical Wardrobe Edit turns out not to be so radical after all. Karen\u2019s main advice seems to be if a piece is \u201cBlah, I don\u2019t care\u201d, bin it. But those that mean something will always have a place in your wardrobe.</p> <p>Before we part, I have one last question for her. Could I, should I, still wear disco-ball frocks in my 70s? Could some version of that actually be OK? It might sound silly to you but, to me, this matters. After our session, I think I already know the answer, but I just want to hear her say it.</p> <p>\u201cI think we get too caught up in what\u2019s age-appropriate,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll make it work when the time comes. It doesn\u2019t need to be fully sequined head-to-toe. You could take it down a notch, but the party frock will always be part of you.\u201d</p> <p>So the sequins stay.

      "bodyText": "Friday night, 11pm. I am snapping a selfie in the bedroom mirror. Not for Instagram I hasten to add \u2013 no one over 40 should do that \u2013 but for my \u201cBest Dressed\u201d folder of outfits. Next to me on a chair is a mountain of clothes that have been lying fallow in my wardrobe for more than a year. Some haven\u2019t seen the light of day for as much as a decade. I must wear them all within a week or drag them kicking and screaming to the charity shop. This is all part of a Radical Wardrobe Edit that I\u2019m racing to complete, as decreed by Dawnn Karen, a fashion psychologist, whose new book Dress Your Best Life promises to \u201charness the power of clothes to transform your life\u201d. The \u201cnew\u201d outfits I\u2019ve unearthed from this growing pile are pinging me pleasing little hits of dopamine, delivering the kind of euphoric high I might ordinarily experience on the Ganni website, but the thought of jettisoning a silver vintage dress brings me out in a cold sweat, even though I know there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever again fit into it and would, in any case, rarely have an occasion to wear it. What lies behind this unnatural attachment? I\u2019m about to find out as I\u2019ve booked a fashion therapy session with Karen who, though based in New York, is available to deal with wardrobe hang-ups from afar by phone or FaceTime. Fortunately, when Karen pops up on my phone screen radiating a joyous positivity, all worries of a brutal wardrobe cull quickly evaporate. Less draconian stylist, more softly-softly wardrobe whisperer, Karen is the salve for all your fashion anxieties, whether you\u2019re looking to revive your sartorial swagger after a heartbreaking divorce or wrestling with your body image. Or perhaps, like me, you\u2019ve hit midlife and simply need coaxing out of a style rut. \u201cI\u2019m not the type to tell you what to wear; I can get a little prescriptive, but only after you\u2019ve told me who you are,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to tell you, \u2018You must get rid of this dress you love.\u2019 But if we had more sessions, I would unpack why you\u2019re holding on to it,\u201d she tells me. Not to be confused with a personal shopper, who will prescribe a \u201clook\u201d and likely persuade you to invest in a heap of new outfits, Karen is a qualified therapist with a master\u2019s degree in counselling psychology from Columbia University. And if you haven\u2019t heard of the role of fashion psychologist before now, that\u2019s because Karen, 31, invented it. It does seem like the perfect marriage of her skill sets. A former model with a lifelong passion for clothes, she is the first black female psychology professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. So Karen knows fashion. But she is also sceptical of \u201cstyle rules, flash-in-the-pan trends and paint-by-numbers styling advice\u201d. Her sessions are designed to gently tease out what clothes mean to you and look at how you can use them to feel more confident, calm or powerful. In other words, fashion as therapy or \u201cstyling from the inside out\u201d, as she calls it. As you might expect from a fashion psychologist, Karen is exquisitely turned out, in a chic black top (everyone should have two of these wardrobe basics), with long glossy black hair. Her personal fashion \u201cbrand\u201d, something we should all have, she says, is minimalist glam, which means statement capes, bold colours, leopard print (\u201cIt\u2019s practically a neutral for me\u201d) and towering heels, as you can see on her Instagram account. Before we start, she makes the point that she normally spends three sessions getting to know her clients before she even looks at their wardrobe, but for the purpose of this interview we will dive straight into my closet. Like many of her clients \u2013 at least those who aren\u2019t in the public eye \u2013 I\u2019m at a transitional stage in my life; one that I\u2019m not sure my current wardrobe suits. I\u2019ve hit my mid-50s, my kids are about to fly the nest, but my wardrobe tells a different story. I am, and I\u2019m almost embarrassed to admit this, something of a sequin addict. And not just sequins. My wardrobe is bursting with silver lam\u00e9, silks, satins, flowing lace and plentiful gold pleats. If it twinkles like a disco ball or says \u201cparty\u201d, I must have it. I have 40 pairs of shoes, few of which I can walk in, and dresses\u2026 so many dresses. Essentially, I have the wardrobe of a fabulous fashionista at a permanent cocktail party, whereas in reality I am a 54-year-old mother of two who works from home in jeans and trainers. When I have a work meeting I panic and reach for the same boring black dress. It\u2019s a serious case of fashion dissonance. Karen might conclude that I have a \u201cRepetitious Wardrobe Complex\u201d and I wonder if it\u2019s something I should strive to fix. I know from her book that I\u2019m far from alone in shopping for a fantasy life. It\u2019s a common affliction among her clients and the reason so many of us peer into a wardrobe bursting at the seams, only to wail, \u201cBut I have nothing to wear.\u201d The question is, what should I do about it? I\u2019d like my signature style to be cool, understated elegance \u2013 the epitome of Jackie O glamour \u2013 but fear that it\u2019s more English eccentric\u2019s garden party. \u201cA lot of my clothes are still from my 30s and 40s,\u201d I say, showing her the blue and lilac devor\u00e9 skirt bought before my daughter, now 19, was born, that I\u2019ve paired with a silky polka-dot top, inspired by Karen\u2019s own penchant for clashing patterns. \u201cOh yes, I love it, I love it!\u201d she says beaming a smile that could light up a football pitch. (Karen is not the kind of therapist, thank God, to sit silently nodding as you howl into the void.) Next, I show her my \u201cgrey rock\u201d dress \u2013 a grey rock outfit, according to Karen, is one you use to blend in \u2013 the long, black, tent-like Yohji Yamamoto-esque dress from Zara that I wear to work meetings, because I think it makes me look serious. Perhaps it is time to invest in more black statement pieces like this. I want my work clothes to say \u201cprofessional\u201d, not shout \u201cbonkers\u201d. But Karen is not convinced my wardrobe needs to grow up. She is all for my whimsical style \u2013 sequins, the lot; not because I\u2019m on trend this season (seriously, when were sequins ever not in fashion?) but because she feels I should be myself. \u201cYou are that girl who wears bold colours, so I would actually have you wear those as that comes across better. It\u2019s more authentic and people will feel it. That would make for a more successful meeting. The number one key to confidence is when you align your attire with your attitude,\u201d she says. The dreaded midlife makeover also gets short shrift. Karen thinks I have a \u201cyoung energy\u201d, which works with my 30-something wardrobe. \u201cI would not have you throw away the clothes you bought in your 30s and 40s. That would be painstaking and exhausting, and a shock to the system. We\u2019re not about casting away items that matter to you,\u201d she says. Rather than reining in my natural flamboyance, Karen is more interested in where my penchant for party frocks might have originated \u2013 my \u201cfashion awakening\u201d as she calls it in her book. As I guide Karen through my outfits, unravelling my style story, it quickly becomes apparent that digging deep into my wardrobe is every bit as revealing as that classic analyst question: \u201cSo tell me about your mother.\u201d Before I know it, I\u2019m telling her a story about how, when I was nine, my father took me shopping for the first time, just before visiting my mother in hospital.

There\u2019s no shame in repeating outfits or having a style uniform (think Blue Obama suit or Steve Jobs turtleneck). Keira Knightley wore her wedding dress on the red carpet, twice. Or having set uniforms for different situations, like going to the airport. Don\u2019t be a slave to trends or style rules. Dress for your personal \u201cbrand\u201d or mood and don\u2019t try to diminish yourself by wearing a style that doesn\u2019t feel like you.

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has promised to give the NHS \u201cwhatever it needs\u201d to tackle the coronavirus crisis, as he looks at loosening the fiscal rules to allow for more borrowing and spending. Before this week\u2019s budget, Sunak did not say how much in additional resources the NHS would get, but indicated the government was potentially willing to write a blank cheque to help the health service cope with a pandemic. Sunak refused to deny several times that he was looking at getting rid of the fiscal rules from the Conservative election manifesto, which commits him to balancing the books on day-to-day spending midway through this parliament. There is speculation that the coronavirus crisis gives the government a reason to throw out the fiscal rules set just a few months ago by Sunak\u2019s predecessor Sajid Javid. Sunak told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI can say absolutely categorically the NHS will get whatever resources it needs to get us through this and to respond to the health crisis.\u201d Sunak\u2019s assurance comes after warnings from doctors and other medical professionals that the NHS is already under too much pressure to be able to deal with a serious worsening of the coronavirus outbreak. There are worries about whether enough beds for critically ill patients will be available, about staff falling ill and others having to take time off to care for children if schools across the country close down. Over the weekend, the government said people could be asked to volunteer in the NHS at the peak of the outbreak. Speaking earlier on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Sunak said he would be outlining further measures at the budget to help businesses hit by short-term financing problems as a result of trade slowing down or large sick pay bills. \u201cYou\u2019re right this could be a challenging period for businesses but it will be an impact for a temporary period of time,\u201d he said. The government would be looking at helping businesses find bridging financing rather than providing bailouts, Sunak added. He said the impact on businesses \u201ccould be significant\u201d so the government was actively looking at how to support them through difficult periods for cashflow. Despite dire predictions about the effects of coronavirus on the world economy, Sunak said the government would not extend the Brexit transition period beyond December. The Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, told Ridge it was \u201cpretty much inevitable that we will need additional resources\u201d in the NHS to cope with coronavirus. She also called for a \u201crelaxation of universal credit rules\u201d to ensure people stayed in isolation if they had suspected coronavirus rather than trying to make appointments at job centres. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people who have been advised to self-isolate to minimise the risk of passing the infection on to others to be sanctioned on their benefits,\u201d she said. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the government\u2019s spending in this week\u2019s budget would be \u201cit\u2019s nowhere near the scale we need\u201d. He told the Marr show it \u201cwill not deliver what we need in terms of the NHS\u201d and warned it \u201chas got to be the most important budget since the second world war\u201d to deal with coronavirus, climate change and the crisis in public services.",

The dancers reappear in modern rehearsal gear and rerun, pause and replay snatches of what we\u2019ve just seen. It\u2019s interesting to see them twitch, glitch, strobe and stagger through repeated micro-movements. But Gogol\u2019s themes are junked, as are any humour, irony or sense of play.</p> <p>The droning, Siri-like voiceover, repeating a choreographer\u2019s musings about choreography, is grating, as is the self-indulgent recitation of dance notations (\u201cSection 2 dash 2, Figure 1 meets Figure 9\u201d). Pite and Young merged performance types with similar irony and openness to deconstruction in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/05/betroffenheit-review-sadlers-wells-crystal-pite-from-trauma-savage-beauty\" title=\"\">Betroffenheit</a></em> in 2015 and in <em>The </em><em>Statement</em> in 2018.

Performed and narrated by <a href=\"https://joanclevilledance.com/solene-weinachter-dancer/\" title=\"\">Sol\u00e8ne Weinachter</a>, this tragedy about Oedipus\u2019s daughter Antigone features lines from Sophocles\u2019s original play of 441BC, along with comical interjections.</p> <p>It\u2019s painfully gauche. Weinachter flails, crawls, tips over and, for several excruciating minutes, acts like a dog, snarling, barking, growling, snuffling, howling and baying. Any actual dance amounts to barely five minutes. Those minutes are wonderful. There are belly-slapping, sauntering, drunken wedding dances; the writhing contortions of injured soldiers; a full-tilt backwards run, the body stiff and angular, like broken branches batted by the wind; and the splayed knees, back-tilted head and defensively braced arms of slaughtered families.</p> <p>Otherwise, this amateurish storytelling session is didactic, dull and patronising as hell; there\u2019s even a shout-out to refugees, activists and \u201cblack bodies\u2026 not doing what they\u2019re told\u201d.

The fussy doctor, conniving ministers, giddy young wife and self-important boss are at once exaggerated and satirically undercut, with Ella Rothschild as a witchy politician and Jermaine Spivey as a nervous postman particularly impressive. It teeters between mime, farce, panto, melodrama and spoof. Then it falls apart. The dancers reappear in modern rehearsal gear and rerun, pause and replay snatches of what we\u2019ve just seen. It\u2019s interesting to see them twitch, glitch, strobe and stagger through repeated micro-movements. But Gogol\u2019s themes are junked, as are any humour, irony or sense of play. The droning, Siri-like voiceover, repeating a choreographer\u2019s musings about choreography, is grating, as is the self-indulgent recitation of dance notations (\u201cSection 2 dash 2, Figure 1 meets Figure 9\u201d). Pite and Young merged performance types with similar irony and openness to deconstruction in Betroffenheit in 2015 and in The Statement in 2018. But when a naked fossil-man appears in Revisor for no reason, with bony fins stuck to his spine and antlers tied to his hands, it\u2019s time to give up and go home. Antigone, Interrupted is Barcelona-born Joan Clevill\u00e9\u2019s first work as artistic director of Scottish Dance Theatre. Performed and narrated by Sol\u00e8ne Weinachter, this tragedy about Oedipus\u2019s daughter Antigone features lines from Sophocles\u2019s original play of 441BC, along with comical interjections. It\u2019s painfully gauche. Weinachter flails, crawls, tips over and, for several excruciating minutes, acts like a dog, snarling, barking, growling, snuffling, howling and baying. Any actual dance amounts to barely five minutes. Those minutes are wonderful. There are belly-slapping, sauntering, drunken wedding dances; the writhing contortions of injured soldiers; a full-tilt backwards run, the body stiff and angular, like broken branches batted by the wind; and the splayed knees, back-tilted head and defensively braced arms of slaughtered families. Otherwise, this amateurish storytelling session is didactic, dull and patronising as hell; there\u2019s even a shout-out to refugees, activists and \u201cblack bodies\u2026 not doing what they\u2019re told\u201d. Never before has an hour felt longer or more agonising than the actual Theban war. Star ratings (out of five) Revisor \u2605\u2605\u2605 Antigone, Interrupted \u2605",

      "body": "<p>In 2002, Dorothy Giunta-Cotter was shot and killed in her own home in Massachusetts by her husband and relentless abuser of 20 years, William Cotter. He then turned the gun on himself. Dorothy, 35, had fled from him with their two daughters a few days earlier because Cotter had begun to hurt their 11-year-old, but she had refused the offer of a refuge. She told the police that if her daughters were with her, Cotter would find them, and kill all three. \u201cShe attempted to avert the worst of two terrible outcomes,\u201d wrote the American journalist Rachel Louise Snyder in an article published in the <em>New Yorker </em>in 2013, \u201cthe loss of her daughters\u2019 lives along with her own.\u201d</p> <p>That article, A Raised Hand, became part of eight years of research from one of the frontlines of what the World Health Organization (WHO) has deemed \u201ca global epidemic\u201d. Snyder\u2019s work is now an award-winning book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/no-visible-bruises-9781912854851.html\" title=\"\">No Visible Bruises: What We Don\u2019t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us</a></em>. In the UK, the issue of domestic abuse is not \u201ctaboo\u201d, which Snyder says the subject still is in the US. Here, while it may be a family secret, it is recognised and discussed nationally; the impact of austerity on closing refuges, slashing legal aid and axing specialist domestic abuse services, has kept the issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/13/domestic-violence-killings-in-uk-at-five-year-high\" title=\"\">high on the UK agenda</a>. It\u2019s a crime that impacts on men too but women make up the overwhelming majority of victims. Eighty women were killed by a partner or ex in the year to March 2019, an increase of 27% on the previous year, while an incident of domestic abuse is reported every minute in England and Wales. The government estimates that the social and economic cost of domestic abuse is a staggering \u00a366bn a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c6b616e519f3cd1c365c525dc527fd67f2e013fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6b616e519f3cd1c365c525dc527fd67f2e013fb/0_0_591_833/355.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothy Giunta-Cotter, shot dead by her husband, William Cotter, in 2002\" width=\"355\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothy Giunta-Cotter, shot dead by her husband, William Cotter, in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Snyder, 51, combines the forensic eye of the investigative reporter with her skills as a professor of creative writing but there is an added empathy.

As Snyder writes: \u201cLove is what makes domestic violence different from other crimes.\u201d</p> <p>Visiting an intensive prison programme to help abusers to change, Snyder tells a circle of men that she too had been a high-school drop-out; she too knows about violence. \u201cI was a rebellious teenager,\u201c she tells me now on the phone from her home in Washington DC. \u201cI was smoking cigarettes at 10, pot at 12. [After her mother died] My father married a woman I met on the day of the wedding and took my brother and me to live 500 miles away\u2026 My dad believed women were secondary to men.

I wasn\u2019t afraid to fight back.\u201d</p> <p>In September 1985, all four teenagers \u201cwere kicked out of the house\u201d. Snyder dropped out of high school at 16. She worked as a waitress, living in her car. \u201cThe manageress let me sleep on her couch for a month. They were good people.\u201d At 19, she says, \u201cI knew the life I\u2019d lived for the past three years would also be my life for the next 60 unless I got an education.

Once she began investigating domestic abuse on her home patch, she says, she realised that here was a crime that linked many of the issues she had covered abroad including child brides in Romania and the forced sterilisation of women in Tibet. Across the world, 137 women are killed every day by familial violence. Domestic abuse, she writes, \u201cis as common as rain\u201d.</p> <p><em>No Visible Bruises </em>was published in the US last year. Halfway through a national book tour last June, Snyder, flew home to Washington DC to attend her 11-year-old daughter\u2019s fifth grade graduation. At the airport, she received a voicemail from a close friend, Michelle. \u201cSomething\u2019s happening at Jason\u2019s,\u201d she said. Michelle\u2019s brother, Jason Rieff, 51 and his wife, Lola Golumova, 45, both diplomats based in Washington DC were due to finalise their divorce. Lola had been given custody of the two daughters and intended to take them overseas on a four-year posting. At 9.25 am on the morning of 7 June while the girls were at school, Jason \u2013 who had bought a gun 10 days earlier \u2013 shot and killed Lola and then shot himself. In the US, 50 women a month are shot dead (90 a month are killed in total) in familial violence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b96d888dce8921b18b0af0d13119ae6f2de83ef6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b96d888dce8921b18b0af0d13119ae6f2de83ef6/0_0_1280_710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lola Gulomova, shot dead by her husband in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"555\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lola Gulomova, shot dead by her husband in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had to tell my daughter that her friend\u2019s daddy killed her friend\u2019s mummy, then killed himself,\u201d Snyder says. Her daughter, Jazz, knew how death was delivered. \u201cWith a gun,\u201d she said.</p> <p>I ask Snyder why she thinks the rates of killings and abuse are escalating. \u201cThe #MeToo movement calling out male behaviour has triggered a backlash,\u201d she suggests. \u201cJust because women are seen to be \u2018winning\u2019, though, doesn\u2019t mean those men are \u2018losing\u2019. And, in Britain and the US, we have elected macho, misogynistic, authoritarian leaders that set a tone. The violent response has become increasingly normative.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years ago, on her return to live in the US, Snyder met Suzanne Dubus and Kelly Dunne who worked at the Jeanne Geiger Crisis Center in Amesbury Massachusetts. Up till then, Snyder writes, she had always thought that domestic violence was, \u201dthe unfortunate fate of the unlucky few\u201d. She believed that restraining orders kept women safe; that victims could easily leave a relationship if it became bad enough; that courts punished men who were violent. Dubus and Dunne taught her otherwise.</p> <p>In 2002, they had tried to help Dorothy Giunta-Cotter, supporting her when she filed a restraining order on her husband, which he broke, and finding a room for her and her two daughters in a long-term shelter, which Dorothy refused. In the wake of Dorothy\u2019s death, Dubus and Dunne were prompted to create the first Domestic Violence High Risk Team (now emulated in the UK and many other countries) to work out how to deal with abusive men more effectively. The team brings police, hospitals, courts, state legislature and other professionals together to share information and prevent domestic murder by intervening early. In Dorothy\u2019s case, detectives had no knowledge of the times William Cotter had hospitalised his partner. \u201cCommunication between professionals is what makes a difference,\u201d Snyder says.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, a breakthrough in understanding and communicating the clues that point to domestic abuse came in the form of the work of Jacqueline Campbell in Maine and her danger assessment tool, which helps health professionals to identify victims. She now travels the US teaching others how to use the tool. Among the 22 risk factors Campbell identified are threats to kill, extreme jealousy, forced sex, stalking and a woman\u2019s isolation. Strangulation is also a vital clue. Strangling to the point of loss of consciousness can cause brain damage and internal injuries often not recognised, yet 60% of victims in the US are strangled at some point in an abusive relationship.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Across the board the violent men I met didn\u2019t want to be violent. What they don\u2019t know is alternative behaviours</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Drawing a timeline to identify a pattern of abuse as it unfolds, sharing the information among frontline collaborating professionals, is vital, Campbell stresses. In this way, an escalating pattern of control and/or violence is revealed and understood as so much more than an isolated \u201caccident\u201d. Yet still, in the UK, according to Davina James-Hanman who reviews domestic abuse murders for the Home Office, scarce resources mostly go to high-risk cases, for instance where attempted murder is flagged up, and not to lower-risk cases where intervention much earlier in an abusive relationship gives the woman a chance to break free.</p> <p>Snyder says that after the deaths of Jason Rieff and Lola Golumova, among the first to send their love and support were the mothers of Michelle and Rocky Mosure. Michelle had had two children with Rocky before she was 18. Rocky appeared the perfect husband but he was also exercising coercive control over Michelle, a crime in the UK since 2015 but not in the US. But in 2001, aged 23, Michelle was breaking free. She had returned to education and had a restraining order on Rocky. He broke the order, Michelle went back to him. Snyder says women return for a variety of reasons, including their lack of finances, the paucity of protection, the fear. Soon after, Rocky shot dead Michelle, his two children and then himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c630565c80543081203d870b5409296354a953f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c630565c80543081203d870b5409296354a953f/0_98_1459_1901/767.jpg\" alt=\"Michelle Monson Mosure, with her children, Kristy and Kyle in 1999.All three were shot dead by husband and father Rocky Mosure in 1999, Montana\" width=\"767\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Monson Mosure, with her children, Kristy and Kyle.

Jimmy Espinoza was a drug addict, pimp, rapist and serial batterer. He had also been sexually abused as a child. He became a group leader of a <a href=\"http://communityworkswest.org/program/rsvp/\" title=\"\">programme</a> to help men desist from abuse. In the book, Snyder notices a poster on the wall at one meeting. \u201cHow do you persuade a 30-year-old to stop beating his wife? Talk to him when he\u2019s 12.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cAcross the board the violent men I met didn\u2019t want to be violent,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t know is alternative behaviours. They don\u2019t understand that where there is greater equality in a relationship, it\u2019s generally stronger and more satisfying.\u201d</p> <p>She says that among the measures that may make a difference in tackling domestic abuse are better training for the judiciary and the police, constant analysis of risk, education in schools and innovative initiatives such as protected housing so a woman doesn\u2019t have to uproot herself and her children and travel 200 miles to a refuge.</p> <p>Snyder wants to trigger an international debate about domestic violence and has her own ideas. She proposes an app to provide advice to teenagers distinguishing, for instance, stalking and harassment from \u201cromance\u201d and a helpline for men who want to stop the violence and control. (The UK has a call line, <a href=\"https://respectphoneline.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Respect</a>.)</p> <p>When Snyder had her daughter, she was reconciled with her father and stepmother, Barbara. Close to death, Barbara revealed that she too had been a victim of domestic abuse in a previous marriage. The book is dedicated to her. Prevention, education and early intervention all matter but something far more fundamental and deep-rooted also has to shift because inequality and male power are at the root of this epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to take the longer view of history,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cUntil very recently, for instance, it was legal for a man to rape his wife. I\u2019m an optimist. I have to believe that change is possible.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 No Visible Bruises</em> by Rachel Louise Snyder is published by Scribe (\u00a39.99).

In 2002, they had tried to help Dorothy Giunta-Cotter, supporting her when she filed a restraining order on her husband, which he broke, and finding a room for her and her two daughters in a long-term shelter, which Dorothy refused. In the wake of Dorothy\u2019s death, Dubus and Dunne were prompted to create the first Domestic Violence High Risk Team (now emulated in the UK and many other countries) to work out how to deal with abusive men more effectively. The team brings police, hospitals, courts, state legislature and other professionals together to share information and prevent domestic murder by intervening early. In Dorothy\u2019s case, detectives had no knowledge of the times William Cotter had hospitalised his partner. \u201cCommunication between professionals is what makes a difference,\u201d Snyder says. Thirty years ago, a breakthrough in understanding and communicating the clues that point to domestic abuse came in the form of the work of Jacqueline Campbell in Maine and her danger assessment tool, which helps health professionals to identify victims. She now travels the US teaching others how to use the tool. Among the 22 risk factors Campbell identified are threats to kill, extreme jealousy, forced sex, stalking and a woman\u2019s isolation. Strangulation is also a vital clue. Strangling to the point of loss of consciousness can cause brain damage and internal injuries often not recognised, yet 60% of victims in the US are strangled at some point in an abusive relationship. Drawing a timeline to identify a pattern of abuse as it unfolds, sharing the information among frontline collaborating professionals, is vital, Campbell stresses. In this way, an escalating pattern of control and/or violence is revealed and understood as so much more than an isolated \u201caccident\u201d. Yet still, in the UK, according to Davina James-Hanman who reviews domestic abuse murders for the Home Office, scarce resources mostly go to high-risk cases, for instance where attempted murder is flagged up, and not to lower-risk cases where intervention much earlier in an abusive relationship gives the woman a chance to break free. Snyder says that after the deaths of Jason Rieff and Lola Golumova, among the first to send their love and support were the mothers of Michelle and Rocky Mosure. Michelle had had two children with Rocky before she was 18. Rocky appeared the perfect husband but he was also exercising coercive control over Michelle, a crime in the UK since 2015 but not in the US. But in 2001, aged 23, Michelle was breaking free. She had returned to education and had a restraining order on Rocky. He broke the order, Michelle went back to him. Snyder says women return for a variety of reasons, including their lack of finances, the paucity of protection, the fear. Soon after, Rocky shot dead Michelle, his two children and then himself. Does Snyder believe abusers can stop, turn themselves around? \u201cJimmy hasn\u2019t abused for years,\u201d she says. Jimmy Espinoza was a drug addict, pimp, rapist and serial batterer. He had also been sexually abused as a child. He became a group leader of a programme to help men desist from abuse. In the book, Snyder notices a poster on the wall at one meeting. \u201cHow do you persuade a 30-year-old to stop beating his wife? Talk to him when he\u2019s 12.\u201d \u201cAcross the board the violent men I met didn\u2019t want to be violent,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t know is alternative behaviours. They don\u2019t understand that where there is greater equality in a relationship, it\u2019s generally stronger and more satisfying.\u201d She says that among the measures that may make a difference in tackling domestic abuse are better training for the judiciary and the police, constant analysis of risk, education in schools and innovative initiatives such as protected housing so a woman doesn\u2019t have to uproot herself and her children and travel 200 miles to a refuge. Snyder wants to trigger an international debate about domestic violence and has her own ideas. She proposes an app to provide advice to teenagers distinguishing, for instance, stalking and harassment from \u201cromance\u201d and a helpline for men who want to stop the violence and control. (The UK has a call line, Respect.) When Snyder had her daughter, she was reconciled with her father and stepmother, Barbara. Close to death, Barbara revealed that she too had been a victim of domestic abuse in a previous marriage. The book is dedicated to her. Prevention, education and early intervention all matter but something far more fundamental and deep-rooted also has to shift because inequality and male power are at the root of this epidemic. \u201cYou have to take the longer view of history,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cUntil very recently, for instance, it was legal for a man to rape his wife. I\u2019m an optimist. I have to believe that change is possible.\u201d \u2022 No Visible Bruises by Rachel Louise Snyder is published by Scribe (\u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "The sexual abuse began when Ad\u00e8le Haenel was 12, she says. The alleged molestation and harassment at the hands of director Christophe Ruggia would continue for years. Haenel, 31, is now pressing charges. Last weekend, when Roman Polanski \u2013 a director convicted of having sex with a 13-year-old girl \u2013 won France\u2019s highest award for directing, Haenel stood up and walked out of the ceremony. \u201cShame!\u201d she shouted. Polanski\u2019s latest film, An Officer and a Spy, came out in November, around the same time Haenel went public with her accusations against Ruggia. The combination of events, in addition to Polanski\u2019s recent accolades, sparked a fiery debate over both the state of the #MeToo movement in France and the enduring legacy of Polanski, now facing his sixth accusation of sexual abuse. The director\u2019s win at the C\u00e9sars shocked observers both in France and around the world, coming less than a week after the felony rape conviction of Harvey Weinstein. A potent mix of cultural and generational differences begin to explain why France has not seen a similar reckoning around sexual assault in the film industry as the US \u2013 and why Polanski\u2019s time might finally be up. \u201cThere is a #MeToo paradox in France,\u201d Haenel told the New York Times. \u201cIt is one of the countries where the movement was the most closely followed on social media, but from a political perspective and in cultural spheres, France has completely missed the boat.\u201d Part of what\u2019s at play is a generational divide. The #MeToo movement in France was soon followed by a countermovement where more than 100 women \u2013 many of them older actors, such as Catherine Deneuve and Ingrid Caven \u2013 signed an open letter denouncing it. The signees relied on the old-fashioned argument that a movement against inappropriate sexual behaviour somehow equalled a puritanical challenge to French sexual liberties. Many journalists and public figures condemned the letter that seemed to equate sexual violence with \u201cclumsy flirting\u201d. Prominent feminist leader Caroline De Haas said the letter reminded her of a \u201ctiresome uncle who doesn\u2019t understand what is happening\u201d. Since then, many French women have said that the #MeToo movement in their country has fallen short, and failed to catalyse any real change. The same handwringing and warnings against feminist extremism resurfaced around the Polanski controversy. When asked about Polanski in an interview last weekend, French actor Isabelle Huppert tried to dodge the question. Huppert, 66, eventually responded by saying, \u201cLynching is a type of pornography\u201d, citing William Faulkner \u2013 although there does not seem to be any credible source that attributes such a phrase to the US writer. Huppert was not alone. Fanny Ardant, 70, was among many actors to defend Polanski, highlighting a generational divide not only among women but within the film industry itself.

Of course, not all older women condemn #MeToo just as not all young women support it, but the lines being drawn in France have increasingly landed around age.

This separation between a public figure\u2019s personal life and their work, while shocking to some outsiders, is not always a bad thing when it comes to avoiding the puritanical traps that persist elsewhere. Philandering is of course not a crime, but there is a tradition in the French public and press alike to ignore \u2013 or briefly mock and then ignore \u2013 the checkered personal lives of powerful men. For certain men who achieve \u201cgenius\u201d status in French culture, even Nazi collaboration isn\u2019t enough to dislodge them from their pedestal. Take, for instance, the writer Louis-Ferdinand Destouches, known as C\u00e9line. He was always a vocal antisemite, but new evidence shows that he reported at least seven Jewish people or Resistance members to the Nazi regime during the French occupation. He even carried out multiple missions for the Gestapo, according to Nazi officers. After a brief stint in prison and more bestselling books, C\u00e9line has posthumously remained a celebrated author and a mainstay on the French baccalaureate exam. Polanski\u2019s defenders in France are numerous, and the theme of \u201cdistinguishing the man from his art\u201d filled dozens of pages in magazines and newspapers as soon as his film came out. And yet this division of the artist and his work is something that young women increasingly refuse to put up with. Activists organised protests in front of cinemas screening Polanski\u2019s film and papered Paris with protest signs such as \u201cPolanski raped. You applauded\u201d.

      "body": "<p>At the end of January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/george-benjamin\">George Benjamin</a> turned 60. A composer who is also a fine conductor is in the useful position of being able to take charge of his own birthday concert, and Benjamin\u2019s programme with the Philharmonia was a belated celebration. Two of his own works were included, alongside pieces by his close friend, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/09/oliver-knussen-obituary\">Oliver Knussen</a>, and by his teacher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/05/olivier-messiaen-centenary\">Olivier Messiaen</a>. Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s joyously brassy Sinfonietta was the finale.</p> <p>Benjamin\u2019s recent output has been dominated by opera, and both of his pieces included here connect obliquely or directly to those projects. Dream of the Song, settings of Lorca and two 11th-century Hebrew poets for countertenor and women\u2019s chorus, was composed in 2015 for Bejun Mehta, who created the role of the Boy in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/08/written-on-skin-review\">Written on Skin</a>, Benjamin\u2019s first full-length stage work. It seems a sensual retreat from the menace and violence of the opera, wrapping the solo voice (the outstanding <a href=\"http://www.jdahall.com/\">James Hall</a> here) in layers of gorgeous, shimmering textures.</p> <p>The 2008 Duet for piano and orchestra preceded the composition of that opera, and its sequence of sparely scored, crisply focused episodes now seems a clearing of the musical decks for the work to come, concentrating on dramatic essentials rather than exploiting the virtuosity of <a href=\"https://pierrelaurentaimard.com/\">Pierre-Laurent Aimard</a>, for whom it was written, and who contributed the Messiaen too \u2013 a typically brilliant account of Le Merle Bleu (The Blue Rock Thrush) from the Catalogue d\u2019Oiseaux.</p> <p>The concert had begun with Knussen \u2013 the rarely performed Choral, composed in 1970 when he was 17. It\u2019s a dark processional for a huge wind band with percussion and double basses; as Benjamin showed, it now makes a sombre memorial to a composer whose loss is still so keenly felt.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At the end of January George Benjamin turned 60. A composer who is also a fine conductor is in the useful position of being able to take charge of his own birthday concert, and Benjamin\u2019s programme with the Philharmonia was a belated celebration. Two of his own works were included, alongside pieces by his close friend, the late Oliver Knussen, and by his teacher, Olivier Messiaen. Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s joyously brassy Sinfonietta was the finale. Benjamin\u2019s recent output has been dominated by opera, and both of his pieces included here connect obliquely or directly to those projects. Dream of the Song, settings of Lorca and two 11th-century Hebrew poets for countertenor and women\u2019s chorus, was composed in 2015 for Bejun Mehta, who created the role of the Boy in Written on Skin, Benjamin\u2019s first full-length stage work. It seems a sensual retreat from the menace and violence of the opera, wrapping the solo voice (the outstanding James Hall here) in layers of gorgeous, shimmering textures. The 2008 Duet for piano and orchestra preceded the composition of that opera, and its sequence of sparely scored, crisply focused episodes now seems a clearing of the musical decks for the work to come, concentrating on dramatic essentials rather than exploiting the virtuosity of Pierre-Laurent Aimard, for whom it was written, and who contributed the Messiaen too \u2013 a typically brilliant account of Le Merle Bleu (The Blue Rock Thrush) from the Catalogue d\u2019Oiseaux. The concert had begun with Knussen \u2013 the rarely performed Choral, composed in 1970 when he was 17. It\u2019s a dark processional for a huge wind band with percussion and double basses; as Benjamin showed, it now makes a sombre memorial to a composer whose loss is still so keenly felt.",

You often hear footballers reflect on that when playing Grand Finals at the ground. The difference there is that those players are conditioned to playing in front of tens of thousands of people every week. That\u2019s not the case in this occasion; this is radically different to the norm. </p> <p>\u201cYou need to use it,\u201d says Lisa Sthalekar about the gigantic crowd. \u201cIf you feel that pressure it shows you can. But you have to try and find a way to stay calm.\u201d <br></p> <p>Of course, as Anjum Chopra adds, India did play in the Lord\u2019s World Cup Final in 2017. I was there that day (on the OBO, as it happens) and it is reflected upon often what a landmark day it was. The women in blue did not hold their nerve on that occasion, losing six wickets in a hurry to fall just short. Can they draw on that experience today?

For the fifth time, Australia are T20 world champions. The Australian skipper takes the trophy from Belinda Clark - another lovely moment. Job done. Meg Lanning speaks. \u201cWe\u2019ve had ups and downs and scraped through the semi-final but to put in that performance on the biggest day of our careers is something we can be very proud of.\u201d Lovely stuff. \u201cIt was tough after we lost that first game, there were a lot of expectations on us from the outside and the inside.\u201d Doing it without Perry too - \u201ca very special group\u201d to go to Plan B and C. \u201cJust as much a part of this as anyone else.\u201d Schutt outstanding: \u201cThat wicket up front really set it up.\u201d Says she never thought she would be part of something like this at the \u2018G. Harmanpreet Kaur speaks. The Indian captain says they were outstanding in the league stage but struggled in the field tonight early on. She doubles down on that saying that fielding is the main issue and they need to improve if they are going to take the next step. \u201cBut future is great for us.\u201d That it is. Asked about a women\u2019s IPL and cricket for girls in India, she says that they are hoping for more games in the women\u2019s challenge and is advocating for more teams to be invited to that. More runs than anyone in a T20 World Cup campaign, capped with an unbeaten 78 in the victory tonight. \u201cI don\u2019t have any words,\u201d she says off the top after taking a deep breath. She\u2019s such a gem. \u201cFortunately Midge makes my life pretty easy up top hitting the ball as well as she does.\u201d Humble, as ever. \u201cWe knew what went wrong in that first game against India, we just didn\u2019t execute out plans. So to come out tonight and conribute with bat, ball and the field was outstanding. And to have the support of 87,000 behind us was pretty unreal as well.\u201d Go you good thing. There was no doubt. She\u2019s talking to Mel Jones at the presentation. \u201cThat was unbelievable!\u201d Healy begins. \u201cThank you everyone! You cannot wipe the smile off my face. Even if we lost the game tonight I still would have been smiling. I never thought we would get an opportunity like this in my career - maybe in 20 years time. This really was something special.\u201d She says that her midsummer slump did not worry her and was able to ride the wave and enjoy the tournament - especially in front of the massive MCG crowd. Adds some nice words about Beth Mooney, her opening partner. \u201cHopefully we can stay together for a lot longer.\u201d Stick with the OBO through the presentation. We can\u2019t be far away from hearing from the captains the players of the match and tournament. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hello Tanya Wintringham. \u201cCongratulations to you and your partner on the birth of your gorgeous Winnie - she\u2019s beautiful! Watching the girls and young women in the crowd at the G loving what\u2019s going on makes my heart so glad. Whether or not Winnie likes cricket, it\u2019s so good that she lives in a world that this game and this crowd exists. Go well (cross-cricket-podcast- pollination).\u201d Exactly this. When we were at Lord\u2019s in 2017 for the final, a defining component of it was how the crowd didn\u2019t sound like a normal, blokey cricket audience. I suspect there\u2019ll be a lot of that commentary in the analysis of tonight. CA have invested a lot of time and money in trying to grow the game with women and girls and this has been the biggest moment yet on that mission. And thank you for the kind words about Winnie! For today, I decked her out in Katy Perry clobber we were gifted. Whether she likes the game or not, I\u2019m thrilled she\u2019ll have the option. PS - GO WELL! And Geoff\u2019s match report from the \u2018G. More to come soon from him. Good egg (and Guardian columnist!) Megan Schutt is on TV. \u201cI was crapping my dacks,\u201d she says in reference to how she felt before today. She\u2019s the absolute best. \u201cWe were all so happy to be here. To have this many people here was incredible and we just wanted to enjoy the ride.\u201d That they did. WHAT. A. CROWD. Poonam Yadav was the final wicket to fall. From the first ball of the final over, holing out to midwicket, taken by Ash Gardner. Another fine piece of fielding to complete the job. Schutt and Jonassen - once again, quite magnificent. Australia have now claimed this trophy five times, tonight in front of nearly 87,000 people. India all-out for 99. They win by 85 runs. Schutt finishes with 4/18. 19th over: India 99-9 (Poonam 0, Radha 1) Target 185 When it mattered at the start of this defence, Lanning threw the ball to Schutt and Jonassen. They now hae 6/38 between them with Schutt about to bowl the final over of the game. Tremendous. Between overs, the Cricket Ground DJ plays Zombie Nation. Respect to you. Another snaffle for Mooney! Straight to her at mid-on. Jonassen joins Schutt with 3/18. Australia are one wicket away from bowling India out in a World Cup final. 18th over: India 97-8 (Poonam 0, Radha 1) Target 185 Megan Schutt has 3/18 making 12 wickets for the tournament, the most in the competition by two. And still with an over to go - provided they don\u2019t bowl them out in the 19th, that is. Two in three balls for Schutt! She started this in the first over and she determined to finish it herself as well. Carey takes it safely at mid-on. Clinical. Too good. What a top catch! Mooney once again, running off the circle at cover running backwards and taking it over her head. They have been so good in the field. 17th over: India 92-6 (Richa 14, Shikha 1) Target 185 The final attendance is 86,174. So, they fall short of breaking the World Record but they have very much filled the MCG tonight. A tremendously positive story. Well done, Melbourne. And it\u2019s Mooney with the catch! Down at long-on, the has to move forward to stick the landing and does precisely that. They\u2019re been excellent in all departments. Nic Carey has had a good tournament and now has a World Cup Final wicket. 16th over: India 88-5 (Deepti 33, Richa 12) Target 185 Jonassen just keeps on keeping on: angling in, turning away. She sums up why these Australian bowlers are so imposing: they\u2019re well-drilled and rarely have a bad day. Meanwhile, I really want one of those giant Beth Mooney heads that I can see in the crowd. 15th over: India 81-5 (Deepti 28, Richa 10) Target 185 Nearly a run out! But the throw needed to be to the non-strikers\u2019 end. Kimmince finishes with 1/17. Superb. Can Australia bowl them out in the final five overs? That\u2019ll be Lanning\u2019s approach. 14th over: India 76-5 (Deepti 25, Richa 8) Target 185 More excellence in the field, this time from Jonassen making a dive-and-flick down at long-off to turn four into two. Deepti takes an even bigger swing at the next Carey offering, a fat outside edge racing away to the rope. Nine of the over. For what little it is worth, India require 18 an over from here - or 109 from 36 deliveries, if you prefer. 13th over: India 67-5 (Deepti 17, Richa 7) Target 185 \u201cThere in a nutshell is the difference,\u201d says Harsha Bhogle as Ash Gardner completes a brilliant diving drop on the deep midwicket boundary. Nicely put. \u201cThey have lifted their game for the big occasion.\u201d Earlier in the Molineux over, Richa struck a nice drive through cover for four. All good experience for India\u2019s other 16-year-old. As I hinted a couple of overs ago, this is the start of their story not the end. They\u2019ll win trophies soon. 12th over: India 58-5 (Deepti 15, Richa 0) Target 185 Two runs and the wicket from Kimmince\u2019s third over. She\u2019s got a long way to go yet on her international journey. Top take! Jonassen, running back with the flight at mid off, takes the tough chance above her head. Kimmince gets her name in the book, rewarded again for those changes of pace she is so excellent at executing. I still can\u2019t believe she was on the bench and out of the starting XI through the middle stages of this tournament. 11th over: India 56-4 (Deepti 14, Krishnamurthy 18) Target 185 Shafali Verma is on the TV broadcast with her head hidden inside her shirt behind her hands - gutted. It\u2019s a poor way for her own tournament to end tonight - the dropped catch off Healy in the first over and falling third ball in the chase - but what a time of it she has had. At 16 years of age, she is going to dominate the women\u2019s game for a long time. They will go to New Zealand for the ODI World Cup next year on the second line of favouritism alongside England, only behind Australia in the pecking order. 10th over: India 51-4 (Deepti 13, Krishnamurthy 14) Target 185 Molineux has been such a great addition to this XI during the business end of the tournament. After a tough 12 months where she has missed a lot of cricket through injury, and some time away from the game with a mental health break, she\u2019s back to her best here. 9th over: India 46-4 (Deepti 11, Krishnamurthy 11) Target 185 The Mexican Wave goes around the MCG, another of those famous old traditions at the place after dark; so impressive when it is full to capacity with the top deck following on slightly behind the bottom. Krishnamurthy gets Kimmince away past third man with a well-timed steer but India need three of those an over. 8th over: India 39-4 (Deepti 10, Krishnamurthy 5) Target 185 Carey\u2019s turn; the squeeze continues. Five singles, easy shopping for the Australians. But knowing Meg Lanning, she will be turning her attention to how they can bowl India out from here. With Bhatia retired hurt, they probably need five wickets and the Australian skipper is ruthless like that. It\u2019s part of her charm as a leader. 7th over: India 34-4 (Deepti 9, Krishnamurthy 1) Target 185 Welcome to the accumulation overs of an ill-fated chase. This is a scenario these dominant Australians know so well from their various bilateral series around the world, striking during the power play with the ball then sucking the life out of the opposition once the field goes out. Molineux has 1/7 from her two overs. \u201cWhat a wonderfully competitive World Cup,\u201d emails Arun V, looking at the big picture. \u201cNo team has been able to breath easy from the first match till the last.\u201d Spot on. This is a landslide win for Australia but let\u2019s not forget how close the were to not making it here and how close and competitive the comp has been overall. 6th over: India 32-4 (Deepti 8, Krishnamurthy 0) Target 185 Krishnamurthy is a fine player with a cool head but she\u2019s there to finish the innings for India, not rehabilitate it. Six runs and the huge wicket of Harmanpreet to close out the power play; Jonassen has 2/11 so far from her two. India\u2019s required run rate is just on 11. In case there as any doubt, that\u2019s absolutely game over. A fine take by Gardner running around at midwicket, taking the catch just inside the rope. Harmanpreet tried to sweep Jonassen but didn\u2019t quite get the contact she needed. The spinner has two wickets and India have lost their four best players inside the power play. 5th over: India 26-3 (Harmanpreet 0, Deepti 7) Target 185 Excellent captaincy from Lanning to get Kimmince on to help the squeeze, her raft of slower balls so difficult to get away when trying to chase quick runs - as India must from here; the required rate is already above 10. It\u2019s an excellent over, going for just three. Harmanpreet is on strike for the final over of the power play. At least Harmanpreet is on strike for it - the captain has only faced three deliveries so far. 4th over: India 23-3 (Harmanpreet 0, Deepti 5) Target 185 Deepti, in at five but essentially No6 with Bhatia having also retired hurt, does nicely to glance a boundary from her first ball. But sure enough, the left-arm tweaker gives her nothing after that. During the week, Molineux talked about going to the MCG to watch her Collingwood football team play along 80-90,000 others. What a joy for her tonight to be part of the action rather than watching in the stands. Disaster for India! Mandhana miscues Molineux\u2019s first ball into the hands of Carey at mid-off! Lanning gives is BIG in celebration - she knows this is all-but done. 3rd over: India 18-2 (Mandhana 11, Harmanpreet 0) Target 185 It\u2019s not ovestating it to say that this partnership is all that stands between Australia and a fifth World Cup in this format. Mandhana and Harmapreet have barely made a run between them in this competition but they are both proven matchwinners of considerable talent and experience. They know exactly what they need to do. The question is whether they will be given any room to move from these Australian bowlers. Mandhana, having faced just three balls in the first two overs, is now able to take advantage of the field being up with a crisp drive over cover - great timing - then steering a second boundary behind point. That\u2019s an even better shot. It\u2019s a start. A second young gun falls, Rodrigues picking out Carey on the circle at mid-on! Easy as you like. Jonassen is in the book and Australia are all over India. 2nd over: India 8-2 (Mandhana 2) Target 185 Missing a sweep of Jonassen, the No3 is hit on the side of the helmet on the edge of the grille. After talking to the medical staff, she is taken off the field. 1st over: India 3-1 (Mandhana 0, Bhatia 1) Target 185 Oh my, that\u2019s nearly two in the first over! Bhatia miscues to cover, the ball falling just short. But she\u2019s off the mark. This is precisely what Lanning wanted when batting first at the toss: get a decent score then unleash her most accurate bowlers during the power play. Schutt is such a clever bowler, as Nasser notes on TV, dragging her length back to Verma to prompt the error. Gone second ball! After making score after score in this tournament the young superstar opener has edged the third delivery of the chase into the gloves of Healy. Schutt has sorted her out with hoop, the opener trying to steer the swing but nicking instead. She\u2019s gutted. And that\u2019s a great take up to the stumps. Some wonderful women are in the middle of the MCG, recognised for their contributions to the game. They include the mighty Mithali Raj, who hasn\u2019t retired yet, Karen Rolton, Clare Connor, Cathryn Fitzpatrick, Lottie Edwards... the list goes on. Superstars and pioneers, the lot of them. They form a guard of honour for the teams as they return to the field for India\u2019s innings. Here we go! Shafali Verma is already the No1 T20 player in the world at age 16; the youngest player to ever turn out in a World Cup final. She\u2019s facing the first ball of this chase, to be bowled by Megan Schutt. They require 185 to win the World Cup. PLAY! We\u2019ll talk about that Healy innings for a long time. From the moment she walked out to the middle, with a smile on her face, her intention was clear with three boundaries in the first over. She bettered that after passing 50, clouting three sixes in a row in the 11th over to ensure that Austalia would be finishing with a considerable tally, even after she fell for 74 off 39. Sure enough, Mooney did as she does so consistently, batting through the innings for an unbeaten 78 off 54. But the game isn\u2019t over yet. Not on that surface; not with India\u2019s top four. Stay tuned. 20th over: Australia 184-4 (Mooney 78, Carey 5) Carey pulls Radha in the air and Rodrigues puts in a huge dive but it isn\u2019t quite enough to drag it in. But that\u2019s the only delivery they manage to properly get away in this final over. Indeed, the innings finishes with a bye when Carey misses everything. Australia have set India a daunting 185 but that\u2019s a fraction short of what they looked on track for. To the credit of Poonam she\u2019s got out of that over well and picked up a wicket along the way. Earlier, Mooney played her with contempt, smashing a wrong\u2019un through midwicket for four before making it seven off two with a steer. But Haynes, still new at the crease, misjudged her pull shot and chopped on. As Harsha notes on telly, India chased 177 in the tri-series before this World Cup. 19th over: Australia 176-4 (Mooney 76, Carey 0) 18th over: Australia 167-3 (Mooney 68, Haynes 3) Shikha has been punished across her three overs so far tonight and Mooney adds to that pain with an ostentatious boundary... reverse paddling, would you call that? Whatever it was, she beats Bhatia\u2019s gloves with complete control, the ball running away for four. Ten off the over. With 12 balls to go, 190 is still well within touching distance for the hosts. \u201cHi, this is Nigam from New Delhi.\u201d Welcom! \u201cMy twelve year old daughter says we can still win this game. The optimism of youth startles me.\u201d I salute her. Why would you give up with all this time to go? Keep your head up, Nigam. Gardner dances at Deepti but misses the straighter one, Bhatia doing the rest behind the stumps. Two wickets in the over for India! And not for nothing, either: it might be the difference between them chasing 200 or 180. 17th over: Australia 157-3 (Mooney 60, Haynes 1) Not that you ever want to see the back of Meg Lanning, but with 22 deliveries to go, I\u2019m pleased to see Gardner walking out there. The skipper is caught at square leg after trying to open up the legside before the ball was bowled. No worries. 16th over: Australia 154-1 (Mooney 60, Lanning 16) Fantastic shot from Mooney to start Radha\u2019s new over, getting down on one knee to sweep with style through the through the air and into the gap at midwidwicket. The spinner pushes the next one through but misses her target, Mooney able to help it around the corner for four more. Easy pickings; beyond 150 they go. Harmanpreet looks stressed. 15th over: Australia 142-1 (Mooney 50, Lanning 14) So consistent, so good: Beth Mooney to her 50 in 41 balls. What more can you ask for in an opener? Michael Clarke says they should get 200 from here and that feels about right. What a lasting memory that would leave for this gigantic crowd. Five overs to go. 14th over: Australia 135-1 (Mooney 48, Lanning 10) Just when India looked like half a chance to applying some pressure on Australia, the captain carves Deepti into the gap for four. What a technician she is. And Mooney follows her in, using her feet as she has so well this tournament, getting to the pitch and striking sweetly for four more over cover. She\u2019s played her role to perfection so far. 13th over: Australia 123-1 (Mooney 41, Lanning 5) Shot, Meg. Lanning is off the mark with a perfectly-positioned sweep off the first ball of Gayakwad final over. The spinner bounces back well though, banking four dots across the next five. 12th over: Australia 117-1 (Mooney 40, Lanning 0) Radha Yadav has been superb for India over the last two years and she\u2019s found the wicket to put the brakes on Australia, if briefly. They have to turn Healy\u2019s wicket into two or three in a hurry. Specifically, they can\u2019t let Mooney bat through the innings, as she does so often. The end of a mighty innings, the MCG standing as one in recognition. After blasting five sixes, she couldn\u2019t make it a sixth, holing out to long-on. 75 in 39 balls, supreme short-form batting. No ton, but her job is well and truly done. 11th over: Australia 114-0 (Healy 75, Mooney 37) SIX MORE! This pair go to their 100 stand with Healy\u2019s third SIX. She doesn\u2019t middle it, just clearing mid-on, but it still reads the same in the book. AND SHE GOES AGAIN! Flatbatting Shika over long-off, there\u2019s nobody stopping that. Goodness me, what tremendous batting this is. AND SIX MORE! THREE IN A ROW! CARNAGE! It\u2019s the best of the night - inside out over cover. \u201cAn absolute beauty!\u201d roars Michael Clarke. \u201cThat\u2019s as good as you\u2019ll ever see, man or woman.\u201d Australia have one hand on the World Cup. 10th over: Australia 91-0 (Healy 57, Mooney 32) Mitch Starc lit up the MCG on World Cup Final day in 2015 and it his wife, Alyssa Healy, is doing precisely the same tonight! She\u2019s to her half-century with her seventh four - straight back over Radha\u2019s head - to go with two sixes, reaching the mark in just 30 balls. What a performance, with enough time to double it and get to 100. India are reeling. 9th over: Australia 79-0 (Healy 49, Mooney 29) Nine off Poonam\u2019s second over - they\u2019re not letting her settle here. It\u2019s Mooney taking the authority this time around, getting to the pitch and depositing her over mid-on. There\u2019s only one way for India to control the carnage here: wickets, two of them, immediately. 8th over: Australia 70-0 (Healy 47, Mooney 23) So much for accumulation! Healy goes BANG, BANG! Gayakwad ended the power play well for India so the Australian opener responds by popping her into the crowd, 83 metres over long-on! The biggest SIX of the competition! And does it again next up, albeit not quite as clean a hit, but sufficient to get over the rope. 16 off the over. She\u2019s 47 from 27. 7th over: Australia 54-0 (Healy 32, Mooney 22) We saw Amelia Kerr crack the code with Poonam\u2019s slow, loopy leg spin in the group stage - making room, shovelling over fine leg. Will Healy do something similar? Not initially - they exchange singles to the sweepers on the off-side. She\u2019s landed her first two wrong\u2019uns of the night, which was the delivery that picked up three Australian wickets in Sydney to begin the competition. Five singles are their lot here - no risks, no worries. 6th over: Australia 49-0 (Healy 28, Mooney 18) To the credit of Gayakwad, she\u2019s got India out of that power play nicely - just two singles. So, Australia are off to a flyer, no doubt. But they get Poonam Yadav on having pegged it back just a bit. 5th over: Australia 47-0 (Healy 28, Mooney 18) Beth\u2019s turn! She ends Shikha\u2019s second over with back to back boundaries, steering past third man then hammering off the back foot through extra cover. Supreme timing. 4th over: Australia 37-0 (Healy 28, Mooney 9) Having had to fight so hard to make it onto this stage, Australia look liberated - batting with such freedom, Mooney to the pitch of Gayakwad, driving over cover for four. BUT SHE\u2019S DROPPED NEXT BALL! Beaten in flight, she gives a chance to the spinner, put down low in her follow through. It\u2019s not an easy catch, but still - both openers have been put down. Nerves everywhere. \u201cThis is wild here,\u201d Geoff Lemon tells me. \u201cIt is heaving.\u201d 3rd over: Australia 32-0 (Healy 28, Mooney 4) Deepti for her second, Healy lifting her over midwicket for a couple. She is flying, no doubt, but not middling everything. But she won\u2019t mind too much given we\u2019re in this power play with the field out. Mooney takes the alternative approach from the penultimate delivery, taking a clever quick single into the off-side. Super batting. Back to Healy to finish who helps a poor delivery on its way down the legside for her sixth boundary. 2nd over: Australia 23-0 (Healy 21, Mooney 2) Shikha Pandey, who has been so good in this tournament, in from the Great Southern Stand End. Mooney gives the strike staight back to Healy, who is straight onto the front foot once more, smashing the seamer straight back over her head for four. With that, Healy goes beyond 2000 T20I runs. And again later in the over, carving over cover for a fifth boundary in nine balls - she\u2019s already into the 20s. India need to settle. 1st over: Australia 14-0 (Healy 13, Mooney 1) \u201cA wonderful moment for the game,\u201d declares Ian Bishop as Deepti Sharma starts her approach. And it\u2019s a full toss to begin, given the treatment by Healy through midwicket - a boundary first ball. Nerves there, no doubt. She\u2019s too full again second up but the opener is happy to ease a single to mid-on. Mooney\u2019s turn and it\u2019s a third full toss to start - once again bunted down to mid-on, getting her off the mark. Shot! Deepti lands her off-break but it is far enough outside the off-stump for Healy to steer magnificently behind point, bisecting the two fielders on the circle. DROPPED AT COVER! Shafali Verma, the youngest player to ever turn out in a World Cup Final, has put Healy down at cover from the fifth ball! Ohhh, it\u2019s an easy chance too - it is all happening at the MCG! Sure enough, Healy takes full advantage: hammering a half-volley through cover to complete the set. Three boundaries and the dropped catch to start, then. I strongly suggest that, in addition to sticking with me, you find a television. Out walk Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney to open for Australia. WHAT A ROAR! We saw firewords in the first over of the previous World Cup Final held at the MCG five years ago, what India would give for a start like that here tonight. It\u2019ll be the off-spinner Deepti Sharma given the first over, from the Members\u2019 End. PLAY! The camera stops on Ellyse Perry. Proudly singing the national anthem with the team, retained in the squad despite suffering a tournament-ending hamstring injury. They know how important she is to be around the team. An email in from Abhijato Sensarma (you can send me one too): \u201cWishing a Happy Women\u2019s Day and best of luck to all the players and fans involved in this game. No matter what happens on the field today, let us hope that cricket is the winner. No matter who crosses the finishing line, let us hope that we have a match for the ages. And no matter who lifts the trophy, let us hope that we\u2019ll be glad for being here today.\u201d Out walk the players for the anthems. The MGC erupts in that familiar way. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t feel so revolutionary,\u201d writes JP Howcroft at Guardian HQ. \u201cBut it is.\u201d Perfectly put. And consider the implications for the women\u2019s game in India, too. Their World Cup run in 2017 just about got a Women\u2019s Indian Premier League over the line. If they can get the job done tonight, there\u2019s little doubt it\u2019ll happen. These are going to be iconic MCG images. Perry, now into Firework, is on the middle of a purple stage, in a purple dress with hundreds of young girls in purple outfits dancing in front of her. They\u2019ve truly nailed this. I was at the World Cup Final in Antigua two years ago and they belted out the tournament song before getting on with it. It\u2019s hard not to get swept up in the emotion of this. To think how far women\u2019s cricket has come in just the five years I\u2019ve been covering it. Billy Jean-King is on fronting a montage on the telly. \u201cWe are women,\u201d she declares... and out walks Katy Perry, flanked by a group of backup dancers dressed as cricket bats. She begins with Roar. This is so good. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit emotional,\u201d says Alyssa Healy on the TV coverage. \u201cTo see all these people celebrating International Women\u2019s Day is very special.\u201d There\u2019s something special too about being underneath the MCG knowing there are the better part of 100,000 people up above you ready to watch. You often hear footballers reflect on that when playing Grand Finals at the ground. The difference there is that those players are conditioned to playing in front of tens of thousands of people every week. That\u2019s not the case in this occasion; this is radically different to the norm. \u201cYou need to use it,\u201d says Lisa Sthalekar about the gigantic crowd. \u201cIf you feel that pressure it shows you can. But you have to try and find a way to stay calm.\u201d Of course, as Anjum Chopra adds, India did play in the Lord\u2019s World Cup Final in 2017. I was there that day (on the OBO, as it happens) and it is reflected upon often what a landmark day it was. The women in blue did not hold their nerve on that occasion, losing six wickets in a hurry to fall just short. Can they draw on that experience today? Has Harmanpreet saved her magical best for tonight? Interesting call batting first. Meg Lanning elected to bowl when India knocked them off in the opening game of this tournament. Then, it was Poonam Yadav ripping the home side apart, the 4\u201911\u201d leggie claiming four scalps. Well, the home side won\u2019t experience a nervous chase tonight, instead backing their batters to mount a big enough tally on a flat track to later squeeze their less experienced opponents with the ball when the flootlights take over. Makes sense to me. India: Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Jemimah Rodrigues, Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Veda Krishnamurthy, Deepti Sharma, Shikha Pandey, Radha Yadav, Poonam Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad. Australia: Alyssa Healy (wk), Beth Mooney, Meg Lanning (c), Jess Jonassen, Ashleigh Gardner, Rachael Haynes, Nicola Carey, Sophie Molineux, Georgia Wareham, Delissa Kimmince, Megan Schutt. Harmanpreet Kaur says her mum is in the stands. It is the Indian captain\u2019s birthday today, turning 31. She debuted at the inaugual edition of this tournament back in 2009 and tonight leads her side to a second global final in three year. They are unchanged from their semi-final win. \u201cWe are as ready as we can be. We are going to have to play our best game.\u201d She can\u2019t believe the crowd. Who will hold their nerve on this enormous stage? We aren\u2019t far away from the toss, brought forward by ten minutes for the Katy Perry pre-game show. The previous World Record is 90,185. That\u2019s the mark for the biggest women\u2019s sporting event of all time, from the football World Cup Final of 1999 in California. Don\u2019t doubt the determination of Melbourne\u2019s sporting public to top that tonight. And if you\u2019re at home wondering if there is still room there is. Additional standing room tickets were released today. Part of what makes the MCG so special are the standing room bays, so don\u2019t let that dissuade you. I\u2019m experiencing some pretty fierce FOMO from the other side of the world, make no mistake. If you are in the \u2018G, drop me a line and tell me what you\u2019ve seen on the way in. Tell us your story. When it was announced last year that the aim was to fill the MCG for this global decider, the response surprised me: it was generally accepted that this was a perfectly reasonable objective and one that would be achieved. Especially if Australia made it. Compare that to three years ago when the goal to pack out Lord\u2019s was put out there the ODI World Cup and it was laughed at it some quarters. As history shows, HQ was at capacity that day and the wonderful word from Melbourne this evening is that the World Record is every chance to go tonight. Talk about a big three years - indeed, a massive five years - for the women\u2019s game around the world. The promise of the massive investment had been realised long before now but this International Women\u2019s Day moment truly is something else. And it\u2019s the dream final for tournament organisers too, the hosts and defending champions up against their nemesis India. Everything about this is huge. Stick with the OBO as we preview the match while keeping an eye on what I am certain will be a spectauclar pre-game show with Katy Perry. Buckle up!",

      "bodyText": "Layla Moran has revealed she plans to run for leadership of the Liberal Democrats, saying the party needs to \u201cmove on from the last decade\u201d. The former teacher, who has been an MP since 2017, would mark a break from the party\u2019s years in coalition with the Tories from 2010 to 2015. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Ridge on Sunday, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she would put climate change and electoral reform at the heart of her agenda. \u201cI want to lead and empower the Liberal Democrats to fight for this future and to grow our support, so that we can make people\u2019s lives better. I want the party to be in a position to win power within a generation, so that we can bring about the change our country so desperately needs,\u201d she said. Moran, who recently came out as pansexual, has previously been critical of former leader Jo Swinson, saying the 2019 election campaign was \u201carrogant\u201d. She had been expected to run for the leadership in 2019 but withdrew after it emerged she had slapped her then boyfriend in 2013 at the party\u2019s conference. Her rivals are likely to include Ed Davey, the former energy secretary, who is currently acting leader and lost out to Swinson in 2019. The first candidate to declare was Wera Hobhouse, the MP for Bath since 2017, who entered the race saying she wanted a \u201cclean break\u201d with the coalition era. Other potential candidates include Daisy Cooper, the St Albans MP, who has only been an MP since December.",

      "body": "<p>Seven teenage girls are falling over themselves with laughter. They\u2019re meant to be posing for a picture, but it\u2019s a bit like photographing a box of puppies \u2013 they can\u2019t keep still, pawing and hugging and joking, and bursting into coordinated dance moves. Someone puts on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Brown Skin Girl, and her lyrics could hardly be more apt: \u201cYour skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story/ Keep dancing, they can\u2019t control you\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne still one, please,\u201d begs the photographer. But this is the cast of the film <em>Rocks</em>, a celebration of female friendship in east London \u2013 and they are unstoppable. They pull peace signs, stick out their tongues. They keep laughing.</p> <p><em>Rocks</em> is directed by Sarah Gavron, and if it seems a world away from her last hit, 2015\u2019s period drama <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/07/suffragette-review-votes-women-carey-mulligan-abi-morgan-bonham-carter\" title=\"\">Suffragette</a></em>, both reflect her mission to put the lives of women in the spotlight. A collaborative project, co-written by Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson, <em>Rocks </em>tells a fictional story developed through workshops with teenage girls from east London, and its cast are largely non-professional actors making their screen debuts. The girls improvised the dialogue while two cameras rolled, giving <em>Rocks</em> a documentary-style feel and a tang of authenticity.</p> <p>The story focuses on Rocks, a British-Nigerian teenager played by Bukky Bakray, who lives on an estate in Hackney. When her mum, struggling with mental health issues, takes off, Rocks is left to look after her little brother \u2013 and fears they\u2019ll be taken into care and separated if anyone finds out. As pressure mounts, she struggles to keep things together.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/rocks-review-high-school-east-london-film\">Rocks review \u2013 high school drama is an energetic five-star triumph</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Peter Bradshaw anointed <em>Rocks </em>the best film at Toronto film festival, describing the film-making as \u201cin the spirit of Ken Loach\u2019s <em>Kes</em> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/21/celine-sciamma-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire\" title=\"\">C\u00e9line Sciamma</a>\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/10/girlhood-gritty-teen-life-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">Girlhood</a></em>. It\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s the opposite of miserablist.\u201d It\u2019s true that the story is heart-wrenching, but the film as a whole builds an exhilarating portrait of loyal, loving female friendship and its vibrant, natural young cast offer a joyful snapshot of London teenagers, far from the gritty drama or poverty porn you might expect from a bald synopsis.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an empowering and powerful film,\u201d says 16-year-old Kosar Ali, who plays Rocks\u2019s best friend, Sumaya. \u201cIt shows what people go through \u2013 how women of colour are taught to have a hard exterior. But Rocks\u2019s journey and everything she goes through, and how powerful she is with friends by her side\u2026 it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>From the start, Gavron\u2019s plan was \u201cto make a film <em>with</em> girls rather than about them\u201d. We chat while all seven are getting ready for their photoshoot: eating chips, winding each other\u2019s headscarves, mock-pouting for selfies once their makeup is done. They grin and wave if they hear their names mentioned. Gavron wanted the film-making process to be as non-hierarchical as possible: a true collaboration with other women. So she, with Ikoko and Wilson, plus associate director Anu Henriques and casting director Lucy Pardee \u2013 who had cast non-professionals for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/13/fish-tank-andrea-arnold-french\" title=\"\">Fish Tank</a> </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/16/american-honey-review-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">American Honey</a> </em>\u2013 worked together to find the right girls, and the right story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ca25034b036ff0a249db940cf93a384cde4b602\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca25034b036ff0a249db940cf93a384cde4b602/0_0_2247_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In a scene from Rocks (left to right): Kosar Ali, Anastasia Dymitrow, Bukky Bakray behind Tawheda Begum (in headscarf ) and Afi Okaidja\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In a scene from Rocks (left to right): Kosar Ali, Anastasia Dymitrow, Bukky Bakray behind Tawheda Begum (in headscarf ) and Afi Okaidja.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Film Company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a case of going into youth clubs, into schools, and absorbing what the girls were talking about, what life was like,\u201d says Gavron. \u201cIt was like a documentary research process. And quickly we noticed that friendship is everything for girls at that age.\u201d</p> <p>They began nine months of development workshops in 2017 with potential cast members mostly from years 8 and 9 from girls\u2019 schools in Hackney and Newham. The stars were chosen not just for their ability to light up the screen, but their ability to light up each other: in no time they formed friendships that the film-makers were desperate to can.</p> <p>\u201cWhat you see in <em>Rocks </em>is real, it\u2019s not a video. It\u2019s real life,\u201d says Bakray, a British-Nigerian 17-year-old who, despite never having acted before, inhabits the title role with a rare mix of warm humour and wounded vulnerability. Bakray lives on an estate in Hackney, close to many of the locations around Dalston where <em>Rocks</em> was shot, and goes to a girl\u2019s school in the area. She was born and raised in London by first-generation immigrant Christian parents, the youngest of four \u2013 and her three older brothers reflect a creative streak in the family too, one working in graphic design and another designing clothing.</p> <p>On screen, she and Ali have a touching friendship and it\u2019s a delight to find that they do in real life, too: their affection fills the room. \u201cMe and Bukky, we\u2019re like this\u201d \u2013 Ali mimes them being drawn together with her hands, fingers interlacing. \u201cShe\u2019s at my house, like, three days a week.\u201d Gavron visited Ali\u2019s home, in Newham in east London, in the run-up to shooting \u2013 and it formed the model for Sumaya\u2019s bustling, love-filled home, with a concerned mother and caring older siblings forming a stark contrast to Rocks\u2019s isolation. In real life, Ali is also from a large British-Somalian Muslim family; like Bakray, she was born in the UK to first-generation immigrant parents.</p> <p>From the first workshop, the two girls were inseparable. \u201cVibes.

And adults are big teenagers!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEspecially when you\u2019re young, your creativity is wild,\u201d points out Ali. \u201cAdults are missing out on that because they don\u2019t want to listen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to give young people a chance to speak,\u201d Bakray says.

Recent figures show that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/31/youth-work-cuts-young-people-councils\" title=\"\">youth services in England and Wales</a> have faced 70% real-terms cuts between 2011 and 2019, with local authorities slashing \u00a31bn of spending on youth services over that time. Across the country, 750 youth centres have closed; 104 have shut in London alone since 2011. \u201cWe are stripping away their resources,\u201d says Gavron. \u201cYouth centres are precious places, and there\u2019s so few of them now. They\u2019re living in really tough times.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqXhMYjasHM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CqXhMYjasHM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/CqXhMYjasHM\">Watch a trailer for Rocks</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s clear the girls look up to Gavron. Part mentor, part mum figure, she recalls being hoarse at the end of every day\u2019s filming, from shouting at them to take their headphones out and listen. But she also adds that she became \u201cmore admiring\u201d of the girls as the shoot went on: \u201cThey\u2019ve got such energy, but they\u2019ve also got this initiative and tenacity. They are this amazing mix of children and adults \u2013 which is also often funny inadvertently,\u201d she smiles.</p> <p>One memorable scene in <em>Rocks </em>is a massive food fight during a cookery class. They only did one take, and Gavron instructed them to really go for it \u2013 which they did, cake mix flying and people slipping over in the mess. Gavron had noticed during the research phase how young people use humour as a coping mechanism. \u201cSitting in the back of a class, we really noticed that even if a girl had told us privately that something difficult was going on at home, they\u2019d be sitting there cracking jokes, laughing, finding joy.\u201d This slipping between hilarity and heartbreak is a defining feature of the final movie.</p> <p>Cinema so rarely really reflects girls\u2019 friendships, says Claire Wilson. \u201cFilms tend to lean towards the romantic, or girls being bitches. I watched a ton of those [growing up], but they always made me feel bad about myself.\u201d </p> <p>Equally important for Ali and Bakray is seeing diversity on screen. \u201cIn TV, the best friend is white and then the second friend is a person of colour,\u201d points out Bakray. \u201cWe have two main protagonists who are people of colour, and the whole friendship group is a mixture of ethnicities.\u201d</p> <p>While Ali is British-Somalian co-star Anastasia Dymitrow has Polish Romani heritage, and Afi Okaidja is London born to Congolese and Ghanaian parents. One of the few boys who in the film declares himself \u201cChinese-Jamaican-Ukrainian-English.\u201d The film-makers did not need to engineer this mix. \u201cIt\u2019s literally just a reflection of London today,\u201d says Ikoko. She was determined to portray the Hackney she knew, full of life and colour and heat. \u201cIt\u2019s a place of community \u2013 it\u2019s not just a cool place to hang out on a Friday night, and it\u2019s not just a place where people get shot and sell drugs.\u201d</p> <p>So watching <em>Rocks</em> \u2013 once they\u2019d got over the cringe-factor (\u201cI wanted to punch myself\u201d Ali deadpans) \u2013 was refreshing, even to its own stars.</p> <p>\u201cI never saw a representation of myself on screen,\u201d says Ali, frankly. \u201cI\u2019m Muslim, and the storylines for me are: you\u2019re a terrorist, or you\u2019re a victim.\u201d It depresses her that depictions of London tend to focus on violence and how any story about young black people will be lazily dubbed \u201curban\u201d (\u201cI hate that whole category\u201d), and that there\u2019s so little range among the stories that do get told. \u201cImagine constantly looking at films and you\u2019re not depicted, you can\u2019t identify with characters \u2013 you\u2019re missing out on so much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"862f0a74fb35aed8a05cd7c1f28176b2bb75d5a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/862f0a74fb35aed8a05cd7c1f28176b2bb75d5a1/0_70_3952_2372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Director Sarah Gavron, right, with screenwriter Theresa Ikoko.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Sarah Gavron, right, with screenwriter Theresa Ikoko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ander Gillenea/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Knife crime, petty theft, drugs and gang warfare on London\u2019s estates often form a grimly titillating backdrop in police procedurals and crime dramas, while the \u201curban\u201d tag kicked off with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/26/why-noel-clarkes-hood-trilogy-remains-a-vital-snapshot-of-britain\" title=\"\">Noel Clarke\u2019s trilogy</a>, beginning with <em>Kidulthood</em> in 2006, showing teenagers drinking and fighting their way round the city. More recently, the acclaimed series <em>Top Boy </em>to Netflix has returned, but does also paint a gloomy, gritty picture of east London, focusing on rival drug gangs.</p> <p>The lack of screen representation also explains why <em>Rocks</em>\u2019s young stars had never dreamed of being film stars \u2013 or of any career in the creative industries \u2013 before being invited into the workshops. \u201cActing was never a thing. There\u2019s not other people like you doing it, so why would I go do that,\u201d admits Ali.</p> <p>Working on <em>Rocks</em> \u2013 with a team about 80% female, with many young women of colour \u2013 has changed her outlook.

      "bodyText": "Seven teenage girls are falling over themselves with laughter. They\u2019re meant to be posing for a picture, but it\u2019s a bit like photographing a box of puppies \u2013 they can\u2019t keep still, pawing and hugging and joking, and bursting into coordinated dance moves. Someone puts on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Brown Skin Girl, and her lyrics could hardly be more apt: \u201cYour skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story/ Keep dancing, they can\u2019t control you\u201d. \u201cOne still one, please,\u201d begs the photographer. But this is the cast of the film Rocks, a celebration of female friendship in east London \u2013 and they are unstoppable. They pull peace signs, stick out their tongues. They keep laughing. Rocks is directed by Sarah Gavron, and if it seems a world away from her last hit, 2015\u2019s period drama Suffragette, both reflect her mission to put the lives of women in the spotlight. A collaborative project, co-written by Theresa Ikoko and Claire Wilson, Rocks tells a fictional story developed through workshops with teenage girls from east London, and its cast are largely non-professional actors making their screen debuts. The girls improvised the dialogue while two cameras rolled, giving Rocks a documentary-style feel and a tang of authenticity. The story focuses on Rocks, a British-Nigerian teenager played by Bukky Bakray, who lives on an estate in Hackney. When her mum, struggling with mental health issues, takes off, Rocks is left to look after her little brother \u2013 and fears they\u2019ll be taken into care and separated if anyone finds out. As pressure mounts, she struggles to keep things together. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw anointed Rocks the best film at Toronto film festival, describing the film-making as \u201cin the spirit of Ken Loach\u2019s Kes or C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s Girlhood. It\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s the opposite of miserablist.\u201d It\u2019s true that the story is heart-wrenching, but the film as a whole builds an exhilarating portrait of loyal, loving female friendship and its vibrant, natural young cast offer a joyful snapshot of London teenagers, far from the gritty drama or poverty porn you might expect from a bald synopsis. \u201cIt\u2019s an empowering and powerful film,\u201d says 16-year-old Kosar Ali, who plays Rocks\u2019s best friend, Sumaya. \u201cIt shows what people go through \u2013 how women of colour are taught to have a hard exterior. But Rocks\u2019s journey and everything she goes through, and how powerful she is with friends by her side\u2026 it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d From the start, Gavron\u2019s plan was \u201cto make a film with girls rather than about them\u201d. We chat while all seven are getting ready for their photoshoot: eating chips, winding each other\u2019s headscarves, mock-pouting for selfies once their makeup is done. They grin and wave if they hear their names mentioned. Gavron wanted the film-making process to be as non-hierarchical as possible: a true collaboration with other women. So she, with Ikoko and Wilson, plus associate director Anu Henriques and casting director Lucy Pardee \u2013 who had cast non-professionals for Fish Tank and American Honey \u2013 worked together to find the right girls, and the right story. \u201cIt was a case of going into youth clubs, into schools, and absorbing what the girls were talking about, what life was like,\u201d says Gavron. \u201cIt was like a documentary research process. And quickly we noticed that friendship is everything for girls at that age.\u201d They began nine months of development workshops in 2017 with potential cast members mostly from years 8 and 9 from girls\u2019 schools in Hackney and Newham. The stars were chosen not just for their ability to light up the screen, but their ability to light up each other: in no time they formed friendships that the film-makers were desperate to can. \u201cWhat you see in Rocks is real, it\u2019s not a video. It\u2019s real life,\u201d says Bakray, a British-Nigerian 17-year-old who, despite never having acted before, inhabits the title role with a rare mix of warm humour and wounded vulnerability. Bakray lives on an estate in Hackney, close to many of the locations around Dalston where Rocks was shot, and goes to a girl\u2019s school in the area. She was born and raised in London by first-generation immigrant Christian parents, the youngest of four \u2013 and her three older brothers reflect a creative streak in the family too, one working in graphic design and another designing clothing. On screen, she and Ali have a touching friendship and it\u2019s a delight to find that they do in real life, too: their affection fills the room. \u201cMe and Bukky, we\u2019re like this\u201d \u2013 Ali mimes them being drawn together with her hands, fingers interlacing. \u201cShe\u2019s at my house, like, three days a week.\u201d Gavron visited Ali\u2019s home, in Newham in east London, in the run-up to shooting \u2013 and it formed the model for Sumaya\u2019s bustling, love-filled home, with a concerned mother and caring older siblings forming a stark contrast to Rocks\u2019s isolation. In real life, Ali is also from a large British-Somalian Muslim family; like Bakray, she was born in the UK to first-generation immigrant parents. From the first workshop, the two girls were inseparable. \u201cVibes. The first day. Instant vibes,\u201d nods Bakray, sagely. \u201cShe\u2019s like a mum, a best friend, a sister and an auntie in one,\u201d says Ali of Bakray. \u201cThe things her brain comes up with, I could literally sit there and have a conversation with her for six hours.\u201d Bakray tries to hide in Ali\u2019s shoulder in embarrassment, but there\u2019s no hiding the enormous smile on her face. British-Nigerian playwright Ikoko \u2013 her 2016 play, Girls, was about the Boko Haram kidnappings \u2013 also grew up on an estate in Hackney. She recognised something in Bakray, and had her in mind for the lead while writing: \u201cPeople said \u2018oh she looks a bit older than the others\u2019 \u2013 but when she smiles, she\u2019s a child again. We\u2019re privileged to be around Bukky when she laughs: it\u2019s the most infectious thing.\u201d Ikoko was initially less sure about Ali as Rocks\u2019s best mate. \u201cShe seemed so quiet, and also tiny\u2026\u201d But then she saw them together. \u201cSuddenly Kosar was so funny and mischievous, and she made Bukky more mischievous \u2013 they actually got kicked out [of a workshop] because they were being so disruptive. And I was like: yes, this is them!\u201d One of the refreshing things about Rocks is that the story centres on girls and friendship, not boys and romance. It swerves the classic teen movie obsession with getting the guy that runs from John Hughes movies right through to contemporary Netflix sensations such as To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before. But that wasn\u2019t the case to start with: the first script by Ikoko and Wilson (whose credits include The Little Drummer Girl, and a forthcoming adaption of Naomi Alderman\u2019s The Power) wasn\u2019t quite right: \u201cWe thought, something is off here,\u201d Ikoko recalls. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a year with girls and yet the story is still turned by men. \u201cSociety often doesn\u2019t let young black girls be young black girls,\u201d she adds. \u201cI really wanted to write something that said: I see your joy and your capacity for love, not just your resilience, your toughness.\u201d Ikoko had also been working on another, more personal script. \u201cIt was a love story for my sister, who always protected me, who had to grow up before her time in order to allow me to be a child,\u201d she explains. She sees the film as a way of saying thank you to her older sister, \u201cfor all of the things that she gave me.\u201d She plucked up the courage to share this second, more intimate script with Wilson and Gavron. They loved it \u2013 and Rocks was born. \u201cI conceived the story, but we all gave birth to it,\u201d Ikoko insists, adding that the \u201cmagic\u201d of the girls\u2019 friendships and voices had already found its way into her writing. To further help the cast feel ownership, Ikoko and Wilson invited them to a writers\u2019 room workshop. \u201cWe got them to Post-it note each scene and tell us what they thought,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWhich was pretty harsh at times!\u201d Ali and Bakray are clearly proud of being involved at that level: \u201cI describe it as a utopia,\u201d says Bakray, \u201cbecause it was mad: adults not just listening to you, but taking on the advice!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re like: \u2018What, me?\u2019\u201d chimes in Ali, her expressive eyes widening. \u201cTo have a say in what goes in an actual film is such a big thing. Especially the contrast to school.\u201d Gavron even reshot one scene when Ali told her it wasn\u2019t working. Do people underestimate teenagers? \u201cMost definitely,\u201d replies Bakray. \u201cTeenagers are just mini adults. And adults are big teenagers!\u201d \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re young, your creativity is wild,\u201d points out Ali. \u201cAdults are missing out on that because they don\u2019t want to listen.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to give young people a chance to speak,\u201d Bakray says.

Part of the spur to make the film was Gavron\u2019s growing concern about how their generation is treated. Recent figures show that youth services in England and Wales have faced 70% real-terms cuts between 2011 and 2019, with local authorities slashing \u00a31bn of spending on youth services over that time. Across the country, 750 youth centres have closed; 104 have shut in London alone since 2011. \u201cWe are stripping away their resources,\u201d says Gavron. \u201cYouth centres are precious places, and there\u2019s so few of them now.

Gavron had noticed during the research phase how young people use humour as a coping mechanism. \u201cSitting in the back of a class, we really noticed that even if a girl had told us privately that something difficult was going on at home, they\u2019d be sitting there cracking jokes, laughing, finding joy.\u201d This slipping between hilarity and heartbreak is a defining feature of the final movie. Cinema so rarely really reflects girls\u2019 friendships, says Claire Wilson. \u201cFilms tend to lean towards the romantic, or girls being bitches. I watched a ton of those [growing up], but they always made me feel bad about myself.\u201d Equally important for Ali and Bakray is seeing diversity on screen. \u201cIn TV, the best friend is white and then the second friend is a person of colour,\u201d points out Bakray. \u201cWe have two main protagonists who are people of colour, and the whole friendship group is a mixture of ethnicities.\u201d While Ali is British-Somalian co-star Anastasia Dymitrow has Polish Romani heritage, and Afi Okaidja is London born to Congolese and Ghanaian parents. One of the few boys who in the film declares himself \u201cChinese-Jamaican-Ukrainian-English.\u201d The film-makers did not need to engineer this mix. \u201cIt\u2019s literally just a reflection of London today,\u201d says Ikoko. She was determined to portray the Hackney she knew, full of life and colour and heat. \u201cIt\u2019s a place of community \u2013 it\u2019s not just a cool place to hang out on a Friday night, and it\u2019s not just a place where people get shot and sell drugs.\u201d So watching Rocks \u2013 once they\u2019d got over the cringe-factor (\u201cI wanted to punch myself\u201d Ali deadpans) \u2013 was refreshing, even to its own stars. \u201cI never saw a representation of myself on screen,\u201d says Ali, frankly. \u201cI\u2019m Muslim, and the storylines for me are: you\u2019re a terrorist, or you\u2019re a victim.\u201d It depresses her that depictions of London tend to focus on violence and how any story about young black people will be lazily dubbed \u201curban\u201d (\u201cI hate that whole category\u201d), and that there\u2019s so little range among the stories that do get told. \u201cImagine constantly looking at films and you\u2019re not depicted, you can\u2019t identify with characters \u2013 you\u2019re missing out on so much.\u201d Knife crime, petty theft, drugs and gang warfare on London\u2019s estates often form a grimly titillating backdrop in police procedurals and crime dramas, while the \u201curban\u201d tag kicked off with the likes of Noel Clarke\u2019s trilogy, beginning with Kidulthood in 2006, showing teenagers drinking and fighting their way round the city. More recently, the acclaimed series Top Boy to Netflix has returned, but does also paint a gloomy, gritty picture of east London, focusing on rival drug gangs. The lack of screen representation also explains why Rocks\u2019s young stars had never dreamed of being film stars \u2013 or of any career in the creative industries \u2013 before being invited into the workshops. \u201cActing was never a thing. There\u2019s not other people like you doing it, so why would I go do that,\u201d admits Ali. Working on Rocks \u2013 with a team about 80% female, with many young women of colour \u2013 has changed her outlook. Ali\u2019s siblings are both doctors and she\u2019d assumed she\u2019d do something similar; now, she wants to write and direct. Bakray, meanwhile, has joined Rada youth theatre. \u201cWe go see Shakespeare, and other really old playwrights. It\u2019s sick; it\u2019s teaching me a lot.\u201d But both are honest about a culture clash: film-making is not a world their parents are familiar with, and they have understandable anxieties. \u201cMy mum\u2019s supportive, always, but as a mother \u2013 especially when you\u2019ve left your culture behind, your religion \u2013 you\u2019d be worried about what your child pursues,\u201d says Ali. When I ask how their mums reacted to the film, both crease up. \u201cHumbling!\u201d Ali laughs. \u201cNo extra portions!\u201d throws in Bakray. \u201cThey\u2019re happy for sure, for all the work we\u2019ve done, but they keep us humble always,\u201d smiles Ali. \u201cI sent my mum the Rocks trailer \u2013 and she just called me to tell me to wash the dishes.\u201d Rocks is in cinemas from 10 April The BFI Southbank in London is staging a Rocks Preview Day and Venue Takeover on 4 April with panel events, Q&amp;A sessions with the girls and workshops.

      "body": "<p>One night about six months ago, as I was tidying up for the babysitter at the same time as battling to put the kids to bed, all while trying to answer a multitude of suddenly-urgent questions they\u2019d had all day to ask, and put lipstick on, I caught sight of my frantic-looking face in the mirror. What, I wondered, was I doing all this for? Was it worth it simply to spend the evening with a couple we didn\u2019t really like, drink insipid wine and make shallow small-talk about other people we don\u2019t really know or want to spend time with?</p> <p>I\u2019ve always been a more-the-merrier type person and someone who prided herself on being a good friend. I have friends from all areas of my life \u2013 school, university, work \u2013 but as I got older and the demands of raising three young children and work have grown, I\u2019ve realised that something had to give. And that something has ended up being my friendships. Not all of them, but I\u2019ve certainly had something of a reassessment.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a contrived thing at first. It was more of an inevitable decline as the children have got older (they are 11, almost 8 and 6) which has left me, their designated driver/slave (football one night, Scouts the next, never-ending homework etc) feeling frazzled. But it\u2019s also because, since turning 40 two years ago, I have, I suppose, become less of a social butterfly and make less of an effort generally. I\u2019ve reached a stage where I choose a bath and a book over a night out.</p> <p>So I decided to prioritise a small number of people, rather than try to keep up and maintain lots of different, superfluous friendships. It started with something of an online \u201ccull\u201d. The \u201cfriend\u201d who always tried to make her life look like something out of a Boden catalogue with never-ending perfect images of her children along with the nauseating hashtag #blessed. The mum from school who hardly said a word to me at the school gates but looked at every story the second I posted it on Instagram and probably gossiped about it afterwards. The people who popped up on Facebook who I hadn\u2019t seen for years and these days wouldn\u2019t cross the road to say hello to.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unfriending and in some cases blocking, made me feel calmer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unfollowing, unfriending and, in some cases, even blocking, made me feel calmer and more in control. It helped prevent FOPO \u2013 Fear of People\u2019s Opinion \u2013 and quelled the anxiety I sometimes get after sharing something spontaneously on social media. So I began to do the same sort of thing IRL too.</p> <p>I stopped making the effort with the people who leave it to me to initiate every meet-up and nurture friendships that, in the words of Marie Kondo, no longer spark joy. Those who I had to bite my tongue with, who looked at their phone constantly while I was talking to them. Those who cancelled meet-ups one too many times or who I saw out of a sense of obligation and duty rather than want. The friend who said \u201cHave you really?\u201d in an incredulous way after I told her I\u2019d lost weight.</p> <p>I stopped texting people back if I didn\u2019t really want to see them, and arranging coffees and lunches unless someone really made the effort.

      "bodyText": "One night about six months ago, as I was tidying up for the babysitter at the same time as battling to put the kids to bed, all while trying to answer a multitude of suddenly-urgent questions they\u2019d had all day to ask, and put lipstick on, I caught sight of my frantic-looking face in the mirror. What, I wondered, was I doing all this for? Was it worth it simply to spend the evening with a couple we didn\u2019t really like, drink insipid wine and make shallow small-talk about other people we don\u2019t really know or want to spend time with? I\u2019ve always been a more-the-merrier type person and someone who prided herself on being a good friend. I have friends from all areas of my life \u2013 school, university, work \u2013 but as I got older and the demands of raising three young children and work have grown, I\u2019ve realised that something had to give. And that something has ended up being my friendships. Not all of them, but I\u2019ve certainly had something of a reassessment. It wasn\u2019t a contrived thing at first. It was more of an inevitable decline as the children have got older (they are 11, almost 8 and 6) which has left me, their designated driver/slave (football one night, Scouts the next, never-ending homework etc) feeling frazzled. But it\u2019s also because, since turning 40 two years ago, I have, I suppose, become less of a social butterfly and make less of an effort generally. I\u2019ve reached a stage where I choose a bath and a book over a night out. So I decided to prioritise a small number of people, rather than try to keep up and maintain lots of different, superfluous friendships. It started with something of an online \u201ccull\u201d. The \u201cfriend\u201d who always tried to make her life look like something out of a Boden catalogue with never-ending perfect images of her children along with the nauseating hashtag #blessed. The mum from school who hardly said a word to me at the school gates but looked at every story the second I posted it on Instagram and probably gossiped about it afterwards. The people who popped up on Facebook who I hadn\u2019t seen for years and these days wouldn\u2019t cross the road to say hello to. Unfollowing, unfriending and, in some cases, even blocking, made me feel calmer and more in control. It helped prevent FOPO \u2013 Fear of People\u2019s Opinion \u2013 and quelled the anxiety I sometimes get after sharing something spontaneously on social media. So I began to do the same sort of thing IRL too. I stopped making the effort with the people who leave it to me to initiate every meet-up and nurture friendships that, in the words of Marie Kondo, no longer spark joy. Those who I had to bite my tongue with, who looked at their phone constantly while I was talking to them. Those who cancelled meet-ups one too many times or who I saw out of a sense of obligation and duty rather than want. The friend who said \u201cHave you really?\u201d in an incredulous way after I told her I\u2019d lost weight. I stopped texting people back if I didn\u2019t really want to see them, and arranging coffees and lunches unless someone really made the effort. I stopped hanging around the school gates to chat unless someone really made a beeline for me. I used to view my birthday as a great excuse to get my friends together but I\u2019ve more or less canned that too. Last year I met my husband for lunch instead and I\u2019ll be doing the same again this year. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s been entirely painless or come without guilt though. I sometimes see people\u2019s names pop up on social media or hear about them in passing conversation and feel a sense of sadness and loss.

Now Trump is gutting it | Blan Holman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s because most of the cost of protecting California properties from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/06/california-collapsing-beach-deaths-highlight-climate-fueled-erosion-crisis\">coastal erosion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/30/california-wildfires-climate-change-new-normal\">wildfires</a> and other effects of the climate crisis will eventually have to be met by the state, with public money. This means those costs won\u2019t fall on the disproportionately white and wealthy people who own property. Rather, they\u2019ll be increasingly borne by the working- and middle-class Hispanic, black and brown Californians that make up the majority of the state, many of whom don\u2019t own real estate. Without really grappling with this reality, the state is slipping step by step towards a massive wealth transfer from the general public to the owners of private property. It\u2019s one more way in which the climate crisis is also a crisis of racism and inequality.</p> <p>What Sea Cliff could look like in a few years\u2019 time can be glimpsed in <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-sea-level-rise-california-coast/\">the town of Pacifica</a>, 14 miles to the south. Parts of the town, which is much more middle-class than Sea Cliff, sit directly on beautiful bluffs that overlook \u2013 and are tumbling into \u2013 the Pacific Ocean. When the town\u2019s mayor proposed a \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d from the coast, home owners and local realtors revolted: the proposal would have effectively taken their homes off the market, cutting them off from potential profits. (Owners does not mean residents: about a third of Pacifica\u2019s housing stock, including many of the most threatened buildings, consists of rental units.) So instead of a managed retreat, the city is taking money from the public coffers and using it to protect property investments by building sea walls and replenishing eroding beaches with trucked-in sand, among other measures.</p> <p>This is a dynamic we have seen throughout the late capitalist economy. The sociologist Ulrich Beck described it as a change from \u201ca logic of wealth distribution\u201d to one of \u201crisk distribution\u201d. Profits are privatized, but risk is made public. The banks made a bunch of bad bets on crappy mortgage debts? Bail them out with public money and give the executives multimillion-dollar bonuses. Someone half bakes a fundamentally unprofitable tech business? Let them IPO it so they can liquidate hundreds of millions of dollars of stock options while transferring the ultimately worthless company into the hands of public pension funds and workers\u2019 401ks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc1d8ebcba3ebc957222fccd52344851398eba70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1d8ebcba3ebc957222fccd52344851398eba70/0_0_4928_3213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sections of land missing from coastal properties in Pacifica, California, in 2016.

Storms and powerful waves have intensified erosion along nearby coastal bluffs and beaches in the area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s the same thing that is now happening in California, where the land is uniquely threatened and at the same time uniquely valuable. There is a concerted political effort not to manage the risk, but rather to keep it from impacting value by making the public bear the costs of the climate crisis through things such as the sorts of publicly funded disaster relief programs and state-subsidized insurance payouts that Jack Dorsey could theoretically benefit from. This is, in fact, what many of the owners of capital and real estate think the government is for: protecting the value of private property at all costs. It\u2019s one of the reasons we have a climate crisis \u2013 instead of a robust, rapid transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 in the first place.</p> <p>The sheer immensity of the climate crisis, and of California, ensures that more and more of the costs will be borne by the public. The Los Angeles Times estimates that $150bn in California property might be impacted by coastal flooding and erosion by 2100. That\u2019s $150bn in private wealth which the government has made it a public priority to preserve.</p> <p>Those costs are dwarfed by the risks created by the region\u2019s intensifying wildfires, which threaten millions of properties around the state. Individuals and insurance companies currently bear financial responsibility for property damaged by wildfires, but there is already pressure to collectivize these risks.</p> <p>It will go something like this: as houses become astronomically expensive, insurance payouts become astronomically large. In response, in threatened areas, private insurers will cancel coverage, or multiply rates to the point of unaffordability. The state will be forced to step in to stabilize the rates, and keep the land valuable, which will likely involve something like the National Flood Insurance Program, which subsidizes flood insurance provided by private insurers and underwrites the full extent of their losses.</p> <p>Currently, the state is forcing insurance companies not to cancel coverage, but reinsurers are getting worried, meaning the pressure is on to decline coverage \u2013 something that is already happening in various parts of the state. This is exactly the point where historically the government has stepped in \u2014 and there are already calls for it to do so now.</p> <p>The racist dimension to this wealth transfer must not be overlooked. Fewer than 55% of California households own their dwelling and only 42% of Latino households and 33% of black ones do. Non-urban space, open space, and at-risk space in California is today particularly white, or at least white-owned.</p> <p>Especially in the sorts of rural areas threatened by wildfire, that disparity is highly dependent on California\u2019s history of racial violence and exclusion. The genocide of California\u2019s first peoples; restrictions on the citizenship status of Asian immigrants; the seizure of Japanese American land during the second world war; the arrogation of land for infrastructure projects in the postwar period; discriminatory lending practices, racial covenants and other racist real estate policies, perpetuated by de facto segregation \u2013 all worked to ensure that non-white property ownership in rural California has remained low and concentrated in dense cities.</p> <p>All of this creates an unjust mismatch: the collective that is underwriting the risk of climate catastrophe will not be the same as the group that is incurring it. As a result, the siphoning off of public wealth to protect private property will increasingly favor white Californians.</p> <p>Of course, that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s likely to be politically acceptable. It would be difficult to imagine the government sanctioning a massive wealth transfer in the other direction, for example by relieving the mortgage debts of the black and brown Americans who were the primary victims of the subprime crisis. But when fire and other types of home insurance markets fail, as they are already beginning to do and inevitably will, the state will have to step in to shore up the largely white property market with black, brown, working and middle-class public money.</p> <p>As the incalculably large price tag of climate change comes due, those excluded from the property market will increasingly foot the bill for California\u2019s cult of the homeowner. It remains to be seen whether that cult will endure, or whether the state can rethink its relationship to real estate.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated on 9 March 2020 to emphasize that individuals and insurance companies currently bear the risk for wildfire damage</p>",

Without really grappling with this reality, the state is slipping step by step towards a massive wealth transfer from the general public to the owners of private property. It\u2019s one more way in which the climate crisis is also a crisis of racism and inequality. What Sea Cliff could look like in a few years\u2019 time can be glimpsed in the town of Pacifica, 14 miles to the south. Parts of the town, which is much more middle-class than Sea Cliff, sit directly on beautiful bluffs that overlook \u2013 and are tumbling into \u2013 the Pacific Ocean. When the town\u2019s mayor proposed a \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d from the coast, home owners and local realtors revolted: the proposal would have effectively taken their homes off the market, cutting them off from potential profits. (Owners does not mean residents: about a third of Pacifica\u2019s housing stock, including many of the most threatened buildings, consists of rental units.) So instead of a managed retreat, the city is taking money from the public coffers and using it to protect property investments by building sea walls and replenishing eroding beaches with trucked-in sand, among other measures. This is a dynamic we have seen throughout the late capitalist economy. The sociologist Ulrich Beck described it as a change from \u201ca logic of wealth distribution\u201d to one of \u201crisk distribution\u201d. Profits are privatized, but risk is made public. The banks made a bunch of bad bets on crappy mortgage debts? Bail them out with public money and give the executives multimillion-dollar bonuses. Someone half bakes a fundamentally unprofitable tech business? Let them IPO it so they can liquidate hundreds of millions of dollars of stock options while transferring the ultimately worthless company into the hands of public pension funds and workers\u2019 401ks. That\u2019s the same thing that is now happening in California, where the land is uniquely threatened and at the same time uniquely valuable. There is a concerted political effort not to manage the risk, but rather to keep it from impacting value by making the public bear the costs of the climate crisis through things such as the sorts of publicly funded disaster relief programs and state-subsidized insurance payouts that Jack Dorsey could theoretically benefit from. This is, in fact, what many of the owners of capital and real estate think the government is for: protecting the value of private property at all costs. It\u2019s one of the reasons we have a climate crisis \u2013 instead of a robust, rapid transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 in the first place. The sheer immensity of the climate crisis, and of California, ensures that more and more of the costs will be borne by the public. The Los Angeles Times estimates that $150bn in California property might be impacted by coastal flooding and erosion by 2100. That\u2019s $150bn in private wealth which the government has made it a public priority to preserve. Those costs are dwarfed by the risks created by the region\u2019s intensifying wildfires, which threaten millions of properties around the state. Individuals and insurance companies currently bear financial responsibility for property damaged by wildfires, but there is already pressure to collectivize these risks. It will go something like this: as houses become astronomically expensive, insurance payouts become astronomically large. In response, in threatened areas, private insurers will cancel coverage, or multiply rates to the point of unaffordability. The state will be forced to step in to stabilize the rates, and keep the land valuable, which will likely involve something like the National Flood Insurance Program, which subsidizes flood insurance provided by private insurers and underwrites the full extent of their losses. Currently, the state is forcing insurance companies not to cancel coverage, but reinsurers are getting worried, meaning the pressure is on to decline coverage \u2013 something that is already happening in various parts of the state. This is exactly the point where historically the government has stepped in \u2014 and there are already calls for it to do so now. The racist dimension to this wealth transfer must not be overlooked. Fewer than 55% of California households own their dwelling and only 42% of Latino households and 33% of black ones do. Non-urban space, open space, and at-risk space in California is today particularly white, or at least white-owned. Especially in the sorts of rural areas threatened by wildfire, that disparity is highly dependent on California\u2019s history of racial violence and exclusion. The genocide of California\u2019s first peoples; restrictions on the citizenship status of Asian immigrants; the seizure of Japanese American land during the second world war; the arrogation of land for infrastructure projects in the postwar period; discriminatory lending practices, racial covenants and other racist real estate policies, perpetuated by de facto segregation \u2013 all worked to ensure that non-white property ownership in rural California has remained low and concentrated in dense cities. All of this creates an unjust mismatch: the collective that is underwriting the risk of climate catastrophe will not be the same as the group that is incurring it. As a result, the siphoning off of public wealth to protect private property will increasingly favor white Californians. Of course, that\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s likely to be politically acceptable. It would be difficult to imagine the government sanctioning a massive wealth transfer in the other direction, for example by relieving the mortgage debts of the black and brown Americans who were the primary victims of the subprime crisis. But when fire and other types of home insurance markets fail, as they are already beginning to do and inevitably will, the state will have to step in to shore up the largely white property market with black, brown, working and middle-class public money. As the incalculably large price tag of climate change comes due, those excluded from the property market will increasingly foot the bill for California\u2019s cult of the homeowner. It remains to be seen whether that cult will endure, or whether the state can rethink its relationship to real estate. \u2022 This article was updated on 9 March 2020 to emphasize that individuals and insurance companies currently bear the risk for wildfire damage",

      "bodyText": "The most popular symbol of the radical left in Germany is an avowed anti-capitalist and a firm believer in collective property. He takes down neo-Nazis with the same bouncy energy as he tackles property speculators. Books expounding his views, running at several volumes, top the German bestseller charts; posters bearing his face are currently plastered all over the country\u2019s cities. His only liability, in terms of electoral optics, could be a fatal addiction to booze-filled pralines \u2013 and the marsupial pouch in which he keeps his copy of Mao\u2019s red book. The Kangaroo Chronicles, a quartet of comic novels by slam poet Marc-Uwe Kling that has sold millions of copies in Germany over the last 10 years, is a classic man-meets-beast buddy story in the vein of Seth MacFarlane\u2019s 2012 comedy Ted \u2013 only that its animal protagonist is mainly vulgar in the Marxist rather than the foul-mouthed sense. The communist kangaroo lives in a flatshare in the heart of counter-cultural Berlin with Marc-Uwe, a bohemian slacker whose anarchist principles are \u201cso mild, he might as well join the [centre-left] SPD\u201d. A big-budget film based on the cult books opened in German cinemas last week, seemingly showing that hairy lefties stuck in 1970s dogmas don\u2019t just trigger feelings of warm affection in the political bubbles of the big cities, but can also have mainstream appeal. As if to emphasise that message, a day before the movie\u2019s premiere parliamentarians in the eastern state of Thuringia re-elected the only state premier for the leftwing party Die Linke \u2013 the popular and widely respected Bodo Ramelow. And throughout the week, several pollsters have predicted that a three-way coalition between the Greens, the Social Democrats and Die Linke could yield a governing majority at the next federal elections, which would be the first time the successor party to the East German Socialist Unity party would enter the national government since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Yet Kling\u2019s cult hit also demonstrates exactly why the kangaroo, an avowed political populist, is also the worst nightmare for a leftwing party with an eye on the seats of power. The film, directed by Swiss filmmaker Dani Levy, shows the communist marsupial team up with Berlin locals against J\u00f6rg Dwigs, a Trump-style property tycoon and founder of the fictional AzD (\u201cAlternative to democracy\u201d) party: a classic \u201cthe people v the elite\u201d narrative, which the German far left has found more difficult to adopt than its counterparts in Britain, America or Southern Europe. \u201cThe German left is still nervous about using populist rhetoric,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Lang, a political scientist and journalist who specialises in the history of Die Linke. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that once you go down the road of talking about \u2018the people\u2019, you are in an arena where the far right will beat you at that game.\u201d Even in a left party notoriously divided between libertarian, orthodox anti-capitalist and Trotskyist wings, said Lang, \u201cthere are factions that hold populist positions, but there isn\u2019t really a populist faction\u201d. Aufstehen! (Get Up!), an attempt to manufacture a left wing populist grassroots movement along the lines of France\u2019s gilets jeunes led by charismatic Die Linke politician Sahra Wagenknecht, disintegrated barely a year into its existence. Bodo Ramelow hails from Die Linke\u2019s party branches in the east. Unlike the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), which is at its most rabidly nationalistic in the states that used to make up the German Democratic Republic, left party politicians in the same regions have shown themselves more interested in forming governing alliances than theorising about world revolution. \u201cRamelow and his people have, in the past few years, shown us evidence that they are capable of accident-free, pragmatic and solid governance,\u201d wrote Der Spiegel this week. In the wake of the controversial vote in Thuringia, which initially saw Merkel\u2019s centre-right party vote with the AfD in order to oust Ramelow, the centre-left SPD\u2019s general secretary, Lars Klingbeil, said his party had \u201cnever been so ready for a pact [with their far-left rivals] as we are now\u201d. For there to be a realistic possibility of a Green-Red-Red coalition after the next German elections, scheduled for 2021, the Left party will have to prove that it is capable of containing its Kangaroo-ish tendencies, however. A video that surfaced in Germany media last week briefly seemed to threaten Ramelow\u2019s chances of being re-elected. Filmed at a Die Linke strategy conference in the western town of Kassel, it showed one participant argue that \u201conce we have shot the 1% of the rich, we will still want to heat our homes and travel\u201d. Rather than criticising the comments, the party\u2019s co-leader Bernd Riexinger responded with an attempt at a joke: \u201cWe are not shooting them, but we will make them do some useful work.\u201d Ramelow was one of the first to criticise the comments when the video emerged, calling them \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Anyone who sees The Kangaroo Chronicles will know that a broad-church German left setting its eyes on government in 2021 will meet similar turbulence along the way. \u201cWe can be friends,\u201d the movie\u2019s marsupial hero says to his more moderate political ally, before whispering to himself: \u201cUntil after the revolution, anyway.\u201d",

A survey found that nearly half of UK businesses are planning to invest in chargeable cars and vans in advance of the government\u2019s ban on sales of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035. The Treasury is expected to accelerate the trend in this week\u2019s budget by signalling an end to a decade of freezes on fuel duty for millions of drivers, as part of plans to meet tougher climate laws. Sales of electric vehicles are climbing quickly but official figures show that they still accounted for only 2% of new car registrations last year. The uptake of low-emissions driving is a key pillar of the government\u2019s plans for cutting carbon emissions to virtually zero by 2050 to end the UK\u2019s contribution to the climate crisis. Cars make up slightly less than a fifth of the UK\u2019s total carbon footprint, a proportion that has risen in recent years in part thanks to the popularity of energy-hungry SUVs. Rachel Maclean, the transport minister, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see UK businesses investing in electric vehicles and embracing greener technology to decarbonise our transport network. \u201cBusinesses having confidence in electric vehicles is crucial to end the UK\u2019s contribution to climate change and improve air quality for all.\u201d More than a third of companies say the government\u2019s looming ban on petrol and diesel cars has made them bring forward plans to shift to clean driving, according to a survey by the owner of British Gas.

      "body": "<p>Last week, faced with a boy too poorly to do anything but cuddle on the couch, my son\u2019s TV time increased significantly, giving me an all-new insight into what makes him tick in tellyland.</p> <p>His favourite things are usually loud and brash \u2013 nursery rhyme songs, singalongs, and anything involving cartoon ducks or runaway buses. In short, the kind of thing you can watch for about four minutes before you start to feel your brain loosening inside your skull. </p> <p>With only my son\u2019s intellectual betterment at heart, I decided it would be an opportunity to expand his artistic knowledge with videos of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/21/beastie-boys-book-memoir-interview\" title=\"\">Beastie Boys</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/06/busta-rhymes-arrested-after-allegedly-throwing-protein-drink-gym-worker\" title=\"\">Busta Rhymes</a>, vintage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sesame-st\" title=\"\">Sesame </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sesame-st\" title=\"\">Street</a> and a few short-lived forays into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/hayaomiyazaki\" title=\"\">Hayao Miyazaki</a>. All of which failed spectacularly. He might be too young, or too poorly, to have enjoyed them, but the fact is nothing sustained his attention like his one, true favourite, the stopgap to which I eventually revert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peppa-pig\" title=\"\">Peppa Pig</a>.</p> <p>I had known he liked <em>Peppa Pig</em>. Of course he does. The whole world loves Peppa Pig, with her stick-figure limbs and head shaped like a travel hairdryer that\u2019s been flattened by a steamroller. I just hadn\u2019t realised he was so breathlessly addicted that it was the one programme he could watch indefinitely while in the grip of fever. Moreover, after many, many hours, I can now confirm it\u2019s an addiction to which I have myself succumbed.</p> <p>The show appears to be a gently comic cartoon about an anthropomorphic pig who lives on a hill, surrounded by other anthropomorphic animals who live on neighbouring hills \u2013 but it\u2019s altogether more intriguing than that. It is never explained, for example, why some animals get to be \u2018people\u2019 and some remain animals. (In the Peppa film, her class even take a trip to the zoo and, well, the less said about that brain-melting melange of animal logic the better.)</p> <p>Almost every adult in the show is called Daddy or Mummy or Grandad etc, suffixed by whatever animal they happen to be \u2013 Daddy Pig, Grandad Dog, Mummy Rabbit. A rare exception is Miss Rabbit, Mummy Rabbit\u2019s identical twin sister who has, for no explained reason, roughly 18 part-time jobs. Are we to detect a critique of late capitalism in the fact that she works as a cashier, librarian, bus driver, helicopter rescue pilot and training co-ordinator for the local fire service?

      "bodyText": "Last week, faced with a boy too poorly to do anything but cuddle on the couch, my son\u2019s TV time increased significantly, giving me an all-new insight into what makes him tick in tellyland. His favourite things are usually loud and brash \u2013 nursery rhyme songs, singalongs, and anything involving cartoon ducks or runaway buses. In short, the kind of thing you can watch for about four minutes before you start to feel your brain loosening inside your skull. With only my son\u2019s intellectual betterment at heart, I decided it would be an opportunity to expand his artistic knowledge with videos of the Beastie Boys and Busta Rhymes, vintage Sesame Street and a few short-lived forays into Hayao Miyazaki. All of which failed spectacularly. He might be too young, or too poorly, to have enjoyed them, but the fact is nothing sustained his attention like his one, true favourite, the stopgap to which I eventually revert, Peppa Pig. I had known he liked Peppa Pig. Of course he does. The whole world loves Peppa Pig, with her stick-figure limbs and head shaped like a travel hairdryer that\u2019s been flattened by a steamroller. I just hadn\u2019t realised he was so breathlessly addicted that it was the one programme he could watch indefinitely while in the grip of fever. Moreover, after many, many hours, I can now confirm it\u2019s an addiction to which I have myself succumbed. The show appears to be a gently comic cartoon about an anthropomorphic pig who lives on a hill, surrounded by other anthropomorphic animals who live on neighbouring hills \u2013 but it\u2019s altogether more intriguing than that. It is never explained, for example, why some animals get to be \u2018people\u2019 and some remain animals. (In the Peppa film, her class even take a trip to the zoo and, well, the less said about that brain-melting melange of animal logic the better.) Almost every adult in the show is called Daddy or Mummy or Grandad etc, suffixed by whatever animal they happen to be \u2013 Daddy Pig, Grandad Dog, Mummy Rabbit. A rare exception is Miss Rabbit, Mummy Rabbit\u2019s identical twin sister who has, for no explained reason, roughly 18 part-time jobs. Are we to detect a critique of late capitalism in the fact that she works as a cashier, librarian, bus driver, helicopter rescue pilot and training co-ordinator for the local fire service? And what kind of zero hours contract is she on that she must also sell ice-cream on the side? I\u2019ve now watched every episode several times and no answers are forthcoming. My only recourse is to keep watching and hope these mysteries are explained. The risk is that my son will get sick of it before I do, but if he does - tough luck. We\u2019ve gone too far now. Some culture is too important to be misunderstood, and I have only his intellectual betterment at heart. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

But the way to solve that isn\u2019t with aggressive grandstanding, or with threats to undermine the BBC\u2019s future and reduce its funding,\u201d said Hobbs. \u201cIt\u2019s to secure its funding for the long term, and to make sure the BBC takes action to reform for the better \u2013 capping excess pays and ramping up its regional reporting.\u201d",

In addition, she wants to know why the party considers it \u201cappropriate\u201d to put new \u201cbarriers in front of new members joining the party in this election, but not in previous contests\u201d and has asked Formby if the NEC was consulted on the new system. The ballot opened on 21 February, and closes on 2 April. It is understood that the full NEC held only a brief discussion of how to manage the leadership contest in January. It is understood that issues relating to membership of the party were placed under the control of Corbyn\u2019s close ally Karie Murphy following the election defeat. A party source said the ballot was being conducted by Civica, formerly Electoral Reform Services, which has more than 100 years\u2019 experience of conducting elections. They said Civica was \u201csatisfied\u201d with how the process was going. They also said new members were being checked against the electoral register because the party wanted the election to be as fair and democratic as possible and this was a way of ensuring people could not register fake or multiple names.",

      "body": "<p>In 1974, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol</a> landed a $1m commission from Italian art dealer Luciano Anselmino. His brief was to forsake the soup cans and superstars that had made his name and take a walk on the wild side, creating portraits of New York\u2019s hidden community of drag queens. Too famous to track them down himself, he sent his young acolytes out to a club called the Gilded Grape, which was the haunt of a largely black and Latinx crowd.</p> <p>So began one of Warhol\u2019s most touching and less-known projects. <em>Ladies and Gentlemen </em>is a series of 268 vibrantly coloured silk screens, 25 of which will make their first UK appearance this month, alongside Mao and Marilyn Monroe, as part of <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/andy-warhol\" title=\"\">a retrospective</a> at Tate Modern. Of the 14 sitters featured in the series, a couple were well known on the gay underground, but most were not. Though they all signed their drag names on the Polaroids from which the pictures were created, the stories of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/194279/ladies-and-gentlemen-broadway\" title=\"\">Broadway</a>, <a href=\"https://artimage.org.uk/29000/andy-warhol/ladies-and-gentlemen--lurdes---1975\" title=\"\">Lurdes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/125798/andy-warhol-helenharry-morales-drag-queen-american-1974/\" title=\"\">Helen/Harry Morales</a> et al have only gradually emerged through decades of research by the Warhol Foundation.</p> <p>One of Warhol\u2019s scouts was <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/corey-grant-tippin-interview-antonio-lopez-andy-warhol-sticky-fingers\" title=\"\">Corey Tippin</a>, a 24-year-old actor and makeup artist. \u201cI would go there and find particularly beautiful women and tell them that they\u2019d get paid $50 \u2013 a lot of money back then \u2013 and it didn\u2019t involve anything sexual. They just had to be ready to be picked up in a taxi at 10 in the morning, which I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d manage, because most of them were sex workers and they lived by night. But they all showed up.\u201d</p> <p>One of the models Tippin discovered was \u201ca very petite, soft-voiced transexual\u201d called <a href=\"https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/andy-warhol-christies-andys-randy-summer/ladies-gentlemen-iris-e-m-broadway-kim-55/17925\" title=\"\">Iris</a>. \u201cShe had a pretty little wig but also posed for some of the pictures without it.\u201d Iris features in eight of the pictures that will be shown at the Tate, in two different poses. One, with her fingers framing one eye, was known in fashion circles as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/andy-warhol/ladies-and-gentleman-iris-FxcGqNaZodwUq8v4zk3QMA2\" title=\"\">the search</a>\u201d. The other, with her arm draped languidly over her head, was dubbed \u201cthe Wilhelmina\u201d, in honour of another sitter says Tippin, who directed the poses and believes he even snapped some of the Polaroids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89a3aacda55879f22dd2143a9e5a7f844ba54913\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89a3aacda55879f22dd2143a9e5a7f844ba54913/0_0_4172_5380/775.jpg\" alt=\"Ladies and Gentlemen (Iris) 1975\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ladies and Gentlemen (Iris) 1975: \u2018the search\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 2020 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. / Licensed by DACS, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The glamour and theatricality of the pictures conceals the hardships that the drag queens suffered. Like many of them, Iris had a missing tooth, which Warhol painted back in for her. \u201cAndy gave her back her tooth,\u201d says Tippin, who holds this small kindness as evidence that the project was not simply exploitative. Iris was very particular about the way she wore her blouse, \u201cwhich made me suspect she was on bootleg hormones and was proud of her little breasts\u201d, says Tippin.</p> <p>\u201cThese were very different times. The idea of drag queens who actually considered themselves women hadn\u2019t come into consciousness, even among most doctors, so they would buy drugs on the black market and many of them got sick. They didn\u2019t have much money, but they had so many little theatrical tricks: the will, the transformation, the risk.

      "bodyText": "In 1974, Andy Warhol landed a $1m commission from Italian art dealer Luciano Anselmino. His brief was to forsake the soup cans and superstars that had made his name and take a walk on the wild side, creating portraits of New York\u2019s hidden community of drag queens. Too famous to track them down himself, he sent his young acolytes out to a club called the Gilded Grape, which was the haunt of a largely black and Latinx crowd. So began one of Warhol\u2019s most touching and less-known projects. Ladies and Gentlemen is a series of 268 vibrantly coloured silk screens, 25 of which will make their first UK appearance this month, alongside Mao and Marilyn Monroe, as part of a retrospective at Tate Modern. Of the 14 sitters featured in the series, a couple were well known on the gay underground, but most were not. Though they all signed their drag names on the Polaroids from which the pictures were created, the stories of Broadway, Lurdes, Helen/Harry Morales et al have only gradually emerged through decades of research by the Warhol Foundation. One of Warhol\u2019s scouts was Corey Tippin, a 24-year-old actor and makeup artist. \u201cI would go there and find particularly beautiful women and tell them that they\u2019d get paid $50 \u2013 a lot of money back then \u2013 and it didn\u2019t involve anything sexual. They just had to be ready to be picked up in a taxi at 10 in the morning, which I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d manage, because most of them were sex workers and they lived by night. But they all showed up.\u201d One of the models Tippin discovered was \u201ca very petite, soft-voiced transexual\u201d called Iris. \u201cShe had a pretty little wig but also posed for some of the pictures without it.\u201d Iris features in eight of the pictures that will be shown at the Tate, in two different poses. One, with her fingers framing one eye, was known in fashion circles as \u201cthe search\u201d. The other, with her arm draped languidly over her head, was dubbed \u201cthe Wilhelmina\u201d, in honour of another sitter says Tippin, who directed the poses and believes he even snapped some of the Polaroids. The glamour and theatricality of the pictures conceals the hardships that the drag queens suffered. Like many of them, Iris had a missing tooth, which Warhol painted back in for her. \u201cAndy gave her back her tooth,\u201d says Tippin, who holds this small kindness as evidence that the project was not simply exploitative. Iris was very particular about the way she wore her blouse, \u201cwhich made me suspect she was on bootleg hormones and was proud of her little breasts\u201d, says Tippin. \u201cThese were very different times. The idea of drag queens who actually considered themselves women hadn\u2019t come into consciousness, even among most doctors, so they would buy drugs on the black market and many of them got sick. They didn\u2019t have much money, but they had so many little theatrical tricks: the will, the transformation, the risk. They really were my heroes.\u201d While most of the sitters had no idea who they were posing for, that was not true of Wilhelmina Ross and Marsha P Johnson, who had both been part of a drag troupe called Hot Peaches. Founder and director Jimmy Camicia recalls putting on their first shows in the loft of Warhol superstar Jackie Curtis, although he was sceptical about the Factory, and in 1973 Hot Peaches sent it up in The Magic Hype drag show, starring the celebrity-obsessed sell-out Randy Whorehall. \u201cWhen you were inside that circle it didn\u2019t look like it did from the outside. In fact, it looked very tacky and exploitative, so that\u2019s how we showed it,\u201d says Camicia today. By the time Camicia met Marsha in the early 70s, she had already played a key part in the 1969 Stonewall uprising and was leading the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries with her friend Sylvia Rivera. \u201cShe was out of the box,\u201d says Camicia. \u201cShe\u2019d panhandled on the street but she gave most of her money away.\u201d The P in Marsha\u2019s name stood for \u201cpay it no mind\u201d, which she reputedly told a judge who questioned her gender, charming him into acquitting her on a minor felony, \u201cprobably loitering\u201d. Wilhelmina turned up a couple of years later, \u201cplaying a cockroach in a really tacky downtown show\u201d, says Camicia. \u201cShe was dressed in this glamorous gown and I thought, what the hell, I\u2019ve got to meet that cockroach. She wouldn\u2019t tolerate bad language. She had this \u2018code of elegance\u2019 and she stuck to it, probably to her disadvantage.\u201d In vintage footage from Hot Peaches shows, Wilhelmina shimmers in flounced white sateen as \u201cdrag queen superstar Belladella Bosom\u201d, purring \u201cI\u2019m not a woman, I\u2019m not a man, it\u2019s my own game\u201d. Wilhelmina had the biggest presence in the Ladies and Gentleman series, appearing in 73 paintings, two of which will be at the Tate. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that and I was astonished.

      "bodyText": "A group of British MPs has called on the foreign secretary to intervene in the case of four young men facing a death sentence in Cairo for crimes they allegedly committed as children. One of them is Ammar El Sudany, who was in the bath when Egyptian security forces raided his home. Only given enough time to throw on shorts and a T-shirt, the then 17-year-old was blindfolded and frogmarched from the building in handcuffs. Now, three years on, he faces being sentenced to death on Monday at a mass trial of 304 people at the north Cairo military court, which has rumbled on for more than two years. According to his family, he was arrested only because his father was a supporter of the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi, and has never attended a demonstration. It is claimed that the four men were charged with two offences of being members of a terrorist cell, after being arrested without a warrant and forced to make confessions under torture. Last month, a cross-party group of MPs and Lords wrote to Dominic Raab asking him to act. \u201cYour intervention could ensure these young men are not sentenced to death,\u201d the letter read. In a separate letter, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for peace and disarmament, Fabian Hamilton, also urged Raab to intervene in the case. On Friday, a group of UN human rights experts urged the Egyptian authorities to release the men. When the security forces came for El Sudany he was preparing to go to the Berkat Sabaa secondary school in Monofiyah, 50 miles north of Cairo. He had memorised the Qur\u2019an and, an able mathematician, wanted to pursue a career in engineering. His favourite hobby was Arabic painting and calligraphy. Now, as his friends contemplate their university careers, El Sudany is a broken man, his body ravaged by beatings and torture that have left him, in his mother\u2019s words, like the \u201cpeople of the cave\u201d, a reference to the Qur\u2019anic story of those who lived in a cave for hundreds of years. He was arrested on 4 December 2016, the day after his father, Yasser Abdelaziz El Sudany, had been detained for supporting Morsi, the democratically elected president overthrown in a military coup in 2013. He was reportedly hung by his arms for three days and subjected to electric shock torture, even on his genitals. Some beatings allegedly took place in the presence of his father, who pleaded with his interrogators to stop the torture, saying he would admit anything if his son was spared. The teenager confessed to being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the party Morsi had led but which is now a banned terrorist organisation under the new president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. The authorities accused El Sudany of joining a group called Hasm, a movement that draws young people to carry out violent attacks on the army, police and state institutions. But his family said he was just a normal schoolboy wanting to do his best in life. His mother, who did not wish to be named, wept as she told how her son has to fend for himself in a tiny, crowded cell, with nothing to occupy his time. She said: \u201cIt is very difficult for Ammar to sleep due to the lack of space in his cell and the number of people in it. All cellmates must share one blanket, with no mattress. They sleep on the ground on top of one blanket, with nothing on top of them. \u201cAmmar has never been allowed pen and paper since his arrest. He is allowed no activities and no outdoor time. \u201cAmmar was an outstanding student. His friends are in university now, and he has been prohibited from taking any exams in prison.\u201d In November 2019, the UN working group on arbitrary detention demanded Egypt immediately release and compensate the men, saying capital punishment can never be imposed on children. Caroline Lucas, who led the cross-party group of six MPs and five members of the House of Lords, said: \u201cIt is chilling that these young men are facing the death penalty in a mass trial of 304 people, after being arrested as children without warrants and subject to torture and incommunicado detention. \u201cIf the UK\u2019s commitment to human rights is to mean anything, the government must not remain silent in a case such as this.

We regularly voice our concerns to the Egyptian authorities and will be raising this case via our embassy in Cairo.\u201d According to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, 82 people are at imminent risk of execution in political cases. In 2019, 320 people were sentenced to death in 170 cases, both political and criminal. There were 18 executions in six cases. Maya Foa, director of Reprieve, the human rights charity, said: \u201cWhen we hear about mass trials where hundreds of defendants face death sentences, caged together in a courtroom, it can be easy to forget that each of those people has a story and a family. \u201cSo when a mother breaks into tears after being asked to describe her son\u2019s condition following months of torture and mistreatment, it reminds us of the human cost of President Sisi\u2019s crackdown on dissent. \u201cAmmar El Sudany was a promising student on the cusp of adulthood, tortured and beaten simply because his father spoke out against Egypt\u2019s ruler.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Aubrey Beardsley, <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/aubrey-beardsley\" title=\"\">at Tate Britain</a>, is elegant, biting and smart as a whip. He pits burning black shapes against the empty white space of a page with coruscating zip and register. He is master of the flowing robes, psychedelic hair and ever lengthening lines that end in swaying tassels or sharp thorns. His graphic art is nervous yet assured, morbid but witty, frequently crude yet decisively suave.</p> <p>Born into genteel poverty in Brighton, Beardsley (1872-98) left school at 16 and worked as a clerk in the City before studying at Westminster School of Art. He was exceptionally industrious, producing more than a thousand prints and designs in a dragonfly career that has become synonymous with fin-de-si\u00e8cle decadence.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw175156/Aubrey-Beardsley\" title=\"\">photograph of the artist</a> \u2013 one of several in this enormous show, the first full-scale survey since 1923 \u2013 shows Beardsley not long before he died of tuberculosis in a hotel in Menton, France. He is still upright and dapper, book in hand, as if contemplating his next illustration. He was just 25.</p> <p>Beardsley\u2019s long absence from our museums may be partly to do with these literary associations. To some, he is known mainly as the illustrator of Malory\u2019s <em>Le</em> <em>Morte d\u2019Arthur</em>, Wilde\u2019s <em>Salom\u00e9</em> or Pope\u2019s <em>The</em> <em>Rape of the Lock</em>, with different downsides in each case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56735c7cbb3149c6089b7b22e63ec87dba80b242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56735c7cbb3149c6089b7b22e63ec87dba80b242/0_0_1793_2497/718.jpg\" alt=\"Beardsley photographed in 1893 by Frederick Evans.\" width=\"718\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beardsley photographed in 1893 by Frederick Evans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wilson Centre for Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The drawings for Malory made Beardsley\u2019s name at the age of 20. But to modern eyes, they arrive out of an early aesthetic so influenced by Edward Burne-Jones, and other knight and nymph-infested pre-Raph mawkishness, as to be an obvious and weak pastiche. Even at the time, William Morris angrily remarked: \u201cDamn it, a man should do his own work.\u201d</p> <p>Beardsley referred to his (comparatively late) <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/work-of-art/the-rape-of-the-lock\" title=\"\">Pope illustrations</a> as \u201cembroideries\u201d, and so they are. It is almost impossible to get your eye into these dense petit-points of dots and whirls, beauty spots and powdered curls. Pope\u2019s mock-heroic epic is lost in an excess of style.</p> <p>But Beardsley\u2019s connection to Oscar Wilde nearly lost him a livelihood. The illustrations to <em><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Salom%C3%A9-_a_tragedy_in_one_act_pg_79.jpg/220px-Salom%C3%A9-_a_tragedy_in_one_act_pg_79.jpg\" title=\"\">Salom\u00e9</a></em> had already baffled or horrified the critics in any case. When Wilde was arrested at the Cadogan hotel in 1895, after losing his libel trial against the Marquess of Queensberry, he was thought to have been in possession of an edition of the <em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-yellow-book\" title=\"\">Yellow Book</a></em>. Beardsley, the magazine\u2019s art editor, was sacked.</p> <p>The images for <em>Salom\u00e9</em> are startling, first to last. Corpses appear to levitate; the moon has a bizarre female face; androgynous figures appear naked beneath Japanese kimonos and trailing peacock cloaks. It is nearly impossible to distinguish between the face of Salom\u00e9 and the severed head of John the Baptist, blood dripping from his luxurious tendrils. At the beautician\u2019s, in picture hat and daring d\u00e9colletage, Salom\u00e9 has been reading Zola and the Marquis de Sade.

The caricature is savage, but no less than Beardsley\u2019s \u201cportrait\u201d of Mrs Whistler as <em>The Fat Woman</em>, her enormous bust measured side to side with the dotted line of a ribbon threaded through her bodice. But look, too, at the drawing of her glove as seen through an empty wine glass. The illusion is astonishingly subtle.</p> <p>And sly jokes are tucked in everywhere: the nipple or vulva, hidden in a supple outline; the phallic candle and the slackly deflated bookmark. Beardsley was as prolific as any daily cartoonist, and it is comic to see the succession of possible cover designs he made for his next employer, the editor of the <em>Savoy</em> magazine.

      "bodyText": "Aubrey Beardsley, at Tate Britain, is elegant, biting and smart as a whip. He pits burning black shapes against the empty white space of a page with coruscating zip and register. He is master of the flowing robes, psychedelic hair and ever lengthening lines that end in swaying tassels or sharp thorns. His graphic art is nervous yet assured, morbid but witty, frequently crude yet decisively suave. Born into genteel poverty in Brighton, Beardsley (1872-98) left school at 16 and worked as a clerk in the City before studying at Westminster School of Art. He was exceptionally industrious, producing more than a thousand prints and designs in a dragonfly career that has become synonymous with fin-de-si\u00e8cle decadence. A photograph of the artist \u2013 one of several in this enormous show, the first full-scale survey since 1923 \u2013 shows Beardsley not long before he died of tuberculosis in a hotel in Menton, France. He is still upright and dapper, book in hand, as if contemplating his next illustration. He was just 25. Beardsley\u2019s long absence from our museums may be partly to do with these literary associations. To some, he is known mainly as the illustrator of Malory\u2019s Le Morte d\u2019Arthur, Wilde\u2019s Salom\u00e9 or Pope\u2019s The Rape of the Lock, with different downsides in each case. The drawings for Malory made Beardsley\u2019s name at the age of 20. But to modern eyes, they arrive out of an early aesthetic so influenced by Edward Burne-Jones, and other knight and nymph-infested pre-Raph mawkishness, as to be an obvious and weak pastiche. Even at the time, William Morris angrily remarked: \u201cDamn it, a man should do his own work.\u201d Beardsley referred to his (comparatively late) Pope illustrations as \u201cembroideries\u201d, and so they are. It is almost impossible to get your eye into these dense petit-points of dots and whirls, beauty spots and powdered curls. Pope\u2019s mock-heroic epic is lost in an excess of style. But Beardsley\u2019s connection to Oscar Wilde nearly lost him a livelihood. The illustrations to Salom\u00e9 had already baffled or horrified the critics in any case. When Wilde was arrested at the Cadogan hotel in 1895, after losing his libel trial against the Marquess of Queensberry, he was thought to have been in possession of an edition of the Yellow Book. Beardsley, the magazine\u2019s art editor, was sacked. The images for Salom\u00e9 are startling, first to last. Corpses appear to levitate; the moon has a bizarre female face; androgynous figures appear naked beneath Japanese kimonos and trailing peacock cloaks. It is nearly impossible to distinguish between the face of Salom\u00e9 and the severed head of John the Baptist, blood dripping from his luxurious tendrils. At the beautician\u2019s, in picture hat and daring d\u00e9colletage, Salom\u00e9 has been reading Zola and the Marquis de Sade. When she dies, two satirical imps bury her bare corpse in a gigantic powder box. The beautician has a tiny pair of scissors tucked into his-her pocket, and this could be the artist\u2019s own motif. Beardsley is cutting in his wit. Look at his lampoon of Whistler \u2013 from whom he took so much \u2013 as a mincing aesthete with a teensy hat perched on a thicket of coiffed curls, puppeting his signature butterfly like Disney\u2019s Tinkerbell.

But look, too, at the drawing of her glove as seen through an empty wine glass. The illusion is astonishingly subtle.

These feature one John Bull after another, more or less human or substantial, including one with a tiny but distinctly erect penis described in the outline of the breeches. You would scarcely notice it, and the editor did not. The edition had to be scrapped. Beardsley\u2019s wild visions of sex, wrote Kenneth Clark, proved \u201ccatmint to adolescents\u201d. He invented a kind of neverland of fauns, satyrs and androgynous beauties, including a manly Venus and a female Apollo; of fleshy dandies with teensy feet, masturbating matrons and young heroes who have to carry their own colossal members just to walk. Tate Britain has a side room for the most obscene prints, which include a vicious image of a middle-aged woman, bound, whipped and impaled on a classical column. This is an illustration to Lysistrata, but nothing justifies its unbridled nastiness. And nor is it so easy to elevate Beardsley as a pioneer of psychedelic art (despite a final gallery of 60s homages, including Procol Harum albums).

In losing to City, Real Madrid looked a disjointed mix of those on the way up the hill and those on the way down, with barely anyone actually at their peak. In their inhibitive dependency on Lionel Messi, Barcelona, who lurched to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/25/napoli-barcelona-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">1-1 draw a</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/25/napoli-barcelona-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">t Napoli</a> in the first leg, increasingly resemble Argentina. The comparative lack of quality of both was evident again in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/01/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\" title=\"\">last Sunday\u2019s scratchy cl\u00e1sico</a>.</p> <p>Both may argue that they are rebuilding. Madrid had been based around Cristiano Ronaldo and so were always going to require some adaptation once he had left. Bar\u00e7a have arguably not worked out in which direction they\u2019re heading since the Guardiola era ended, and any sense of strategic competence disappeared amid the panic that has followed Neymar\u2019s departure. But equally it\u2019s hard not to think that both might have begun to address their failings earlier if their stature didn\u2019t essentially guarantee them a top-three spot in la Liga. It\u2019s not as though Bar\u00e7a\u2019s stretched and creaking midfield hasn\u2019t been exposed repeatedly in Europe over the past three years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Atalanta\u2019s story is romantic but this is the first season in which the last 16 all come from the richest five leagues</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Juventus, stuttering in Serie A, were desperately uninspired in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/26/lyon-juventus-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">losing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/26/lyon-juventus-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">at Lyon</a>, who are fifth in Ligue 1. Juve\u2019s problems are almost entirely self-inflicted and born of a sense that domestic success can almost be taken for granted. The idea that five league titles and four cups in five years (and two Champions League finals) might somehow be inadequate seems absurd, but that was why Max Allegri was let go. Maurizio Sarri was appointed to manage a shift to a more progressive, possession-based game, but no one seems to have asked how he was going to achieve that with Ronaldo, who was brought in at great expense the summer before last seemingly on the logic that his prodigious goal return would bring Champions League success. Sarri talks constantly about how hard he is finding it to get his team to move the ball quickly, but it\u2019s hardly a surprise when the focus of the attack is essentially static.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Paris Saint-Germain, untouchable in France but unfulfilled in Europe. There were moments in the group stage when it seemed that Thomas Tuchel had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/18/paris-saint-germain-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">finally got the midfield right</a> thanks in large part to the signing of Idrissa Gueye but the return of Neymar has seemingly scuppered that. Brilliantly skilful he may be, but his erratic defensive work inevitably destabilises his team against high-class opposition. Borussia Dortmund, their young and vibrant attack built on the shakiest of foundations, are deeply inconsistent but outplayed PSG at home in the first leg and may regret not beating them more convincingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/18/red-hot-erling-haaland-hits-double-to-give-dortmund-victory-over-psg\" title=\"\">than the 2-1 they did manage</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66293a303c5033cd1eec68476710dfb48a6a0d5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66293a303c5033cd1eec68476710dfb48a6a0d5c/0_92_2259_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Borussia Dortmund v PSG\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borussia Dortmund players congratulate Erling Braut Haaland after their second goal against an off-colour PSG, who should have been beaten more convincingly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a common theme there, and that is a feeling of complacency or self-indulgence: these four giants, fatted on domestic dominance, losing sight of basic planning (or being lured into short-termism by presidential elections, the curse of democracy in sport) and becoming convinced that celebrities will bring success. In fact one of the reasons that the outcry against the basic inequality of the sport has reached such a pitch in England recently is that Manchester City and Liverpool have achieved the highly unusual feat of being both rich and extremely well-run (City\u2019s financial fair play breaches notwithstanding). Football could bear an uber-wealthy elite so long as it squandered most of its money. Once the super-clubs start buying players with potential to fit the long-term plan of a highly gifted coach, the result is 100-point seasons and a realisation the system is broken.</p> <p>But even City are flawed this season, undone by their failure to replace Vincent Kompany in the summer, which left them vulnerable to just the sort of long-term injuries to a centre-back that Aymeric Laporte has suffered. And Liverpool, apparently unstoppable so recently, have slowed over the past two months as some combination of fatigue, injury and pressure (or relief) have taken their toll. Bayern, meanwhile, have just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/26/robert-lewandowski-same-class-as-lionel-messi-and-cristiano-ronaldo-says-david-alaba-bayern-munich-chelsea\" title=\"\">lost </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/26/robert-lewandowski-same-class-as-lionel-messi-and-cristiano-ronaldo-says-david-alaba-bayern-munich-chelsea\" title=\"\">Robert Lewandowski</a> for a month.</p> <p>This does happen occasionally.

      "bodyText": "Just wait for the knockout phase of the Champions League. That\u2019s when the season really gets going, that\u2019s when the real football begins. That\u2019s when you get the festival that justifies the tedium of the group stage, the greatest football ever played, the glorious pay-off for the grotesque iniquities of the game\u2019s financial structure. Ah. Perhaps the second legs will be better. Or perhaps it\u2019s actually the quarter-final stage when everything gets started. But on the evidence of the first legs of the last 16, the super\u2011clubs, en masse, aren\u2019t very good this season. There are exceptions. Until the turn of the year, Liverpool were brilliant. Manchester City, fuelled by their sense of grievance, were impressive in winning at the Bernab\u00e9u \u2013 although whether despite or because of Pep Guardiola\u2019s tactical tinkering no one seemed quite able to agree. Bayern Munich have added pace and looked both dynamic and well balanced in dismissing Chelsea 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. But a lot of the other giants are having what might kindly be termed transitional seasons. In losing to City, Real Madrid looked a disjointed mix of those on the way up the hill and those on the way down, with barely anyone actually at their peak. In their inhibitive dependency on Lionel Messi, Barcelona, who lurched to a 1-1 draw at Napoli in the first leg, increasingly resemble Argentina. The comparative lack of quality of both was evident again in last Sunday\u2019s scratchy cl\u00e1sico. Both may argue that they are rebuilding. Madrid had been based around Cristiano Ronaldo and so were always going to require some adaptation once he had left. Bar\u00e7a have arguably not worked out in which direction they\u2019re heading since the Guardiola era ended, and any sense of strategic competence disappeared amid the panic that has followed Neymar\u2019s departure. But equally it\u2019s hard not to think that both might have begun to address their failings earlier if their stature didn\u2019t essentially guarantee them a top-three spot in la Liga. It\u2019s not as though Bar\u00e7a\u2019s stretched and creaking midfield hasn\u2019t been exposed repeatedly in Europe over the past three years. Juventus, stuttering in Serie A, were desperately uninspired in losing at Lyon, who are fifth in Ligue 1. Juve\u2019s problems are almost entirely self-inflicted and born of a sense that domestic success can almost be taken for granted. The idea that five league titles and four cups in five years (and two Champions League finals) might somehow be inadequate seems absurd, but that was why Max Allegri was let go. Maurizio Sarri was appointed to manage a shift to a more progressive, possession-based game, but no one seems to have asked how he was going to achieve that with Ronaldo, who was brought in at great expense the summer before last seemingly on the logic that his prodigious goal return would bring Champions League success. Sarri talks constantly about how hard he is finding it to get his team to move the ball quickly, but it\u2019s hardly a surprise when the focus of the attack is essentially static. And then there\u2019s Paris Saint-Germain, untouchable in France but unfulfilled in Europe. There were moments in the group stage when it seemed that Thomas Tuchel had finally got the midfield right thanks in large part to the signing of Idrissa Gueye but the return of Neymar has seemingly scuppered that. Brilliantly skilful he may be, but his erratic defensive work inevitably destabilises his team against high-class opposition. Borussia Dortmund, their young and vibrant attack built on the shakiest of foundations, are deeply inconsistent but outplayed PSG at home in the first leg and may regret not beating them more convincingly than the 2-1 they did manage. There is a common theme there, and that is a feeling of complacency or self-indulgence: these four giants, fatted on domestic dominance, losing sight of basic planning (or being lured into short-termism by presidential elections, the curse of democracy in sport) and becoming convinced that celebrities will bring success. In fact one of the reasons that the outcry against the basic inequality of the sport has reached such a pitch in England recently is that Manchester City and Liverpool have achieved the highly unusual feat of being both rich and extremely well-run (City\u2019s financial fair play breaches notwithstanding). Football could bear an uber-wealthy elite so long as it squandered most of its money. Once the super-clubs start buying players with potential to fit the long-term plan of a highly gifted coach, the result is 100-point seasons and a realisation the system is broken. But even City are flawed this season, undone by their failure to replace Vincent Kompany in the summer, which left them vulnerable to just the sort of long-term injuries to a centre-back that Aymeric Laporte has suffered. And Liverpool, apparently unstoppable so recently, have slowed over the past two months as some combination of fatigue, injury and pressure (or relief) have taken their toll. Bayern, meanwhile, have just lost Robert Lewandowski for a month. This does happen occasionally. Sometimes the elite do all, for various reasons, simultaneously have an off-season, or at least an off-couple of months, offering an opportunity to a lesser force. Perhaps Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, a goal up against Liverpool after the first leg, could do what Chelsea did in 2012 and, after years of near misses, finally lift the Champions League just as it seems their chance has gone. Or perhaps Julian Nagelsmann, the mini\u2011Mourinho as Tim Wiese called him, could do what the actual Mourinho achieved with Porto in 2004 and lead RB Leipzig to an unexpected success. But if there were to be a surprise winner \u2013 even little Atalanta, who beat Valencia 4-1 in their first leg \u2013 it would not invalidate the basic point that the elite is over-dominant and greedy for more. However romantic Atalanta\u2019s story, this remains the first season in which the last 16 have all been drawn from Europe\u2019s richest five leagues. Still, it is one of football\u2019s pleasing ironies, almost a natural check and balance, that nothing is more likely to deflect a side from dominance than the complacency that seems naturally to be inspired by dominance.",

      "body": "<p>There has always been more than one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidlammy\" title=\"\">David Lammy</a>, but until I read this book I didn\u2019t realise quite how many there were. To younger readers, he might be the man who went viral after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-inquiry\" title=\"\">Grenfell</a> tragedy with an emotional denunciation of the ways in which residents had been failed, or the Twitter warrior against Brexit. Older readers may, however, remember the smooth Blair protege of the 00s, whom it sometimes seems hard to reconcile with the later version. But trying to reconcile them is arguably missing the point of this thoughtful, nuanced book, which is about learning to live with complexity rather than tearing ourselves apart over it. If the conundrum Lammy raises in the book \u2013 that we all have a human need to belong to a group, but that these tribal instincts are being channelled in increasingly polarising ways that turn people against one another \u2013 isn\u2019t wholly solved, the journey towards a solution is unfailingly interesting.</p> <p>Lammy\u2019s childhood was split between Tottenham in north London, where he grew up as the child of working-class immigrant parents, and a state-funded boarding school in Peterborough, to which he won a chorister\u2019s scholarship from age 11. He went on to become a lawyer, an MP, a minister, a personal friend of Barack Obama\u2019s. He has been tipped to be Britain\u2019s first black prime minister. Yet throughout, he has been targeted with racist hate mail, much of it trying to make him feel as if he does not belong, and despite moving in elite circles he has rarely felt part of the crowd.</p> <p>Politically, Lammy is hard to pigeonhole, an advocate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/21/david-lammy-may-stand-labour-first-bame-leader\" title=\"\">national service</a> (although for civic, not military, purposes) and of John McDonnell\u2019s pet project, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/12/labour-would-trial-universal-basic-income-if-elected-john-mcdonnell-says\" title=\"\">universal basic income</a> paid to everyone regardless of salary. He was threatened with deselection by pro-Corbyn activists for challenging antisemitism within Labour, but lionised for staunchly opposing Brexit. \u201cMy identities are fluid and cross-cutting and a couple of them even contradict,\u201d he writes, adding that while all these identities are part of him, \u201cnone of them on their own define me\u201d. He insists, in short, on the right to contain multitudes, but fears Britain is struggling to do the same.</p> <p>The book divides broadly into three parts: a trip through the places that made him, an analysis of how tribalism divides society, and finally some ideas to bring it back together. The argument for a \u201cpolitics of belonging\u201d overlaps throughout with the live debate about how Labour can win again, in ways that suggest the leadership contest might have been enlivened if Lammy had stood (he became vice-chair of Keir Starmer\u2019s campaign instead). The book gives generous space to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">Lisa Nandy</a>\u2019s analysis of how Labour became estranged from its northern heartlands, while defending the best of the Blair years more strongly than anyone in this race bar Angela Rayner.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lammy encourages an \u201cencounter culture\u201d \u2013 bringing people of opposing backgrounds together to foster understanding</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sadly, for a contest short on new ideas, the final chapters are arguably the least satisfying part of an otherwise absorbing book; not because there\u2019s anything bad about the policies themselves but because most are either very familiar or \u2013 like the idea of countries coming together to formulate a global wealth tax \u2013 seem doomed to fail in the current climate. Yet perhaps there can be no silver bullet for something this complex, beyond encouraging what Lammy calls an \u201cencounter culture\u201d \u2013 bringing people of opposing views and backgrounds together to foster understanding.</p> <p>He certainly does his bit on that score. The arch-Remainer returns to Peterborough to interview Brexit voters (including Clive and Kathy, the parents of a school friend who became something of a substitute family for him) and takes an empathic view of their objections to eastern Europeans moving into town. It is, he writes, \u201cwholly understandable that the transformation of Clive and Kathy\u2019s street from a friendly family environment to one full of young, mostly male workers living chaotic lives, regardless of their background\u201d would cause alarm.</p> <p>He writes equally generously about a man charged with sending him racist abuse online, who cuts an unexpectedly sad figure in the dock. Yet he doesn\u2019t try to paper over every crack: a chapter on identity politics, that wellspring of furious rows over everything from trans rights to the legacy of colonialism, argues that righting historical injustices means accepting that divisions do exist and that people\u2019s experiences of the world are inevitably shaped by race, gender, sexuality or other aspects of personal identity. Some division, it seems, is inevitable.</p> <p>So are tribes good or bad things in themselves? The answer, seemingly, is both.

      "bodyText": "There has always been more than one David Lammy, but until I read this book I didn\u2019t realise quite how many there were. To younger readers, he might be the man who went viral after the Grenfell tragedy with an emotional denunciation of the ways in which residents had been failed, or the Twitter warrior against Brexit. Older readers may, however, remember the smooth Blair protege of the 00s, whom it sometimes seems hard to reconcile with the later version. But trying to reconcile them is arguably missing the point of this thoughtful, nuanced book, which is about learning to live with complexity rather than tearing ourselves apart over it. If the conundrum Lammy raises in the book \u2013 that we all have a human need to belong to a group, but that these tribal instincts are being channelled in increasingly polarising ways that turn people against one another \u2013 isn\u2019t wholly solved, the journey towards a solution is unfailingly interesting. Lammy\u2019s childhood was split between Tottenham in north London, where he grew up as the child of working-class immigrant parents, and a state-funded boarding school in Peterborough, to which he won a chorister\u2019s scholarship from age 11. He went on to become a lawyer, an MP, a minister, a personal friend of Barack Obama\u2019s. He has been tipped to be Britain\u2019s first black prime minister. Yet throughout, he has been targeted with racist hate mail, much of it trying to make him feel as if he does not belong, and despite moving in elite circles he has rarely felt part of the crowd. Politically, Lammy is hard to pigeonhole, an advocate of national service (although for civic, not military, purposes) and of John McDonnell\u2019s pet project, a universal basic income paid to everyone regardless of salary. He was threatened with deselection by pro-Corbyn activists for challenging antisemitism within Labour, but lionised for staunchly opposing Brexit. \u201cMy identities are fluid and cross-cutting and a couple of them even contradict,\u201d he writes, adding that while all these identities are part of him, \u201cnone of them on their own define me\u201d. He insists, in short, on the right to contain multitudes, but fears Britain is struggling to do the same. The book divides broadly into three parts: a trip through the places that made him, an analysis of how tribalism divides society, and finally some ideas to bring it back together. The argument for a \u201cpolitics of belonging\u201d overlaps throughout with the live debate about how Labour can win again, in ways that suggest the leadership contest might have been enlivened if Lammy had stood (he became vice-chair of Keir Starmer\u2019s campaign instead). The book gives generous space to Lisa Nandy\u2019s analysis of how Labour became estranged from its northern heartlands, while defending the best of the Blair years more strongly than anyone in this race bar Angela Rayner. Sadly, for a contest short on new ideas, the final chapters are arguably the least satisfying part of an otherwise absorbing book; not because there\u2019s anything bad about the policies themselves but because most are either very familiar or \u2013 like the idea of countries coming together to formulate a global wealth tax \u2013 seem doomed to fail in the current climate. Yet perhaps there can be no silver bullet for something this complex, beyond encouraging what Lammy calls an \u201cencounter culture\u201d \u2013 bringing people of opposing views and backgrounds together to foster understanding. He certainly does his bit on that score. The arch-Remainer returns to Peterborough to interview Brexit voters (including Clive and Kathy, the parents of a school friend who became something of a substitute family for him) and takes an empathic view of their objections to eastern Europeans moving into town. It is, he writes, \u201cwholly understandable that the transformation of Clive and Kathy\u2019s street from a friendly family environment to one full of young, mostly male workers living chaotic lives, regardless of their background\u201d would cause alarm. He writes equally generously about a man charged with sending him racist abuse online, who cuts an unexpectedly sad figure in the dock. Yet he doesn\u2019t try to paper over every crack: a chapter on identity politics, that wellspring of furious rows over everything from trans rights to the legacy of colonialism, argues that righting historical injustices means accepting that divisions do exist and that people\u2019s experiences of the world are inevitably shaped by race, gender, sexuality or other aspects of personal identity. Some division, it seems, is inevitable. So are tribes good or bad things in themselves? The answer, seemingly, is both. Lammy argues that the atomisation of society and collapse of old social structures are driving people towards toxic new ways of satisfying a natural desire to belong \u2013 criminal gangs, white supremacist subcultures, Isis \u2013 which would be better satisfied by creating broader communities based on positive values. He may not have all the answers on how to do that yet. But for a Labour party seeking to rebuild a broad electoral coalition, this book asks the right questions. \u2022 Tribes: How Our Need to Belong Can Make or Break the Good Society by David Lammy is published by Constable (\u00a320).

At the other end of the game there were those two cards that Jones got so worked up about, one shown to Ellis Genge, the other to Manu Tuilagi for a reckless and unnecessary tackle that damn near decapitated George North out on the right wing. Tuilagi, who made a point of walking over to North to apologise, was a deal more gracious about it than his boss was. In the middle of it, right where the fire was white hot, those two great locks, former teammates for the British and Irish Lions, Maro Itoje and Jones. They were at each other from the opening minute, Jones yanking at Itoje\u2019s shirt in a ruck like he was trying to tear down a redwood. Strong as Jones is, there wasn\u2019t an inch of give in Itoje\u2019s limbs. If Itoje seemed hardly to notice Jones that time, he sure did a few minutes later when the two of them set about each other when that scrap broke out on the English try line. The days when they were merrily sharing a room in New Zealand seemed a long way away right then as they had to be pulled apart while they were wrestling on the floor. In 2017 Jones had the edge as a player. These days Itoje doesn\u2019t lose an inch in the comparison. In the years since, he\u2019s grown into one of the very best players in the world. And right now he\u2019s playing as well as ever. Itoje\u2019s form\u2019s been gathering through this tournament, coming on like a boulder downhill, and now it\u2019s about over he\u2019s become runaway unplayable. He seemed to be involved in almost every good thing England did. We even got a rare glimpse of him galloping through midfield, 10, 20, 30 metres on into the Welsh half. In the end it took three men to bring him down. We don\u2019t see that side of Itoje\u2019s game so often anymore. He\u2019s more often prowling around the midfield at a steady jog, his mind working overtime as the game plays out around him, and he\u2019s waiting, watching, wondering where the next best opportunity will come. Or else he\u2019s running the well-oiled lineout. In the first half England had two throws five metres from the Welsh line and they threw to him both times. They scored tries off both. He stole one of Wales\u2019 throws, too, and came within inches of spoiling another when he came bursting through in pursuit of their scrum-half, Tomos Williams. He would have scragged him if Ross Moriarty hadn\u2019t hauled him back at the last minute. Itoje takes some guarding. Right now Itoje has made more tackles than any other player in the tournament, and he\u2019s in the top five for turnovers won and lineouts won too. In among it all there were a couple of times he went in too high and a couple more when he was near as dammit to being offside. That\u2019s the way he plays, right up on the line, pushing the limits of what he can get away with. It\u2019s one reason why everyone else\u2019s fans spend so much time grumbling about the way he plays and grousing about everything he\u2019s gotten away with. Consider it a misbegotten mark of respect. When Tuilagi scored the try that seemed to settle the game midway through the second half, Itoje didn\u2019t celebrate but he rushed up to Joe Launchbury, who had just come on, to pass on a couple of pointers about what was going on. And he was right to do it, too, because it turned out the game wasn\u2019t done. England had to play out the last six minutes of the game with 13 men. They were 17 points up already but you\u2019d never have guessed it from the way they fought in those moments. And there was Itoje, of course, right in the thick of it, ripping through mauls, rolling and twisting in the sea of bodies, rubbing up against Jones one last time, unforgiving to the very end.",

      "body": "<p>The Tories have been in power for almost a decade, but elements of this government believe themselves to be a revolutionary new regime. This may not be true of the prime minister himself, but it certainly is the case among the Vote Leave gang that he imported to Number 10. It is most definitely true of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\" title=\"\">Dominic Cummings</a>, the regime\u2019s hoodie-wearing Robespierre.</p> <p>For these revolutionaries, their mission is to challenge the established institutions of Britain wherever they are to be found and however well they have generally served the country in the past. The BBC will be \u201cwhacked\u201d, to use the mafiosi lingo of one anonymous briefer. The judiciary is also on their list. So, big time, is the civil service.</p> <p>The case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/04/boris-johnson-pushed-to-disclose-when-he-heard-bullying-claims\" title=\"\">Priti Patel</a> and the mounting volume of allegations about the home secretary\u2019s treatment of officials is just one face of the larger struggle between Whitehall and Downing Street. The conventional view is that Mr Cummings hates the civil service because he believes it to be infested with opponents of Brexit, but the pathology is more profound than that. He is opposed to the very concept of a permanent civil service impartially serving the government of the day whatever its political complexion. His ambition is to replace it with a more American-like set-up in which senior roles are filled with ideologically aligned political appointees. That is the primary source of the conspicuously destabilised and mutually paranoid relationship that is developing between the elected and permanent wings of government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are excellent reasons why the ministerial code states that the bullying of civil servants 'will not be tolerated'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are those who shrug: what\u2019s new? We\u2019ve always seen flare-ups when governments that want to shake things up collide with an instinctively cautious civil service. Labour ministers often arrive in office wary that Whitehall is packed with establishment types intent on smothering their radical ideas. Tory governments arrive suspicious that the civil service is stuffed with closet pinkos. What politicians and their aides think of as radical, urgent and necessary, civil servants often interpret as reckless, impetuous and unrealistic.</p> <p>Politicians complain that they get the boot from government when something goes wrong even when it is not always their fault, while for unaccountable civil servants a slide sideways or even a promotion is often the reward for failure. This partly explains the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/home-office-chief-sir-philip-rutnam-quits-over-priti-patel-bullying\" title=\"\">combustion between Ms Patel and Sir Philip Rutnam</a>, who quit as permanent secretary in a spectacularly unprecedented public fashion via a televised statement accusing her of intimidating staff and orchestrating a vicious briefing campaign against him. She is under enormous pressure from Number 10 to deliver on a new immigration system, border controls and a settlement scheme for more than 3 million EU nationals, and all by the end of the year. Her officials are sceptical that this can be done so quickly without it turning into a fiasco.</p> <p>In his account of his time at Number 10, Tony Blair commends the dedication of the civil service, but laments that he found it populated with people who \u201cfaced with big challenges\u2026 thought small thoughts\u201d. In Margaret Thatcher\u2019s memoirs, she was complimentary about the professionalism of civil servants, but despaired that they were most animated by \u201ca desire for no change\u201d. She describes a dinner with all the permanent secretaries as \u201cone of the most dismal of my time in government\u201d.</p> <p>Mr Cummings would lustily agree with them both. There is, though, a critical difference. Unlike the disruptor-in-chief, who can\u2019t see an institution without wanting to take a sledgehammer to it, neither Mrs Thatcher nor Mr Blair tried to smash the civil service. They made progress on their agendas not by shouting, swearing and trashing officials but by promoting those who were in tune with their style and grasped their goals. The elected government and the permanent one adapted to each other without violating the essential principles that hold together the constitution. There are excellent reasons why the ministerial code states that the bullying of civil servants \u201cwill not be tolerated\u201d \u2013 and not just because it is ugly behaviour. One of the jobs of senior officials is to \u201cspeak truth to power\u201d, especially if ministers are thinking about doing dangerous or unlawful things. This won\u2019t happen if civil servants are terrorised by their political masters.</p> <p>I doubt that Number 10 wanted its first high-profile struggle to be over the conduct of the home secretary. His own aides will acknowledge that Boris Johnson knows that Ms Patel isn\u2019t the most competent of ministers, but she clings on for now because they don\u2019t want to hand a scalp to the civil service and make the prime minister look stupid for appointing her to such an important job in the first place.

      "bodyText": "The Tories have been in power for almost a decade, but elements of this government believe themselves to be a revolutionary new regime. This may not be true of the prime minister himself, but it certainly is the case among the Vote Leave gang that he imported to Number 10. It is most definitely true of Dominic Cummings, the regime\u2019s hoodie-wearing Robespierre. For these revolutionaries, their mission is to challenge the established institutions of Britain wherever they are to be found and however well they have generally served the country in the past. The BBC will be \u201cwhacked\u201d, to use the mafiosi lingo of one anonymous briefer. The judiciary is also on their list. So, big time, is the civil service. The case of Priti Patel and the mounting volume of allegations about the home secretary\u2019s treatment of officials is just one face of the larger struggle between Whitehall and Downing Street. The conventional view is that Mr Cummings hates the civil service because he believes it to be infested with opponents of Brexit, but the pathology is more profound than that. He is opposed to the very concept of a permanent civil service impartially serving the government of the day whatever its political complexion. His ambition is to replace it with a more American-like set-up in which senior roles are filled with ideologically aligned political appointees. That is the primary source of the conspicuously destabilised and mutually paranoid relationship that is developing between the elected and permanent wings of government. There are those who shrug: what\u2019s new? We\u2019ve always seen flare-ups when governments that want to shake things up collide with an instinctively cautious civil service. Labour ministers often arrive in office wary that Whitehall is packed with establishment types intent on smothering their radical ideas. Tory governments arrive suspicious that the civil service is stuffed with closet pinkos. What politicians and their aides think of as radical, urgent and necessary, civil servants often interpret as reckless, impetuous and unrealistic. Politicians complain that they get the boot from government when something goes wrong even when it is not always their fault, while for unaccountable civil servants a slide sideways or even a promotion is often the reward for failure. This partly explains the combustion between Ms Patel and Sir Philip Rutnam, who quit as permanent secretary in a spectacularly unprecedented public fashion via a televised statement accusing her of intimidating staff and orchestrating a vicious briefing campaign against him. She is under enormous pressure from Number 10 to deliver on a new immigration system, border controls and a settlement scheme for more than 3 million EU nationals, and all by the end of the year. Her officials are sceptical that this can be done so quickly without it turning into a fiasco. In his account of his time at Number 10, Tony Blair commends the dedication of the civil service, but laments that he found it populated with people who \u201cfaced with big challenges\u2026 thought small thoughts\u201d. In Margaret Thatcher\u2019s memoirs, she was complimentary about the professionalism of civil servants, but despaired that they were most animated by \u201ca desire for no change\u201d. She describes a dinner with all the permanent secretaries as \u201cone of the most dismal of my time in government\u201d. Mr Cummings would lustily agree with them both. There is, though, a critical difference. Unlike the disruptor-in-chief, who can\u2019t see an institution without wanting to take a sledgehammer to it, neither Mrs Thatcher nor Mr Blair tried to smash the civil service. They made progress on their agendas not by shouting, swearing and trashing officials but by promoting those who were in tune with their style and grasped their goals. The elected government and the permanent one adapted to each other without violating the essential principles that hold together the constitution. There are excellent reasons why the ministerial code states that the bullying of civil servants \u201cwill not be tolerated\u201d \u2013 and not just because it is ugly behaviour. One of the jobs of senior officials is to \u201cspeak truth to power\u201d, especially if ministers are thinking about doing dangerous or unlawful things. This won\u2019t happen if civil servants are terrorised by their political masters. I doubt that Number 10 wanted its first high-profile struggle to be over the conduct of the home secretary. His own aides will acknowledge that Boris Johnson knows that Ms Patel isn\u2019t the most competent of ministers, but she clings on for now because they don\u2019t want to hand a scalp to the civil service and make the prime minister look stupid for appointing her to such an important job in the first place. Despite the choreographed shows of support, Tory MPs I\u2019ve spoken to, including ones with some sympathy with Ms Patel, believe she is \u201cin real trouble\u201d. Mr Rutnam is suing for constructive dismissal and his day in court will allow him to lay out the allegations against the home secretary in all their gory detail. His resignation has triggered a cascade of further accusations about her behaviour at three different departments \u2013 she denies them all \u2013 and an investigation by the Cabinet Office. This is the most ominous development for her. To many, this will smell of an inside job, but similar investigations have often been the instrument that has terminated ministerial careers. \u201cShe is now in the hands of officials. They will dredge around Whitehall for allegations against her,\u201d says one former cabinet minister. \u201cThey might not be too bad individually, but it may be there are so many of them that she can\u2019t survive.\u201d Some senior Tories familiar with the process think that the investigation will be designed to \u201cput something in front of the prime minister saying she has to go\u201d.

I invited a member of staff for Public Health England to come into my school last week to give an assembly on cleaning hands. To ensure the pupils didn\u2019t feel worried, we were careful to stress that good handwashing is what they should be doing anyway, to avoid getting colds and tummy bugs.</p> \n<p>The reality is, though, I\u2019ve got 200 children at my school and about 20 sinks. Making sure each child washes their hands for 30 seconds four times a day (after they arrive, before snacktime, before lunchtime and before they go home) is quite a big ask. If we really try to enforce that, we will cut into learning time and break time. It\u2019s very hard, logistically, to get them all to the sinks and back quickly.</p> \n<p>A number of families at our school have recently returned from holidaying in Italy. None of them are feeling unwell and none are self-isolating. They did ask me for advice on what they should do. But there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called \u201cself\u201d isolation. It\u2019s a tricky question for me to answer. First, I am not allowed to say you should keep your kids at home. Second, missing two weeks of school is massively detrimental to someone\u2019s learning. But on the other hand, we have immunocompromised children, parents and grandparents in our school community.</p> \n<p>If staff or children fell ill, I\u2019d feel awful and to some extent, responsible. On top of that, all the parents would be up in arms, criticising my decisions, bringing out the flaming torches and pitchforks, and the names of the children who didn\u2019t self-isolate will be mud. Already I\u2019ve had parents emailing, saying we should be bleaching the desks after every lesson. No matter how well we follow Public Health England\u2019s guidance, if someone does contract the coronavirus via a school, headteachers are liable to get the blame.</p> \n<h2>My pharmacies are getting a hundred requests every day for hand sanitisers</h2> \n<p><strong>Olivier Picard, owner of four Newdays pharmacies in Berkshire </strong><br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98e3248052b4119a4011fed280cf7786a155416c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98e3248052b4119a4011fed280cf7786a155416c/0_283_1788_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Picard is working 12-hour shifts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Picard is working 12-hour shifts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We are getting about 100 requests every day for hand sanitisers, but we ran out of stock more than a week ago. We are also getting 20 people a day coming in to buy face masks, and we still have some of those left.</p> \n<p>My advice to people who come in for hand sanitisers is that washing your hands with soap and water is just as efficient as using the alcohol-based gel. Anxiety levels are definitely rising, because more people are talking about it, especially in the media. I have patients with long-term conditions and respiratory diseases who are genuinely worried that the coronavirus might infect them, and are thereforelooking for professional advice. A pharmacist is available to them without an appointment, in a way that a GP isn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re getting lots of information from NHS England and the National Pharmacy Association, which has been very helpful. But seeing an extra 100 people a day who need reassurance about the lack of hand sanitisers means we are very busy. For the past few weeks, I have been working 12-hour days, six days a week, staying for hours after the pharmacy closes to dispense prescriptions and do work I would normally have been able to do in the daytime. Then, at the end of the day, I make sure I catch up on the news about the virus and NHS emails.</p> \n<p>I am most worried about how the coronavirus might hit my staff, particularly the pharmacists who dispense the medicines. There could come a point when I and other pharmacists across the country can\u2019t operate and that would affect the health of many people. I do find it very difficult to switch off from it all. But when I finally get home and put my key in the door, I try to put my phone down and give my young family the little time I have left in the evening. We tend to avoid conversations about the virus.</p> \n<h2>Residents of our care home are in their 80s and frail.

We are reasonably well-stocked with hand sanitiser and disposable waste bags, although panic buying is giving us the biggest cause for concern at the moment.</p> \n<p>Most of our residents are in their late 80s or older. They are living with advanced frailty and many have dementia. If they are exposed to this highly contagious virus, the consequences would in all likelihood be catastrophic. But while it\u2019s right to be vigilant and aware of the risks, at the same time I\u2019m trying to keep up morale and make sure everyone feels safe. If we all started wearing masks and gloves all day, it would cause a huge amount of anxiety among our residents. It\u2019s also unrealistic to expect that people living with advanced dementia and frailty are going to wash their hands between five and 10 times a day.</p> \n<p>Similarly, banning visitors is an absolute last resort, because I know how important it is to our families to be able to come and see their loved ones. We want to have a proportionate response to what is going on.</p> \n<p>I am most concerned about the consequences of a blanket school and transport closure. Many of our staff have school-age children and don\u2019t drive. So there\u2019s anxiety about whether staff are going to be able to get to work and whether food and medicine supplies will be disrupted.

I also reassured them they would get their test results within an average of two days \u2013 with a phone call if they were positive. That classic \u201cno news is good news\u201d.After one day off from CV duty I was back to it on Tuesday: another day working long hours, but at least there was a positive side: I was working with my favourite doctor. We had a relatively pleasant morning and I got my lunch in good time. </p> \n<p>Later in the week we were advised by our managers that the general public were bulk buying hand-sanitiser and we needed to be mindful they might come and target our department looking for some. An additional lock has been placed on our store cupboard \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p> \n<p>Last Thursday we had a total of 16 patient referrals, a mixture of 111 referrals and people who were self-presenting. I think that is the only frustrating thing about all this: people who are not following the public health advice, which is to call 111 and stay indoors, not come to hospital, where you are putting many more people at risk. We will not get pre-alerted that these people are on their way and subsequently they end up mixing with the general population that attend our department. It is important we educate them, and don\u2019t get too frustrated, as they tend to be anxious and are simply seeking health advice. Anyway, I cannot wait for this to be over \u2013 I hope I never have to wear another face mask or goggles again.</p> \n<h2>We are now screening all patients, and segregating any with respiratory problems</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd26b30d2043cff5dd1c1b9808a8ada202cb7845\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd26b30d2043cff5dd1c1b9808a8ada202cb7845/0_0_321_429/321.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Wheatley\" width=\"321\" height=\"429\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Dr Jane Wheatley, a GP in North London </strong><br></p> \n<p>Although we are still in the early stages of the Covid-19 outbreak it has already had a major impact on the surgery where I work.</p> \n<p>One of our receptionists told us that her younger brother had become unwell after returning from a school skiing trip to Italy, as had several of his friends. One of them got tested for the virus. When our receptionist\u2019s mother rang 111 to see if her son needed to be tested too, they said someone would come out to do that.</p> \n<p>When we heard that, we sent our receptionist home as a precaution. Public Health England said she should self-isolate and be tested and we should deep clean the surgery. That was done\u2013 overnight, so we didn\u2019t have to close \u2013 and our receptionist self-isolated. But despite several more calls to 111, her brother was never tested \u2013 his friend tested negative \u2013 and neither was she, so she came back to work. But the incident did raise concerns for us as a practice about how 111 are handling things.Last Wednesday we were told that one of our patients had been admitted to hospital with Covid-19. The next day a local primary school emailed parents of its pupils to say that a parent had tested positive for coronavirus. The parent is not in hospital, though; they are self-isolating at home. That\u2019s in line with the new policy announced that day that Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, Public Health England (PHE), the NHS and ministers have agreed, that if people who have tested positive have mild symptoms then they can stay at home as long as they isolate themselves to reduce the risk of onward transmission.</p> \n<p>Also on Thursday a parent at the school who had received its email rang our duty doctor to say that they had a child who had been unwell for a week with a temperature and dry cough but had no history of travel to any of the high-risk areas. 111 had advised that the child should see a GP. But after consultation with PHE (three phonecalls) it was decided not to see the child in our surgery and that the father should ring 111 again, with our duty doctor reviewing the child again by telephone.</p> \n<p>As GPs we do have questions about the advice NHS111 are giving some people. So far I have seen two possible Covid-19 patients, both at the GP extended hours service where I work on Saturdays. The first had symptoms of a mild viral illness and wanted a test for the virus. He had recently come back from a conference in the Far East, but not a country with a high incidence of cases, which meant he could not be tested. NHS 111 booked him in. I feel that he should have been told to self-isolate at home and not been booked in to a GP appointment, because he was not unwell enough to be seen by a doctor. I think he just had a cold.</p> \n<p>The second patient had a temperature and dry cough but no recent history of travel to an affected area overseas but had been in touch with two people who had been to a Category 1 (high-risk) country. Again he was worried about infecting family members and wanted a test. Again he had been booked in by 111. That\u2019s a concern, though, because the official advice is that anyone who may have Covid-19 should not go to a GP surgery. Generally patients worried that they may have the virus are phoning us for advice. But we\u2019ve also had two patients with symptoms come into the surgery asking to be seen, both after being told to come by 111. Neither was very unwell. We appreciate that 111 services are very busy just now, but why are they sending people who may be infected and who want a test to a GP surgery?</p> \n<p>We are now considering or have already implemented steps in line with the government\u2019s strategy of \u201ccontain\u201d and then \u201cdelay\u201d. That includes screening patients when they book an appointment by asking about travel and potential symptoms of Covid-19, and segregating patients who have any respiratory symptoms \u2013 such as babies with bronchiolitis and viral-induced wheeze \u2013 in our isolation room, so we keep them out of our waiting area. We\u2019re also dealing with more patients on the phone, through home visits and by issuing longer prescriptions to reduce the need for people to come in to the surgery. Older doctors and pregnant doctors may also concentrate on doing lab results, paperwork and telephone consultations rather than seeing patients, as we have to look after ourselves as well as our patients.</p> \n<p>But we also need PHE to takegreater account of GPs\u2019 clinical judgements about who needs to be tested, as too many people are finding it impossible to get a test, and 111 to be more consistent and not send possible Covid-19 patients to GP surgeries like ours, just because they haven\u2019t travelled or are not very sick. And importantly, we need the NHS to ensure that every GP practice has the right Personal Protective Equipment \u2013 an FFP3 respirator mask, full-length gown, long gloves, head cap and goggles or face visor \u2013 to deal with any patients we may come across who we think may have the virus. That has taken far too long to happen, which has also been an issue for GPs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "If my pupils get ill, the parents will bring out the flaming torches and pitchforks Headteacher of a primary school in Nottingham A lot of the kids had already heard about Covid-19 because it\u2019s been on the news. I invited a member of staff for Public Health England to come into my school last week to give an assembly on cleaning hands. To ensure the pupils didn\u2019t feel worried, we were careful to stress that good handwashing is what they should be doing anyway, to avoid getting colds and tummy bugs. The reality is, though, I\u2019ve got 200 children at my school and about 20 sinks. Making sure each child washes their hands for 30 seconds four times a day (after they arrive, before snacktime, before lunchtime and before they go home) is quite a big ask. If we really try to enforce that, we will cut into learning time and break time. It\u2019s very hard, logistically, to get them all to the sinks and back quickly. A number of families at our school have recently returned from holidaying in Italy. None of them are feeling unwell and none are self-isolating. They did ask me for advice on what they should do. But there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called \u201cself\u201d isolation. It\u2019s a tricky question for me to answer. First, I am not allowed to say you should keep your kids at home. Second, missing two weeks of school is massively detrimental to someone\u2019s learning. But on the other hand, we have immunocompromised children, parents and grandparents in our school community. If staff or children fell ill, I\u2019d feel awful and to some extent, responsible. On top of that, all the parents would be up in arms, criticising my decisions, bringing out the flaming torches and pitchforks, and the names of the children who didn\u2019t self-isolate will be mud.

      "body": "<p>On Sunday Liz Mayne will make a familiar \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to the Netherlands. In 2015, she flew in to inspect the wreckage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\" title=\"\">Malaysia Airlines flight MH17</a>, shot down over eastern Ukraine the previous summer. \u201cYou could still smell the burning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an overwhelming experience.\u201d</p> <p>Her son Richard, a second-year student at Leeds University, was one of 298 people on board. Ten were Britons. All perished. Richard was 20. His body was recovered intact from sunflower fields near the village of Hrabove. He was returned in the clothes he had set off in: sweatshirt and socks bearing the logo of his favourite rugby team, the Leicester Tigers.</p> <p>Since that first grim trip to see the debris, Liz has returned each year. In 2018 she and her husband, Simon, were shown poignant CCTV images of Richard, taken at Schiphol airport. On 17 July 2014, she had driven him from their home in Leicester to Birmingham; he gave her a \u201ccheeky\u201d wave before boarding a connecting flight to Amsterdam.</p> <p>The footage shows him walking towards gate eight \u2013 on his way to Australia. He goes into a tunnel and then vanishes. Seeing him alive again was both sad and magical, Liz recalls. \u201cHe is on his way to this wonderful experience. I see that as something to celebrate. He\u2019s not thinking: \u2018I am walking to my death.\u2019 He\u2019s thinking: \u2018The world is my oyster\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The wheels of justice have turned slowly. For Liz and other relatives seeking to understand why their loved ones were killed, it has been a long and painful process, threaded with grief and frustration. Their agony not helped by the fact that Russia \u2013 the state investigators allege is most responsible for the disaster \u2013 continues to deny its guilt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"189e044b01bc6cb234485d6abad0d934c4d365f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/189e044b01bc6cb234485d6abad0d934c4d365f4/0_111_2471_3087/800.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Mayne.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Mayne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday Liz will watch the start of a trial of four suspects whom Dutch authorities say were responsible for downing the Boeing 777 with a Russian anti-aircraft missile while it was on its way to Kuala Lumpur. The trial is to take place in a judicial complex in Schiphol. Twenty next of kin chosen by ballot will sit in courtroom D; Mayne will watch on a video feed from a conference centre in Utrecht.</p> <p>It will be an international affair \u2013 not surprising given that two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch, and the others came from Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. Four hundred journalists from around the world are expected to attend. Some of the British families may drop out because of fears over the coronavirus.</p> <p>The first week is expected to deal with \u201chousekeeping\u201d issues rather than hearing evidence. It will include the crucial detail of whether<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/mh17-suspects-dutch-reveal-backgrounds-of-ukraine-separatists\" title=\"\"> the suspects</a> \u2013 who are each charged with murdering all 298 passengers and crew, and with bringing a missile launcher into eastern Ukraine \u2013 will turn up. One is known to have appointed a lawyer but, since neither Russia nor Ukraine extradites its nationals, it is almost certain they will be tried in absentia.</p> <p>Three are Russians \u2013 Igor Girkin, a former colonel of Russia\u2019s FSB spy service; Sergei Dubinsky, employed by Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency; and Oleg Pulatov, a former soldier with the GRU\u2019s Spetsnaz special forces unit. A fourth is a Ukrainian citizen, Leonid Kharchenko. All were senior commanders in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR). In summer 2014, the separatist militia, helped and armed by Moscow, was embroiled in a bloody war with Ukrainian forces. Russia boosted the DNR\u2019s efforts with undercover soldiers.</p> <p>According to the prosecution, the defendants asked Russia\u2019s defence ministry for heavy weapons, and it agreed. A convoy was allegedly sent from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, based in the Russian city of Kursk. It included the Buk missile launcher used to bring down MH17.</p> <p>A tragic mistake? Or a deliberate act? This is something relatives hope the public sessions will establish.</p> <p>For more than five years the Kremlin has denied all involvement. In contrast to authorities in Iran, which in January said their military had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/11/iran-admits-shooting-down-ukrainian-airliner-unintentionally\" title=\"\">shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane</a> in error, President Vladimir Putin has batted away accusations of responsibility. Russian state TV has broadcast conspiracy theories: the Ukrainians fired on the plane, mistaking it for Putin\u2019s jet; it was already full of dead bodies; the US was to blame.</p> <p>Despite these counterclaims, the evidence against Moscow has piled up. The investigative website Bellingcat found <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/\" title=\"\">photographs </a><a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/\" title=\"\">of Russian soldiers</a> who travelled with the convoy. Locals filmed the Buk as it headed back to the Russian border, minus one missile. Girkin boasted that the rebels had shot down another \u201cbird\u201d, before deleting his post.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/30/bellingcat-eliot-higgins-exposed-novichok-russian-spy-anatoliy-chepiga\" title=\"\">Bellingcat\u2019s founder, Eliot Higgins, </a>thinks prosecutors will reveal additional evidence. He believes the Dutch-led joint investigation team has obtained further videos and photographs, and may have an image of the missile being fired. There are likely to be recorded calls between the indicted DNR operatives and their Russian army handlers, plus a possible witness who travelled with the Buk on its deadly journey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6541c6b1a947e046052730d45981afd6f857e289\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6541c6b1a947e046052730d45981afd6f857e289/96_214_3358_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Relatives attend a ceremony in memory of the victims, in the Netherlands, on the fifth anniversary of the their deaths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relatives attend a ceremony in memory of the victims, in the Netherlands, on the fifth anniversary of the their deaths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank van Beek/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trial will last many months . It\u2019s unclear if more will follow. Possible future defendants include the four Russian soldiers and a captain who crewed the anti-aircraft system \u2013 assuming they are still alive \u2013 as well as senior members of Moscow\u2019s general staff. \u201cThere\u2019s been a total Russian disinformation campaign. Getting some hard truths in a court of law is what\u2019s needed,\u201d Richard\u2019s brother, Will \u2013 now 24 \u2013 says.</p> <p>Will is scathing about the suspects, who are believed to be hiding in Russia and rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine. \u201cThese individuals are egotistical enough to take up arms and to kill other human beings. But when a tragedy like this happens in a theatre of war, nobody is man enough to own up,\u201d he says. Getting justice will be a \u201clong road\u201d, he admits, and may not happen in his parents\u2019 lifetime.</p> <p>Richard\u2019s father, Simon, says Monday\u2019s court session is the beginning of a process that \u2013 like the investigation into Lockerbie \u2013 could last 30 years. He points out that the political state of Russia a decade in the future is unknowable: \u201cIt is important to establish the facts now. The trial will reveal the chain of command right back to the Kremlin. That may one day become important.\u201d</p> <p>Simon also blames Ukraine, which in the months before the tragedy failed to close its airspace, even after its military transports were targeted. \u201cCynically, one could say that it suited them very well to have MH17 downed. The spotlight went on the Russians, sanctions were tightened, the rebellion in the east was temporarily halted,\u201d he says. He adds that the EU needs to explain why it allowed flights to go on \u201csuch a perilous path\u201d.</p> <p>Though the court process is welcome, relatives of the victims say that \u2013 almost six years on \u2013 they are still struggling to cope. Liz Mayne calls her desire to watch the proceedings close-up a \u201ccompulsion\u201d. She has written a victim impact statement that will be entered into the official record. It is a harrowing document: a moving and brutal account of how Richard\u2019s death has \u201ccompletely broken\u201d her family.</p> <p>\u201cI get quite intolerant at people moaning about little things,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m lacking in sympathy and empathy It\u2019s been eroded.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday Liz Mayne will make a familiar \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to the Netherlands. In 2015, she flew in to inspect the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, shot down over eastern Ukraine the previous summer. \u201cYou could still smell the burning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an overwhelming experience.\u201d Her son Richard, a second-year student at Leeds University, was one of 298 people on board. Ten were Britons. All perished. Richard was 20. His body was recovered intact from sunflower fields near the village of Hrabove. He was returned in the clothes he had set off in: sweatshirt and socks bearing the logo of his favourite rugby team, the Leicester Tigers. Since that first grim trip to see the debris, Liz has returned each year. In 2018 she and her husband, Simon, were shown poignant CCTV images of Richard, taken at Schiphol airport. On 17 July 2014, she had driven him from their home in Leicester to Birmingham; he gave her a \u201ccheeky\u201d wave before boarding a connecting flight to Amsterdam. The footage shows him walking towards gate eight \u2013 on his way to Australia. He goes into a tunnel and then vanishes. Seeing him alive again was both sad and magical, Liz recalls. \u201cHe is on his way to this wonderful experience. I see that as something to celebrate. He\u2019s not thinking: \u2018I am walking to my death.\u2019 He\u2019s thinking: \u2018The world is my oyster\u2019.\u201d The wheels of justice have turned slowly. For Liz and other relatives seeking to understand why their loved ones were killed, it has been a long and painful process, threaded with grief and frustration. Their agony not helped by the fact that Russia \u2013 the state investigators allege is most responsible for the disaster \u2013 continues to deny its guilt. On Monday Liz will watch the start of a trial of four suspects whom Dutch authorities say were responsible for downing the Boeing 777 with a Russian anti-aircraft missile while it was on its way to Kuala Lumpur. The trial is to take place in a judicial complex in Schiphol. Twenty next of kin chosen by ballot will sit in courtroom D; Mayne will watch on a video feed from a conference centre in Utrecht. It will be an international affair \u2013 not surprising given that two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch, and the others came from Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. Four hundred journalists from around the world are expected to attend. Some of the British families may drop out because of fears over the coronavirus. The first week is expected to deal with \u201chousekeeping\u201d issues rather than hearing evidence. It will include the crucial detail of whether the suspects \u2013 who are each charged with murdering all 298 passengers and crew, and with bringing a missile launcher into eastern Ukraine \u2013 will turn up. One is known to have appointed a lawyer but, since neither Russia nor Ukraine extradites its nationals, it is almost certain they will be tried in absentia. Three are Russians \u2013 Igor Girkin, a former colonel of Russia\u2019s FSB spy service; Sergei Dubinsky, employed by Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency; and Oleg Pulatov, a former soldier with the GRU\u2019s Spetsnaz special forces unit. A fourth is a Ukrainian citizen, Leonid Kharchenko. All were senior commanders in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR). In summer 2014, the separatist militia, helped and armed by Moscow, was embroiled in a bloody war with Ukrainian forces. Russia boosted the DNR\u2019s efforts with undercover soldiers. According to the prosecution, the defendants asked Russia\u2019s defence ministry for heavy weapons, and it agreed. A convoy was allegedly sent from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, based in the Russian city of Kursk. It included the Buk missile launcher used to bring down MH17. A tragic mistake? Or a deliberate act? This is something relatives hope the public sessions will establish. For more than five years the Kremlin has denied all involvement. In contrast to authorities in Iran, which in January said their military had shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane in error, President Vladimir Putin has batted away accusations of responsibility. Russian state TV has broadcast conspiracy theories: the Ukrainians fired on the plane, mistaking it for Putin\u2019s jet; it was already full of dead bodies; the US was to blame. Despite these counterclaims, the evidence against Moscow has piled up. The investigative website Bellingcat found photographs of Russian soldiers who travelled with the convoy. Locals filmed the Buk as it headed back to the Russian border, minus one missile. Girkin boasted that the rebels had shot down another \u201cbird\u201d, before deleting his post. Bellingcat\u2019s founder, Eliot Higgins, thinks prosecutors will reveal additional evidence. He believes the Dutch-led joint investigation team has obtained further videos and photographs, and may have an image of the missile being fired. There are likely to be recorded calls between the indicted DNR operatives and their Russian army handlers, plus a possible witness who travelled with the Buk on its deadly journey. The trial will last many months . It\u2019s unclear if more will follow. Possible future defendants include the four Russian soldiers and a captain who crewed the anti-aircraft system \u2013 assuming they are still alive \u2013 as well as senior members of Moscow\u2019s general staff. \u201cThere\u2019s been a total Russian disinformation campaign. Getting some hard truths in a court of law is what\u2019s needed,\u201d Richard\u2019s brother, Will \u2013 now 24 \u2013 says. Will is scathing about the suspects, who are believed to be hiding in Russia and rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine. \u201cThese individuals are egotistical enough to take up arms and to kill other human beings. But when a tragedy like this happens in a theatre of war, nobody is man enough to own up,\u201d he says. Getting justice will be a \u201clong road\u201d, he admits, and may not happen in his parents\u2019 lifetime. Richard\u2019s father, Simon, says Monday\u2019s court session is the beginning of a process that \u2013 like the investigation into Lockerbie \u2013 could last 30 years. He points out that the political state of Russia a decade in the future is unknowable: \u201cIt is important to establish the facts now. The trial will reveal the chain of command right back to the Kremlin. That may one day become important.\u201d Simon also blames Ukraine, which in the months before the tragedy failed to close its airspace, even after its military transports were targeted. \u201cCynically, one could say that it suited them very well to have MH17 downed. The spotlight went on the Russians, sanctions were tightened, the rebellion in the east was temporarily halted,\u201d he says. He adds that the EU needs to explain why it allowed flights to go on \u201csuch a perilous path\u201d. Though the court process is welcome, relatives of the victims say that \u2013 almost six years on \u2013 they are still struggling to cope. Liz Mayne calls her desire to watch the proceedings close-up a \u201ccompulsion\u201d. She has written a victim impact statement that will be entered into the official record. It is a harrowing document: a moving and brutal account of how Richard\u2019s death has \u201ccompletely broken\u201d her family. \u201cI get quite intolerant at people moaning about little things,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m lacking in sympathy and empathy It\u2019s been eroded. It\u2019s like this dislocation from people. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m on another planet, really. I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d She says she knows others don\u2019t want to hear a \u201cnarrative of tragedy\u201d but at the same time feels unable to move on. Richard\u2019s three siblings have adopted different survival strategies, she adds. The oldest, Tom, now 30, largely avoids the subject; Will has been the most vocal; while his younger sister, Francesca, who is 22, has struggled. \u201cShe\u2019s frozen, not able to process it,\u201d Liz says. \u201cWhen I asked her what we should do, if we were to have a magic wand, she replied: \u2018Just bring Richard back\u2019.\u201d",

The research took me back to the \u201chappiness industry\u201d, often criticised for displacing attention from the causes of unhappiness. The difference between happiness and kindness, I suggested, was that the former was passive, but the latter active. But since the rise of the hashtag, I\u2019ve started to question this.</p> <p>A number of things have spurred my questioning. One was the <em>Daily Mail </em>columnist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/02/sarah-vine-daily-mail-columnist-and-driving-force-behind-goves-pm-dream\" title=\"\">Sarah Vine</a>, who, upon the prime minister announcing last week that his girlfriend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-expecting-summer-baby\" title=\"\">Carrie Symonds</a> was having a baby, urged her Twitter followers to \u201cbe kind to the pregnant lady\u201d. Vine\u2019s kindness to pregnant women however, was memorably lacking when Meghan Markle announced her first child, with pieces on \u201cbump boasting\u201d and the problem with Markle\u2019s birth plan. Apart from the comic hypocrisy of Vine\u2019s message, one so loaded with self-interest and politics the original sentiment has almost dissolved, like nachos, soft and flannelly under their heated cheese, it vibrates with the proof that when scrutinised, \u201ckindness\u201d is not one thing. That it is allowed to shape-shift according to voice, time, audience and intention.</p> <p>Perhaps the most clear evidence of this came in the form of a photo shared online of protestors holding banners outside an abortion clinic in London. I\u2019ve seen plenty of these groups in the flesh, but the news that such protests are rising reignited my fury. Thirty eight hospitals, GP surgeries and clinics in England and Wales have reported experiencing anti-abortion activity in the past 18 months; eight of these protests are new, with Bpas (the British Pregnancy Advisory Service) saying protesters are taking \u201cadvantage of the insufficiency and incompleteness of the existing law to impinge on women\u2019s access to care\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Anti-abortion protestors believe they are shouting at scared girls to be kind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Government indifference to the enforcement of women\u2019s legal rights has led them here, with their blown-up photos of foetuses and their laminated signs about Jesus. Emboldened, a Texas-founded campaign called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/26/40-days-life-prayers-protests\" title=\"\">40 Days for Life</a> has encouraged more to assemble outside abortion clinics throughout Lent, some filming women entering, some pushing leaflets into their cars that say abortion \u201ccauses breast cancer and increases the risk of suicide\u201d, and some with microphones calling women murderers.</p> <p>My simplest response (and one that I croak from under the weight of an eight-month foetus, more aware than ever of the horror implicit in asking a woman to carry and birth a child she knows she can\u2019t care for) is that if you don\u2019t like abortions, don\u2019t have one. If you\u2019re a man, and don\u2019t like abortions, make sure you don\u2019t knock anyone up unless you\u2019re sure you\u2019re able to love and support a kid for the rest of your life. But as simple as it seems to me, it must seem even more straightforward to the protestors, who believe they are acting out of care to the unborn foetus. Though their actions appear needlessly cruel, I\u2019m sure many of the protestors believe they are shouting at scared girls because of love, because of tenderness. To be kind. Brrr.</p> <p>Which leads me to think that a campaign that asks individuals to \u201cbe kind\u201d is destined to fail. Creating a kinder culture relies on a shared motivation, well beyond protecting each other from online bullying. Kindness, in this context, is code for empathy, an action far harder to perform, because it relies on putting yourself in a stranger\u2019s shoes, and imagining their feelings, their incentives, the weight of their rotten dad\u2019s rotten faith. For all the flattening togetherness of hashtags, we\u2019re not all the same, and we don\u2019t all have the same moral codes, the same ideas of what kindness entails. So to urge our own concept of kindness on a disparate group of strangers is to invite disappointment.</p> <p>\u201cBe Kind\u201d is a phrase acceptable only for children and hashtags. Because the longer version, the chewier, more complicated version that lies beneath, the one that acknowledges and attempts to change the structures of our societies, both on and offline, so that we are all understanding of and enriched by other people\u2019s wellbeing, requires thought, compromise, hard work and, occasionally, just shutting up. And that sentence by itself would struggle to fit on a T-shirt, let alone a cupcake.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

But as simple as it seems to me, it must seem even more straightforward to the protestors, who believe they are acting out of care to the unborn foetus. Though their actions appear needlessly cruel, I\u2019m sure many of the protestors believe they are shouting at scared girls because of love, because of tenderness. To be kind. Brrr. Which leads me to think that a campaign that asks individuals to \u201cbe kind\u201d is destined to fail. Creating a kinder culture relies on a shared motivation, well beyond protecting each other from online bullying. Kindness, in this context, is code for empathy, an action far harder to perform, because it relies on putting yourself in a stranger\u2019s shoes, and imagining their feelings, their incentives, the weight of their rotten dad\u2019s rotten faith. For all the flattening togetherness of hashtags, we\u2019re not all the same, and we don\u2019t all have the same moral codes, the same ideas of what kindness entails. So to urge our own concept of kindness on a disparate group of strangers is to invite disappointment. \u201cBe Kind\u201d is a phrase acceptable only for children and hashtags. Because the longer version, the chewier, more complicated version that lies beneath, the one that acknowledges and attempts to change the structures of our societies, both on and offline, so that we are all understanding of and enriched by other people\u2019s wellbeing, requires thought, compromise, hard work and, occasionally, just shutting up. And that sentence by itself would struggle to fit on a T-shirt, let alone a cupcake. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman",

Liverpool are losing by three goals at half time. A lost cause. Minds wander to the second biology paper\u2026 But wait. Liverpool pull back to 3-3. And win on penalties. Pandemonium. We join the throng in the streets; the blaring car horns; the beer jumping, like salmon, from pint glasses; the embrace of strangers; the straining vocal cords. </p> <p>I am 18 and living in Russia, watching games on my first-generation smartphone via a 2G internet connection. Each time a player goes through on goal the signal drops to endless buffering. Liverpool finish second in the league, four points behind bitter rivals Manchester United.</p> <p>I am 26, we are bearing down on the title.

But I manage to watch the last game of the season, which will be decisive. Liverpool finish the league with 97 points; the highest points tally ever for a team that doesn\u2019t win the title. City win again. With 98 points. Liverpool do, however, win the Champions League \u2013 for the sixth time \u2013 after scoring four goals in a sublime semi-final comeback against Barcelona. The injured Mohamed Salah, watching on the bench, wears a T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cNever Give Up\u201d. The T-shirt sells out.</p> <p>I am 30. I have never witnessed my beloved Liverpool FC lift the title. Two months from now, this is going to change. As I write Liverpool have a 22-point lead at the top of the table. Of 84 points available this season, they have taken 79.

What it means to other fans: those who witnessed the dominance of the 1980s, and the younger ones who have known only disappointment. And what it means, too, for the future of the area of Anfield itself.</p> <p>It\u2019s late February in the Flat Iron pub, one of the many dotted around Anfield. Steve Dodd, who is 49, is with his friends Dan Wynn, 26, and Gerrard Noble, 47. All from Somerset, they are having a pre-match drink before the home game against West Ham. Steve talks of the current J\u00fcrgen Klopp-assembled side as the best Liverpool side he thinks he\u2019s ever seen.</p> <p>The friends have been scouring the internet for places to stay in the city for the last home fixture of the season, but to no avail. \u201cRooms are going for \u00a3400 a night,\u201d Gerrard says, his eyes widening. He and Steve are allowing themselves to get excited, but Dan, who like me has yet to experience a league title win, looks anxious and rubs his thighs. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it. Though I\u2019ve been kicked out of various WhatsApp groups for being smug about all the results.\u201d Steve tells me they weren\u2019t prepared for it, this three-decade-long wait: \u201cI just thought we\u2019d go on winning.\u201d</p> <p>We talk about how important it is that Klopp\u2019s politics match the club: Liverpool is a leftwing city; Liverpool is a leftwing club.

But isn\u2019t it true? Isn\u2019t the 127-year-old club what people think of when anyone, anywhere in the world, mentions \u201cLiverpool\u201d? The famous football team that plays in red \u2013 allowing for the Beatles, of course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"18f91cf42f54fc20b0f9e40ae5b6a9619d2834cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18f91cf42f54fc20b0f9e40ae5b6a9619d2834cf/0_213_3192_1915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man of the people: Jurgen Klopp with goalkeeper Alisson after the West Ham game last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp with goalkeeper Alisson after the West Ham United game last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Greenwood/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city has another team, the blue of Everton. I have nothing against Everton. I consider Everton fellow scousers and too little a threat to focus animosity towards. In a way, the clubs are unruly siblings; we love and scrap in equal measure. Totally different personalities, but born of the same streets.</p> <p>Four years ago, a man named J\u00fcrgen Klopp arrived on these streets. Or more accurately, he arrived in the suburb of Formby, renting the house from his managerial predecessor, Brendan Rodgers. Klopp is the football manager that even non-football fans like. He\u2019s <a href=\"https://ludovicoeinaudi.com/\" title=\"\">Ludovico Einaudi</a>, seducing those previously uninterested in classical music. He is a man of principle; a baseball cap permanently affixed to his head, as though at any point he might be required to step up to the plate on a blindingly sunny day. Perhaps for the Boston Red Sox, owned by Liverpool FC\u2019s American proprietor, John W Henry.</p> <p>Klopp is erudite. He is proudly anti-Brexit in a city that voted 58% Remain. \u201cFor me, Brexit makes no sense at all,\u201d he has said. He is a socialist: \u201cI am on the left \u2026 I believe in the welfare state. I\u2019m not privately insured. I would never vote for a party because they promised to lower the top tax rate. If there\u2019s something I will never do in my life it is vote for the right.\u201d He grew up in a humble village in Germany\u2019s Black Forest, and it shows. There\u2019s a saying in the region: \u201cthe hair in the soup\u201d. It means focusing on even the tiniest things that can be improved.</p> <p>He has the good looks of one of my favourite 1960s Russian film stars, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0218849/\" title=\"\">Aleksandr Demyanenko</a>. He hugs his players as though they were the loves of his life and he might never see them again. Journalists like him for his press-conference banter as well as his eloquence. He visits children in hospitals. He is funny. When Mario G\u00f6tze, one of his star players at former club Borussia Dortmund, left for Pep Guardiola\u2019s Bayern Munich, his explanation was: \u201cHe\u2019s leaving because he\u2019s Guardiola\u2019s favourite. If it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s mine. I can\u2019t make myself shorter and learn Spanish.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool have had many famous managers, of course. Bill Shankly (there\u2019s a statue of him outside the ground); Bob Paisley (ditto); Kenny Dalglish. But Klopp is already being talked of as one of the best ever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85a45d0d0453c29d6cc6e9f5e5f49c1e8b151db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85a45d0d0453c29d6cc6e9f5e5f49c1e8b151db4/0_264_4191_2514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Albert pub outside Anfield on a match day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Albert pub outside Anfield on a match day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liverpool the city has evolved from its shamefully prominent role in the slave trade \u2013 in common with other major British ports \u2013 to a place with a diverse population and a well-won reputation for being friendly and welcoming. But the tragedy and scandal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a>, in which 96 fans were crushed to death in 1989 at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s ground, is etched into the nation\u2019s sporting history, and its social justice record. After a 27-year-long battle to clear the names of the Liverpool fans whose reputations were smeared, after inquests that lasted two years \u2013 the longest case heard by a jury in British legal history \u2013 a verdict of unlawful killing was returned. But, as Margaret Aspinall of the indefatigable Hillsborough Family Support Group pointed out, after David Duckenfield, police commander at the ground, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/28/hillsborough-david-duckenfield-verdict\" title=\"\">cleared of manslaughter last year</a>, no one has yet been found accountable for those killings.</p> <p>The <em>Sun</em>, which categorically did not report \u201cThe Truth\u201d, as the infamous headline went, but was found to have published untruths that blamed Liverpool fans for the disaster, is a red-top pariah here. The paper is the bestselling national in print, but shifts a measly 12,000 or so copies on Merseyside. A branch of Sainsbury\u2019s was <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-sainsburys-secretly-selling-sn-13697940\" title=\"\">once found to be selling copies under the counter</a>, as though they were counterfeit cigarettes. It\u2019s a boycott that has lasted longer than many marriages.</p> <p>The socially progressive values of the club extend to it supporting an end to period poverty \u2013 free sanitary products are available in every women\u2019s loo at Anfield. Last month, the Reds Going Green initiative saw the installation of organic machines to break down food waste into water. The club even has its own allotment, which grows food to serve to fans in the main stand. It was the first Premier League club to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/11/liverpool-premier-league-club-lgbt\" title=\"\">officially involved with an LGBT Pride event</a> in 2012, at the invitation of Paul Amann. Amann tells me how he set up the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LiverpoolFCLGBTSupporters/\" title=\"\">LGBT supporters group, Kop Outs</a>, because: \u201cIt\u2019s essential that our voices are heard, our presence is welcomed and respected.\u201d The group works alongside the <a href=\"http://www.spiritofshankly.com/\" title=\"\">Spirit of Shankly</a> supporters\u2019 group and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FansSupportingFooddbanks/\" title=\"\">Fans Supporting Foodbanks</a> initiative and has regular meet-ups. These things mean something to me: a football fan as a girl, and now as a woman. A woman who dates other women. A woman who doesn\u2019t want to hear homophobic chants on the terraces. Or, it goes without saying, racist ones. Jamie Carragher, ex-player and pundit, has apologised on behalf of the club for its backing of striker Luis Su\u00e1rez, who was banned from playing for eight matches in 2011 for making racist comments. \u201cWe made a massive mistake,\u201d Carragher said. \u201cWhat message do you send to the world? Supporting someone being banned because he used some racist words.\u201d</p> <p>Back on the pitch, some of this season\u2019s performances have been, quite simply, balletic. Others as powerful and muscular as a weightlifting competition. Formations as beautiful as constellations. Forward surges as though our fullbacks were plugged into the mains. Possibly the best fullbacks playing today: 21-year-old local lad Trent Alexander-Arnold (known just as Trent) and the fiery Scot Andy Robertson (Robbo) are spoken about by pundits as innovators. Gary Lineker and I text, rapturously, about the two of them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1efa31833e0b397e15e0cd2c78ab3d5975b0567\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1efa31833e0b397e15e0cd2c78ab3d5975b0567/0_658_6131_3678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool fans Dan Wynn, Gerrard Noble and Steve Dodd enjoy a livener before the game at the Flat Iron pub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool fans Dan Wynn, Gerrard Noble and Steve Dodd enjoy a livener before the game at the Flat Iron pub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a football team to be consistent, for a team to win the league, it must be capable of winning in many different ways. The aesthetically pleasing playing out from the back. Lightning counter-attacks. Scraping 1-0 wins in the final minutes (and, particularly at the start of this season, we have done a lot of that. It\u2019s something Manchester United used to do in their 90s pomp, and naturally, I hated them for it). Mindful of the trauma of The Slip, the agreed club line is \u201cone game at a time\u201d, said again and again, as another scouse son, Pete Burns, once sang: \u201clike a record baby, right round, round, round\u2026 \u201d And my God, how many of those we\u2019ve smashed. The current side is the first in England to hold an international treble (the Champions League; Uefa Super Cup; Fifa Club World Cup). We have not lost a home game for almost two calendar years. Shortly, we\u2019ll no doubt break the record for the earliest title win during a season; the most points across Europe\u2019s top five leagues. </p> <p>It is, even to the neutral, extraordinary stuff. It is, even to the haters, albeit grudgingly, extraordinary stuff. In 2016, one of the greatest stories of modern football was the previously mediocre Leicester City winning a surprise title. Liverpool\u2019s dominance this season surpasses that for drama. It is watching history in the present.</p> <p>Being at a game at Anfield is like being high while ingesting nothing. The stands seem to have lungs. Though You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone has become supremely emotional, an anthem for strength and perseverance post-Hillsborough (\u201cwalk on through the wind / walk on through the rain\u201d) it\u2019s a song originally from the musical <em>Carousel</em>. It was a standout 1963 cover version by Liverpudlian band Gerry and the Pacemakers that kicked off its adoption at Anfield. \u201cIt\u2019s got a lot of lovely major-to-minor changes at often unexpected moments that have the effect of emotionally blindsiding you,\u201d music journalist Pete Paphides says (although he\u2019s a United fan, so feel free to discount everything he tells me). \u201cBut it\u2019s also obviously very hymnal, with a chorus which invites that religious ambiguity. It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DM-jPM0XBw\" title=\"\">Aretha Franklin\u2019s version</a> that John Peel played after Hillsborough and rendered himself incapable of carrying on by virtue of doing so.\u201d</p> <p>Anfield has always been something special; players from countless teams often talk of it being the greatest ground they have ever played at. Or the most intimidating. Or the most electric. But of late, there\u2019s an extra buoyancy. The crowd salivates.</p> <p>Watching the game against West Ham, we take the lead within 10 minutes, but they quickly equalise, before going ahead. We score twice more. It is our 21st consecutive home win, setting a Premier League-era record. At the end of the game, Klopp and his players applaud the Kop end, fans\u2019 eyes glistening with both emotion and wind chill (\u201cwalk on, through the wind\u2026 \u201d)</p> <p>Adjacent to the stadium at the redbrick Albert pub, Clara, Tom, John \u2013 all in their 20s, students, and local \u2013 and John\u2019s dad, David, who is 53, are cheering the last-ditch win. I repeat what I asked Steve and his friends: just how excited should we all be?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f8f053a4869a99bee86f2751da9442d52cf462d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f8f053a4869a99bee86f2751da9442d52cf462d/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scarves for sale outside Anfield before the game versus West Ham United.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scarves for sale outside Anfield before the game versus West Ham United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cVery fucking excited,\u201d says John. \u201cVery fucking excited,\u201d Tom concurs. (Scousers use swear words as ellipses. And the speed of Liverpudlian patter matches the rat-a-tat-tat of freestyle rappers.) The Albert is floor-to-ceiling in flags; unassuming from the outside, iconic inside. Across the road at the Park \u2013 the \u201cEstablished 1888\u201d sign above its door \u2013 it is <em>Where\u2019s Wally?</em> levels of rammed, entirely usual for a match day. But the mood is as disbelieving as triumphant. It hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it already feels as though people are waiting to be shaken awake from a dream. Around the corner, posters at another fan favourite, the Sandon, advertise a huge end-of-season victory party. I grab a burger at the Kop of the Range, a kebab joint not far from a scarf stall that has seen its business rocket over the past three years.</p> <p>My Uber driver, Mohamed, 35, moved to the city from Sri Lanka. A massive Salah fan, he tells me his own revenue booms when the club win a game \u2013 happier fans means higher fares. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to spend money on a loss,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we win, the whole mood lifts. You can feel it in the car. Though when you start driving with Uber, they tell you not to mention what football team you support. Because football means a lot to people. There are many feelings involved with football.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unsurprising to me that even back in Sri Lanka, Mohamed was a fan. Liverpool is a global behemoth. The richest club in the UK outside Manchester. </p> <p>A \u00a31.7bn valuation; \u00a3533m turnover; pre-tax profits of \u00a342m. Matchday ticket revenues increased (thanks to a regenerated \u00a3110m main stand). Visiting the club shop, there is LFC-branded gin; babygros; even a Hello Kitty tie-in range. As Richard Haigh at consultants Brand Finance tells me, next season\u2019s kit deal with Nike is \u201cexpected to represent the largest in history. Brands will be willing to pay to have some magic dust of LFC.\u201d There are official stores as far afield as Dubai and Bangkok.</p> <p>John W Henry has won the support of the fans for his positive handling of the club. And yet, despite this huge wealth, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/835115/IoD2019_Statistical_Release.pdf\" title=\"\">Anfield is the 10th most deprived neighbourhood in the country</a>. Boarded-up houses surround the stadium. The club has not covered itself in glory in the past, accused of buying up properties in unscrupulous ways. But it is hoped that local enterprises, such as the community-run Homebaked cake shop and new housing association properties, will make the neighbourhood better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2ea246fd121fc800bcaf6ed1bc9cee553b744d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2ea246fd121fc800bcaf6ed1bc9cee553b744d2/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Big business: inside the club shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big business: inside the club shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week, we were knocked out of the FA Cup in a match against Chelsea. Or, as I call that fixture, Kensington versus Kensington. (In Liverpool\u2019s \u201cKenny\u201d, 98% of residents are among the most deprived 5% nationally. In London\u2019s, residents earn three times the national average.)</p> <p>In the league, there has been a blip. Last weekend we finally lost. And we lost 3-0 to, with the greatest respect, Watford; not a bad side, but a side ensconced in a relegation battle. Arsenal, who once went a whole season unbeaten (\u201cthe Invincibles\u201d), and are keen to keep that record, tweeted from the official club account: \u201cPhew!\u201d</p> <p>But I am not panicking. It\u2019s possible Dan from the Flat Iron is panicking. But Klopp isn\u2019t panicking. In typical fashion, he said the fact we played an absolutely awful game of football was \u201crather positive\u2026 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cA couple of years ago,\u201d our hero reminds us, \u201cI said we wanted to write our own stories and create our own history, and obviously the boys took what I said really seriously. It is so special. The numbers are incredible.\u201d In a nod to Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s famous line that his greatest challenge was \u201cknocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\u201d, Liverpool chief executive Peter Moore says now: \u201cWe are back on our perch.\u201d As <em>The Anfield Wrap</em>\u2019s Gareth says: \u201cIn a dream scenario, a period of dominance follows. Not so long ago that dream was just that. Now, it\u2019s a reality that is much easier to imagine.\u201d</p> <p>Four more games. Eyes on the prize.

      "bodyText": "I am three years old in the photograph, hugging a plastic, flyaway football. I am seven, arriving tentatively for my first training session at a local girls\u2019 club. I am bounding back to my mother\u2019s car, blowing hot breath on cold hands, beaming, the salt from the artificial turf embedded in the soles of my trainers. I am eight and glued to the television, watching teen wunderkind and my Liverpool hero, Michael Owen, score the perfect goal against Argentina in World Cup 98. I am nine. I give up one of the few days I have to visit my father to attend my first ever match at Anfield, Liverpool FC\u2019s famous stadium. A week later, my father dies. These two events are inextricably linked in my mind, and the guilt continues to whichever day you are reading this. I am 10 and make my first appearance in print in a feature for the local paper, the Liverpool Echo, about girls getting into football. I am quoted as saying that all my sister cares about is boys and fashion. Twelve years old and the fuzzy letters of \u201cParkinson\u201d on the back of my shirt arch down my shoulder blades. I am 13. Our team, known as Liverpool Feds, are approached by Liverpool FC to become their official girls\u2019 outfit. We visit Melwood, the first team\u2019s training ground. The full-size goals loom like scaffolding. I am 14. My hero, Owen, makes the same move to Real Madrid that Steve McManaman made five years before him. This breaks my heart. Suddenly, all I care about is boys and fashion. Without really making a decision, I give up football. Cold winter nights are spent inside on the sofa watching Sex and the City. I discover live music and MySpace. I am 15. I own the entire range of Clearasil products. A group of my schoolfriends and I take a night off GCSE revision to watch the 2005 European Champions League final in Istanbul; the first the club has reached since the mid-80s, and so it is forbidden not to watch. Liverpool are losing by three goals at half time. A lost cause. Minds wander to the second biology paper\u2026 But wait. Liverpool pull back to 3-3. And win on penalties. Pandemonium. We join the throng in the streets; the blaring car horns; the beer jumping, like salmon, from pint glasses; the embrace of strangers; the straining vocal cords. I am 18 and living in Russia, watching games on my first-generation smartphone via a 2G internet connection. Each time a player goes through on goal the signal drops to endless buffering. Liverpool finish second in the league, four points behind bitter rivals Manchester United. I am 26, we are bearing down on the title. Steven Gerrard in an impromptu on-pitch team talk, after a crucial win against the newly flush Manchester City, shouts hoarsely at his players: \u201cThis does not fucking slip now!\u201d The next home game, Gerrard \u2013 one of the best players the club has ever seen, captain, scouser, Liverpool FC lifer \u2013 literally slips on the turf against Chelsea to concede a goal. We lose. Manchester City finish top of the league by two points. I am 29. I am in Cuba, where the internet is heavily censored. But I manage to watch the last game of the season, which will be decisive. Liverpool finish the league with 97 points; the highest points tally ever for a team that doesn\u2019t win the title. City win again. With 98 points. Liverpool do, however, win the Champions League \u2013 for the sixth time \u2013 after scoring four goals in a sublime semi-final comeback against Barcelona. The injured Mohamed Salah, watching on the bench, wears a T-shirt bearing the slogan \u201cNever Give Up\u201d. The T-shirt sells out. I am 30. I have never witnessed my beloved Liverpool FC lift the title. Two months from now, this is going to change. As I write Liverpool have a 22-point lead at the top of the table. Of 84 points available this season, they have taken 79. Next Monday is the derby against Everton. I want to untangle what this will mean to me \u2013 the fan who met Steven Gerrard a couple of years ago, grinning like a child; the fan who, two weeks ago, was unbelievably touched when current star Trent Alexander-Arnold recorded a video message to cheer her up during a bad time. What it means to other fans: those who witnessed the dominance of the 1980s, and the younger ones who have known only disappointment. And what it means, too, for the future of the area of Anfield itself. It\u2019s late February in the Flat Iron pub, one of the many dotted around Anfield. Steve Dodd, who is 49, is with his friends Dan Wynn, 26, and Gerrard Noble, 47. All from Somerset, they are having a pre-match drink before the home game against West Ham. Steve talks of the current J\u00fcrgen Klopp-assembled side as the best Liverpool side he thinks he\u2019s ever seen. The friends have been scouring the internet for places to stay in the city for the last home fixture of the season, but to no avail. \u201cRooms are going for \u00a3400 a night,\u201d Gerrard says, his eyes widening. He and Steve are allowing themselves to get excited, but Dan, who like me has yet to experience a league title win, looks anxious and rubs his thighs. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it. Though I\u2019ve been kicked out of various WhatsApp groups for being smug about all the results.\u201d Steve tells me they weren\u2019t prepared for it, this three-decade-long wait: \u201cI just thought we\u2019d go on winning.\u201d We talk about how important it is that Klopp\u2019s politics match the club: Liverpool is a leftwing city; Liverpool is a leftwing club. At the last election, Labour retained all of its 14 MPs on Merseyside. The city has never forgiven the Tories for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe\u2019s strategy of \u201cmanaged decline\u201d. Thatcher is a hated figure. But so is Derek Hatton, the former city council deputy leader and member of the Marxist group Militant. Last month, Italy\u2019s rightwing politician Matteo Salvini was forced to deny that he had pulled out of a visit to Liverpool after the metropolitan region\u2019s mayor called him a \u201cfascist\u201d. During several games last year, chants rang out for Jeremy Corbyn. The current prime minister conspicuously avoids visiting. As Gareth Robertson, who is a part of the immensely popular The Anfield Wrap podcast, with more than 200,000 weekly downloads in 200 countries, puts it to me: \u201cNot only do we want a good football coach, we expect almost a political leader, someone who gets us, and our city, its values.\u201d Humorously, there have been petitions for Liverpool to become a self-determined scouse state, and \u201cScouse not English\u201d is a frequent terrace chant. The club has a mantra: \u201cThis means more.\u201d It pisses off other teams and is, understandably, dismissed as marketing speak. But isn\u2019t it true? Isn\u2019t the 127-year-old club what people think of when anyone, anywhere in the world, mentions \u201cLiverpool\u201d? The famous football team that plays in red \u2013 allowing for the Beatles, of course. The city has another team, the blue of Everton. I have nothing against Everton. I consider Everton fellow scousers and too little a threat to focus animosity towards. In a way, the clubs are unruly siblings; we love and scrap in equal measure. Totally different personalities, but born of the same streets. Four years ago, a man named J\u00fcrgen Klopp arrived on these streets. Or more accurately, he arrived in the suburb of Formby, renting the house from his managerial predecessor, Brendan Rodgers. Klopp is the football manager that even non-football fans like. He\u2019s Ludovico Einaudi, seducing those previously uninterested in classical music. He is a man of principle; a baseball cap permanently affixed to his head, as though at any point he might be required to step up to the plate on a blindingly sunny day. Perhaps for the Boston Red Sox, owned by Liverpool FC\u2019s American proprietor, John W Henry. Klopp is erudite. He is proudly anti-Brexit in a city that voted 58% Remain. \u201cFor me, Brexit makes no sense at all,\u201d he has said. He is a socialist: \u201cI am on the left \u2026 I believe in the welfare state. I\u2019m not privately insured. I would never vote for a party because they promised to lower the top tax rate. If there\u2019s something I will never do in my life it is vote for the right.\u201d He grew up in a humble village in Germany\u2019s Black Forest, and it shows. There\u2019s a saying in the region: \u201cthe hair in the soup\u201d. It means focusing on even the tiniest things that can be improved. He has the good looks of one of my favourite 1960s Russian film stars, Aleksandr Demyanenko. He hugs his players as though they were the loves of his life and he might never see them again. Journalists like him for his press-conference banter as well as his eloquence. He visits children in hospitals. He is funny. When Mario G\u00f6tze, one of his star players at former club Borussia Dortmund, left for Pep Guardiola\u2019s Bayern Munich, his explanation was: \u201cHe\u2019s leaving because he\u2019s Guardiola\u2019s favourite. If it\u2019s anyone\u2019s fault, it\u2019s mine. I can\u2019t make myself shorter and learn Spanish.\u201d Liverpool have had many famous managers, of course. Bill Shankly (there\u2019s a statue of him outside the ground); Bob Paisley (ditto); Kenny Dalglish. But Klopp is already being talked of as one of the best ever. Liverpool the city has evolved from its shamefully prominent role in the slave trade \u2013 in common with other major British ports \u2013 to a place with a diverse population and a well-won reputation for being friendly and welcoming. But the tragedy and scandal of Hillsborough, in which 96 fans were crushed to death in 1989 at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s ground, is etched into the nation\u2019s sporting history, and its social justice record. After a 27-year-long battle to clear the names of the Liverpool fans whose reputations were smeared, after inquests that lasted two years \u2013 the longest case heard by a jury in British legal history \u2013 a verdict of unlawful killing was returned. But, as Margaret Aspinall of the indefatigable Hillsborough Family Support Group pointed out, after David Duckenfield, police commander at the ground, was cleared of manslaughter last year, no one has yet been found accountable for those killings. The Sun, which categorically did not report \u201cThe Truth\u201d, as the infamous headline went, but was found to have published untruths that blamed Liverpool fans for the disaster, is a red-top pariah here. The paper is the bestselling national in print, but shifts a measly 12,000 or so copies on Merseyside. A branch of Sainsbury\u2019s was once found to be selling copies under the counter, as though they were counterfeit cigarettes. It\u2019s a boycott that has lasted longer than many marriages. The socially progressive values of the club extend to it supporting an end to period poverty \u2013 free sanitary products are available in every women\u2019s loo at Anfield. Last month, the Reds Going Green initiative saw the installation of organic machines to break down food waste into water. The club even has its own allotment, which grows food to serve to fans in the main stand. It was the first Premier League club to be officially involved with an LGBT Pride event in 2012, at the invitation of Paul Amann. Amann tells me how he set up the LGBT supporters group, Kop Outs, because: \u201cIt\u2019s essential that our voices are heard, our presence is welcomed and respected.\u201d The group works alongside the Spirit of Shankly supporters\u2019 group and the Fans Supporting Foodbanks initiative and has regular meet-ups. These things mean something to me: a football fan as a girl, and now as a woman. A woman who dates other women. A woman who doesn\u2019t want to hear homophobic chants on the terraces. Or, it goes without saying, racist ones. Jamie Carragher, ex-player and pundit, has apologised on behalf of the club for its backing of striker Luis Su\u00e1rez, who was banned from playing for eight matches in 2011 for making racist comments. \u201cWe made a massive mistake,\u201d Carragher said. \u201cWhat message do you send to the world? Supporting someone being banned because he used some racist words.\u201d Back on the pitch, some of this season\u2019s performances have been, quite simply, balletic. Others as powerful and muscular as a weightlifting competition. Formations as beautiful as constellations. Forward surges as though our fullbacks were plugged into the mains. Possibly the best fullbacks playing today: 21-year-old local lad Trent Alexander-Arnold (known just as Trent) and the fiery Scot Andy Robertson (Robbo) are spoken about by pundits as innovators. Gary Lineker and I text, rapturously, about the two of them. For a football team to be consistent, for a team to win the league, it must be capable of winning in many different ways. The aesthetically pleasing playing out from the back. Lightning counter-attacks. Scraping 1-0 wins in the final minutes (and, particularly at the start of this season, we have done a lot of that. It\u2019s something Manchester United used to do in their 90s pomp, and naturally, I hated them for it). Mindful of the trauma of The Slip, the agreed club line is \u201cone game at a time\u201d, said again and again, as another scouse son, Pete Burns, once sang: \u201clike a record baby, right round, round, round\u2026 \u201d And my God, how many of those we\u2019ve smashed. The current side is the first in England to hold an international treble (the Champions League; Uefa Super Cup; Fifa Club World Cup). We have not lost a home game for almost two calendar years. Shortly, we\u2019ll no doubt break the record for the earliest title win during a season; the most points across Europe\u2019s top five leagues. It is, even to the neutral, extraordinary stuff. It is, even to the haters, albeit grudgingly, extraordinary stuff. In 2016, one of the greatest stories of modern football was the previously mediocre Leicester City winning a surprise title. Liverpool\u2019s dominance this season surpasses that for drama. It is watching history in the present. Being at a game at Anfield is like being high while ingesting nothing. The stands seem to have lungs. Though You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone has become supremely emotional, an anthem for strength and perseverance post-Hillsborough (\u201cwalk on through the wind / walk on through the rain\u201d) it\u2019s a song originally from the musical Carousel. It was a standout 1963 cover version by Liverpudlian band Gerry and the Pacemakers that kicked off its adoption at Anfield. \u201cIt\u2019s got a lot of lovely major-to-minor changes at often unexpected moments that have the effect of emotionally blindsiding you,\u201d music journalist Pete Paphides says (although he\u2019s a United fan, so feel free to discount everything he tells me). \u201cBut it\u2019s also obviously very hymnal, with a chorus which invites that religious ambiguity. It was Aretha Franklin\u2019s version that John Peel played after Hillsborough and rendered himself incapable of carrying on by virtue of doing so.\u201d Anfield has always been something special; players from countless teams often talk of it being the greatest ground they have ever played at. Or the most intimidating. Or the most electric. But of late, there\u2019s an extra buoyancy. The crowd salivates. Watching the game against West Ham, we take the lead within 10 minutes, but they quickly equalise, before going ahead. We score twice more. It is our 21st consecutive home win, setting a Premier League-era record. At the end of the game, Klopp and his players applaud the Kop end, fans\u2019 eyes glistening with both emotion and wind chill (\u201cwalk on, through the wind\u2026 \u201d) Adjacent to the stadium at the redbrick Albert pub, Clara, Tom, John \u2013 all in their 20s, students, and local \u2013 and John\u2019s dad, David, who is 53, are cheering the last-ditch win. I repeat what I asked Steve and his friends: just how excited should we all be? \u201cVery fucking excited,\u201d says John. \u201cVery fucking excited,\u201d Tom concurs. (Scousers use swear words as ellipses. And the speed of Liverpudlian patter matches the rat-a-tat-tat of freestyle rappers.) The Albert is floor-to-ceiling in flags; unassuming from the outside, iconic inside. Across the road at the Park \u2013 the \u201cEstablished 1888\u201d sign above its door \u2013 it is Where\u2019s Wally? levels of rammed, entirely usual for a match day. But the mood is as disbelieving as triumphant. It hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it already feels as though people are waiting to be shaken awake from a dream. Around the corner, posters at another fan favourite, the Sandon, advertise a huge end-of-season victory party. I grab a burger at the Kop of the Range, a kebab joint not far from a scarf stall that has seen its business rocket over the past three years. My Uber driver, Mohamed, 35, moved to the city from Sri Lanka. A massive Salah fan, he tells me his own revenue booms when the club win a game \u2013 happier fans means higher fares. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to spend money on a loss,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we win, the whole mood lifts. You can feel it in the car. Though when you start driving with Uber, they tell you not to mention what football team you support. Because football means a lot to people. There are many feelings involved with football.\u201d It\u2019s unsurprising to me that even back in Sri Lanka, Mohamed was a fan. Liverpool is a global behemoth. The richest club in the UK outside Manchester. A \u00a31.7bn valuation; \u00a3533m turnover; pre-tax profits of \u00a342m. Matchday ticket revenues increased (thanks to a regenerated \u00a3110m main stand). Visiting the club shop, there is LFC-branded gin; babygros; even a Hello Kitty tie-in range. As Richard Haigh at consultants Brand Finance tells me, next season\u2019s kit deal with Nike is \u201cexpected to represent the largest in history. Brands will be willing to pay to have some magic dust of LFC.\u201d There are official stores as far afield as Dubai and Bangkok. John W Henry has won the support of the fans for his positive handling of the club. And yet, despite this huge wealth, Anfield is the 10th most deprived neighbourhood in the country. Boarded-up houses surround the stadium. The club has not covered itself in glory in the past, accused of buying up properties in unscrupulous ways. But it is hoped that local enterprises, such as the community-run Homebaked cake shop and new housing association properties, will make the neighbourhood better. Last week, we were knocked out of the FA Cup in a match against Chelsea. Or, as I call that fixture, Kensington versus Kensington. (In Liverpool\u2019s \u201cKenny\u201d, 98% of residents are among the most deprived 5% nationally. In London\u2019s, residents earn three times the national average.) In the league, there has been a blip. Last weekend we finally lost. And we lost 3-0 to, with the greatest respect, Watford; not a bad side, but a side ensconced in a relegation battle. Arsenal, who once went a whole season unbeaten (\u201cthe Invincibles\u201d), and are keen to keep that record, tweeted from the official club account: \u201cPhew!\u201d But I am not panicking. It\u2019s possible Dan from the Flat Iron is panicking. But Klopp isn\u2019t panicking. In typical fashion, he said the fact we played an absolutely awful game of football was \u201crather positive\u2026 \u201d \u201cA couple of years ago,\u201d our hero reminds us, \u201cI said we wanted to write our own stories and create our own history, and obviously the boys took what I said really seriously. It is so special. The numbers are incredible.\u201d In a nod to Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s famous line that his greatest challenge was \u201cknocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\u201d, Liverpool chief executive Peter Moore says now: \u201cWe are back on our perch.\u201d As The Anfield Wrap\u2019s Gareth says: \u201cIn a dream scenario, a period of dominance follows. Not so long ago that dream was just that. Now, it\u2019s a reality that is much easier to imagine.\u201d Four more games. Eyes on the prize. For me, at last, 30 years in the making, eyes on the prize.",

Now, as the world deals with a public health emergency in the shape of the coronavirus outbreak, experts worry his immigration policies may put everyone at risk. There is a widespread fear that the president\u2019s policies have sown such fear of deportation and wariness of any contact with US authorities among immigrants \u2013 who also have greater difficulty getting healthcare \u2013 that many of them will not seek help if they fall sick with the virus. \u201cIf you continue to discourage people from seeking services under normal circumstances, you cannot expect them necessarily to seek those services just because you as the racist, anti-immigrant president have decided that now it\u2019s a good idea. That\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d said Max Hadler, director of health policy at the New York Immigration Coalition. Even as coronavirus spreads across the US, the Trump administration is ramping up surveillance in so-called sanctuary cities, places where local police don\u2019t always work with federal immigration enforcement. The operation\u2019s goal is to \u201carrest as many undocumented immigrants as possible\u201d, the New York Times reported, and it is being executed as prominent sanctuary cities such as Seattle, Los Angeles and New York stare down a potential coronavirus public health crisis. Randy Capps, director of research for US programs at the Migration Policy Institute, warned that officers could spread the coronavirus if they go door-to-door in localities that have already been affected. Meanwhile, Hadler worried that an increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) presence could deter immigrants from accessing healthcare. Medical treatment and healthcare facilities are supposed to be \u201csensitive locations\u201d, exempt from most immigration enforcement actions. But that has been undermined as reports from around the country have indicated Ice officers arrested or questioned people at or near hospitals. Last month, Ice brought a man in handcuffs out of a Brooklyn hospital after agents tasered and shot another person who tried to intervene in his arrest. Neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) nor Ice responded to a request for comment. An expanded public charge rule targeting immigrants\u2019 use of public benefits could also impact how people approach coronavirus as fears over their citizenship status \u2013 or that of their relatives \u2013 discourages many from seeking help from the state, even when it comes to healthcare. The rule went into effect in late February, and has caused fear and uncertainty in immigrant communities. It doesn\u2019t apply to public health services, community health centers or hospital emergency rooms or preclude anyone from getting screened or cared for, said Capps, but it still might make immigrants less likely to seek healthcare unless they\u2019re in urgent need. The Trump administration has also attempted to deny visas to anyone who can\u2019t prove they will have health insurance or be able to afford medical costs in the US. In the face of more stringent immigration policies and heightened enforcement, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that in December 2018, 6.3% of adults in immigrant families said they or a family member had avoided going to the doctor or a clinic because they did not want to be asked or bothered about their citizenship status. \u201cWe certainly have seen that there\u2019s evidence that some people are avoiding medical care, and I think our take is that it certainly poses a public health risk,\u201d said Hamutal Bernstein, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute who co-authored the report. Her research found immigrant families didn\u2019t enroll in benefits such as Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program before the new rule was implemented because they didn\u2019t want anyone in their family to lose out on a green card. Those reactions were widespread, even among people who weren\u2019t implicated in the policy change. It\u2019s too soon to know how these trends will influence whether immigrants get screened or treated specifically for coronavirus, experts say, though some believe there\u2019s cause for concern. \u201cIf it hits the immigrant communities, I mean, I\u2019m just sure that some people will not go to the hospitals because of fear of being deported and being separated from their loved ones,\u201d said Ally Bolour, a Los Angeles- based immigration attorney who\u2019s on the American Immigration Lawyers Association\u2019s board of governors. Bolour has witnessed first-hand what the virus can do: his sister and her husband tested positive while traveling abroad and are currently quarantined in Tokyo. He said the situation has been \u201clike a horror movie\u201d, and as recently as two weeks ago, he wasn\u2019t sure that his brother-in-law would survive. \u201cThis is a national health emergency crisis.

The US hosts the world\u2019s largest immigration detention system, where detainees sometimes endure \u201cdilapidated\u201d and \u201cmoldy\u201d bathrooms, eat expired food and lack basic toiletries for personal hygiene, according to DHS\u2019s internal watchdog.

      "body": "<p>When Alison Brie was in middle school, her grandmother, who was schizophrenic and homeless, was knocked down by a car and left in a coma. \u201cMy family didn\u2019t have the resources to care for her,\u201d Brie says. \u201cAnd she lived on the street.\u201d On a visit to the hospital, she remembers struggling to connect the dirty homeless woman in the bed with a photo at home of her grandparents on their wedding day \u2013 \u201cDancing, looking beautiful, radiant.\u201d</p> <p>Brie, 37, who has alert, glacier-bright blue eyes, tells this moving story with unrehearsed candour. Talking publicly about her grandmother is still a fresh experience, and raw, but it\u2019s also cathartic. For a long time, these were conversations she had only with her mother, but that time is over. Her new film, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/horse-girl-review-alison-brie-shines-in-frustrating-netflix-psychodrama\" title=\"\">Horse Girl</a></em>, now on Netflix, is a fiction, but one that mines her grandmother\u2019s story for a twisting meditation on mental illness with a mischievous coda: just because someone is schizophrenic doesn\u2019t mean the aliens aren\u2019t real.</p> <p>On shows like NBC\u2019s <em>Community</em> and the Netflix series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/jun/22/glow-review-a-riotous-portrayal-of-the-piledriving-world-of-womens-wrestling\" title=\"\">G</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2017/jun/22/glow-review-a-riotous-portrayal-of-the-piledriving-world-of-womens-wrestling\" title=\"\">low</a></em>, Brie has won accolades for her comic instincts. <em>Horse Girl</em> initially feels like a quirky indie vehicle for those same reflexes, alternating between whimsical scenes in a craft store, where her character, Sarah, works by day, and awkward interactions with Sarah\u2019s roommate, Nikki, by night. But then the film\u2019s mood shifts and darkens. Sarah\u2019s grip on reality becomes increasingly untethered. She begins to obsess about the story of her mentally ill grandmother. Unaccountable nosebleeds and sleepwalking stints spiral into wild conspiracy theories involving alien abduction and cloning. By the end, the audience is left to connect the dots between the real and the imagined.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieqemSsMxek\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ieqemSsMxek?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Latest role: Alison Brie draws on her experience with her grandmother for Horse Girl. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Co-written by Brie and director Jeff Baena, <em>Horse Girl </em>seems to relish ambiguity and defy easy categories. The review site, <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/horse_girl\" title=\"\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, classifies it as a \u201ccomedy, drama, science fiction and fantasy\u201d, which seems about right. In online forums it has elicited acres of head-scratching analysis. Brie can live with that. \u201cOnce you release art into the world, I think the fun part is letting it speak to people in the way it speaks to them,\u201d she says. \u201cThen it\u2019s theirs as much as it is yours.\u201d</p> <p>We are sitting in the dining room of New York\u2019s Whitby Hotel, beneath the frozen gaze of a brass parakeet perched in a chandelier above us. Brie, who is in the midst of making a new movie, <em>Happiest Season</em>, directed and co-written by Clea DuVall, had spent the previous night filming in Pittsburgh. As a result, she has motored through the day on 40 minutes\u2019 sleep, avoiding the temptation of a catnap.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My grandma thought the house was bugged and her children were spies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d sat down for 15 minutes, I was going to pass out,\u201d she says. Instead, she is here, sipping tea with honey and lemon, and giving an excellent impression of someone who can think of no better place to be, despite the bed waiting somewhere above our heads. This, after all, is also a measure of success \u2013 not just award shows and parties, but the schlep of interviews, the 6am hunt for the departure gate, or, as at the Sundance Festival in January, having to change in an airport toilet for a red-carpet premiere. \u201cThere\u2019s something very humbling about being, like, \u2018Then I ran into this little room where someone just took a shit and stood on my own jeans so that I wasn\u2019t standing on the bathroom floor,\u2019\u201d she says, laughing.</p> <p>Sundance marked the first time Brie watched <em>Horse Girl</em> with an audience, a moment of validation. Afterwards people wanted \u2013 <em>needed \u2013</em> to tell her their own mental-health stories. \u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt really proud and grateful.\u201d But the opinion she cared about most was her mother\u2019s. \u201cThrough this whole process of making it, the conversation I had with my mum after her seeing the film was the most intimate,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been some conversations I feel are too personal to share, but also some things that my mum suddenly opened up about that I had never heard before, and that were much darker than I realised.\u201d Brie worried that perhaps the film had \u201crattled something open\u201d in her mother\u2019s head, a trauma that she had wanted to forget. \u201cShe was shaken, but she doesn\u2019t seem upset with me about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62c6467362afceefe154c00e5de13af0cfc393a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62c6467362afceefe154c00e5de13af0cfc393a4/0_1540_6192_6021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Studying drama was my opportunity to be the freest I had ever been\u2019: Alison Brie wears trousers and jacket by Area, top by Norma Kamali, shoes by Schutz, rings by Ananya, Lady Grey and Pamela Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"972\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Studying drama was my opportunity to be the freest I had ever been\u2019: Alison Brie wears trousers and jacket by Area, top by Norma Kamali, shoes by Schutz, rings by Ananya, Lady Grey and Pamela Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Dorsa/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of us look to our grandparents to help inform and make sense of our own identities. For Brie, that narrative is scrambled by mental illness. \u201cMy grandmother thought that the house was bugged and that her children were spies,\u201d she says. In the 1960s, when her grandmother began displaying signs of schizophrenia, treatment was haphazard and shrouded in shame. \u201cShe was medicated by a doctor who gave her uppers to wake up in the morning and downers to go to bed,\u201d Brie says. Her uncle \u2013 the youngest of four children, and subjected to physical abuse \u2013 was the first to be taken into care; her mother and a younger sister soon followed.</p> <p>\u201cThe effects of this trauma spider-webbed its way down through the whole family,\u201d Brie says. \u201cAt the same time, my mum had a very intense loyalty to her own mother, so that was traumatic for her as well.\u201d She marvels at her mother\u2019s resilience. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry talking about it,\u201d she says, and pauses to steady herself. \u201cOften I\u2019ll stop and think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe the things she went through, and how she turned out to be such a wonderful mum.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Although <em>Horse Girl </em>is inspired by her grandmother, the narrative is shaped by another question that has gnawed at Brie\u2019s consciousness: what if she begins to act abnormally too? Would she be aware she was slipping into schizophrenia? How would she be able to distinguish between what was real and what was not?</p> <p>\u201cRight before we started writing the movie, I went through a deep depression unlike any I had experienced,\u201d she says. \u201cI would just sit there sobbing, even though everything was fine.

      "bodyText": "When Alison Brie was in middle school, her grandmother, who was schizophrenic and homeless, was knocked down by a car and left in a coma. \u201cMy family didn\u2019t have the resources to care for her,\u201d Brie says. \u201cAnd she lived on the street.\u201d On a visit to the hospital, she remembers struggling to connect the dirty homeless woman in the bed with a photo at home of her grandparents on their wedding day \u2013 \u201cDancing, looking beautiful, radiant.\u201d Brie, 37, who has alert, glacier-bright blue eyes, tells this moving story with unrehearsed candour. Talking publicly about her grandmother is still a fresh experience, and raw, but it\u2019s also cathartic. For a long time, these were conversations she had only with her mother, but that time is over. Her new film, Horse Girl, now on Netflix, is a fiction, but one that mines her grandmother\u2019s story for a twisting meditation on mental illness with a mischievous coda: just because someone is schizophrenic doesn\u2019t mean the aliens aren\u2019t real. On shows like NBC\u2019s Community and the Netflix series Glow, Brie has won accolades for her comic instincts. Horse Girl initially feels like a quirky indie vehicle for those same reflexes, alternating between whimsical scenes in a craft store, where her character, Sarah, works by day, and awkward interactions with Sarah\u2019s roommate, Nikki, by night. But then the film\u2019s mood shifts and darkens. Sarah\u2019s grip on reality becomes increasingly untethered. She begins to obsess about the story of her mentally ill grandmother. Unaccountable nosebleeds and sleepwalking stints spiral into wild conspiracy theories involving alien abduction and cloning. By the end, the audience is left to connect the dots between the real and the imagined. Co-written by Brie and director Jeff Baena, Horse Girl seems to relish ambiguity and defy easy categories. The review site, Rotten Tomatoes, classifies it as a \u201ccomedy, drama, science fiction and fantasy\u201d, which seems about right. In online forums it has elicited acres of head-scratching analysis. Brie can live with that. \u201cOnce you release art into the world, I think the fun part is letting it speak to people in the way it speaks to them,\u201d she says. \u201cThen it\u2019s theirs as much as it is yours.\u201d We are sitting in the dining room of New York\u2019s Whitby Hotel, beneath the frozen gaze of a brass parakeet perched in a chandelier above us. Brie, who is in the midst of making a new movie, Happiest Season, directed and co-written by Clea DuVall, had spent the previous night filming in Pittsburgh. As a result, she has motored through the day on 40 minutes\u2019 sleep, avoiding the temptation of a catnap. \u201cIf I\u2019d sat down for 15 minutes, I was going to pass out,\u201d she says. Instead, she is here, sipping tea with honey and lemon, and giving an excellent impression of someone who can think of no better place to be, despite the bed waiting somewhere above our heads. This, after all, is also a measure of success \u2013 not just award shows and parties, but the schlep of interviews, the 6am hunt for the departure gate, or, as at the Sundance Festival in January, having to change in an airport toilet for a red-carpet premiere. \u201cThere\u2019s something very humbling about being, like, \u2018Then I ran into this little room where someone just took a shit and stood on my own jeans so that I wasn\u2019t standing on the bathroom floor,\u2019\u201d she says, laughing. Sundance marked the first time Brie watched Horse Girl with an audience, a moment of validation. Afterwards people wanted \u2013 needed \u2013 to tell her their own mental-health stories. \u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt really proud and grateful.\u201d But the opinion she cared about most was her mother\u2019s. \u201cThrough this whole process of making it, the conversation I had with my mum after her seeing the film was the most intimate,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been some conversations I feel are too personal to share, but also some things that my mum suddenly opened up about that I had never heard before, and that were much darker than I realised.\u201d Brie worried that perhaps the film had \u201crattled something open\u201d in her mother\u2019s head, a trauma that she had wanted to forget. \u201cShe was shaken, but she doesn\u2019t seem upset with me about it.\u201d Most of us look to our grandparents to help inform and make sense of our own identities. For Brie, that narrative is scrambled by mental illness. \u201cMy grandmother thought that the house was bugged and that her children were spies,\u201d she says. In the 1960s, when her grandmother began displaying signs of schizophrenia, treatment was haphazard and shrouded in shame. \u201cShe was medicated by a doctor who gave her uppers to wake up in the morning and downers to go to bed,\u201d Brie says. Her uncle \u2013 the youngest of four children, and subjected to physical abuse \u2013 was the first to be taken into care; her mother and a younger sister soon followed. \u201cThe effects of this trauma spider-webbed its way down through the whole family,\u201d Brie says. \u201cAt the same time, my mum had a very intense loyalty to her own mother, so that was traumatic for her as well.\u201d She marvels at her mother\u2019s resilience. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry talking about it,\u201d she says, and pauses to steady herself. \u201cOften I\u2019ll stop and think, \u2018I can\u2019t believe the things she went through, and how she turned out to be such a wonderful mum.\u2019\u201d Although Horse Girl is inspired by her grandmother, the narrative is shaped by another question that has gnawed at Brie\u2019s consciousness: what if she begins to act abnormally too? Would she be aware she was slipping into schizophrenia? How would she be able to distinguish between what was real and what was not? \u201cRight before we started writing the movie, I went through a deep depression unlike any I had experienced,\u201d she says. \u201cI would just sit there sobbing, even though everything was fine. Nothing had happened.\u201d In fact, by any normal measure life could hardly be better. She had recently married actor Dave Franco, and had just wrapped the second season of Glow. She was being nominated for awards. It \u201ccame out of nowhere,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to get irrationally angry at my own DNA, and started to think, \u2018This is just in me, I can\u2019t even control this. This is brain chemistry.\u2019\u201d Brie resisted medication for her depression, but did take up therapy. That helped, but it also informed the writing of Horse Girl: what would happen to someone who did not have the money for therapy, or the supportive husband, or a network of friends? The question became the spark for her character Sarah\u2019s spiralling crisis. In the movie\u2019s most disturbing scene, a new romance curdles as Sarah realises her date has merely been humouring her manic chatter about aliens and clones. In that moment she has never been more alone. While Horse Girl came out of Brie\u2019s meditation on her family history, the parallels only go so far. Sarah is tentative, lonely and awkward.

      "body": "<h2>All hail maiden aunts<br></h2> <p>Last week I was installed deep in the bowels of the BBC, where I was recording a series of essays I\u2019d written for Radio 3 \u2013 and there I must admit that I did briefly find myself wondering what might happen in the event that the coronavirus hits Broadcasting House. If BBC radio had only a skeleton staff, for instance, what would get priority, <em>You and Yours</em> or <em>Woman\u2019s Hour</em>? (Cue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jenni-murray\" title=\"\">Jenni Murray</a> in a hazmat suit.)</p> <p>For the most part, though, I was intensely focused on the task in hand. Behind a microphone, I inevitably find myself unable to pronounce perfectly ordinary words. Plus, I must somehow try to resist my craven \u2013 and deeply unfashionable \u2013 urge to make myself sound posher. The trouble is that I worry about my vowels. If my \u201caunt\u201d sounds like \u201cant\u201d, won\u2019t some listeners think I\u2019m talking about insects?</p> <p>Maiden aunts, that now almost extinct species, feature heavily in my essay The Odd Woman, which is about single women in all their guises, from the surplus generation created by the First World War to the Mateus Ros\u00e9-swigging divorcees of the 1970s. Naturally, I\u2019ve included David Copperfield\u2019s beloved aunt, Betsey Trotwood; Sponge and Spiker from <em>James and the Giant Peach</em> also appear.

      "bodyText": "All hail maiden aunts Last week I was installed deep in the bowels of the BBC, where I was recording a series of essays I\u2019d written for Radio 3 \u2013 and there I must admit that I did briefly find myself wondering what might happen in the event that the coronavirus hits Broadcasting House. If BBC radio had only a skeleton staff, for instance, what would get priority, You and Yours or Woman\u2019s Hour? (Cue Jenni Murray in a hazmat suit.) For the most part, though, I was intensely focused on the task in hand. Behind a microphone, I inevitably find myself unable to pronounce perfectly ordinary words. Plus, I must somehow try to resist my craven \u2013 and deeply unfashionable \u2013 urge to make myself sound posher. The trouble is that I worry about my vowels. If my \u201caunt\u201d sounds like \u201cant\u201d, won\u2019t some listeners think I\u2019m talking about insects? Maiden aunts, that now almost extinct species, feature heavily in my essay The Odd Woman, which is about single women in all their guises, from the surplus generation created by the First World War to the Mateus Ros\u00e9-swigging divorcees of the 1970s. Naturally, I\u2019ve included David Copperfield\u2019s beloved aunt, Betsey Trotwood; Sponge and Spiker from James and the Giant Peach also appear. But it\u2019s my own great aunts, Hilda and Vera, who have the starring roles. As a girl, I understood these two women hardly at all; I was a bit afraid of them, I think. But now I\u2019m middle-aged myself, they feel newly dear to me: I see their great stoicism and pluck, as well as their outlandish hats and snakeskin handbags. It\u2019s very good, even this late in the day, to be able to make amends for the callousness of youth. Defoe does great plague In France, sales of Albert Camus\u2019 1947 novel The Plague have risen sharply in the face of anxiety about Covid-19, while in Britain it seems that most people would rather spend their money on extra loo roll. Literally no one \u2013 or not that I\u2019ve heard of, anyway \u2013 is racing to buy Daniel Defoe\u2019s 1722 fiction-history mash-up, A Journal of the Plague Year. This is a shame, and not only because it\u2019s so grimly immediate (the novel purports to be an eyewitness account of the 1665 great plague of London, and thanks to this you can practically smell the death and decay that\u2019s abroad). Defoe, a journalist first and last, is ever alive to the fact that panic is another contagion, one of the principal symptoms of which is the kind of suspicion that has people desperately hiding their distempers, spots and swollen gums for fear they will otherwise be shunned by their neighbours, and have their houses shut up by the authorities. Defender of beauty I knew Fiona MacCarthy, the wondrous biographer of Eric Gill and William Morris, hardly at all. But when I heard that she\u2019d died, I realised how much she meant to me. Having fallen in love with the designer David Mellor (they met in the 1960s, when she went to interview him), this clever, beautiful woman who had once been a debutante came to live with him in Sheffield, my home town \u2013 something I could never quite get over. It sounds silly, but I always felt wonderful about this South Yorkshire leap of faith. Combined with her passionate conviction that beauty has an essential part to play in the raising of human spirits, it made her a heroine to me, and I wish now that I\u2019d taken the chance properly to tell her so. \u2022 Rachel Cooke is an Observer columnist",

      "bodyText": "There are demands for independent inquiries into the roles of the Foreign Office and Cambridgeshire police after an investigation into the abduction of a princess on a British street was allowed to lapse. Princess Shamsa Al Maktoum of Dubai was snatched two decades ago by men working for her father, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, the billionaire ruler of Dubai, who is a friend of the Queen. Politicians and human rights groups said the inquiries were vital if political interference into the investigation was to be ruled out, and for the public\u2019s faith in the rule of law to be maintained. The demands came amid extraordinary claims that Shamsa had contacted the Cambridgeshire force in 2017, asking it to help secure her release from Dubai, 17 years after she was snatched in Cambridge. The force is already under scrutiny after the bombshell ruling in the high court family division, published last week, which established that Sheikh Mohammed had kidnapped both Shamsa and her younger sister, Princess Latifa. The \u201cfact-finding\u201d ruling found that Shamsa had fled the Dubai family\u2019s Surrey estate in 2000, but men working on behalf of her father captured her in Cambridge and forcibly returned her to Dubai, where she has been held against her will for 20 years. A request by David Beck, the Cambridgeshire detective leading the investigation into the abduction, to interview potential witnesses in Dubai, was turned down in 2002, the court heard. The force has subsequently said it did not have sufficient evidence to proceed, and the investigation lapsed. David Haigh, a human rights lawyer, shared confidential information with Cambridgeshire police relating to the two princesses in 2018 and 2019 as he sought to have the investigation into Shamsa\u2019s abduction reopened. During his meetings with detectives, Haigh said a female detective had told him that Shamsa had phoned in 2017 requesting the force\u2019s help. Haigh told the Observer: \u201cShe said \u2018I was here when she [Shamsa] called us six months ago\u2019 and I said \u2018oh\u2019 and then she said, \u2018didn\u2019t you know that?\u2019\u201d Cambridgeshire police confirmed that it conducted a further review of the original investigation in 2017, only to again conclude that there was insufficient evidence for further action. A spokeswoman for the force said: \u201cAs with any crime it is inappropriate for us to make any comment in relation to specific contact or accounts from any victim. As far as the IOPC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] is concerned, since the release of the public judgment the case is now subject to further review by ourselves. This will take a period of time to progress but whether a referral is required will be an area for discussion.\u201d Last week\u2019s ruling also detailed two unsuccessful attempts by Latifa to flee the United Arab Emirates, most recently in 2018 when she tried to escape by yacht. Radha Stirling, chief executive of Detained in Dubai, who alerted authorities to Latifa\u2019s 2018 abduction and has submitted evidence to the UN and the FBI, confirmed that both women have been making \u201congoing attempts to get their messages out\u201d. Downing Street has insisted that the Foreign Office had no role in the investigation into Shamsa\u2019s abduction or its outcome. But the Foreign Office has confirmed that it holds information relevant to the investigation, which it refused to disclose to the high court, claiming that it would harm the UK\u2019s relationship with the UAE. \u201cGiven the seriousness of the allegations concerning Cambridgeshire police\u2019s due diligence during the investigation into Princess Shamsa\u2019s disappearance, a self-referral to the IOPC is the right course of action,\u201d said Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK\u2019s director. \u201cIt\u2019s of paramount importance that public confidence in the police isn\u2019t undermined by cases like this, not least when there are claims of political interference at the highest levels.\u201d Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cThe government must now establish an independent inquiry into what role the Foreign Office played in preventing that investigation going ahead.

Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president, Mike Pence, has been tasked with heading up the US response to coronavirus, a dangerous disease that has now killed more than 3,400 people worldwide and quarantined millions. It has shuttered institutions from schools to the Louvre and put an end to pilgrimages to Islam\u2019s two holiest cities in Saudi Arabia.

Employees at the department of health were unwilling to comment on Pence, but they did say that the syringe program has been overwhelmingly successful in confronting the HIV outbreak. However, despite that success, opponents of the programs remain and without legislative action, exchanges in Austin and elsewhere in Indiana will be shut down next year. Public health experts who offered recommendations on combatting the HIV outbreak in Indiana have questioned whether Pence can put evidence ahead of his own beliefs.

Carrie Lawrence, the associate director of the center, said the Austin HIV outbreak showed that when Pence has to make a public health decision \u201chis go to is his ideology or faith instead of going to the data or the evidence\u201d. Pence likely already faces a conflict between ideology and expertise: while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that coronavirus has the potential to have serious disruption in the US, the president has largely downplayed the threat of the virus. On Wednesday, Trump \u2013 without evidence \u2013 called the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) coronavirus mortality rate \u201ca false number\u201d and said thousands of people infected with coronavirus \u201cget better, just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work\u201d. In Austin, where the HIV outbreak occurred, there is hope that Pence\u2019s experiences in Indiana will help him. Howell, the pastor, said Pence made some missteps in 2015. \u201cI think he missed telltale signs prior \u2013 and then when the problem got big he acted on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to put a fire out when it\u2019s smoldering. Once it becomes a blaze, it\u2019s harder to control.\u201d However, he said he trusts Pence and believes he is capable of handling the US\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cI think maybe [the HIV outbreak] was given to him as a test for this bigger obstacle now that he has to take care of,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he can take some of these hard lessons learned and apply them here. And I pray that he listens to doctors and goes against what even he himself might think to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Howell said addiction remains a problem in Austin, but that \u201crecovery is bigger\u201d. One of the people at the church\u2019s free meal last week was Laura Nowling, 51, who has been sober for three years following addictions to methamphetamines, cocaine and alcohol. Her life came crashing down in February 2016 when she was arrested for drug possession at Austin elementary school, where she was a teacher. Then, last year, her oldest son died at 26 from a fentanyl overdose in Ohio after getting hooked on opioids in Austin. Her two other children are recovering from addictions as well. Nowling said the idea of a syringe exchange was wildly unpopular in Austin in 2015, particularly among those who had no personal connection to addiction. \u201cEven though it wasn\u2019t popular at the time, [Pence] went ahead and made it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he went against public opinion, I guess. I think that\u2019s good.\u201d She added: \u201cI think if they\u2019ve asked him to do that, he will take the initiative to do what\u2019s right and not necessarily go with popular opinion.\u201d",

As the situation evolves, individual countries \u2013 and travel operators \u2013 are introducing different policies, leaving some travellers stranded, others uncertain and many out of pocket. Advice from airlines has been confusing, with some offering refunds or rebookings to passengers headed for risky regions and some leaving them to their fate. Insurers are similarly divided in what they will and won\u2019t offer. For those wondering what to do about an impending holiday, it\u2019s important to know when a refund is a right and when it depends on goodwill.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m due to go on holiday to Venice this month but I\u2019m worried about the infection in </strong><strong>northern Italy.

Insurers may make an exception if your GP confirms that your condition makes it risky for you to travel.</p> <p><strong>I booked flights from London to Delhi with Oman Air to attend a wedding.

However, article 2(j) exempts airlines from liability if there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d such as health, safety or inadequate travel documentation. All of those could be applied to you, meaning that you are not entitled to your money back, although some airlines are being more sympathetic. Many passengers are struggling to get accurate information from airlines and booking agents so it\u2019s vital that you make your own checks. Oman Air did not respond to requests for a comment.</p> <p><strong>We were booked to go on a Royal Caribbean cruise from Hong Kong.

Cruise passengers are particularly vulnerable to the rapidly evolving crisis, not only because any flights booked separately are non-refundable unless the airline is prepared to be flexible, but because ships have proved an incubator for the virus. The Cruise Lines International Association says its members will deny boarding to anyone who has been in South Korea, China, Hong Kong or Macau within 14 days of joining the cruise ship.

If, on the other hand, you had booked the two flights separately, then a carrier who cancels one has no responsibility to refund the other.

Passengers whose flights are cancelled can in fact claim a refund directly from the airline under EC 261/2004, according to Coby Benson of the aviation specialist solicitor Bott &amp; Co, and airlines have no business batting them back to the booking agent. Since the coronavirus counts as an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d, the usual compensation is not payable on top of the refund.

If you bought flights, accommodation and tickets for an event separately, you are not protected unless there\u2019s a Foreign Office warning against travel to the area. Package bookings may be eligible for a refund in these circumstances since under the package travel regulations, you can request your money back if a tour operator makes a \u201csignificant change\u201d to the arrangements. BA has announced that bookings made between 3 and 16 March can be postponed for no extra charge, but passengers who wish to cancel seats booked before that are subject to usual rules depending on the type of ticket.</p>",

      "body": "<p>International Women\u2019s Day, on 8 March, is like an annual progress report on women\u2019s rights, asking how far we have come. The findings of the UN Development Forum gender index, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/05/nine-out-of-10-people-found-to-be-biased-against-women\" title=\"\">published</a> on Thursday, provide a bleak answer: 90% of the population in 75 countries is biased against women. Meanwhile men\u2019s rights activists, living in a parallel universe they deem \u201cgynocentric\u201d, <a href=\"https://avoiceformen.com/a-voice-for-men/mission-statement/\" title=\"\">believe</a> \u201cthe efforts to enhance the rights of women have become toxic efforts to undermine the rights of men\u201d.</p> <p>This kind of narrative has been around for more than 30 years. Starting with fathers angry about custody rights, it mutated into a rabid men\u2019s rights movement with distinctive male supremacist characteristics. More recently it entered the mainstream, overlapping with white supremacists, incels and the far right, and embodied in the person of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/aug/14/why-jordan-peterson-is-filling-the-void-modern-masculinity-episode-1\" title=\"\">Jordan Peterson</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Icelandic men have the highest life expectancy in Europe \u2013 and that\u2019s not just down to the cold air and herring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They see rights as a zero-sum game, as if there existed only a limited pool of them, and if women gain more then men must inevitably have fewer. If women are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/12/university-gender-gap-scandal-thinktank-men\" title=\"\">entering</a> higher education in greater numbers than men, it must be because they\u2019ve elbowed out the men. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/the-end-of-men-by-hanna-rosin.html\" title=\"\">shift</a> from manufacturing to service jobs isn\u2019t a macroeconomic and transnational trend but a plot by women \u2013 a \u201cwar on masculinity\u201d. There\u2019s even an International Men\u2019s Day (and you thought there were already 365 of them?).</p> <p>What makes this even more dispiriting is that there really is a lot wrong with men\u2019s lives \u2013 the higher <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2018registrations\" title=\"\">rates</a> of male suicide attest to that.

      "bodyText": "International Women\u2019s Day, on 8 March, is like an annual progress report on women\u2019s rights, asking how far we have come. The findings of the UN Development Forum gender index, published on Thursday, provide a bleak answer: 90% of the population in 75 countries is biased against women. Meanwhile men\u2019s rights activists, living in a parallel universe they deem \u201cgynocentric\u201d, believe \u201cthe efforts to enhance the rights of women have become toxic efforts to undermine the rights of men\u201d. This kind of narrative has been around for more than 30 years. Starting with fathers angry about custody rights, it mutated into a rabid men\u2019s rights movement with distinctive male supremacist characteristics. More recently it entered the mainstream, overlapping with white supremacists, incels and the far right, and embodied in the person of Jordan Peterson. They see rights as a zero-sum game, as if there existed only a limited pool of them, and if women gain more then men must inevitably have fewer. If women are now entering higher education in greater numbers than men, it must be because they\u2019ve elbowed out the men. The shift from manufacturing to service jobs isn\u2019t a macroeconomic and transnational trend but a plot by women \u2013 a \u201cwar on masculinity\u201d. There\u2019s even an International Men\u2019s Day (and you thought there were already 365 of them?). What makes this even more dispiriting is that there really is a lot wrong with men\u2019s lives \u2013 the higher rates of male suicide attest to that. Yet the cause isn\u2019t women\u2019s rights but the very way that masculinity has been constituted in profit-obsessed, patriarchal cultures: as feminists have been saying for a long time, the patriachy damages not just women but also men. The idea that women\u2019s rights are gained at the expense of men\u2019s is actually the opposite of the truth: there\u2019s now a stack of evidence that men benefit from living in more gender-equal societies and that policies promoting gender equality improve the quality of life of everyone, not just for women. A recent WHO report comparing 41 European countries found that men\u2019s health was poorer in more gender-unequal societies \u2013 the sexual division of labour harms men as well as women. When the sexes are more equal, men say they\u2019re more satisfied with life. In more gender-equal societies such as the Nordic countries, apparently both men and women sleep better. The latter, a finding from a recent European study, suggests that this isn\u2019t just because waking obligations and stresses affect our sleep but also because men in more equal societies take better care of themselves. In more gender-equal societies men are half as likely to be depressed, less likely to commit suicide, have around a 40% smaller risk of dying a violent death and even suffer less from chronic back pain. Adolescent boys in those countries have fewer psychosomatic complaints and are more likely to use contraceptives. And sex? Contrary to the stereotypes, one study found that men with feminist partners reported greater sexual satisfaction, as did women with partners who supported feminism. Before we hurtle into a gender-equal sexual nirvana, though, we need to factor in some other truths. Like the fact that most men benefit from male privilege and are unlikely to relinquish it voluntarily for some promised future gain. What\u2019s more, just as women don\u2019t form a single homogeneous group, neither do men: it\u2019s hard to see what privileges an unemployed BME man with a disability could trade in for a good night\u2019s sleep. Some women will also respond to all this with a dismissive \u201cwho cares?\u201d. Why should change only get enacted if it benefits men? Isn\u2019t improving the lives of women a good enough reason for gender equality? We spend so much of our lives thinking about men\u2019s needs, can\u2019t we get time off for good behaviour? I have some sympathy for this view, and the one that voices concern that men will muscle their way into gender equality and make it all about them.

Seven years ago, her daughters entered her in a local cookery competition because they wanted the prize money to buy a computer. Now, her business \u2013 providing traditional meals and cookery lessons to tourists \u2013 is helping put the girls through university.</p> <p>Even though working for a salary remains relatively new for many Turkish women, one of the nation\u2019s most famous exports is a result of their talents. Historically, weaving was a female pursuit and women\u2019s lives are written into the warp and weft of Turkey\u2019s carpets, if you know how to read them. Our lesson in this art comes from Ruth, a New Zealander who has been in the rug trade here for 30 years. Rather than giving us the usual hard sell, Ruth speaks passionately about the women who made these rugs by hand \u2013 an art that has almost died out as nomadic and village communities modernise. I enter her shop, <a href=\"https://www.tribalcollectionscarpets.com/\" title=\"\">Tribal Collections</a> in G\u00f6reme, somewhat half-heartedly but leave a convert, wondering how many of the cecim rugs knotted by nomadic women from Konya I can fit in my suitcase.</p> <p>Our next stop is the Antalyan coast and Kekova island, an idyllic spot where bougainvillea curls around harbourside restaurant terraces and Lycian ruins pepper the wooded hillsides. On a day cruise around the island, our traditional wooden <em>gulet</em> is piloted by Sebahat, who owns the craft with her husband Mehmet and proudly displays her captain\u2019s licence. We swim, eat, swim again, eat again, and as the sun sets our guide Aynur opens yet another bottle of wine.</p> <p>In 2017, Intrepid committed to doubling the number of female tour leaders it employs, and 34-year-old Aynur, who grew up in Amasya in Turkey\u2019s Black Sea region, is one of its local recruits. At our side since we landed in Istanbul, she\u2019s the lynchpin of the trip: translator, navigator, cultural commentator, sommelier, late-night-dancer and expert Turkish coffee-maker. As we sit on deck, watching the stars, I remember the proverb she told us as she brewed the first cup of our trip: share a coffee with a Turk, and you\u2019ll share a lifelong friendship. Whether caffeine is the catalyst I can\u2019t say but I\u2019ll definitely leave Turkey having forged bonds with women I\u2019ll never forget.</p> <p>\u2022<em> The trip was provided by <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/uk/turkey/turkey-womens-expedition-125259\" title=\"\">Intrepid Travel</a>.

Even though working for a salary remains relatively new for many Turkish women, one of the nation\u2019s most famous exports is a result of their talents. Historically, weaving was a female pursuit and women\u2019s lives are written into the warp and weft of Turkey\u2019s carpets, if you know how to read them. Our lesson in this art comes from Ruth, a New Zealander who has been in the rug trade here for 30 years. Rather than giving us the usual hard sell, Ruth speaks passionately about the women who made these rugs by hand \u2013 an art that has almost died out as nomadic and village communities modernise. I enter her shop, Tribal Collections in G\u00f6reme, somewhat half-heartedly but leave a convert, wondering how many of the cecim rugs knotted by nomadic women from Konya I can fit in my suitcase. Our next stop is the Antalyan coast and Kekova island, an idyllic spot where bougainvillea curls around harbourside restaurant terraces and Lycian ruins pepper the wooded hillsides. On a day cruise around the island, our traditional wooden gulet is piloted by Sebahat, who owns the craft with her husband Mehmet and proudly displays her captain\u2019s licence. We swim, eat, swim again, eat again, and as the sun sets our guide Aynur opens yet another bottle of wine. In 2017, Intrepid committed to doubling the number of female tour leaders it employs, and 34-year-old Aynur, who grew up in Amasya in Turkey\u2019s Black Sea region, is one of its local recruits. At our side since we landed in Istanbul, she\u2019s the lynchpin of the trip: translator, navigator, cultural commentator, sommelier, late-night-dancer and expert Turkish coffee-maker. As we sit on deck, watching the stars, I remember the proverb she told us as she brewed the first cup of our trip: share a coffee with a Turk, and you\u2019ll share a lifelong friendship. Whether caffeine is the catalyst I can\u2019t say but I\u2019ll definitely leave Turkey having forged bonds with women I\u2019ll never forget. \u2022 The trip was provided by Intrepid Travel.

Adding in \u00a33 for a return bus fare, a cleaner should therefore be paid \u00a321.14 to clean for an hour, or \u00a339.28 for a two-hour session (and more for those based in London).\u201d</p> <p>The average cleaner in London, however, earns just \u00a38.89 an hour. Today, as part of International Women\u2019s Strike (coinciding with International Women\u2019s Day), cleaners, teachers and careworkers are marching, in London, Argentina and Madrid, to demand recognition of the social value of their work\u2019.</p> <p>For two months, I tried the fair pay option, contracting Jurate, a non-agency cleaner, and paying her, to her delight, \u00a340 for a two-hour session. In the end, I couldn\u2019t square this approach with my new knowledge about the relationship between paying a woman to clean my home and the structural devaluation of women\u2019s work. The clincher, in the end, was my three-year-old son, who quizzically followed Jurate around the house as she squeezed her mop and brandished her ever-present Viakal. I did not want him to see the labour of some women as less worthwhile than the labour and leisure of other women and men. Middle-class women\u2019s emancipation from housework has come at the cost of reinscribing poor women\u2019s ties to it.</p> <p>Did I find I could hire a cleaner with a clean conscience?

Today, as part of International Women\u2019s Strike (coinciding with International Women\u2019s Day), cleaners, teachers and careworkers are marching, in London, Argentina and Madrid, to demand recognition of the social value of their work\u2019. For two months, I tried the fair pay option, contracting Jurate, a non-agency cleaner, and paying her, to her delight, \u00a340 for a two-hour session. In the end, I couldn\u2019t square this approach with my new knowledge about the relationship between paying a woman to clean my home and the structural devaluation of women\u2019s work. The clincher, in the end, was my three-year-old son, who quizzically followed Jurate around the house as she squeezed her mop and brandished her ever-present Viakal. I did not want him to see the labour of some women as less worthwhile than the labour and leisure of other women and men. Middle-class women\u2019s emancipation from housework has come at the cost of reinscribing poor women\u2019s ties to it. Did I find I could hire a cleaner with a clean conscience? No, but I found I could ease my feminist conscience by scrubbing my own toilet. Sally Howard\u2019s book, The Home Stretch: Why It\u2019s Time To Come Clean About Who Does the Dishes, is out now (Atlantic Books, \u00a314.99)",

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for your company today. Big wins for Collingwood and Melbourne in the AFLW, and plenty of excitement building for what promises to be a record breaking night at the MCG. For more on that, and all your Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final needs, I\u2019ll handball you to Adam Collins, right over here: A-League: HT: CCM 0-2 Wellington - The Phoenix are heading into second place on the A-League ladder after exploiting Central Coast\u2019s defensive frailties in Gosford. In open play the game has been even, with the Mariners fashioning a few decent opportunities of their own, but when Wellington have gone forward they\u2019ve done so with purpose and no little class. No surprise at Casey Fields as the Demons continue their impressive season, thumping the last-placed Eagles in a handy percentage booster. Melbourne will likely end the round second in Conference B, but if Brisbane do them a favour away to Fremantle later on they could finish top. Karen Paxman was the leading ball-winner while eight Demons split the big sticks, including Sarah Perkins who kicked a goal on debut after the siren. A-League: 30 mins: CCM 0-2 Wellington (GOAL! Hooper) - Dreadful defending from the Mariners - caught square as the onrushing Hooper timed his run to perfection, latching onto a well-weighted Piscopo through-ball over the back-three - and the Nix are two goals to the good. AFLW: 3QT: Melbourne 8.3 (51) v 1.1 (7) West Coast - Put a fork in this one. A five-goal quarter to the Dees will see them home against the Eagles and give them a handy leg up in Conference B. A-League: 22 mins: CCM 0-1 Wellington - Shortly after the goal the Mariners have a decent penalty shout turned down, one of those destined to remain with the onfield referee one way or the other based on the VAR guidelines. As it is the Mariners continue their ugly run of form. A-League: 17 mins: CCM 0-1 Wellington (GOAL! Cacace) - Pretty much their first meaningful attack of the game ends in a goal for the Phoenix. It was a glorious move, beginning with Piscopo wriggling free on the right hand side before Davila weighted a perfect through-ball for the onrushing Cacace to guide a calm finish beyond Birighitti. A-League: 10 mins: CCM 0-0 Wellington: Not much to write home about in the early exchanges at Gosford, but if you\u2019ve just tuned in be warned that the team normally in all yellow are wearing all black, and the team normally decked out in black on away trips are in all yellow. Welcome to the A-League. AFLW: Q3: 10 mins remaining: Melbourne 5.1 (31) v 1.1 (7) West Coast - Playing with the wind it\u2019s been all Melbourne since half-time and they\u2019ve kicked two goals in quicktime to surge to a commanding lead. A-League: We have just kicked-off in Gosford where Wellington are hot favourites to continue their good run of form away to cellar dwellers Central Coast Mariners. AFLW: HT: Melbourne 3.0 (18) v 1.1 (7) West Coast - With the wind at their backs the Eagles stormed their way back into the contest until the Demons snapped the momentum late in the half when Sarah Lampard finished off a nice move down the right flank. A real arm-wrestle of a quarter at Casey Fields. Cricket: A rundown of the state of play on day three of the latest round of Sheffield Shield fixtures. Tasmania (270 &amp; 61-0) require 67 to beat NSW (195 &amp; 203) in Hobart. Nathan Ellis\u2019s nine-wickets for the match have put Tasmania in a commanding position on day three at Blundstone Arena. They are on course for a mighty upset victory inside three days. Victoria (292 &amp; 299-5) v South Australia (214) in Adelaide. The Vics are pushing towards a declaration and a day four dart for victory at Adelaide Oval. Travis Dean missed out on a second-innings ton, falling for 92. WA (277) v Queensland (425-6) in Perth. A brisk unbeaten 79 from Jack Wildermuth has opened the door for the Bulls in a match that looked to be destined for a draw. A reminder that NSW are flying high on top of the ladder with six wins, Queensland are in second with four, then it\u2019s a four-way scrap with the stragglers all sharing two apiece. AFLW: Q2: 13 mins remaining: Melbourne 2.0 (12) v 1.0 (6) West Coast - The Eagles have come out firing in the second quarter, with the wind at their backs, and they\u2019re rewarded with a bomb from Maddy Collier. AFLW: QT: Melbourne 2.0 (12) v 0.0 (0) West Coast - It\u2019s all going according to script at Casey Fields with Melbourne scoring two unanswered goals in the opening quarter. The second of which went to Dubliner Niamh McEvoy after good work from fellow import Sinead Goldrick. AFLW: Q1: 10 mins remaining: Melbourne 1.0 (6) v 0.0 (0) West Coast - It didn\u2019t take long for the in-form Eden Zanker to get the Demons on the scoreboard at a gusty Casey Fields. AFLW: Time for our second AFLW contest of the day with Melbourne welcoming West Coast to Casey Fields. The Eagles arrived rooted to the foot of Conference B. By contrast, the Demons sit third, with a win all-but guaranteeing them second place, with a healthy victory putting them in with a chance of top spot by the end of the round. Kirsten McLeod\u2019s goal midway through the final quarter threatened to set up a grandstand finish but it was in vain as the Bulldogs\u2019 season ended limply at a windswept Morwell. They now have just one win from five matches and are well off the pace of the top four in Conference B. That leading quartet includes the Magpies, who snapped a two-game losing streak, to join Melbourne on three wins, a game behind Carlton and Fremantle. Chloe Molloy starred with 3.2 in difficult goal-kicking conditions while Brianna Davey\u2019s 30 disposals was far and away the best on ground. AFLW: 3QT: Collingwood 6.3 (39) v 2.3 (15) Western Bulldogs - The Doggies are scrapping hard in Morwell and they enjoyed their best quarter of the match but remain a long way behind Collingwood heading into the final break. Brianna Davey and Jaimee Lambert are dominating the ball for the Magpies while Chloe Molloy still leads the way on the scoreboard with her 2.2. Cricket: AFLW: Q3: 6 mins remaining: Collingwood 6.3 (39) v 1.3 (9) Western Bulldogs - Kirsty Lamb has kicked the first goal of the day for the Doggies but it\u2019s barely made a dent in the deficit with the Pies on course for their first win in three games. AFLW: In conjunction with International Women\u2019s Day, this month is Endometriosis Awareness Month. The purpose is to spread awareness about an incredibly painful and debilitating disease that affects about 800,000 women in Australia (Endometriosis was the most Googled word in 2018, and yet it currently takes seven-10 years to get a diagnosis). Next Friday\u2019s contest between Geelong and North Melbourne is Shining a Light on Endo night at Kardinia Park. Cricket: A rundown of the state of play in the Sheffield Shield. Tasmania (270 &amp; 0-0) require 128 to beat NSW (195 &amp; 203) in Hobart. Nathan Ellis\u2019s nine-wickets for the match have put Tasmania in a commanding position on day three at Blundstone Arena. Victoria (292 &amp; 158-1) v South Australia (214) in Adelaide. Travis Dean is nearing a century as the Vics push towards a declaration and a day four dart for victory at Adelaide Oval. WA (277) v Queensland (317-5) in Perth. We\u2019re heading for a draw at the WACA Ground unless the visiting lower order can get a wriggle on and increase Queensland\u2019s lead with enough time to dismiss Western Australia for a second time. A reminder that NSW are flying high on top of the ladder with six wins, Queensland are in second with four, then it\u2019s a four-way scrap with the stragglers all sharing two apiece. AFL: Richmond\u2019s Sydney Stack just held onto an excellent mark in his preseason run-out against GWS. Recorded with typical understatement, of course. AFLW: HT: Collingwood 4.2 (26) v 0.2 (2) Western Bulldogs - That two-goal wind didn\u2019t blow hard enough for the Bulldogs in the second quarter as Collingwood reinforced their ascendancy in Morwell. The Doggies are facing a long 2021 preseason if they can\u2019t turn things around after half-time. AFLW: Q2: 6 mins remaining: Collingwood 3.2 (20) v 0.2 (2) Western Bulldogs - The game is more on the Bulldogs\u2019 terms this quarter but that has yet to translate on the scoreboard where the Pies remain in control. Molloy remains the contest\u2019s defining figure, tormenting the Doggies overhead and at ground level. Golf: Marc Leishman is in contention for the Arnold Palmer Invitational after conditions became near unplayable during the third round at Bay Hill. How tough were they? Brooks Koepka fired an 81. Tennis: No Nick Kyrgios, no Alex de Minaur, no problems for Australia\u2019s Davis Cup squad. AFLW: QT: Collingwood 3.0 (18) v 0.1 (1) Western Bulldogs - Six disposals, four marks, two goals - not a bad quarter\u2019s work for Chloe Molloy who has managed the blustery and rainy conditions in Morwell to lead Collingwood to a convincing early lead. A bit like a Test match that can\u2019t be judged properly until both sides have batted at least once on a questionable pitch, let\u2019s see what the Bulldogs can do with the wind at their backs after a Gatorade break. Cricket: The Australian men\u2019s team will be delighted their female counterparts are hogging the limelight because they have just completed a dismal ODI series away to South Africa that has ended in a 3-0 whitewash defeat. AFLW: Q1 11 mins remaining: Collingwood 1.0 (6) v 0.0 (0) Western Bulldogs - With the Magpies playing with what Leigh Montagna has suggested is a \u201ctwo-goal wind\u201d at their back, Chloe Molloy has booted - or perhaps that should be socked - the opening goal of the game. Molloy burst free of the last defender but turned into Cinderella and lost her slipper in the process, slamming home from point blank range with just a black stocking for protection. Cricket: We should all strive to think more like Geoff. AFLW: A vital AFLW clash between Collingwood and Western Bulldogs is about to get underway at a blustery Morwell in eastern Victoria. It\u2019s fourth v fifth in Conference B and the loser can probably write off their chances of any finals football for 2020. Megan Maurice has put into context what tonight\u2019s T20 World Cup final means for women\u2019s sport and Australian cricket in particular. But what we have witnessed with this Australia women\u2019s team over the past five years has been even bigger than that. The momentum around the team has grown and crowds and television audiences have expanded alongside it. It happened slowly enough that it almost wasn\u2019t noticeable. A reference to \u2018batters\u2019 instead of \u2018batsmen\u2019 here. An understanding that \u2018Healy\u2019 means Alyssa and not Ian there. And before we knew it, people were standing around office kitchens having long conversations about Ellyse Perry\u2019s hamstring and furious debates about whether she should be replaced by an all-rounder or a specialist bowler. Hello everybody and welcome to another Sunday Sportwatch. Today\u2019s action is spread a little thinner than usual with the agenda pointing directly towards the final of the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup from 6pm. We\u2019ll be launching a special liveblog for that from 5pm, but before then... AFLW can take centre stage with Collingwood hosting the Bulldogs at 1.10pm followed by West Coast\u2019s visit to Melbourne at 3.10pm. We\u2019ve also got one A-League fixture kicking-off at 4pm between Central Coast and Wellington. After that we\u2019ll flick over to the cricket, and hopefully witness the breaking of the record for the highest attendance ever at a women\u2019s sporting event - on International Women\u2019s Day, no less.

This generational difference explains a great deal about what\u2019s happened during the most tumultuous two weeks in recent American economic and political history. Since 24 February, with the lethal coronavirus spreading around the world, middle-aged and older Americans \u2013 not only most vulnerable to the disease but also accounting for most retirement savings \u2013 have been fleeing stocks for the relative safety of US government bonds. The stampede has gutted the stock market while reducing bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, to unprecedented lows. The interest rates on the 10-year Treasury note fell Friday to a record-breaking 0.71%. Despite the Fed\u2019s half-per cent cut in interest rates last Tuesday and the labor department\u2019s upbeat jobs report on Friday, the flight to safety continues. Bonds are deadly dull, but when the economy is wracked by uncertainty they\u2019re the safest havens available. The rush to safety didn\u2019t end there. In last week\u2019s Super Tuesday primaries in the 2020 election, older Democratic voters stampeded toward Joe Biden. As recently as 22 February \u2013 the Friday before the giant selloff on Wall Street \u2013 only 17.2% of Democratic voters supported Biden, according to the RealClearPolitics aggregate polls. Less than two weeks later, Biden\u2019s support had surged to 34.3%. Biden was helped by his strong showing in the South Carolina primary and by the last-minute endorsements of the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and the Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. And by fear-mongering over Bernie Sanders by Democratic insiders, big funders and pundits. But the rapidity of Biden\u2019s ascendance was fueled by a sudden flight to safety among older voters. Biden is the political equivalent of US government bonds. He may be boring but at least he\u2019s familiar and safe. Younger voters are still counting on Bernie Sanders. They\u2019re looking beyond the immediate coronavirus and financial crises to the larger existential crises of this century \u2013 climate change, health care, inequality and corruption. Their time horizons extend beyond those of their parents and grandparents because they\u2019ll be here longer. The generation gap revealed itself on Super Tuesday. Voters between 45 and 64 preferred Biden by 22 points over Sanders (42% to 20%). But Sanders triumphed with younger voters. In Texas, Biden won the support of just 17% of voters under the age of 45, while Sanders won only 19% of voters over 45. In Colorado, Biden won a mere 8% of the under-45s, while Sanders pulled down just 20% support among their elders. In California, Biden\u2019s support among sub-45 voters came to a bare 9%; Sanders won only 22% of those over 45. Meanwhile, as the coronavirus and its financial fallout continue to spread, Donald Trump appears even more dangerous than he did just weeks ago. The deceptive, narcissistic, vindictive president is helping transform a public health problem and financial slide into a double-barreled national emergency. On Friday, while wearing his own re-election campaign merchandise, Trump gave a disjointed news conference during which he called Jay Inslee, the Washington state governor who has criticized Trump\u2019s leadership on the coronavirus, a \u201csnake\u201d. He also claimed the coronavirus test was available to all who needed it, but anyone who has tried to be tested knows that\u2019s untrue. As of now, no more than several thousand people can be tested per day. Trump is facing crises that elude his capacities to con. He can\u2019t bully the coronavirus. He can\u2019t intimidate or threaten it into submission. He can\u2019t convince it to go away or make a deal with it. Nor can he order the stock and bond markets to do better. The coronavirus is in plain sight. Hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed. As of Saturday afternoon, authorities had reported 400 confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, and 19 people have died. The germ phobic president may even be worried for his own safety. He called off a scheduled visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday because of a suspected case of coronavirus at the CDC. itself, and then put it back on his schedule when the person tested negative. But at some point not even Mar-a-Lago will be completely safe. Most of Trump\u2019s supporters are middle-aged and older, with little or no savings to tide them over a recession. If the double-barreled crisis deepens, they too are likely to flee to safety next November. Politics and economics are complex, but in times of crisis they follow simple rules. Older people want safety. Younger people want change. Everyone wants leaders they can trust.",

But it is much more than that. The linking of trade agreements to human rights has become normal practice in recent years. As Barnier suggested, the ECHR provides essential legal underpinning in a range of areas. He highlighted cooperation in criminal justice and law enforcement, which, he said, \u201crequires commitment on both sides with respect to fundamental rights of persons\u201d.</p> <p>A UK refusal to guarantee future adherence to the treaty could have a potentially serious negative impact on the Good Friday agreement, to which it is integral. Security cooperation might also be affected, likewise arrangements regarding privacy and the safeguarding of personal data.

Or perhaps this question should be directed at Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, who is on record as wanting rid of the ECHR altogether. Rightwing Tories have long disparaged the treaty and the 1998 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk-human-rights-act-is-at-risk-of-repeal-heres-why-it-should-be-protected-111368\" title=\"\">Human Rights Act</a> that translated it into British law, seeing them as tools employed by scheming Brussels bureaucrats to extend control over British life.</p> <p>This has always been an absurd argument. The <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/what-is-the-european-convention-on-human-rights\" title=\"\">ECHR</a>, and its associated court in Strasbourg, came into being long before the modern-day EU, and is entirely separate from it. It is the creation of the 47-country <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/who-we-are\" title=\"\">Council of Europe</a> that Winston Churchill, Johnson\u2019s hero, helped found. In 1948, Churchill called for a \u201ccharter of human rights guarded by freedom and sustained by law\u201d.</p> <p>The ECHR is, in fact, an achievement of which Britain should be particularly proud. Reacting to the horrors of the Second World War, the treaty aimed to ensure that governments would never again be allowed to abuse ordinary people with impunity. Its development helped inform the UN\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/28/un-adopts-universal-declaration-human-rights-paris-1948\" title=\"\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. British experts helped draft it. The UK was first to ratify it. And it has been hugely influential in setting or raising standards in Europe and around the world.</p> <p>Despite his insistence that Britain will remain a signatory, Johnson\u2019s refusal to fully commit to abiding by the ECHR in EU negotiations strongly suggests that he may seek, in future, to <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/the-next-target-in-the-project-to-take-back-control-strasbourg-and-the-human-rights-act-brexit-law-constitution\" title=\"\">abrogate it</a> (and the HRA) entirely \u2013 as ideologues such as Cummings demand. This would do huge damage to Britain\u2019s standing in the world and its hard-won reputation as a leading advocate for global human rights.</p> <p>More than that, it represents a fundamental threat to the rights of British people, who, unlike in many democracies, are not protected by written constitutional guarantees or a modern bill of rights. If the UK abandoned the ECHR, it would join Belarus, an authoritarian dictatorship that is the only country in Europe not a party to it. Even Vladimir Putin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/CP_Russia_ENG.pdf\" title=\"\">Russia</a> has been a member since 1998.</p> <p>With international laws and institutions such as the international criminal court being vandalised and undermined by autocrats and demagogues such as Donald Trump, this is not the time to start messing with British citizens\u2019 basic legal protections. Johnson and Cummings must be told: keep your hands off our rights.</p>",

As Barnier suggested, the ECHR provides essential legal underpinning in a range of areas. He highlighted cooperation in criminal justice and law enforcement, which, he said, \u201crequires commitment on both sides with respect to fundamental rights of persons\u201d. A UK refusal to guarantee future adherence to the treaty could have a potentially serious negative impact on the Good Friday agreement, to which it is integral. Security cooperation might also be affected, likewise arrangements regarding privacy and the safeguarding of personal data. Barnier warned, rightly, that the British position, if maintained, will severely handicap and limit the scope of the future EU-UK relationship. What is Boris Johnson playing at? Or perhaps this question should be directed at Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, who is on record as wanting rid of the ECHR altogether. Rightwing Tories have long disparaged the treaty and the 1998 Human Rights Act that translated it into British law, seeing them as tools employed by scheming Brussels bureaucrats to extend control over British life. This has always been an absurd argument. The ECHR, and its associated court in Strasbourg, came into being long before the modern-day EU, and is entirely separate from it. It is the creation of the 47-country Council of Europe that Winston Churchill, Johnson\u2019s hero, helped found. In 1948, Churchill called for a \u201ccharter of human rights guarded by freedom and sustained by law\u201d. The ECHR is, in fact, an achievement of which Britain should be particularly proud. Reacting to the horrors of the Second World War, the treaty aimed to ensure that governments would never again be allowed to abuse ordinary people with impunity. Its development helped inform the UN\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. British experts helped draft it. The UK was first to ratify it. And it has been hugely influential in setting or raising standards in Europe and around the world. Despite his insistence that Britain will remain a signatory, Johnson\u2019s refusal to fully commit to abiding by the ECHR in EU negotiations strongly suggests that he may seek, in future, to abrogate it (and the HRA) entirely \u2013 as ideologues such as Cummings demand. This would do huge damage to Britain\u2019s standing in the world and its hard-won reputation as a leading advocate for global human rights. More than that, it represents a fundamental threat to the rights of British people, who, unlike in many democracies, are not protected by written constitutional guarantees or a modern bill of rights. If the UK abandoned the ECHR, it would join Belarus, an authoritarian dictatorship that is the only country in Europe not a party to it. Even Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia has been a member since 1998. With international laws and institutions such as the international criminal court being vandalised and undermined by autocrats and demagogues such as Donald Trump, this is not the time to start messing with British citizens\u2019 basic legal protections. Johnson and Cummings must be told: keep your hands off our rights.",

I recognised the vitriol and misogyny spewed at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/06/hillary-clinton-revealing-docuseries-hulu\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a> as well as the more subtle institutional sexism directed at her. I heard the rationalisations insisting that it wasn\u2019t the idea of A Woman President, it was the idea of <em>this</em> woman with a lengthy record of national service, who was running against a reality-television star with little relevant experience and a lengthy history of bankruptcies, controversy and scandal.</p> <p>Yet, despite her qualifications, Clinton was a polarising figure. What would happen if we took those voters at their word and found another woman, one who was less controversial than Clinton and who had even more experience? Surely, that would work. Wouldn\u2019t it?</p> <p>Warren seemed to be the ideal candidate: she was not only smart, articulate and unafraid, she was highly qualified. In short, she was the candidate most likely to affect the change needed to reverse the incredible harm the past four years have witnessed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If 2016 taught us anything, isn\u2019t it that even if we think we know who is most likely to be elected, we have no idea?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet, last week, Democrats in my home state of South Carolina, and those in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, California, Massachusetts and many, many other states answered the question of whether <em>this</em> woman would be worthy of their support with a resounding <em>no</em>.</p> <p>Instead of voting for a woman who was both accomplished and compassionate, a candidate who combined the progressive ideals of one of her rivals with an ability to foster connection and collaboration, they starkly split their ballots between two familiar faces \u2013 both themselves polarising and controversial, both white men. There are a lot of voters who will continue to insist that gender had nothing to do with their choice. But the rhetoric of the past few weeks tells a different story. Again and again, people have said that Warren was their preferred candidate but that they didn\u2019t vote for her because they didn\u2019t think she\u2019d win either the nomination or in the general election.</p> <p>Everyone agrees that defeating Donald Trump is the most important thing, that we all need to get together on the same side, whichever side that turns out to be, #BlueNoMatterWho, etc. However, instead of casting a ballot for the candidate they prefer, instead of voting for the candidate they want to see carry the nomination, they choose the candidate who they think is most electable. But if 2016 has taught us anything, hasn\u2019t it taught us that even if we think we know who is most likely to be elected, we really have no idea?</p> <p>I am proud to have voted for Elizabeth Warren, and I\u2019m disappointed, yet again, to see a smart, well-qualified woman cast aside to make way for yet more white men. My heart hurts to see that our country fails to recognise that there\u2019s a better alternative to the dogmatism and indignation of one candidate or the comfortable status quo of the other. I\u2019m profoundly saddened that we have rejected a candidate who is willing to admit mistakes and be accountable for them in favour of more finger-pointing and redirection.</p> <p>Despite my sadness, I\u2019m also left with a powerful sense of gratitude. Thank you, Senator Warren, for being such a positive example of grit, integrity and grace. Thank you for standing up for your principles and not backing down from a fight. Thank you for standing for the dignity of all Americans, for working towards inclusivity and opportunity. Thank you, most of all, for your persistence.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Erin Templeton is Dean of Humanities, Sciences, &amp; Business at Converse College, South Carolina</em></p>",

Wouldn\u2019t it? Warren seemed to be the ideal candidate: she was not only smart, articulate and unafraid, she was highly qualified. In short, she was the candidate most likely to affect the change needed to reverse the incredible harm the past four years have witnessed. Yet, last week, Democrats in my home state of South Carolina, and those in Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, California, Massachusetts and many, many other states answered the question of whether this woman would be worthy of their support with a resounding no. Instead of voting for a woman who was both accomplished and compassionate, a candidate who combined the progressive ideals of one of her rivals with an ability to foster connection and collaboration, they starkly split their ballots between two familiar faces \u2013 both themselves polarising and controversial, both white men. There are a lot of voters who will continue to insist that gender had nothing to do with their choice. But the rhetoric of the past few weeks tells a different story. Again and again, people have said that Warren was their preferred candidate but that they didn\u2019t vote for her because they didn\u2019t think she\u2019d win either the nomination or in the general election. Everyone agrees that defeating Donald Trump is the most important thing, that we all need to get together on the same side, whichever side that turns out to be, #BlueNoMatterWho, etc. However, instead of casting a ballot for the candidate they prefer, instead of voting for the candidate they want to see carry the nomination, they choose the candidate who they think is most electable. But if 2016 has taught us anything, hasn\u2019t it taught us that even if we think we know who is most likely to be elected, we really have no idea? I am proud to have voted for Elizabeth Warren, and I\u2019m disappointed, yet again, to see a smart, well-qualified woman cast aside to make way for yet more white men. My heart hurts to see that our country fails to recognise that there\u2019s a better alternative to the dogmatism and indignation of one candidate or the comfortable status quo of the other. I\u2019m profoundly saddened that we have rejected a candidate who is willing to admit mistakes and be accountable for them in favour of more finger-pointing and redirection. Despite my sadness, I\u2019m also left with a powerful sense of gratitude. Thank you, Senator Warren, for being such a positive example of grit, integrity and grace. Thank you for standing up for your principles and not backing down from a fight. Thank you for standing for the dignity of all Americans, for working towards inclusivity and opportunity. Thank you, most of all, for your persistence. \u2022 Erin Templeton is Dean of Humanities, Sciences, &amp; Business at Converse College, South Carolina",

Not even sure about the \u201cyoung adult\u201d; this triumphant new six-part BBC adaptation seemed pretty damned grownup to me.</p> <p>Granted, the intended dystopia is not meant to spring from the simple inversion of skin colour, with black \u201cApricans\u201d having invaded Albion many years since, owning all the wealth, technology, luxuries, pampering and good schools. Whites, or Noughts, work (or riot) as undereducated menials. It\u2019s meant to spring from the fact that, though slavery is <em>technically</em> abolished in Britain \u2013 Albion \u2013 (though some Crosses want to reintroduce it), segregation still legally exists, a la Jim Crow laws, and certainly exists in terms of opportunity, hope, cash. The all-black government, and its violent police, makes only mouth music as to the Noughts\u2019 rights.</p> <p>It is astonishing how easily we accept the inversion. The Crosses throw glorious parties, resplendent in updated Aprican robes; the Noughts are humble waiters who dare not catch the eyes of their richers and betters. We hear, utterly anew, phrases hardly unknown today, just radically racially inverted. The haughty sneer of a Cross sergeant major, forced to admit a tiny few Noughts into \u201chis\u201d military academy: \u201cThat\u2019s quotas for you.\u201d The nicer, liberal Cross teacher at the school of our heroine Sephy (Persephone): \u201cI know a few Noughts, feel for them. They\u2019re always so cheerful! But you do get some uppity ones. That\u2019s <em>not</em> prejudice, that\u2019s fact.\u201d</p> <p>So rich, privileged Sephy (a powerful Masali Baduza), whose dad is a hardline home secretary, wanders into a culture war by falling, cf <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>West Side Story</em> etc, for a poor whitey in the form of Callum (Jack Rowan) . There\u2019s a nice touch when Sephy\u2019s smug boyfriend addresses him ignorantly as \u201cKaleem? Kaylim?\u201d. Callum lives with dad Ian Hart and charlady mum Helen Baxendale \u2013 we\u2019re a long way from <em>Friends</em> here. The Noughts are rioting, the all-powerful black press is making up many lies about a death, and the stage is set for an all-consuming drama, written partly as a result of our former children\u2019s laureate\u2019s reaction to the Stephen Lawrence case. So far, it\u2019s sharply adapted and just subtle enough, and the guiltily shocked reaction of Sephy when she accidentally calls someone a \u201cblanker\u201d \u2013 the one word guaranteed to get Noughts\u2019 hackles up \u2013 still resonates.</p> <p>I started to wonder if an actor has ever been asked to punch so below his weight as the lovely Jason Watkins, in <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/mcdonald-dodds/2a7401\" title=\"\">McDonald &amp; Dodds</a></strong>, and then remembered McKellen and Jacobi phoning it in in the execrable <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/vicious-mckellen-jacobi-de-la-tour\" title=\"\">Vicious</a></em>. Watkins could never phone it in, but his Dodds wears a beige anorak and tank top and has specs he <em>always</em> forgets are on his head \u2013 geddit? \u2013 as a character \u201ctrait\u201d rather than being granted anything as challenging for the writers as a \u201cpersonality\u201d. His police colleagues look down on him as a sad little man and yet, what would you know, flung into the field just pre-retirement he proves a geeky wizard at cracking cases! He is paired \u2013 of course \u2013 with Tala Gouveia\u2019s McDonald, a ballsy, feisty, overconfident \u2013 of course \u2013 ex-Met cop, flung into the sticks of Bath and hence, apparently, back about 180 years in time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d57cbcb5643f2cf30436017d7f2820f593ad54b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d57cbcb5643f2cf30436017d7f2820f593ad54b3/0_7_4511_2706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Watkins and Tala Gouveia in McDonald &amp; Dodds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Watkins and Tala Gouveia in McDonald &amp; Dodds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bath certainly looks lovely. The residents are portrayed as borderline racists and backwoods dunderheads who speak funny. A chin-stroker for the tourist board, then. It all feels as if it\u2019s actually been written by algorithm: sun-dappled (check), copper/cultural mismatch (check), unheralded genius (check): a feeling compounded by the fact that the two episodes both make a bizarre point of stressing the game of boules, as if a computer was fed duff gen about Bath being the forgotten European epicentre of p\u00e9tanque. Will it get recommissioned? For all that it\u2019s a load of boules, I suspect it really might: certainly the leads, and good guest stars, act their sockses off despite the script.</p> <p>Less disappointing, but still\u2026 hmm\u2026 was the next series of ITV\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/liar/2a4547\" title=\"\">Liar</a></strong>, which had us all agog a couple of years ago. Brothers Harry and Jack Williams had set up a sharp-enough premise about date rape and credibility right at the start of the #MeToo era, and though overburdening with red herrings mid-series led to heavy wobbles of tone, it satisfied. The kicker was that chappie had not only done it, but was left with a slit throat in revenge by\u2026 someone\u2026 in the hauntingly weird Tollesbury marshes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXdkLJRf3z0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HXdkLJRf3z0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXdkLJRf3z0\">Watch a trailer for season 2 of Liar.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/24/ioan-gruffudd-on-sexism-weinstein-and-his-distressing-new-role-i-found-myself-crying\" title=\"\">Ioan Gruffudd</a> now deaded, he can only make his nastily charming, controlling appearances in flashback, of which there are, oh, way too many.

Still, intrigued enough to watch at least the next two.

Granted, the intended dystopia is not meant to spring from the simple inversion of skin colour, with black \u201cApricans\u201d having invaded Albion many years since, owning all the wealth, technology, luxuries, pampering and good schools. Whites, or Noughts, work (or riot) as undereducated menials. It\u2019s meant to spring from the fact that, though slavery is technically abolished in Britain \u2013 Albion \u2013 (though some Crosses want to reintroduce it), segregation still legally exists, a la Jim Crow laws, and certainly exists in terms of opportunity, hope, cash. The all-black government, and its violent police, makes only mouth music as to the Noughts\u2019 rights. It is astonishing how easily we accept the inversion. The Crosses throw glorious parties, resplendent in updated Aprican robes; the Noughts are humble waiters who dare not catch the eyes of their richers and betters. We hear, utterly anew, phrases hardly unknown today, just radically racially inverted. The haughty sneer of a Cross sergeant major, forced to admit a tiny few Noughts into \u201chis\u201d military academy: \u201cThat\u2019s quotas for you.\u201d The nicer, liberal Cross teacher at the school of our heroine Sephy (Persephone): \u201cI know a few Noughts, feel for them. They\u2019re always so cheerful! But you do get some uppity ones. That\u2019s not prejudice, that\u2019s fact.\u201d So rich, privileged Sephy (a powerful Masali Baduza), whose dad is a hardline home secretary, wanders into a culture war by falling, cf Romeo and Juliet, West Side Story etc, for a poor whitey in the form of Callum (Jack Rowan) . There\u2019s a nice touch when Sephy\u2019s smug boyfriend addresses him ignorantly as \u201cKaleem? Kaylim?\u201d. Callum lives with dad Ian Hart and charlady mum Helen Baxendale \u2013 we\u2019re a long way from Friends here. The Noughts are rioting, the all-powerful black press is making up many lies about a death, and the stage is set for an all-consuming drama, written partly as a result of our former children\u2019s laureate\u2019s reaction to the Stephen Lawrence case. So far, it\u2019s sharply adapted and just subtle enough, and the guiltily shocked reaction of Sephy when she accidentally calls someone a \u201cblanker\u201d \u2013 the one word guaranteed to get Noughts\u2019 hackles up \u2013 still resonates. I started to wonder if an actor has ever been asked to punch so below his weight as the lovely Jason Watkins, in McDonald &amp; Dodds, and then remembered McKellen and Jacobi phoning it in in the execrable Vicious. Watkins could never phone it in, but his Dodds wears a beige anorak and tank top and has specs he always forgets are on his head \u2013 geddit? \u2013 as a character \u201ctrait\u201d rather than being granted anything as challenging for the writers as a \u201cpersonality\u201d. His police colleagues look down on him as a sad little man and yet, what would you know, flung into the field just pre-retirement he proves a geeky wizard at cracking cases! He is paired \u2013 of course \u2013 with Tala Gouveia\u2019s McDonald, a ballsy, feisty, overconfident \u2013 of course \u2013 ex-Met cop, flung into the sticks of Bath and hence, apparently, back about 180 years in time. Bath certainly looks lovely. The residents are portrayed as borderline racists and backwoods dunderheads who speak funny. A chin-stroker for the tourist board, then. It all feels as if it\u2019s actually been written by algorithm: sun-dappled (check), copper/cultural mismatch (check), unheralded genius (check): a feeling compounded by the fact that the two episodes both make a bizarre point of stressing the game of boules, as if a computer was fed duff gen about Bath being the forgotten European epicentre of p\u00e9tanque. Will it get recommissioned? For all that it\u2019s a load of boules, I suspect it really might: certainly the leads, and good guest stars, act their sockses off despite the script. Less disappointing, but still\u2026 hmm\u2026 was the next series of ITV\u2019s Liar, which had us all agog a couple of years ago. Brothers Harry and Jack Williams had set up a sharp-enough premise about date rape and credibility right at the start of the #MeToo era, and though overburdening with red herrings mid-series led to heavy wobbles of tone, it satisfied. The kicker was that chappie had not only done it, but was left with a slit throat in revenge by\u2026 someone\u2026 in the hauntingly weird Tollesbury marshes. With Ioan Gruffudd now deaded, he can only make his nastily charming, controlling appearances in flashback, of which there are, oh, way too many. Whereas the first series was genuinely captivating in its premise of one person\u2019s word against another, this seems set to rely on whether the police can catch someone out on a lie. About a dead rapist. Than which more rats\u2019 asses have been given. Joanne Froggatt is back, having now to defend herself against a particularly ballsy, feisty etc Met officer (Katherine Kelly), who has a frankly alarming approach to the sensitivities normally demanded when dealing with a proven rape victim. Still, intrigued enough to watch at least the next two. And I\u2019ll forgive Harry and Jack much, just for The Missing. The Trip to Greece is Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan\u2019s last outing as micro-upped versions of themselves, commissioned to jaunt with wit and impunity, and eat daringly expensive, mouthwatering food, around the loveliest locations in Europe, by something called the Observer. (I bloody wish. Even Jay Rayner has to keep the bus receipts to break even, and regurgitate neglected starters to the newsdesk like a cormorant.) And it\u2019s all very spoilt and very lovely, with just-so direction by Michael Winterbottom and music by Michael Nyman, but it\u2019s probably about time for a lie-down for this unlikeliest of hits. The impressions-off still impress \u2013 the pair, sitting outside the Hotel Lesbian, imaging Moore-as-Bond faced in the 70s with a lesbian \u2013 evinced guilty chortles, but even Coogan ponders whether they should still be trying Ronnie Corbett. The tiny premise is recreating Homer\u2019s Odyssey, so we get way too much bloody Byron, but also some teeny and huggable knowledge and insights amid swank hotels and to-die-for balcony lunches. But the delight, more delighting as we know it\u2019s soon to fade to black, is in the sweet, competitive bickering, almost to fadeout, between genuine friends. Byron\u2019s proudest achievement was swimming the Hellespont. So what\u2019s theirs? \u201cThe seven Baftas, I suppose.\u201d \u201cMy children, I think.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have any Baftas, do you, Rob?\u201d",

The first series, in 2018, had Scarlett Curtis as presenter; Sarpong is more measured and professional, less saccharine. The format remains the same, with Sarpong explaining the concept of each episode and (sometimes) reading out a letter she herself has written, but for series two there\u2019s a sense of highlighting women who have been publicly disparaged in some way.</p> <p>So we hear from Miranda Kane, ex-sex worker-turned-activist-and-comedian; from #MeToo activist and Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan; from model and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/may/14/munroe-bergdorf-transition-feminine-transgender-model\" title=\"\">Munroe Bergdorf</a>.

Though, as we all know, any woman who puts her head above the parapet will always be sneered at, or worse, by some harrumphing keyboard warrior.</p> <p>This is an admirably broad collection of lived female experience, and every story needs to be heard. Plus, <em>To the Woman</em> is easy to listen to, sometimes gripping, often emotional. But its strengths are also its weaknesses: when someone reads a letter, as opposed to just chatting, they are naturally more careful, more formal in their delivery. This ensures that no word is wasted, but it also means there\u2019s a stiffness that only a few readers can overcome. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jun/15/upskirting-to-become-a-criminal-offence-punishable-by-two-years-in-jail\" title=\"\">Gina Martin</a>, who worked to ban upskirting, is one, sounding upbeat and close to laughter, almost as though she\u2019s speaking off the top of her head. Also \u2013 and I\u2019m aware this sounds grumpy \u2013 every letter is a celebration, a thank you from one fabulous woman to another. A brilliant and worthy USP, but how amazing it would be to hear a celebration of women that acknowledges our awfulness, as well as our brilliance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b8feb2f1d57b5ca6e6a21ff39306e78ffb784d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b8feb2f1d57b5ca6e6a21ff39306e78ffb784d9/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"judy collins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Collins, inspiring subject of The Last Bohemians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Kelly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which brings me to <strong><a href=\"https://www.thelastbohemians.co.uk/judy\" title=\"\">The Last Bohemians</a></strong>, a far spikier and more nuanced celebration. This show talks to older women, cultural outsiders \u2013 the more eccentric and offbeat the better. In the opening episode of series two, presenter Kate Hutchinson meets the American singer-songwriter Judy Collins, whose 60-year career started in the 1960s Greenwich Village folk scene. We hear Collins describing how she told her husband she was having an affair while on magic mushrooms. \u201cIt was a very bad thing to do,\u201d she says, laughing, before going on to cover addiction, activism, suicide; proper heavy stuff.</p> <p>Collins takes herself seriously, which is correct. \u201cI think that one thing that helped me is focus,\u201d she says. \u201cMy object was to be learning: learning songs, the piano, learning to show up, learning to perform. From the time I was four or five years old. The secret is to find something that drives you.\u201d Collins still gigs, at 80. What a wonderful life. This is a very cheering production: future episodes will feature singer PP Arnold, designer Zandra Rhodes, film-maker Vivienne Dick and others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8277be74ae19c0c8216ff916fe998a986e4db80b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8277be74ae19c0c8216ff916fe998a986e4db80b/0_307_2500_3125/800.jpg\" alt=\"Daughters of Reykjav\u00edk\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daughters of Reykjav\u00edk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was also cheered by a new podcast from the <strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/daughters-of-reykjavik-the-podcast/episodes/lofatek\" title=\"\">Daughters of Reykjavik</a></strong>, a nine-strong rap collective from Iceland. This is simply a series of conversations between young women, the Daughters and invited guests, and I found it both enlightening and heartening. The topics are inspired by songs on the group\u2019s forthcoming album, <em>Soft Spot</em>, and they\u2019ve only released two episodes so far \u2013 on female sexuality and need for approval \u2013 but there is a wonderful honesty and sweetness about their chat. Did they grow up thinking themselves sexually attractive? What do they think is sexy about themselves? What does applause mean to them? Or Instagram followers? How do they find working in the music industry? All the speakers are so open and aware, curious, uncertain, funny.

But I am so pleased that Dotty won the music breakfast show award. Her upbeat presentation is pitched perfectly for her audience, her interview skills are exceptional, and her knowledge of music is unparalleled. Plus her show lasts four hours! It\u2019s just a great way to start the day.</p> <p><strong>Best community programming: <a href=\"https://prison.radio\" title=\"\">Prison Radio Association</a><br></strong>The PRA makes the programmes for National Prison Radio and puts experienced audio-makers to work with prisoners, training them in audio production and presentation. The resulting shows (which can\u2019t be heard outside the prison system) help build a real community in UK prisons: giving information, answering questions, playing tracks, reading out letters. There\u2019s a breakfast show (called, inevitably, <em>Porridge</em>), a request show, and a show that interviews ex-prisoners to see how they managed once they left. A wonderful, wonderful thing.</p> <p><strong>Moment of the year: <a href=\"https://talkradio.co.uk/radio/schedule\" title=\"\">Iain Lee</a><br></strong>Lee\u2019s late-night phone-in show on talkRADIO, <em>The Late Night Alternative</em>, has long been controversial. Lee eschews the obvious divisive topics for debate and, instead, asks his listeners to talk about other stuff, leading to amazingly offbeat moments of humour and sadness. This award, voted for by the public, was given for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/20/talkradio-host-iain-lee-suicidal-caller-phone\" title=\"\">30 minutes that Lee talked, live, to Chris, a man who had taken an overdose</a>.

      "bodyText": "To the Woman | audible.co.uk The Last Bohemians | thelastbohemians.co.uk Daughters of Reykjavik | acast.com Today is International Women\u2019s Day, as you may be pleased (or not) to know: a nice \u201chello, why not try this?\u201d hook for various women-friendly shows and podcasts. On Audible, June Sarpong has taken over presenting duties for the To the Woman podcast, in which various women read letters they\u2019ve written to other women. The first series, in 2018, had Scarlett Curtis as presenter; Sarpong is more measured and professional, less saccharine. The format remains the same, with Sarpong explaining the concept of each episode and (sometimes) reading out a letter she herself has written, but for series two there\u2019s a sense of highlighting women who have been publicly disparaged in some way. So we hear from Miranda Kane, ex-sex worker-turned-activist-and-comedian; from #MeToo activist and Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan; from model and activist Munroe Bergdorf. Others include poet Sabrina Mahfouz, critic Bonnie Greer and Laura Bates, founder of the campaigning website Everyday Sexism, who you might think don\u2019t fit that remit. Though, as we all know, any woman who puts her head above the parapet will always be sneered at, or worse, by some harrumphing keyboard warrior. This is an admirably broad collection of lived female experience, and every story needs to be heard. Plus, To the Woman is easy to listen to, sometimes gripping, often emotional. But its strengths are also its weaknesses: when someone reads a letter, as opposed to just chatting, they are naturally more careful, more formal in their delivery. This ensures that no word is wasted, but it also means there\u2019s a stiffness that only a few readers can overcome. Gina Martin, who worked to ban upskirting, is one, sounding upbeat and close to laughter, almost as though she\u2019s speaking off the top of her head. Also \u2013 and I\u2019m aware this sounds grumpy \u2013 every letter is a celebration, a thank you from one fabulous woman to another. A brilliant and worthy USP, but how amazing it would be to hear a celebration of women that acknowledges our awfulness, as well as our brilliance. Which brings me to The Last Bohemians, a far spikier and more nuanced celebration. This show talks to older women, cultural outsiders \u2013 the more eccentric and offbeat the better. In the opening episode of series two, presenter Kate Hutchinson meets the American singer-songwriter Judy Collins, whose 60-year career started in the 1960s Greenwich Village folk scene. We hear Collins describing how she told her husband she was having an affair while on magic mushrooms. \u201cIt was a very bad thing to do,\u201d she says, laughing, before going on to cover addiction, activism, suicide; proper heavy stuff. Collins takes herself seriously, which is correct. \u201cI think that one thing that helped me is focus,\u201d she says. \u201cMy object was to be learning: learning songs, the piano, learning to show up, learning to perform. From the time I was four or five years old. The secret is to find something that drives you.\u201d Collins still gigs, at 80. What a wonderful life. This is a very cheering production: future episodes will feature singer PP Arnold, designer Zandra Rhodes, film-maker Vivienne Dick and others. I was also cheered by a new podcast from the Daughters of Reykjavik, a nine-strong rap collective from Iceland. This is simply a series of conversations between young women, the Daughters and invited guests, and I found it both enlightening and heartening. The topics are inspired by songs on the group\u2019s forthcoming album, Soft Spot, and they\u2019ve only released two episodes so far \u2013 on female sexuality and need for approval \u2013 but there is a wonderful honesty and sweetness about their chat. Did they grow up thinking themselves sexually attractive? What do they think is sexy about themselves? What does applause mean to them? Or Instagram followers? How do they find working in the music industry? All the speakers are so open and aware, curious, uncertain, funny. I love this podcast. Three worthy winners at last week\u2019s Arias Best music breakfast show: The 1Xtra Breakfast Show With Dotty There were many deserving music-based winners at the 2020 Audio and Radio Industry awards last week: 1Xtra\u2019s MistaJam (AKA the nicest man in radio) for best music presenter; Radio 3\u2019s This Classical Life for best specialist music show, presented by the amazing Jess Gillam. But I am so pleased that Dotty won the music breakfast show award. Her upbeat presentation is pitched perfectly for her audience, her interview skills are exceptional, and her knowledge of music is unparalleled. Plus her show lasts four hours! It\u2019s just a great way to start the day. Best community programming: Prison Radio Association The PRA makes the programmes for National Prison Radio and puts experienced audio-makers to work with prisoners, training them in audio production and presentation. The resulting shows (which can\u2019t be heard outside the prison system) help build a real community in UK prisons: giving information, answering questions, playing tracks, reading out letters. There\u2019s a breakfast show (called, inevitably, Porridge), a request show, and a show that interviews ex-prisoners to see how they managed once they left. A wonderful, wonderful thing. Moment of the year: Iain Lee Lee\u2019s late-night phone-in show on talkRADIO, The Late Night Alternative, has long been controversial. Lee eschews the obvious divisive topics for debate and, instead, asks his listeners to talk about other stuff, leading to amazingly offbeat moments of humour and sadness. This award, voted for by the public, was given for the 30 minutes that Lee talked, live, to Chris, a man who had taken an overdose. His co-presenter and producer, Katherine Boyle, contacted the police, and listeners helped to find Chris, who was on the street, and get him to hospital.",

It informed anyone with concerns to contact the ACU or the department of health of the state of Maryland and urged people to remain calm. The statement said: \u201cThis attendee had no contact with the president or vice-president and never attended the events in the main hall.\u201d It noted that the Trump administration had been informed of the situation. \u201cWe will continue regular communication with all appropriate government officials,\u201d the statement continued. The ACU chairman, Matt Schlapp, had previously tweeted a proud message about introducing the president at the CPAC event last weekend. He then retweeted several posts from a journalist at the conservative-leaning RealClearPolitics media outlet. The governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, said the state had acted as soon as it became aware of the positive test. \u201cImmediately after learning of this individual\u2019s interactions in our state, we began coordinating with the White House, the CDC and federal officials, the New Jersey Department of Health, Prince George\u2019s County officials, and conference organizers,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cDue to the scale of this conference, we are urging attendees who are experiencing flu-like symptoms to immediately reach out to their health care provider. We are providing this update not to unnecessarily raise alarm, but in the interest of full transparency and out of an abundance of caution.\u201d Also on Saturday, a marine at Virginia\u2019s Fort Belvoir became the first military case of coronavirus reported inside the US. The marine was being treated at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, located south of Washington, and had recently returned from an overseas assignment, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said on Twitter.",

Xu Zhiyong, a former law lecturer and founder of the social campaign New Citizens Movement, was taken away by police on 15 February during a fresh crackdown on freedom of speech precipitated by the coronavirus crisis. Xu\u2019s family found out from Beijing police on Saturday that he has been held in secret detention on the charge of \u201cinciting subversion of state power\u201d and has been denied access to a lawyer, according to friends Teng Biao, a legal academic, and fellow activist Hua Ze.

Sport Australia had been ordered to respond to 40 questions its officials had taken on notice following a 28 February committee hearing examining the $100m sports grants program by 6 March. Guardian Australia can reveal that after being denied an extension to answer the questions, Sport Australia refused to comply with the order and the questions, which included further information on what it knew about the colour-coded spreadsheets and when changes were made, remain unanswered. The refusal came just one day after Sport Australia was forced to admit it had given the Senate committee the wrong information about when it received ministerial briefs from Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office on the day the election was called. The former health department boss Glenys Beauchamp did comply with the Senate order to answer questions, but denied having any memory of a late-night meeting between herself, the Australian Sports Commission chair, John Wylie, and the former Sport Australia head Kate Palmer. Palmer told the Senate committee on 28 February she had been \u201csurprised\u201d to see one of the colour-coded targeted and marginal seat spreadsheets McKenzie\u2019s office was using to award the grants, after it was handed to her by a staffer as she walked into an April estimates hearing, just days before Scott Morrison called the election. \u201cA teleconference was held that evening between the chair of the board, the department secretary and myself,\u201d Palmer told the inquiry. Palmer told the committee she had taken no notes, but remembered it had been called to ensure Sport Australia was meeting its obligations. When Beauchamp faced the committee on what was her last day in the public service, she said she could not recall the meeting and any notes she may have taken were among those she destroyed in January, following her resignation from the public service. In response to a question for further information, the department reported: \u201cMs Beauchamp spoke to Mr Wylie and neither has any specific recollection of the meeting as reported by Ms Palmer.\u201d The department also reported it had \u201cno record of any meeting in the form reported by Ms Palmer\u201d.

The Australian National Audit Office had testified the prime minister\u2019s office had requested a last-minute change before the documents were sent to Sport Australia at 8.46am on 11 April, the day the government went into caretaker mode. Another set of changes were made at 12.43pm that same day. McKenzie gave her first statement since resigning from the ministry over the saga late last week when she denied making \u201cany changes or annotations\u201d to the ministerial brief after 4 April, leaving open the question of who did. Morrison has repeatedly denied he or his office had anything to do with the decision-making when it came to the grants, despite the audit office reporting 136 emails were exchanged between his office and the then sport minister\u2019s staff. He refused to take questions on the issue on Friday, following McKenzie\u2019s statement. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the public deserved answers. \u201cWe need to know who changed the additional nine grants that were given and the one grant that was taken off,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cThe minister says it wasn\u2019t her, the prime minister refused to answer questions about it at a media conference, that is not good enough. \u201cThis government needs to be accountable and not just dismiss issues, say that they are the \u2018bubble\u2019, say that is just \u2018gossip\u2019, which is what Scott Morrison\u2019s form is.\u201d The Senate committee looking at the sports rorts allegations hits the road this week, with trips to Adelaide and Melbourne scheduled to talk to sports clubs that missed out on grants.

It follows the death of an 82-year-old man in Sydney, who is the third person to die in Australia after testing positive to Covid-19. The man was a resident at the BaptistCare-run Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, and had been in hospital since 1 March. Seven people had tested positive to Covid-19 in relation to an outbreak at that home, including a 95-year-old woman who died last week. The Australian health minister called for people to stop hoarding supermarket supplies in preparation for the virus, saying \u201cthis is the time to be our best selves and to let our better angels prevail\u201d. Police in New South Wales charged two women with affray over a fight in the toilet paper aisle in a Sydney supermarket on Saturday. \u201cThere have been some things which have occurred in recent days which have not been our best selves,\u201d Hunt said.

Thirty-eight of Australia\u2019s confirmed cases were in NSW. Sixteen cases nationwide were apparent cases of community transmission.

      "bodyText": "Police have charged two women for an alleged fight over dwindling supplies of toilet paper in a Sydney supermarket. Police said they were called to a Woolworths store at Chullora about 7am on Saturday after reports a 49-year-old woman had been assaulted. A video of the incident was shared on social media and showed a small group of women pushing, yelling and fighting over a shopping cart filled with toilet paper. \u201cWe just ask that people don\u2019t panic like this when they go out shopping,\u201d the New South Wales police acting inspector Andrew New said. \u201cThere is no need for it. It isn\u2019t the Thunderdome, it isn\u2019t Mad Max, we don\u2019t need to do that. \u201cViolence of this nature will not be tolerated and anyone involved in this behaviour may be committing an offence and find themselves before the court. \u201cThere is no need for people to go out and panic buy at supermarkets, paracetamol and canned food or toilet paper.\u201d Two women, aged 23 and 60, both from Bankstown, spoke to police at Bankstown police station on Saturday night. They were both issued with summons to attend the Bankstown local court on 28 April on charges of affray. Under the NSW Crimes Act, a person may be charged with affray if they \u201cuse or threaten unlawful violence towards another, and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present the scene to fear for his or her personal safety\u201d. If two or more people are alleged to have used or threatened unlawful violence, the court must consider their conduct as a whole. The video shows one woman pulling the hair of another during the heated altercation. One woman yells: \u201cI just want one packet.\u201d Another woman, who is in possession of the trolley packed with toilet paper, replies \u201cNo, not one packet,\u201d before two supermarket workers intervene to break up the argument. The woman was not injured and no arrests were made, however police now want to interview the other woman involved in the altercation. Earlier in the week, Woolworths imposed a four-packet limit on the sale of toilet paper after having its shelves stripped by shoppers. \u201cWe will not tolerate violence of any kind from our customers in our stores and we are working with police who are investigating the matter,\u201d a Woolworths spokesperson said.

      "bodyText": "General practitioners have rallied behind a Melbourne doctor who tested positive for coronavirus and demanded an apology from the Victorian health minister who they say has maligned frontline health workers. It comes as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia reaches 75. Dr Chis Higgins saw approximately 70 patients while recovering from what he believed to be a mild cold last week, before he tested positive for Covid-19. He had flown in from the US on Saturday morning. All of those patients, including two he visited at Malvern\u2019s Mecwacare nursing home, as well as all the clinical staff at the Toorak Clinic where Higgins is a GP, have since been told to self-isolate for 14 days. The health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said on Saturday that she was \u201cflabbergasted that a doctor that has flu-like symptoms has presented to work\u201d, and that his decision to continue to treat patients while unwell may be a matter for the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency to pursue. \u201cI understand our medical and healthcare workers are dedicated to the work they do \u2026 But it is irresponsible for people to be going to work if they are unwell, and that is not just healthcare workers, it is everybody in the community who needs to take this very seriously,\u201d Mikakos said. She did not name the doctor, but the Toorak Clinic only has eight GPs. The federal president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, said the doctor had acted in good faith and in accordance with current guidelines, which do not recommend testing or isolation for people who become unwell upon returning from the US, and that Mikakos\u2019s comments were \u201cvery disappointing indeed\u201d. Bartone said the minister should apologise. He also challenged suggestions GPs were well-resourced and had been kept well-informed during the outbreak. \u201cWhat is clear is that \u2026 there has been an inconsistency of messaging through various parts of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an official online advisory site that is supposed to guide but clearly there have been times where various states and territories have had different messaging to their communities. \u201cWe have to start acting as one if we\u2019re to deal with this threat of Covid-19 and assure that we have not only the briefs of truth online but that we are singing from the same song sheet, we know what is expected of us, and that information is clearly communicated in real-time and updated as quickly as necessary.\u201d Higgins, the father of the singer Missy Higgins, responded in a comment on Mikakos\u2019s Facebook page, saying: \u201cAs the doctor concerned, I have been upset about the inaccuracies and unfairness of your comments. \u201cThis is not the story that I told the DHSS whose job it is to relay information to you.

The number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 206 on Saturday.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, believes emergency powers can be used to give NHS volunteers the employment safeguards they need to allow them to leave their main jobs and temporarily volunteer in the event of a widespread pandemic.</p> <p>Around 3 million people already work voluntarily in the health, community health and social care sectors. A government source said last night: \u201cIn the event of a pandemic, we want to be able to maximise the number of volunteers and the amount of time they can commit to supporting the health and social care system \u2013 without fear of them losing their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cUnder these proposed measures, the government will ensure that the jobs of skilled, experience or qualified volunteers are protected for up to four weeks to allow them to shore up resilience across the health and social care systems. As part of this, leading business groups will be consulted thoroughly about how best to implement these changes.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers are also discussing whether limits on when supermarket delivery vans can operate, and restrictions on drivers\u2019 hours, can be lifted temporarily to allow food to be delivered to the ill and vulnerable. Any attempt to suspend limits on drivers\u2019 hours is likely to be resisted by unions.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will use the budget to put in place a multibillion-pound fund to help businesses that suffer the worst effects of the virus, with particular focus on small firms employing 100 people or fewer.

      "bodyText": "A range of drastic new measures, including emergency legislation allowing people to switch jobs and volunteer to work in the NHS or care homes, are being drawn up by ministers in an attempt to tackle the coronavirus crisis. The measures \u2013 which also include plans for courts to use telephone and video links to avoid people having to attend in person \u2013 are likely to be included in a special Covid-19 emergency bill, as the government prepares to move to the next phase \u2013 delay \u2013 of its response to the spread of the virus. Sports governing bodies and broadcasters have been called to an emergency meeting on Monday by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to examine whether large events should be held behind closed doors if the situation worsens. Another measure reportedly being considered is banning over-70s from attending large gatherings. The government\u2019s emergency committee, Cobra, will also meet on Monday and will be chaired by the prime minister before the budget on Wednesday, which has had to be reshaped and rewritten in response to the outbreak. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 206 on Saturday. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, believes emergency powers can be used to give NHS volunteers the employment safeguards they need to allow them to leave their main jobs and temporarily volunteer in the event of a widespread pandemic. Around 3 million people already work voluntarily in the health, community health and social care sectors. A government source said last night: \u201cIn the event of a pandemic, we want to be able to maximise the number of volunteers and the amount of time they can commit to supporting the health and social care system \u2013 without fear of them losing their jobs. \u201cUnder these proposed measures, the government will ensure that the jobs of skilled, experience or qualified volunteers are protected for up to four weeks to allow them to shore up resilience across the health and social care systems. As part of this, leading business groups will be consulted thoroughly about how best to implement these changes.\u201d Ministers are also discussing whether limits on when supermarket delivery vans can operate, and restrictions on drivers\u2019 hours, can be lifted temporarily to allow food to be delivered to the ill and vulnerable. Any attempt to suspend limits on drivers\u2019 hours is likely to be resisted by unions. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will use the budget to put in place a multibillion-pound fund to help businesses that suffer the worst effects of the virus, with particular focus on small firms employing 100 people or fewer. Sunak is understood to be concerned that smaller firms will be especially vulnerable if the crisis develops and a majority of staff call in sick or are sent home to prevent the spread of the virus. Without the ability to find replacement staff, Sunak will say, smaller firms could be forced to shut down or even go bust. \u201cWe are preparing for the worst while hoping for the best,\u201d one government source said. \u201cWe are looking at all aspects of how the virus can damage the economy, and looking to make sure we can protect firms and employees.\u201d Details of the plan were still being hammered out this weekend but the chancellor expects to provide a comprehensive package of measures following talks with other Whitehall departments. He is also hopeful that he can give details of how firms can make claims on the funds. On Saturday, the Department of Health announced that coronavirus cases had risen by 42 to 206, a slight slowdown on the previous day, when the biggest leap yet \u2013 47 \u2013 had been reported. So far, more than 21,000 people have been tested for the virus in the UK. Off the coast of California, more than 140 Britons were stranded on a cruise ship on Saturday night waiting to be tested for the virus after it emerged that at least 21 crew members and passengers had been infected. On Saturday, the family of the UK\u2019s second fatality from coronavirus paid tribute to the 83-year-old man, who died in Milton Keynes university hospital last Thursday. Requesting that the media did not name him, and revealing they were being forced to self-isolate and had been tested for the virus, the family said: \u201cWe as a family have lost a truly loving and wonderful person and are trying to come to terms with this. He was 83 years old and a wonderful husband, dad, grandad and great-grandad who would go to any lengths to support and protect his family. \u201cThis whole nightmare is not something that we or our loved one asked for.

Re:START Container mall was built in Christchurch after the earthquake of 2011, and survived for seven years by becoming a tourist attraction. Closer to home there\u2019s Eat Street Market in Brisbane. Then there\u2019s budget accommodation: as far back as 2010, Canberra\u2019s Australian National University opened a residential block made from shipping containers.</p> <p>In Victoria, until May, shipping containers repurposed as luxury eco-pod hotel rooms are doing the rounds of vineyards as <a href=\"http://visitvictoria.com/regions/your-happy-space/pop-up-hotel\">Wine Down Pop Up</a>. They\u2019re the project of Toly Mezhov and Irene Polo, working as <a href=\"http://contained.com.au/\">Contained</a>, and have a bathroom, timber flooring and bedrooms that can be extended when the container is dropped into location. Mezhov likes the way shipping containers are versatile and easy to move around. Plus people tend to be fascinated by them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd5668e455b3d82858eecafabdddbfd32e09c26a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd5668e455b3d82858eecafabdddbfd32e09c26a/0_147_3508_2194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The interior of a shipping container hotel room for Contained\u2019s Wine Down pop-up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The interior of a shipping container hotel room for Contained\u2019s Wine Down pop-up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visit Victoria</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe started going down the path of container homes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut realised that it\u2019s not that affordable as yet, because by the time you start working on something bespoke the price point is not dissimilar to building a home in situ, so we switched up our model and went down the path of pop-up restaurants, bars and hotel rooms.\u201d</p> <p>Mezhov says that the reduction of embodied carbon in this kind of build, combined with using off-grid infrastructure, results in dwellings that are effectively carbon neutral. They\u2019ve collaborated with Black Stump Technologies, which has another container holding a solar power generator, so the hotel is off-grid.</p> <p>They serve as a nice taster for those tempted to take the plunge. Until building solutions for working with steel containers become more accessible to the general public, the reality of shipping-container homes may realistically be limited to environmental enthusiasts intent on recycling.</p> <p>Although Lego fetishists may also be tempted.</p>",

But, of course, it\u2019s built into a shipping container. \u2018It\u2019s not that affordable as yet\u2019 As for commercial ventures, retail has caught on fast: there\u2019s the double-decker shipping-container pop-up mall Boxpark, in London\u2019s Shoreditch, and Pop Brixton south of the river. Re:START Container mall was built in Christchurch after the earthquake of 2011, and survived for seven years by becoming a tourist attraction. Closer to home there\u2019s Eat Street Market in Brisbane. Then there\u2019s budget accommodation: as far back as 2010, Canberra\u2019s Australian National University opened a residential block made from shipping containers. In Victoria, until May, shipping containers repurposed as luxury eco-pod hotel rooms are doing the rounds of vineyards as Wine Down Pop Up. They\u2019re the project of Toly Mezhov and Irene Polo, working as Contained, and have a bathroom, timber flooring and bedrooms that can be extended when the container is dropped into location. Mezhov likes the way shipping containers are versatile and easy to move around. Plus people tend to be fascinated by them. \u201cWe started going down the path of container homes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut realised that it\u2019s not that affordable as yet, because by the time you start working on something bespoke the price point is not dissimilar to building a home in situ, so we switched up our model and went down the path of pop-up restaurants, bars and hotel rooms.\u201d Mezhov says that the reduction of embodied carbon in this kind of build, combined with using off-grid infrastructure, results in dwellings that are effectively carbon neutral. They\u2019ve collaborated with Black Stump Technologies, which has another container holding a solar power generator, so the hotel is off-grid. They serve as a nice taster for those tempted to take the plunge. Until building solutions for working with steel containers become more accessible to the general public, the reality of shipping-container homes may realistically be limited to environmental enthusiasts intent on recycling. Although Lego fetishists may also be tempted.",
