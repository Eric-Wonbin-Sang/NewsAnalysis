Arizona and Albigna, well backed for the Juvenile Turf and Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf respectively, both finished unplaced without ever threatening to land a serious blow. </p> <p>The first race of the meeting, the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint, set the tone for the day as a six-strong raiding party \u2013 half of the field \u2013 could manage no better than a fifth-place finish for Tom Dascombe\u2019s Dr Simpson, as Four Wheel Drive won it from the front.</p> <p>Wesley Ward\u2019s colt did what the trainer\u2019s horses do best, breaking with lightning speed from stall nine and quickly getting to the lead under Irad Ortiz jnr. A\u2019Ali, with Frankie Dettori in the saddle, was held up towards the rear from a wide draw and could not get into contention as the suitably-named Four Wheel Drive flew around the tight home turn at high speed as if he was attached to a rail. He kicked again from there to finish three-quarters of a length in front of Chimney Rock with Another Miracle in third.</p> <p>It was a similar story in the Juvenile Turf, as Arizona, the runner-up in the Dewhurst Stakes, was slowly away from stall 12 and then settled at the tail of the field by Ryan Moore. He made a spirited attempt to make ground in the stretch and eventually finished fifth, but the damage had already been done. Structor, who had launched his challenge from a much better position, ran on well to beat two big outsiders, Billy Batts and Gear Jockey. </p> <p>Sharing, whose trainer, Graham Motion, grew up on a stud farm in Newmarket, completed the sweep for US-trained horses in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf, although Daahyeh, the winner of the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, was staying on strongly through the final furlong and got to within a length and a quarter of the winner. </p> <p>There was a huge shock at the end of the card as big outsiders filled the first three places in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile. Dennis\u2019 Moment, the hot favourite, lost all chance with a bad stumble just a stride into the race, and his main market rival Eight Rings could not take advantage as Storm The Court (45-1) made most of the running to beat Anneau D\u2019Or (25-1) and Wrecking Crew (35-1).</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T23:43:44.846Z\">at 11.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dbcbeb88f08cb84c60a3399\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T23:28:47.281Z\">11.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Many thousands of stunned punters are heading away from Santa Anita after that shock result in the Juvenile, but many thousands more will be back here tomorrow for the main card, and nine Breeders\u2019 Cup races in all. </p> <p>I\u2019ll be back in my blogging chair from around 18.00GMT tomorrow and I hope you\u2019ll join me as Anthony Van Dyck, Old Persian, Circus Maximus and more go hunting for the glory of a Breeders\u2019 Cup victory.

I\u2019m here at Santa Anita racecourse in California, perched about five floors above the finishing line, ready to blog live throughout the next two days of racing at Breeders\u2019 Cup 2019. </p> <p>The meeting begins today with the five events for two-year-olds: two on dirt, and three on turf, including the Juvenile Turf Sprint which made its debut at last year\u2019s meeting. The European team \u2013 which pretty much means Britain and Ireland at this year\u2019s meeting \u2013 fields fancied runners in all three turf events, including two favourites: Arizona, in the Juvenile Turf, and Albigna, Jessica Harrington\u2019s first Breeders\u2019 Cup runner in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf. </p> <p>On the dirt, Dennis\u2019 Moment and Eight Rings are vying for favouritism in the Juvenile, a race could well determine the early favourite for next year\u2019s Kentucky Derby, while the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 is wide open, and any one of four fillies \u2013 Donna Veloce, British Idiom, Bast and Wicked Whisper \u2013 could conceivably set off as the punters\u2019 pick. </p> <p>Regardless of which horses come home in front, the most important thing this afternoon will be to get them all back safe, after the traumatic months in the first half of the year when 30 horses died either racing or training at Santa Anita.

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s challenge for the three juvenile turf races on the first day of this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting came up well short here on Friday, as only Daahyeh, in Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf, managed even to make the frame. Arizona and Albigna, well backed for the Juvenile Turf and Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf respectively, both finished unplaced without ever threatening to land a serious blow. The first race of the meeting, the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint, set the tone for the day as a six-strong raiding party \u2013 half of the field \u2013 could manage no better than a fifth-place finish for Tom Dascombe\u2019s Dr Simpson, as Four Wheel Drive won it from the front. Wesley Ward\u2019s colt did what the trainer\u2019s horses do best, breaking with lightning speed from stall nine and quickly getting to the lead under Irad Ortiz jnr. A\u2019Ali, with Frankie Dettori in the saddle, was held up towards the rear from a wide draw and could not get into contention as the suitably-named Four Wheel Drive flew around the tight home turn at high speed as if he was attached to a rail. He kicked again from there to finish three-quarters of a length in front of Chimney Rock with Another Miracle in third. It was a similar story in the Juvenile Turf, as Arizona, the runner-up in the Dewhurst Stakes, was slowly away from stall 12 and then settled at the tail of the field by Ryan Moore. He made a spirited attempt to make ground in the stretch and eventually finished fifth, but the damage had already been done. Structor, who had launched his challenge from a much better position, ran on well to beat two big outsiders, Billy Batts and Gear Jockey. Sharing, whose trainer, Graham Motion, grew up on a stud farm in Newmarket, completed the sweep for US-trained horses in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf, although Daahyeh, the winner of the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, was staying on strongly through the final furlong and got to within a length and a quarter of the winner. There was a huge shock at the end of the card as big outsiders filled the first three places in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile. Dennis\u2019 Moment, the hot favourite, lost all chance with a bad stumble just a stride into the race, and his main market rival Eight Rings could not take advantage as Storm The Court (45-1) made most of the running to beat Anneau D\u2019Or (25-1) and Wrecking Crew (35-1). Many thousands of stunned punters are heading away from Santa Anita after that shock result in the Juvenile, but many thousands more will be back here tomorrow for the main card, and nine Breeders\u2019 Cup races in all. I\u2019ll be back in my blogging chair from around 18.00GMT tomorrow and I hope you\u2019ll join me as Anthony Van Dyck, Old Persian, Circus Maximus and more go hunting for the glory of a Breeders\u2019 Cup victory. This is Greg Wood at Santa Anita, signing off. Storm The Court was 45-1, Anneau D\u2019Or was 25-1 and Wrecking Crew was 35-1. It\u2019s safe to say that absolutely no-one saw this one coming. Or did they? Having predicted a record-breaking Trifecta, it actually seems to have paid at around 3930-1, which is chunky but still well below what many here would have expected in the circumstances. \u201cDid someone miss off a zero?\u201d, as somebody put it. Outsiders filled the first three places! Dennis\u2019 Moment was a hopeless cause from the moment he stumbled out of the stalls. Eight Rings was not far off the pace but faded rapidly in the stretch, while Scabbard ran on to finish fourth. The trifecta here is going to be mind-blowing. 1 STORM THE COURT, 2 Anneau D\u2019Or, 3 Wrecking Crew. Wow. Dennis Moment still last, here comes Anneau D\u2019Or to challenge STorm The Court, it\u2019s a real boilover in the Juvenile the favourite stumbled badly early, now last as storm the court leads from Eight Rings Nightmare start for Dennis Moment as he misses the break! Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile! Even money now for Dennis\u2019 Moment, and it\u2019s almost post time for the Juvenile. Dennis\u2019 Moment is currently the first odds-on favourite of the day in the Breeders\u2019 Cup events, showing at 4-5 on the tote. Eight Rings is 9-5 and Scabbard is 9-2. The shortest price about any of the rest is 22-1, so it will be one of the big three or a monster upset. The only other runner in today\u2019s race at a single-figure price is Scabbard, who was just under two lengths behind Dennis\u2019 Moment in the Iroquois. As the video shows, though, the bare form does not give anything like enough credit to Dennis\u2019 Moment, who was pretty much coasting through the final furlong. Eight Rings, meanwhile, has been doing his racing on the west coast. He took the Grade 1 American Pharoah here at Santa Anita last time and did so with authority in the end, though he did drift away from the rail a couple of times in the straight. The feature race on the card is the fifth and final Breeders\u2019 Cup race today, the Juvenile. The field was reduced in quality when Maxfield was scratched earlier in the week, but the anticipated head-to-head between Dennis\u2019 Moment and Eight Rings promises to be one to savour. I\u2019m not sure that his name would find favour with the apostrophe police, but that won\u2019t matter if he delivers the goods. Here\u2019s Dennis\u2019 Moment winning the Grade 3 Iroquois Stakes at Churchill Downs. Sharing may not be European-trained but she is at least trained by a European. Sort of. Graham Motion, who was born in Cambridge and grew up in Newmarket, has just trained the fourth Breeders\u2019 Cup winner of his career. Daahyeh, in second, and Albigna, who was fourth, both finished fast from off the pace. But it was too late to get to Sharing, who completes a 3-0 win for US-trained horses in today\u2019s three turf events. 1 SHARING, 2. Daahyeh, 3. Sweet Melania. Sweet Melania in front, here comes Sharing, and Sharing wins it! Etoile is fourth, Daahyeh well back, into the stretch Abscond leads down the back Frankie got out on Etoile but he\u2019s four wide at the turn, Albigna has only one behind. Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf! The locals prefer Daahyeh to Albigna, perhaps on account of her lower draw in five, and she is 7-2 favourite. Jessica Harrington, though, said earlier in the week that she was really pleased to draw nine as it will keep Albigna out of trouble. Not long now to find out who is right ... To stand any chance at all, Frankie will need to be away from the stalls with a lot more alacrity than Ryan Moore on Arizona earlier on. And even if he is, there\u2019s still every chance he will be four or five wide at the first turn. He\u2019s a jockey, not a miracle-worker, though a win here might suggest that he really does have supernatural powers. British Idiom, by the way, is the third consecutive unbeaten winner on today\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup card. They are now out on the track for the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf. Etoile will be a rare Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained ride for Frankie Dettori here, but he was distinctly unimpressed by her draw in stall 14 of 14 and even the Frankie Factor can\u2019t get her any shorter than 24-1 on the local tote. A quick Google search on whether Sweet Melania is named after America\u2019s First Lady has proved inconclusive. The home team, meanwhile, is led by Todd Pletcher\u2019s Sweet Melania, who took the Jessamine Stakes at Keeneland: And if Albigna doesn\u2019t win, then maybe Roger Varian\u2019s Daahyeh will. She took the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot back in June: Here\u2019s Albigna winning the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp last time out: Last chance saloon for the Europeans coming up after a wipeout in the two turf races so far. The impressive Albigna heads the betting for the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf, attempting to give Jessica Harrington a winner with her first Breeders\u2019 Cup runner. She pulled off the same trick with Sizing John in the Cheltenham Gold Cup a couple of years ago and it would be a life for the visitors after a difficult time of it so far. Here\u2019s the connections of British Idiom celebrating the win: A gritty, determined performance by British Idiom, who started at 5-2. She was slightly outpaced on the turn for home as Donna Veloce made her move and grabbed the lead, but there was an impressive relentlessness about the way she ground out the win, getting up in the final strides. 1 BRITISH IDIOM, 2 Donna Veloce, 3 Bast. Driving for the wire, it\u2019s British Idiom just in front, edging out Donna Veloce British Idiom laying down a challenge Wicked Whisper and Bast go on, turning for home Two Sixty leads, from Bast and Wicked Whisper Off and running in the Juvenile Fillies! Approaching the gates, it\u2019s post time for the Juvenile Fillies\u2019. As for Donna Veloce, the fourth member of the quarter, I\u2019m struggling for a YouTube at the moment but I\u2019ll keep looking. She\u2019s just joined British Idiom at the top of the betting, they are both showing at 5-2 with Wicked Whisper on 3-1 and Bast at 4-1. And Wicked Whisper has to have a big chance on the back of her win in the Grade 1 Frizette: Bast has plenty of supporters too, this is a Grade 1 at Del Mar: We are on to the dirt for the next Breeders\u2019 Cup event, the Juvenile Fillies\u2019. Four runners dominate the betting, which is headed by British Idiom at 3-1. Here she is in action, winning the Grade 1 Alcibiades Stakes: Certainly no reason to be writing off Arizona after this. The last two Derby winners have been beaten in the Juvenile Turf. Here\u2019s the replay of the Juvenile Turf Sprint on the Breeders\u2019 Cup Twitter feed: As for Arizona, he finished well from a hopeless position after his slow start. He had every opponent in front of him going into the back stretch and did quite well under the circumstances to finish fifth. Not that that will be much consolation to his back. A huge sigh of relief from the punters as Structor keeps the race. The runner-up and third were both big outsiders at 50-1 and 60-1, while Structor had far more support at around 5-1. RESULT STANDS! There was all sorts of drama and scrimmaging on the turn into the stretch and Structor was hard against the rail turning in. He tightened up Peace Achieved on his outside as Jose Ortiz tried to find running room. INQUIRY KLAXON! 1 STRUCTOR, 2 Billy Batts, 3 Gear Jockey. But ... Structor finishing well, he\u2019s going to get there as the front-runners fade ... Graceful Kitten leads, Arizona still towards the rear. Arizona dawdled in the stalls, one off the rail going into the first turn. Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Turf! Arizona is showing as 2-1 here, with Decorated Invader at 5-2. Over to you, Ryan Moore. Getting close to the off in the Juvenile Turf, and Arizona is now favourite with the local punters. Chad Brown\u2019s Structor could also be a big player here. He took the Grade 3 Pilgrim Stakes at Belmont in September. And this is Decorated Invader guaranteeing a place in today\u2019s field with a win-and-you\u2019re-in success in the Summer Stakes at Woodbine. Here\u2019s Arizona finishing behind Pinatubo in the Dewhurst: Next up here is the Juvenile Turf, which poses another draw-based dilemma for a fancied European runner. Arizona is miles clear of the field on ratings, having chased home the brilliant Pinatubo last time. But stall 12 is a horrible place to be and he is only joint-favourite here at the moment with Christophe Clement\u2019s Decorated Invader. It looked like a bit of a present for the Europeans when the Turf Sprint was added to the main Breeders\u2019 Cup card, but the home team are now two-nil up and So Perfect last year is the only Euro to even make the frame. The draw did the visitors no favours, but Four Wheel Drive showed so much early speed that he would still have won from nine regardless. Unless you can match the pace and running style of Ward\u2019s juveniles, this is going to be a much tougher race to win than many had hoped. Four Wheel Drive paid $5.00 to $2.00 on the tote, which is 6-4. The punters got it right. That was a very chastening experience for the Europeans. A\u2019Ali never threatened to figure from stall 10 and it all happened way too fast for most of them. Four Wheel Drive trapped like a greyhound and never looked likely to come back to his field. Tom Dascombe\u2019s Dr Simpson, with Richard Kingscote aboard, was best of the visitors in fifth. 1 FOUR WHEEL DRIVE, 2 Chimney Rock, 3 Another Miracle All over, Four Wheel Drive scarcely saw another rival. Turning in, it\u2019s Four Wheel Drive still in front Four Wheel Drive is on the lead, Frankie was slow away on A\u2019Ali and has one behind him Off and running in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint! The market has moved slightly towards Four Wheel Drive. He is the 9-5 favourite, with Kimari on 5-2 and A\u2019Ali 9-2. The runners are out on the track for the Juvenile Turf Sprint and Breeders\u2019 Cup 2019 will be underway in 10 minutes. Kimari is slightly on her toes but otherwise they all look undaunted by their Santa Anita experience so far. As has been pointed out on Twitter, Wesley Ward does have a third runner in this race, though a draw in 12 of 12 is likely to give the splendidly-named Tyler Gaffalione even more problems on the filly Cambria than Frankie will have on A\u2019Ali. But here she is in her last race at Kentucky Downs. And this is Four Wheel Drive in the Futurity at Belmont Park. The most obvious obstacle to the European contingent, which also include King Neptune (Aidan O\u2019Brien), Band Practice (Archie Watson), Alligator Alley (Joseph O\u2019Brien), Dr Simpson (Tom Dascombe) and Dream Shot (James Tate) is a familiar one. Wesley Ward has become a familiar figure in the winners\u2019 enclosure at Royal Ascot in recent years, unleashing juveniles in particular which seem capable of remarkable bursts of five-furlong speed. His two runners here, Kimari and Four Wheel Drive, are currently inseparable at the top of the on-track betting at 2-1. Here\u2019s Kimari\u2019s last race, the Indian Summer Stakes at Keeneland. The first winner of Breeders\u2019 Cup 2019 will be returning in triumph in just over half an hour. The Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint was a race on the undercard until 12 months ago and one in which the British and Irish often did quite well but the visiting juveniles came up short in its first year as a Breeders\u2019 Cup event and they are up against it again this time if the betting is any guide. A wide draw has really dented the chance of A\u2019Ali, who looked tailor-made for the race when he took the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot: Good evening, good afternoon or perhaps even an early good morning, if you\u2019re in Japan and too excited to sleep. I\u2019m here at Santa Anita racecourse in California, perched about five floors above the finishing line, ready to blog live throughout the next two days of racing at Breeders\u2019 Cup 2019. The meeting begins today with the five events for two-year-olds: two on dirt, and three on turf, including the Juvenile Turf Sprint which made its debut at last year\u2019s meeting. The European team \u2013 which pretty much means Britain and Ireland at this year\u2019s meeting \u2013 fields fancied runners in all three turf events, including two favourites: Arizona, in the Juvenile Turf, and Albigna, Jessica Harrington\u2019s first Breeders\u2019 Cup runner in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf. On the dirt, Dennis\u2019 Moment and Eight Rings are vying for favouritism in the Juvenile, a race could well determine the early favourite for next year\u2019s Kentucky Derby, while the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 is wide open, and any one of four fillies \u2013 Donna Veloce, British Idiom, Bast and Wicked Whisper \u2013 could conceivably set off as the punters\u2019 pick. Regardless of which horses come home in front, the most important thing this afternoon will be to get them all back safe, after the traumatic months in the first half of the year when 30 horses died either racing or training at Santa Anita. There\u2019s more on that story here and here, while my personal picks for today\u2019s five Breeders\u2019 Cup races are: Kimari (Juvenile Turf Sprint), Decorated Invader (Juvenile Turf), Wicked Whisper (Juvenile Fillies\u2019), Albigna (Juvenile Fillies Turf) and Dennis\u2019 Moment (Juvenile). It\u2019s going to be a very busy weekend of racing Stateside and I look forward to sharing it with you as the 14 races find their winners.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s no surer sign that a politician is looking towards some kind of advancement than when they jump on to a populist cause \u2013 and to hell with the facts. This week the New South Wales deputy premier and National party leader, John Barilaro, excelled himself when he declared he would be prepared to \u201crip up\u201d the Murray-Darling basin plan and has asked for legal advice on whether the state government can \u201cwalk away\u201d from it. He said we should be \u201cpausing all water-sharing plans\u201d while the drought continued, and \u201cwe need to put people before the environment\u201d. He has been aided and abetted by the state\u2019s water minister, Melinda Pavey, who criticised the release of water down the Lachlan River by the commonwealth environment water holder as \u201cblind recklessness\u201d while towns along the valley faced the prospect of running dry. \u201cFarmers have been blamed for a lot while the CEWH continues to pour water down the river without any regard for our communities doing it tough,\u201d Pavey said. These statements exploit people\u2019s strong sympathy for farmers and their plight, but without the slightest effort to explain the facts or the science behind environmental water. And they are almost certainly being made for motives that owe more to the Nationals\u2019 existential struggle with the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party and Barilaro\u2019s own ambition. Fish kills: just the beginning But back to the facts. The Murray-Darling basin plan was agreed to by the states and territories in 2007 because there was general recognition there had been historic over-allocation of the available water in the system, which if unaddressed would lead to environmental catastrophe. The basin states and territories eventually agreed to an environmentally sustainable level of take by irrigators and an allocation of environmental flows, because otherwise the river system was going to die, with enormous environmental, social and economic consequences. Major fish kills would be the tip of the iceberg. Mass die-offs of river red gums, loss of breeding grounds for birds and fish, rising salinity and undrinkable water for towns along the river were on the cards. Even now, scientists worry that the plan didn\u2019t go far enough. The scientific consensus was that the 2750GL target for environmental water was the bare minimum to repair the river. \u201cThe entire point of the basin plan is to share water between people and rivers, particularly during drought,\u201d says Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute. \u201cThe current management of the basin was set up by John Howard specifically in response to drought.\u201d The other critical part of the reforms was to create legally enforceable and tradable water rights. The commonwealth has spent billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money buying water entitlements back from farmers for the environment. Some farmers and agribusinesses have made millions trading water entitlements. The advantage of the scheme is that farmers who hold high-security water rights know that even in a drought they have a legally enforceable right to water. Water rights of lesser value \u2013 general security and supplementary rights \u2013 don\u2019t have the same guarantee of access. Farmers know that in a drought the chances are they won\u2019t get their full entitlement, and may not get any water. The plan also includes a hierarchy of needs. Water for critical human uses in towns comes first, then water for stock, then high-security water, then general security water. On 1 July each year, the states declare what the allocation against these entitlements will be. In a drought, the general security and supplementary water users lose out first. Most have zero allocations this year. Those who hold high-security water might get a cut too, but this year they are still receiving about 97% in most valleys. In a drought the allocations for environmental water are reduced as well. Science before politics What has outraged Pavey and Barilaro was the decision by the commonwealth environmental water holder to let 22GL of its entitlement in the Lachlan river system flow down the river in mid-September to flush the system and water the Cumbung swamp. David Papps, a former commonwealth environmental water holder, said the decisions on environmental water were based on world-class science and that the priorities were set in consultation with the states. He said criticising the commonwealth environmental water holder amounted to an explicit criticism of the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, because his department signed off on the decision. \u201cJust because there\u2019s a drought doesn\u2019t mean we can abandon environmental watering,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are assets that were already under stress because of our mismanagement of the Murray-Darling.\u201d Papps also warned Barilaro and Pavey that they should be very wary of the precedent that would be set by disregarding or overriding environmental water entitlements. \u201cThe strength of the architecture of the plan is that environmental water rights are the same legal instruments as other water holders,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you trash legally enforceable rights to water for one holder, then it will devalue the rights of all. \u201cIf the Nationals override the rights of the environmental water holder, it would mean that a future Labor government could decide to unilaterally repudiate the rights of irrigators.\u201d Papps also pointed out that state governments already have ample powers to protect water for towns: they can declare an embargo on pumping in any valley to protect the last of the water in dams for use by towns. But this would mean that irrigators with high security licences would also have to stop pumping. Even in the middle of this drought, there will be cotton grown in parts of NSW \u2013 but that\u2019s how the system works. If a farmer has a water allocation, it is up to the farmer to decide what is the highest value crop to grow. And the farmer has certainty that the water will be delivered. \u201cBarilaro seems not to understand that the plan and the commonwealth environmental water holder were set up, and paid for, in order to use environmental water based on science, not on what might get him in the newspapers,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cBarilaro\u2019s ideas aren\u2019t just bad for the health of our river system, or for science-based policy, they\u2019re bad for all owners of water rights. \u201cWhile the science behind our water management has been badly compromised, hopefully we don\u2019t yet use water in whatever way a deputy premier feels like on a given day.\u201d Papps suggested that Barilaro\u2019s posturing owed more to politics, and a long-term goal of trying to get rid of a final stage of the plan which will see a further 450GL of water retrieved for the environment. There is intense speculation that Barilaro is positioning himself for a run at the federal seat of Eden-Monaro, which would be vulnerable if the sitting member, Labor\u2019s Mike Kelly, called it a day. In August the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, recommitted to the Murray-Darling basin plan at the Council of Australian Governments meeting. Papps said: \u201cThe basin plan is a truly significant national reform that is fundamental to ensuring the health of the basin\u2019s environment into the future and its unconscionable for it to be under threat from the petty and self-interested politics of the NSW National party.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp has called on Fifa and Uefa to meet the leading managers in world football over the \u201ccrazy\u201d demands on top international players. The Liverpool manager was a leading critic of the fixture schedule even before his team\u2019s qualification for December\u2019s Club World Cup and progress to the Carabao Cup quarter-final created a clash of dates that remains unresolved. Klopp insists his concerns are for the greater good and shared by \u201cpretty much all managers, especially managers who are in Europe and have a lot of international players\u201d. He has accused football authorities of placing their own financial interests before the wellbeing of players who drive the game\u2019s popularity, by adding competitive fixtures to the international calendar and proposing an expanded Club World Cup from 2021. But Klopp believes solutions can be found, providing officials listen to those \u201cwho have to do the actual work\u201d. \u201cThere should be a meeting with five to 10 top managers in the world, Fifa, Uefa and the CEOs of the big leagues,\u201d he said. \u201cThey discuss it and everyone gets the same vote. Just talk about the game again. The game has grown in the last couple of years and I get that \u2026 it is a business, we are part of that and we get the benefit of the business 100%. But it grew so much because of the quality of the players. \u201cOur part of it is to help players fulfil their potential. That only really works with training but in modern football a manager has no time for training any more. You have a pre-season which is disrupted by pretty much everything and for the last 10 days you have your whole squad. \u201cThe biggest benefit this game could get is to give these really good coaches out there more time. This game could be improved unbelievably again to the next level if we had a period in the year when we could really train together.\u201d Klopp claims leading internationals such as Sadio Man\u00e9 are approaching breaking point with only two weeks\u2019 rest per year.

      "bodyText": "Frank Lampard has warned Michy Batshuayi and Olivier Giroud that he will not prioritise their international careers over Chelsea\u2019s needs. Tammy Abraham\u2019s goalscoring exploits have left both strikers in the shade this season, hurting their chances of representing their countries at Euro 2020. Roberto Mart\u00ednez said during the last international break that Batshuayi needed to play more for Chelsea and the Belgium manager\u2019s France counterpart, Didier Deschamps, has complained about Giroud\u2019s lack of games. However, Lampard dismissed suggestions that he is under pressure from Mart\u00ednez and Deschamps, even though Giroud has hinted he could push for a transfer in January to cement his place in the France squad. \u201cNot at all,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt is difficult for me and it is difficult for them. We both have our jobs, so it doesn\u2019t feature in my thinking. I have to care for all the players. I have to pick the squad as I see it for the best of Chelsea, as they do for their countries.\u201d Giroud has not started a league game since August and was an unused substitute when Chelsea were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Manchester United on Wednesday. Lampard is happy to talk to the 33-year-old about his future in January but wants the former Arsenal forward to stay. Batshuayi has done well recently, coming off the bench to grab Chelsea\u2019s winner against Ajax in the Champions League last month and scoring a fine goal when he started against United. However the 26-year-old is likely to be replaced by Abraham when Chelsea visit Watford on Saturday evening. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who has a 50-50 chance of being involved when Lampard\u2019s side host Ajax on Tuesday, has not recovered from a groin injury for the trip to Vicarage Road. If Kant\u00e9 is fit, Lampard will not ask Deschamps not to pick the midfielder for France\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Albania and Moldova this month. \u201cI love players playing for their countries,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt means they are playing well for us. If he is fit and playing for us, then I will happily wave him away and hope he comes back in good health.\u201d Antonio R\u00fcdiger will not return against Watford. The German defender trained this week but will see a specialist on Monday to discuss a problem in his pelvic area.",

Martial has four goals in seven appearances, either side of two months out with a hamstring injury. He can be perceived as not smiling often and his previous manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, was not always content with his attitude. Solskj\u00e6r said of the 23-year-old: \u201cI don\u2019t think he has had a long run of games as a No 9 since he played many years ago [here] as a boy. Now he is maturing. You have to be obsessed with scoring goals as a No 9 and he is looking more and more like a player who wants to score goals and not just show his tricks. \u201cFor me he has matured a lot in his behaviour on the training ground as well. I believe we will see the best of him in the next few years. He looks happier and seems happy. He is an infectious boy \u2013 his smile and sense of humour. You can see he is happy here and that rubs off on everyone and it\u2019s great to see.\u201d United are at Bournemouth for Saturday\u2019s early game, having won their past three away matches in a run of four in 10 days.

Everything went for them. Nothing went for us.</p> <p>\u201cWe threw the dice and played extravagantly. I thought it was the only way we would get something from the game. I wanted us to have a real go and score a few tries. They tore us apart.\u201d</p> <p>The Bulls scored 13 tries and Jones lost his job with the Reds. Twelve years later, he is coaching England against South Africa in the World Cup final on Saturday. Yokohama is a long way from Pretoria. But Jones has always been phlegmatic about that humiliation. \u201cI\u2019ve suffered worse losses than 92-3,\u201d he said with a rueful grin. \u201cAt Tokai University we were once beaten 110-0. We then lost 75-0 in the very next game. But that was Japanese university rugby in the 1990s. This was Super 14 rugby and so it stung to get hammered like that in Pretoria.\u201d</p> <p>The Springboks certainly regarded the Bulls game as an aberration in Jones\u2019s stellar career and plans were made to entice him into their World Cup camp. Eight weeks before South Africa played England in Paris, Jones was appointed as the Springboks\u2019 technical director and the effective No 2 to the head coach, Jake White.</p> <p>It was an inspired decision because Jones offered tactical acumen and vast experience that calmed the camp. They already had great players \u2013 Bryan Habana, Fourie du Preez, Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha had been part of the Bulls team that crushed the Reds \u2013 but Jones offered them something different. He was incredibly shrewd and mentally tough. The Springboks were also taken aback by his candour.</p> <p>John Smit, who captained the Springboks to victory in that World Cup, told me about the startling impact Jones had on the squad. \u201cHe watched our first session and I thought we looked pretty good as we showed him some of our best moves. Afterwards, I asked him: \u2018What do you think, Eddie?\u2019 He gave that little smile of his and said: \u2018It wasn\u2019t bad, mate, but if I were giving you a score out of 10 I\u2019d say it was about a four.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Smit laughed. \u201cI thought he was joking.

I didn\u2019t care if they were offended. I went through some set moves and showed the Boks how I would do things differently. They must have liked it because Jake asked if I would consider becoming their technical adviser on the eve of the World Cup. I was so excited I said \u2018Yes\u2019 on the spot. It became one of my greatest experiences in rugby.\u201d</p> <p>By the time they reached Paris, Jones felt an integral part of the Springbok setup. At half-time against England, South Africa were leading 20-0. Jones described it as the most dominant performance he had seen against defending world champions and he felt privileged to have moved from the disaster of Pretoria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/15/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20078\" title=\"\">to the masterclass of Paris</a>. \u201cBut then it got really interesting. South Africa were so much better than England it felt as if they could end up winning 100-0. So the players made a surprising tactical decision. They were ready to let England have as much ball as they liked in the second half so that the Boks could practise their defence.</p> <p>\u201cThis was a sign of an intelligent team who knew they were going deep into the tournament so, rather than chasing a huge score, they decided to sharpen their defence for tougher battles. It showed me the South African mentality. They absolutely love making big hits. England had much more of the ball in the second half but the Boks still won 36-0.\u201d</p> <p>After a player-led regrouping, England somehow made it to the final against South Africa. The Springboks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/22/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20074\" title=\"\">won a much tighter match, 15-6</a>, and numerous players in their team have told me that they don\u2019t believe they would have lifted the World Cup without Jones.</p> <p>Du Preez, their scrum-half and one of their best players, was the most emphatic: \u201cHe got us right tactically and the calmness he gave us was vital. Jake White would have struggled without Eddie.\u201d</p> <p>Jones played down the plaudits. \u201cI believe the Boks would have still become world champions. I saw myself as being like the guy who comes in after a new house has been built and he takes care of the small details \u2013 sorting out minor issues and adding a gloss of paint to a very solid structure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was very happy in Cape Town but the England job was intriguing</p> <footer> <cite>Eddie Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cJake did feel the pressure and he was nervous but he coached really well. I helped most by taking some of the pressure off him. I had coached Australia to the World Cup final four years earlier and I could pass on the lessons I had learned about preparation and tension.\u201d</p> <p>That squad shredded the stereotype of the South African player. They were the opposite of unimaginative hulks who clobbered anyone who got in their way but could be outsmarted by more thoughtful opponents. Jones told me often that only his Brumbies team, who won the Super 12 in 2001 and included the Wallabies George Gregan, Stephen Larkham and Rod Kafer, could rival the 2007 Boks as the most intelligent squad he has coached.</p> <p>Jones is under no illusions while preparing England for the final on Saturday. Rassie Erasmus, the Springbok head coach, \u201cis canny and very bright. He\u2019s a real thinker\u201d. Jones knows he will have to work hard to outwit Erasmus \u2013 while also steeling his players for a massive physical assault.</p> <p>Over the years he has had his share of scrapes with the Springboks. In August 2003, after his Wallabies had beaten South Africa by 20 points in Brisbane, Jones called the Springboks \u201ca disgrace to international rugby\u201d. Botha, the great lock whom Jones coached four years later, was banned for eight weeks for foul play while the prop Robbie Kempson was suspended for a month after a high tackle.</p> <p>Jones was incandescent: \u201cIt\u2019s a deliberate tactic from the Springboks and it puts a slur on the game. They need to have a good look at themselves, because that sort of rubbish should not go on.\u201d</p> <p>Yet 2007 bolstered his innate respect for South African rugby culture. He spoke openly to me, a South African, about his affection for the country and Springbok rugby. \u201cFor me, the two greatest rugby nations in the world are New Zealand and South Africa. As an Australian I\u2019m never going to be given the opportunity to coach in New Zealand and so when I got the chance in 2015 to take over the Stormers, in a city as beautiful as Cape Town, I was excited. There is so much raw talent in South Africa, especially in the Cape with a blend of black and white players. I was flying after my first session with the Stormers.\u201d</p> <p>At that point Ian Ritchie, the Rugby Football Union chief executive at the time, arrived in Cape Town to persuade Jones to leave the Stormers. After England\u2019s disastrous home World Cup, and with Jones having just used his inside knowledge of South Africa to inspire Japan to a famous victory over the Springboks, Ritchie was desperate to secure the Australian as England\u2019s new head coach.</p> <p>\u201cI was very happy in Cape Town but the England job was intriguing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIan and I met at a fancy hotel on the Waterfront. We were in a room with a beautiful view of Table Mountain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI made a joke when Ian asked if I was interested in coaching England. I said: \u2018Well, mate, who wants to swap Cape Town for London?\u2019 But the England job was too big a challenge to turn down. Leaving South Africa, and the Stormers, was still hard.\u201d</p> <p>Four years later, as Jones leads England into the World Cup final he always told me they would reach, it seems fitting that the opposition should be South Africa. He has already won the tournament with the Springboks and masterminded the greatest shock in World Cup history through an intricate game plan that enabled Japan to beat South Africa in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always brutal against the Springboks,\u201d he once told me. \u201cBut they\u2019re smarter than you think and I never underestimate them. I also know that coaching South Africa is the hardest job in world rugby. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/08/rugby-rainbow-nation-2023-world-cup-south-africa-springboks\" title=\"\">politics are complicated</a>. But, under Rassie, the development programme is working and they\u2019ve got many outstanding black players there on merit. They will get stronger and stronger. But it\u2019s my job now to make sure England are always a step ahead of South Africa. They\u2019re a great rugby country \u2013 but I always want to beat them.\u201d</p> <p><em>My Life and Rugby by Eddie Jones, with Donald McRae, is published on 21 November by Macmillan</em></p>",

As an Australian I\u2019m never going to be given the opportunity to coach in New Zealand and so when I got the chance in 2015 to take over the Stormers, in a city as beautiful as Cape Town, I was excited. There is so much raw talent in South Africa, especially in the Cape with a blend of black and white players. I was flying after my first session with the Stormers.\u201d At that point Ian Ritchie, the Rugby Football Union chief executive at the time, arrived in Cape Town to persuade Jones to leave the Stormers. After England\u2019s disastrous home World Cup, and with Jones having just used his inside knowledge of South Africa to inspire Japan to a famous victory over the Springboks, Ritchie was desperate to secure the Australian as England\u2019s new head coach. \u201cI was very happy in Cape Town but the England job was intriguing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIan and I met at a fancy hotel on the Waterfront. We were in a room with a beautiful view of Table Mountain. \u201cI made a joke when Ian asked if I was interested in coaching England. I said: \u2018Well, mate, who wants to swap Cape Town for London?\u2019 But the England job was too big a challenge to turn down. Leaving South Africa, and the Stormers, was still hard.\u201d Four years later, as Jones leads England into the World Cup final he always told me they would reach, it seems fitting that the opposition should be South Africa. He has already won the tournament with the Springboks and masterminded the greatest shock in World Cup history through an intricate game plan that enabled Japan to beat South Africa in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s always brutal against the Springboks,\u201d he once told me. \u201cBut they\u2019re smarter than you think and I never underestimate them. I also know that coaching South Africa is the hardest job in world rugby. The politics are complicated. But, under Rassie, the development programme is working and they\u2019ve got many outstanding black players there on merit. They will get stronger and stronger. But it\u2019s my job now to make sure England are always a step ahead of South Africa. They\u2019re a great rugby country \u2013 but I always want to beat them.\u201d My Life and Rugby by Eddie Jones, with Donald McRae, is published on 21 November by Macmillan",

That led to New Balance filing papers in a last-ditch attempt to block a Liverpool-Nike kit deal but has been dismissed, paving the way for Liverpool to sign a five-year contract with Nike from the start of next season.",

Eamonn Harrison, 22, appeared in court in Dublin on Friday to face 41 charges, including 39 manslaughter charges, conspiracy to commit human trafficking and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, after the endorsement of a European arrest warrant. UK authorities suspect he delivered the trailer to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge before its onward journey to England. CCTV taken at a truck stop in Veurne, Belgium, showed Harrison to be the driver of the lorry that later deposited the trailer at Zeebrugge, DS Jim Kirwan of the garda\u2019s extradition unit told the court. Harrison, from Mayobridge in County Down, will face an extradition hearing later this month. He was arrested at Dublin port last Saturday after taking a ferry from France.

Maurice \u201cMo\u201d Robinson, 25, another Northern Ireland haulier who collected the trailer from Purfleet in Essex, was charged on Monday with similar offences. The news came as police in Vietnam arrested two people on Friday on suspicion of involvement in the deaths. Ha Tinh police also summoned others for questioning as part of an investigation into human trafficking. Essex police, earlier on Friday, appealed to two Irish brothers wanted in connection with the deaths to turn themselves in. DCI Daniel Stoten told a press conference in Belfast that Ronan and Christopher Hughes should come forward to face questioning over suspected manslaughter and people trafficking. Stoten also confirmed that police recently spoke by phone with Ronan Hughes but that his whereabouts were not known since the victims\u2019 bodies were discovered in the back of a lorry in Essex on 23 October. \u201cToday I want to make a direct appeal: Ronan and Christopher, hand yourselves in to the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

Five other people from the island of Ireland have been arrested in connection with the tragedy. Robinson, 25, who drove the lorry container in which the eight women and 31 men were found, was charged on Monday with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering. Prosecutors allege he was part of a global ring of traffickers. Ronan Hughes rented the lorry container and is believed to have hired Robinson to collect it from Purfleet, where it arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge. Earlier this week, it was reported that Hughes phoned police soon after the discovery of the bodies and said Robinson was unaware of the clandestine human cargo.

The shooting happened in a house in Orinda, Contra Costa county. The homeowner had been told the renter would use the house for a family reunion of 12 people but about 100 showed up to the party.

He was a principal of a Catholic school in a small town, living hours away from his family and under enormous stress. It was a frightening moment for the couple, and although it turned out to be an acute anxiety attack, they knew they had to take a break. They\u2019d spent time in Bali and so they decided to get away from it all.</p> <p>But while they were away, Anthony had a horrifying recollection. During the meditational practice, memories of being abused as a small child came flooding back to him. He chokes up as he tells the story, his pain still evident today. \u201cIt was a massive shock to realise the abuse had happened, because it was a Catholic priest. We were a very religious family, and we didn\u2019t think anything like that could happen,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt really strange that I couldn\u2019t believe that my subconscious had kept that suppressed so much.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses to clear his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s been times that I\u2019ve been in the absolute depths of despair [and] Elle has been there, and it\u2019s given me the courage to get up and go again, because ultimately I had to do something about it myself \u2026 The love from Elle and the kids has helped that a lot. You really lose a lot of your identity, I\u2019ve associated my identity for 48 years as being a Catholic, and to be able to come to that and still have the relationship that we have has been pretty eye opening.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66b5811b1ee06d10f7e3bce33129ff53c6b6bdb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66b5811b1ee06d10f7e3bce33129ff53c6b6bdb8/0_69_960_699/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony and Danielle Hayes have built a home in Bali\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony and Danielle Hayes have built a home in Bali.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danielle &amp; Anthony Hayes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After that initial recollection, more memories resurfaced, and the family pulled together to deal with the trauma. Anthony left his position and then, after a few years, with both children at university, the couple decided to move to Bali permanently, where they now live. \u201cBali for us had always been really healing, and it was actually a very healing place for me personally,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cAnd, it just seemed to be another one of those risks that I didn\u2019t really want to take but I think that Elle saw the opportunities here, and it\u2019s been pretty amazing. It\u2019s deepened our relationship even more, [even though] we\u2019ve had some really tough times while we\u2019ve been here, missing the kids, and missing family.\u201d</p> <p>Initially they taught in local schools but now they have set up a business together leading retreats and workshops on conscious parenting and creating conscious relationships. They\u2019re excited by the opportunities but they know to keep work and family life separate.

It is the leading cause of death for young adults, and suicide rates in Indigenous communities are more than double the rest of the community. This picture has been static for a decade. Some people with mental illness are plagued with suicidal ideations, and for some that ends in tragedy, but as Scott Morrison\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, told me earlier this year, a substantial proportion of people who take their lives in Australia never present to clinicians with depression or another illness. So the paths leading to the ultimate end point are different, but here\u2019s something we know: up to 25% of people who attempt to take their own lives will try again, and the risk of relapse is significantly higher during the first three months following discharge from hospital after an attempt.

      "bodyText": "The terrifying triumph of the film Jaws was how its opening scene unfolded without a glimpse of the shark. Thrashing, screaming, spluttering. And the fear of a killer lurking beneath that has lingered in swimmers\u2019 minds for decades. Shark attacks remain exceptionally rare. But when one occurs off Australia\u2019s coast, the reaction is often hysteria, as dramatic and phoney as when the fake shark finally did raise its head. \u201cWhat will it take for government, tourism and council leaders to stand up to greenies who are turning the turquoise waters of the Great Barrier Reef blood red?\u201d wrote Courier-Mail columnist Peter Gleeson after two British men were bitten during a boat tour of the Whitsundays in north Queensland. The newspaper\u2019s front page, in line with coverage in most Australian news outlets, directly linked the attack to the removal of drum lines \u2013 lethal baited traps \u2013 from the Great Barrier Reef marine park after a tribunal decision a few months earlier. A small but consequential detail: the Queensland lethal shark control program has never been run in the Whitsundays. The nearest beach to ever have regular drum lines installed is 110km to the south, at Mackay. Another fact: this week\u2019s attack took place at an ocean site almost 30km from the mainland, where drum lines are not designed to work. And another: experts say there is no scientific evidence the baits prevent or reduce attacks. \u201cHuman life comes first,\u201d says George Roff, an ecology professor from the University of Queensland. \u201cBut shark control has become a wedge issue, a greenies versus common sense issue. \u201cThat is based on an assumption that culling works ... this understanding that if you kill sharks, then people will be safer. It\u2019s a largely untested assumption and with the advent of modern technology there are smarter ways of keeping beachgoers safe.\u201d Roff experienced the thin end of that wedge last year, after he authored a study about declining shark numbers in Queensland. \u201cWe found 70% to 90% declines in the abundance of sharks caught off the coastline. The media polarised the debate as valuing shark populations over human life.\u201d On Channel Nine\u2019s Today program to talk about the research, Roff found himself speaking in front of a superimposed footage of shark attack victims. \u2018He thought his mate grabbed him by the leg\u2019 On a clear day looking out to sea from Airlie Beach, there are shadows on the horizon. The Whitsunday Islands \u2013 a collection of white-sand resorts and nature reserves set among coral reefs \u2013 are the peaks of drowned mountains that went under at the end of the last ice age. The mainland hub at Airlie is the jumping-off point for the jumble of islands; for snorkelling and sightseeing charters, and for \u201cbareboating\u201d, where tourists pilot their own vessel into the ocean. The area provides an experience of Australia that international tourists crave. And in the past year, everything they also fear. The most recent shark attack victims, Britons Alistair Raddon, 28, and his friend Danny Maggs, 22, were on a snorkelling trip. Raddon had his foot bitten off by a shark at Hook Passage, which is about 30km from the mainland. A crewman on the rescue helicopter, Grant Bollington, told the ABC the two men had been play-fighting in the water. \u201c[Raddon] thought his mate grabbed him by the leg really hard, turned around and saw there was blood in the water and realised he was getting bitten by a shark,\u201d Bollington said. The incident followed a series of four attacks at a nearby spot in the Whitsundays, Cid Harbour, last Australian summer that had authorities scrambling to respond. In the aftermath of the first reported attack in September, Queensland fisheries authorities installed drum lines in the Cid Harbour, despite knowing they were ineffective in remote areas where there are few swimmers. Emails released under freedom of information laws show how the state\u2019s panicked response to install drum lines appeared driven by a fear of media criticism. The Queensland Fisheries executive director, Claire Anderson, wrote to her colleagues: \u201cThere was another shark incident in the location 10 days ago. A local boatie was bitten but strapped himself up and took himself off to the hospital. \u201cThere are comments on social media about it, so it will likely be picked up by the media. This reinforces the need to get some drum lines in the location as quickly as possible.\u201d The drum lines killed several tiger sharks, but were removed after a few weeks in early October. In November, Melbourne medical researcher, Daniel Christidis was killed at the same location. Eventually authorities acknowledged that Cid Harbour, where they had observed large numbers of sharks, would be be better managed by educating tourists about shark safety and signs advising people it was not safe to swim. A no-go zone Locals who know Cid Harbour say it is a popular and safe mooring spot for bareboaters, but known as a \u201cno-go zone\u201d for swimming, because of its murky waters and regular sightings of sharks. Marine scientists say drum lines cannot make any place safe; particularly in the Whitsundays, where incidents have occurred far from port. The result can be people failing to act safely, because they misunderstand measures referred to as \u201cshark protection\u201d. \u201cTraditional drum lines give a false sense of safety,\u201d says Jonathan Clarke, the Queensland coordinator of the apex harmony campaign for Sea Shepherd Australia. \u201cThey play into that mindset there\u2019s a big scary thing out there, that government needs to do something to save somebody.\u201d Before exclusion zones were placed around drum lines, Clarke said he and others had surveyed them up and down the Queensland coast. They found a shocking number were left not baited. \u201cOne day we found three of 54 drum lines at Townsville were baited. One day in Mackay, 100% of those drum lines did not have any bait.

The eastern curlew is the largest of more than 100 shorebirds that traverse the globe every year. They travel on one of nine invisible flyways that converge in the Arctic region.

      "bodyText": "The ascent is vertical. Up, up and into the jet stream. If the conditions are not right up there it will come back down and wait. But if there is a good tailwind in the right direction it will begin an epic journey that will take it around the curvature of the Earth; from the Arctic Circle to the southern hemisphere. Using the sun and stars as a compass, and navigating by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, recognising landmarks, the far eastern curlew will fly nonstop to the Yellow Sea, where it fuels up on the mudflats of north-east China. Then it will fly through days and nights across oceans to reach the Australian coastline, an exhausted wreck of a bird that is down to skin and bones. An endurance athlete of the animal kingdom, an aerodynamic wonder, a bird that flies 30,000km a year, flapping its wings all the way because it can\u2019t or soar or glide, the eastern curlew is a phenomenon of the natural world. It is also critically endangered. It has lost 80% of its population in the past 30 years. We don\u2019t always see what is right in front of us. Tidal mudflats seem featureless, aesthetically disappointing, empty space, devoid of glossy breaking waves. But hidden beneath the mud they are fully functioning ecosystems of hundreds of species of invertebrates, crabs, shellfish and worms. Were it not for its preposterously long curving protuberance of a beak, you might not notice the brown speckled bird with that beak deep in the mud, feeding. The eastern curlew is the largest of more than 100 shorebirds that traverse the globe every year. They travel on one of nine invisible flyways that converge in the Arctic region. It is sometimes called the moonbird because if it lasts its 20-year lifespan it would have flown the distance between the Earth and the moon. Now, if a proposed development goes ahead on the mudflats at Toondah Harbour in Brisbane, the eastern curlew will, after flying 12,000km, arrive to find part of its habitat for six months each year taken over by a $1.4bn, 42-hectare marina and 3,500 apartment complex. Toondah is part of Moreton Bay, which is listed under the Ramsar convention on wetlands \u2013 an international treaty that protects important wetlands around the world. As well as 50,000 waterbirds, including 30 migratory species, it is the habitat of dugongs and turtles. For tens of thousands of years the eastern curlew has travelled on the east Asian-Australasian flyway to get here. Along with 55 other migratory species it passes through 22 countries along the way. The flyways \u2013 super highways \u2013 take birds to Africa, Europe, the Americas. Says Randall Wood, a director who is travelling and researching Flyways, a film about globally migrating shorebirds: \u201cThe birds link all those countries. It is a beautiful story of resilience, endurance and versatility.\u201d The world record for marathon flying is now held by the smaller bar-tailed godwit, which has been tracked travelling 11,000km from Alaska to New Zealand at an average of 50km/h, in a big arc and without stopping, in only eight days. \u201cFuel is stored in the body as fat,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThey use a combination of fat and animo acid drawn from muscle depletion, so they are literally digesting their muscles on route. What [scientists] are not sure about is how they are able to fly as far as they do with the fuel that they have got. The math doesn\u2019t add up. It is known that the eastern curlew shrivels organs like its reproductive system, which it doesn\u2019t use while flying, to almost nothing to save a few grams of weight. Harry Saddler, who wrote the book The Eastern Curlew, says: \u201cBefore they leave they will feed frantically and put on 80% of their bodyweight again in fat. When they are getting ready to fly they are like balloons that are bursting and you wonder how they can get off the ground.\u201d Migrating birds\u2019 ability to predict long-term weather forecasts, says Wood, \u201cis better than the very, very best computer models we have got. They can tell months out when a storm is going to come. They will actually time their departures to literally slingshot themselves out to sea on the tail of a storm and propel themselves across oceans.\u201d A whimbrel, says Amanda Lilleyman, a research associate at Charles Darwin University, was \u201ctracked moving 200km out of the way of the eye of the cyclone before the cyclone hit\u201d. As eastern curlews get ready to leave for their breeding grounds in Siberia in April, their plumage change. \u201cThey get these fresh flight feathers to take them back up north,\u201d says Lilleyman. They will also be growing brighter feathers to attract mates. Having gone to all the trouble of the energy-intensive migration to Siberia, says Saddler, \u201cThey get straight down to business because they are only there for six weeks. The male tries to impress the female by doing 15-metre-high flights while calling the whole time.\u201d The chicks feed themselves from the moment they are hatched and are start their first migration at six weeks. It is what they face on their migration that gives us the bird\u2019s eye view of the world we have created. \u201cMany scientists call the eastern curlew a sentinel species,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThey are telling us about the state of the world globally in ways that many other species just aren\u2019t. \u201cShorebirds face a perfect storm.

It is this frustration that has led to developments such as Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and rise of the far right.</p> <p>The unifying characteristic of this distrust and discontent around the world? Powerlessness. \u201cPeople increasingly feel like things are getting harder for them and the people they care about, and they can\u2019t think of a way to change that,\u201d Stears says.</p> <p>\u201cThey feel a sense of frustration that despite all their personal effort, they can\u2019t make it better. I think that\u2019s causing a lot of the rage. It is a global phenomenon of people saying politics as normal are not responding to our needs. We need to try something else.\u201d</p> <p>In western Sydney, ethnically diverse and lower socio-economic communities are feeling that discontent. Thuy Nguyen, of the Sydney Alliance, a coalition of diverse communities, says that individuals in the region have no faith in politicians, and feel their concerns are neither heard nor understood.</p> <p>\u201cWestern Sydney feels like the periphery,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like we are on the margins of the centre where people actually have the power and agency to change their lot in life. I think there is some anger.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you feel that anger and you feel alone, that\u2019s when you look to someone on the TV, the strongman to solve your problem. But if you are able in public to tell the stories of your private pain, and someone next to you says \u2018I\u2019ve experienced the same thing\u2019, and to do that across diverse groups, it\u2019s a recognition that all of us are experiencing the same injustices. And we can\u2019t blame each other. That\u2019s the antidote to that rage.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The solution to powerlessness is to find power\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Nguyen, like many meeting at the Sydney Policy Lab, is facilitating community resistance and activism to intractable problems such as a lack of affordable housing, energy, and a labour market in which, for many people, work is becoming increasingly insecure and low-paid. \u201cPeople have woken up to the fact that the solution to powerlessness is to find more power,\u201d Stears says.</p> <p>Here are three examples of global communities finding their power:</p> <p><strong>ENERGY: Voices for Power, Sydney</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"afc1a91fe193f0c0bf8a70c6115669d9c96319d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afc1a91fe193f0c0bf8a70c6115669d9c96319d2/25_62_190_235/190.jpg\" alt=\"Thuy Nguyen of Sydney Alliance\" width=\"190\" height=\"235\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thuy Nguyen of Sydney Alliance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sydney Policy Lab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nguyen leads the Voices for Power campaign that brings together seven different community groups in western Sydney around the issue of access to affordable, sustainable power.

      "bodyText": "Marc Stears is congenial as he lays out some of the critical threats to liberal democracy in the 21st century. \u201cNormal people have had enough,\u201d he says, and our politicians are complacent. \u201cIt\u2019s a gigantic mistake, because the more distrust grows, the more dangerous it becomes.\u201d The director of Sydney University\u2019s Sydney Policy Lab is taking time out during a weeklong meeting of activists, researchers and community leaders from around the world to discuss how to affect change. The group gathers in a week where yet another multibillion-dollar company admits to large-scale underpayment of workers, as numerous Australians face a potentially blistering summer unsure of how they\u2019ll afford to pay their energy bills, people from Hong Kong to Latin America take to their streets against their regimes, and against a backdrop of record low trust not only in politicians in Australia but in democracy itself. \u201cLiberal democratic states depend on parties being responsive to the population, and largely speaking for the 20th century that was structured around class lines,\u201d Stears says. \u201cNow all sorts of things are fractured and parties here [in Australia] no longer reflect those stable social compositions, but nevertheless they carry on as if they did.\u201d People do not see their concerns or experiences reflected in debate from Madrid to Washington to Canberra, he says, and that is breeding a deep dissatisfaction with the prevailing political order. It is this frustration that has led to developments such as Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and rise of the far right. The unifying characteristic of this distrust and discontent around the world? Powerlessness. \u201cPeople increasingly feel like things are getting harder for them and the people they care about, and they can\u2019t think of a way to change that,\u201d Stears says. \u201cThey feel a sense of frustration that despite all their personal effort, they can\u2019t make it better. I think that\u2019s causing a lot of the rage. It is a global phenomenon of people saying politics as normal are not responding to our needs. We need to try something else.\u201d In western Sydney, ethnically diverse and lower socio-economic communities are feeling that discontent. Thuy Nguyen, of the Sydney Alliance, a coalition of diverse communities, says that individuals in the region have no faith in politicians, and feel their concerns are neither heard nor understood. \u201cWestern Sydney feels like the periphery,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels like we are on the margins of the centre where people actually have the power and agency to change their lot in life. I think there is some anger. \u201cWhen you feel that anger and you feel alone, that\u2019s when you look to someone on the TV, the strongman to solve your problem. But if you are able in public to tell the stories of your private pain, and someone next to you says \u2018I\u2019ve experienced the same thing\u2019, and to do that across diverse groups, it\u2019s a recognition that all of us are experiencing the same injustices. And we can\u2019t blame each other. That\u2019s the antidote to that rage.\u201d \u2018The solution to powerlessness is to find power\u2019 Nguyen, like many meeting at the Sydney Policy Lab, is facilitating community resistance and activism to intractable problems such as a lack of affordable housing, energy, and a labour market in which, for many people, work is becoming increasingly insecure and low-paid. \u201cPeople have woken up to the fact that the solution to powerlessness is to find more power,\u201d Stears says. Here are three examples of global communities finding their power: ENERGY: Voices for Power, Sydney Nguyen leads the Voices for Power campaign that brings together seven different community groups in western Sydney around the issue of access to affordable, sustainable power. Working with each community within that group\u2019s language and culture, they then convene leaders who set agendas for lobbying for things such as better energy-efficiency standards in rental accommodation and help these often disempowered communities to navigate the energy market. \u201cEvery time we meet a political leader, we show up in power \u2026 That\u2019s 14, up to 20 community leaders meeting the politician in a room,\u201d Nguyen says. \u201cThey\u2019re diverse, they\u2019re well organised, they\u2019ve got an agenda they\u2019ve agreed on. Politicians are not used to meeting these constituents.\u201d HOUSING: Reclaim the City, Cape Town In Cape Town a physical segregation of white and black continues, with black South Africans relegated to under-serviced and distant townships, says Nkosikhona Swartbooi of Ndifuna Ukwazi, which supports Reclaim the City. Facing the sale of public land to private developers in the centre of the city, Reclaim the City uses litigation and direct-action occupation of public buildings to demand social housing in central Cape Town, enabling black people to live in the city in which they work. They have so far managed to get 11 sites in the city released for public housing. \u201cThe principle is \u2018public land for public good\u2019,\u201d Swartbooi says. \u201cYou must realise land for its social value, as opposed to commodifying land and housing, therefore perpetuating the spatial inequality that you see in Cape Town.\u201d WAGES: Living Wage Campaign, London Since the beginning of the Living Wage Campaign in 2001, more than 1bn pounds (A$1.9bn) in extra wages has been secured for low-paid workers. Starting in London with a coalition of unions, faith groups and educational institutions, Stefan Baskerville, now of the UK\u2019s New Economics Foundation, says the success of the campaign was due to broad-base coalition, willingness to confront employers not paying workers enough to live on, and then making allies of those which reformed. But there was also something more fundamental about the campaign. \u201cThere was a simplicity and a moral clarity to the demand,\u201d he says. \u201cHow can it be right that you sit at the top of an organisation, and the person who cleans the carpet under your feet doesn\u2019t have enough to live on?\u201d \u2018NGOs are not the messiah\u2019 The shape of modern-day activism and community organisation is not necessarily flat and leaderless.

But \u201cthe race that stops the nation\u201d had loftier goals, embedding itself in the national identity.</p> <h2>\u2018A particular version of Australian-ness\u2019</h2> <p>The Melbourne Cup was first run in 1861 to a crowd of 4,000 people. Two horses died. It was a handicap race with a broad field and sneered at by the self-appointed arbiters of the Australian Jockey Club, whose premier event, the Sydney Derby, was a fixed-weight race designed to identify the best three-year-old colt in any given year.</p> <p>The Melbourne Cup, by contrast, was anyone\u2019s game. Good horses were made to carry a substantial amount of extra weight, while the bottom end of the field, carrying the lightest weights and the longest odds, had a better chance.</p> <p>It suited the high-risk, high-reward culture of Victoria at the tail end of the gold rush, says historian Richard Waterhouse (no relation to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/09/gai-waterhouse-melbourne-cup-win-reputation\">Waterhouse racing dynasty</a>).</p> <p>\u201cYou could make huge amounts of money and then you could lose huge amounts of money, and the Melbourne Cup reflected that ethos,\u201d he says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t mean the best horse won.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a tension between those who love the horses and the necessity to be absolutely brutal in the way you conduct your business.</p> <footer> <cite>Historian Richard Waterhouse</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That made it more popular with the public than a breeder\u2019s race, says racing historian Wayne Peake, who says the handicap format appealed to Australia\u2019s egalitarian values.</p> <p>Paired with the other pillars of colonial Australian entertainment \u2013 gambling and drinking \u2013 it soon became the highlight of the social calendar.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that at the Melbourne Cup, you could win a lot of money for a small outlay obviously popularised it with the people,\u201d Peake says. \u201c[It] took the racing into very much a gaming proposition, not just a matter for the squattocracy to race against each other for small stakes in set weight races.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the 19th century, a quarter of Melbourne watched the race. In 1895, Mark Twain visited Melbourne and reported himself overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cNowhere in the world have I encountered a festival of people that has such a magnificent appeal to the whole nation,\u201d Twain wrote. \u201cThe Cup astonishes me.\u201d</p> <p>In 1930, Phar Lap arrived at the track under police guard following a suspected assassination attempt.

      "bodyText": "The risk of elevating a horse race from a niche sporting event to a national symbol is that, when the nation changes, so too must the event. This is the challenge facing the organisers of the Melbourne Cup, who are torn between upholding the traditions of an inherently conservative sport and attempting to maintain their hold on the public consciousness despite pockets of outrage and a growing sense of indifference. Recent footage of racehorses ending their careers at the slaughterhouse may prove a tipping point for what has become an event that some now see as no less outdated and exploitative as a circus with elephants. University of Sydney professor Carole Cusack, who wrote in 2009 that attending the Melbourne Cup at Flemington was one of Australia\u2019s secular pilgrimages, said she once considered the first Tuesday in November to be the one \u201crelatively unproblematic\u201d entry in Australia\u2019s triptych of national days, which includes Australia Day and Anzac Day. Increasing concern about the welfare of retired horses and a string of deaths on the track \u2013 six horses have died during or as a result of the Melbourne Cup since 2013 \u2013 have changed that. \u201cIt is no longer relatively unproblematic,\u201d Cusack said. Anecdotal evidence suggests the tide may be turning among a broader public. Dozens of people Guardian Australia spoke to \u2013 many previously neutral or mildly positive towards the race \u2013 say they plan to boycott the office sweep this year. Others say they were already appalled by the cultural cringe of seeing dozens of well-dressed adults vomiting into port-a-loos at 2pm, describing the spectacle of horse racing as both insufferably stuffy and unbearably gauche. Some who have attended a spring carnival event in Melbourne as a way to see friends each year say they will not return until the industry submits to independent, robust regulation, rather than opaque industry-led promises to ensure spent thoroughbreds are retired to new homes. They have asked how to balance their growing unease with the memory of their teetotaling grandmother placing a bet each way for her grandchildren. \u201cShould I tell my dying father, keen to make a few lasting memories with his family that I could no longer support the sport, or should I just humour him and my mother?\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cHow could I be true to my need to support ethical treatment of animals yet respect my family\u2019s traditions?\u201d The headline act, Taylor Swift, pulled out in September following a campaign by fans urging her not to support it for animal welfare reasons, to be replaced by 2004 Australian Idol runner-up Anthony Callea. Callea has pledged to donate his performance fee to a horse welfare charity. Supermodel Megan Gale, a fixture of the cup carnival for the past decade and brand ambassador for the race\u2019s major sponsor, Lexus, says she won\u2019t attend because of animal cruelty concerns. Some companies have cancelled their annual Melbourne Cup lunch. Even the bookies are worried, reportedly saying it will be \u201ctoo hard to make money this year\u201d with betters more interested in other sports. If the Melbourne Cup were just a horse race, it would not generate this level of national angst. But \u201cthe race that stops the nation\u201d had loftier goals, embedding itself in the national identity. \u2018A particular version of Australian-ness\u2019 The Melbourne Cup was first run in 1861 to a crowd of 4,000 people. Two horses died. It was a handicap race with a broad field and sneered at by the self-appointed arbiters of the Australian Jockey Club, whose premier event, the Sydney Derby, was a fixed-weight race designed to identify the best three-year-old colt in any given year. The Melbourne Cup, by contrast, was anyone\u2019s game. Good horses were made to carry a substantial amount of extra weight, while the bottom end of the field, carrying the lightest weights and the longest odds, had a better chance. It suited the high-risk, high-reward culture of Victoria at the tail end of the gold rush, says historian Richard Waterhouse (no relation to the Waterhouse racing dynasty). \u201cYou could make huge amounts of money and then you could lose huge amounts of money, and the Melbourne Cup reflected that ethos,\u201d he says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t mean the best horse won.\u201d That made it more popular with the public than a breeder\u2019s race, says racing historian Wayne Peake, who says the handicap format appealed to Australia\u2019s egalitarian values. Paired with the other pillars of colonial Australian entertainment \u2013 gambling and drinking \u2013 it soon became the highlight of the social calendar. \u201cThe fact that at the Melbourne Cup, you could win a lot of money for a small outlay obviously popularised it with the people,\u201d Peake says. \u201c[It] took the racing into very much a gaming proposition, not just a matter for the squattocracy to race against each other for small stakes in set weight races.\u201d By the end of the 19th century, a quarter of Melbourne watched the race. In 1895, Mark Twain visited Melbourne and reported himself overwhelmed. \u201cNowhere in the world have I encountered a festival of people that has such a magnificent appeal to the whole nation,\u201d Twain wrote. \u201cThe Cup astonishes me.\u201d In 1930, Phar Lap arrived at the track under police guard following a suspected assassination attempt. His death from arsenic poisoning in the United States in 1932 turned the animal celebrity into something resembling a deity, his remains split between three museums. More than 540,000 visited his body at the Melbourne museum last year. The cup came to represent \u201ca certain kind of Australian-ness\u201d, says Prof Fiona Nicoll, a gambling policy expert who has researched the Melbourne Cup. It was an \u201cAustralian-ness\u201d defined in the era of the White Australia policy, Nicoll says. Racing played into both the celebration of Anglo-Saxon heritage and broader narratives around purity of blood, which were used to justify the removal of Indigenous children. It was \u201ca story about Australia that doesn\u2019t take account of the people who were here before the whites came and also doesn\u2019t stretch out to be particularly inclusive towards the people who came after the white story was established\u201d, Cusack says. Racing\u2019s relevance has decreased with every year since the white Australia policy was abolished in 1966. Increasing multiculturalism, Peake says, is one of the reasons behind its waning popularity. He also attributes it to a push from the Victorian Racing Club to attract more international runners in the cup, suppressing the handicap weights and decreasing the chance of a long-odds Australian-bred horse roaring to victory. But Peake says that to claim racing has reached the end of its social licence is to ignore the work done by the industry, who are \u201call genuine horse lovers,\u201d to improve equine welfare. He says those efforts should receive more publicity. \u201cRacing is strong; racing is resilient,\u201d Peake says. \u201cIt will need to come to terms with some of the shortcomings that have been exposed, but it will. Don\u2019t dismiss horse racing, there\u2019s a lot of people power in horse racing as well as the animal rights activists.\u201d \u2018A ruthless sport\u2019 Waterhouse spent several years at racetracks writing the official history of the Australian Jockey Club, but has not been back since it was published in 1992.

      "bodyText": "Greenhouse gas emissions from diesel cars, utes and vans have risen sharply since 2011, effectively cancelling out the cut in pollution from new renewable energy replacing some coal plants. A surge in ownership of larger diesel vehicles is a central reason emissions from transport leapt by more than 10% over the decade, according to the monthly emissions audit published by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute. They rose as the federal government considered, promoted and ultimately shelved plans to introduce vehicle emissions standards to address the issue. Report author Hugh Saddler, an energy expert and honorary associate professor with the Australian National University\u2019s Crawford School of Public Policy, found annual carbon dioxide emissions from burning diesel increased by 21.7m tonnes between 2011 and 2018. Diesel vehicles \u2013 mostly utes \u2013 have doubled their share of the light commercial vehicle market, and from a lower base tripled their share of household passenger car sales. Emissions from electricity fell by 22.1m tonnes a year over the same period. Saddler said the increase in diesel use was one of the reasons there had been a year-on-year rise in national emissions since 2015. He said governments and industry had improved fuel efficiency of heavy road freight vehicles but done little to lift the efficiency of light vehicles such as the work ute or family car, with the issue \u201cplaced in the purgatory of a ministerial forum for the last five years\u201d. \u201cFocusing purely on reducing electricity emissions while failing to recognise the importance of transport emissions is taking two steps forward, one step back,\u201d he said. Saddler said there had been a dip in retail diesel sales over the past six months but it was too early to tell what caused it. The ministerial forum on vehicle emissions was set up by the Turnbull government in 2015. In 2017, interest groups were sent a model proposing a standard of 105g of carbon dioxide per kilometre for Australian light vehicles, phased in from 2020 to 2025. The Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development estimated the resulting fuel savings would deliver a net benefit to the economy by 2040 of $13.9bn. The owner of an average petrol car was expected to save $519 a year. Josh Frydenberg, then the environment and energy minister, now the Treasurer, said reforms to Australia\u2019s fuel efficiency, fuel quality and noxious emissions standards had the potential to deliver real benefits, and pointed out that 80% of the global vehicle passenger fleet was subject to fuel efficiency standards. But the proposal was shelved after internal opposition and criticism from the automotive lobby. Labor adopted a similar policy before this year\u2019s federal election, promising 50% of new car sales would be electric by 2030. Scott Morrison responded by accusing the opposition of wanting to \u201cend the weekend\u201d by forcing people out of four-wheel drives. A spokeswoman for the Michael McCormack, the minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, said the government\u2019s goal was to encourage cleaner and more efficient vehicles without burdening Australian families. She pointed to a February announcement that it would develop a national electric vehicle strategy \u201cto plan and manage the transition to new vehicle technologies and infrastructure\u201d. \u201cThe Liberal and Nationals government\u2019s policy is clear: we will not introduce a mandatory fuel efficiency standard that can drive up the price of cars for Australians,\u201d she said. Saddler said based on the evidence there was \u201cabsolutely no reason\u201d not to introduce vehicle emissions standards. \u201cIt\u2019s a failure of political will,\u201d he said. Most countries in the OECD have adopted policies to reduce emissions and improve vehicle efficiency. Saddler said in the 1990s diesel vehicles were viewed as better for the environment than petrol cars but technology evolved and many markets, particularly in Europe, had moved to cleaner alternatives. \u201cThe average diesel vehicle owner travels further than a petrol vehicle owner and many diesel engines have gotten larger, easily undoing the benefit of diesel as a lower CO2 polluting fuel than petrol,\u201d he said. The Australian government has revised down over time the emissions cuts it expects to make from cleaning up cars. In 2015, it produced a graph indicating it expected to achieve a reduction of about 100m tonnes between 2020 and 2030 through vehicle emissions standards. The climate package released earlier this year projected only 10m tonnes of abatement through a yet-to-be-released electric vehicle strategy.",

At issue for many of the demonstrators is rampant corruption and the impunity of a ruling class that has siphoned off huge cuts from state revenues over much of the past 16 years. Other demonstrators, meanwhile, continue to rail at Iran, which has a whip hand in the affairs of Iraq and significant influence over its legislators. Since the US-led invasion, political sectarianism has been entrenched by a system of governance that has demarcated power between majority Shias, Sunnis and Kurds in the country. Shia Iran has developed close links to many Iraqi MPs and broad networks within the central institutions. In addition, military groups loyal to Iran have taken prominent stakes in the affairs of state. Some factions, such as that led by populist cleric Muqtadr al-Sadr, have established a political presence in the country\u2019s parliament and can muster significant influence on lower middle class Shias, many of whom feel aggrieved by a lack of opportunities provided by successive governments. Al-Sadr had earlier threatened to withdraw his support for Abdul Mahdi\u2019s one-year-old administration, a move that would deal it a near fatal blow if he mobilised loyalists at the same time. Another influential Shia cleric, Ayatollah al-Sistani, on Friday appeared to give support to the protests, warning of \u201cchaos and destruction\u201d if security forces continued a violent crackdown that has killed around 250 people since the rallies began, and wounded many hundreds more. Sistani has often been at odds with the conduct of Iraqi officials, and with Iran, whose influence his supporters say often diverges from the country\u2019s interests. The prominent Iranian general Qassem Suleimani played a pivotal role during the week in stabilising Abdul Mahdi. A source close to the Iraqi prime minister revealed he had warned the outspoken cleric to temper his criticism.",

On a high happy, they made the final and were made to work hard for it by Wales which has prepared them for the final.</p> <p>The difference between teams is basically nothing but England may have peaked a week too early. We have not seen the best of this South Africa team. If they click on Saturday, England are in for a torrid time.</p> <p>I shall be watching with my brother as I can scream at his house as his wife is a Springbok supporter. South Africa will have to play it in the forwards with their power and domination of being very physical and in England\u2019s faces. Their backs can also be devastating, especially Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe. If given the chance, Damian De Alande and Pollard can be dangerous. They must just stay calm and focused.\u201d <strong>David Lichtenstein, South Africa</strong></p>",

England are a strong team and are going to make this a tough game. We need to keep as much possession as possible and ensure we don\u2019t drop the ball \u2013 in all senses of the word. Shannon O\u2019Farrell, a South Africa fan in Guildford \u2018We will all be going big with outfits and flags\u2019 It\u2019s been a very exciting World Cup. I\u2019m so glad for Japan. It\u2019s going to be one cracker of a game on Saturday. Both teams are so strong physically. I can\u2019t wait for the final. I\u2019m having a braai (barbecue) at my brother\u2019s house next to the swimming pool and a big TV outside. All four of my brothers will be there and we will be going big with outfits and flags, all the necessary stuff. We will open the first can of beer at 9am, two hours before kick-off. The Springboks need to play wisely with their physicality and dominate England up front. The rest will fall in place. Enjoy the game. May the best team win. Anton Wessels, Johannesburg \u2018If South Africa click, England are in for a torrid time\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m very excited about how South Africa have progressed. The low was losing to New Zealand after camping in their half for 20 minutes and only getting three points for their efforts. On a high happy, they made the final and were made to work hard for it by Wales which has prepared them for the final. The difference between teams is basically nothing but England may have peaked a week too early. We have not seen the best of this South Africa team. If they click on Saturday, England are in for a torrid time. I shall be watching with my brother as I can scream at his house as his wife is a Springbok supporter. South Africa will have to play it in the forwards with their power and domination of being very physical and in England\u2019s faces. Their backs can also be devastating, especially Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe. If given the chance, Damian De Alande and Pollard can be dangerous. They must just stay calm and focused.\u201d David Lichtenstein, South Africa",

      "body": "<p>You can tell you are in another world because there, in that wild universe, the master of the Oxford college is black. (In our world, the first black head of house at Oxford, Lady Amos, <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-08-02-baroness-valerie-amos-appointed-master-university-college\" title=\"\">will take up her new role at University College next August</a>.) This magical world, both like and unlike our own, is that of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials novels, brought to vivid life in a new television adaptation. The first series \u2013 of, it is anticipated, three \u2013 arrives on BBC One in the UK this Sunday, and on HBO in the US on Monday.</p> <p>The series, on the basis of its first episode, shows every sign of being a BBC family drama in the grand old style, with skilful writing, a luxurious cast, and lavish visuals. The story, based on the first novel in the series, Northern Lights, begins with young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/01/how-philip-pullman-lyra-won-the-world\" title=\"\">Lyra</a>, who is growing up (and running wild) in Jordan College. One day, her brusque, mysterious uncle Asriel \u2013 played by James McAvoy \u2013 appears, fresh from a dangerous mission to the far north. Hard on his heels comes the mortally attractive Mrs Coulter, played by Ruth Wilson at her most silky and acidulated. It is wonderful fun, but it is not just that. Pullman\u2019s world is serious and densely layered with allusion. His epic scale, his cosmological purview, is refined from a lifetime immersed in the poetry of Milton and Homer and Blake.

      "bodyText": "You can tell you are in another world because there, in that wild universe, the master of the Oxford college is black. (In our world, the first black head of house at Oxford, Lady Amos, will take up her new role at University College next August.) This magical world, both like and unlike our own, is that of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials novels, brought to vivid life in a new television adaptation. The first series \u2013 of, it is anticipated, three \u2013 arrives on BBC One in the UK this Sunday, and on HBO in the US on Monday. The series, on the basis of its first episode, shows every sign of being a BBC family drama in the grand old style, with skilful writing, a luxurious cast, and lavish visuals. The story, based on the first novel in the series, Northern Lights, begins with young Lyra, who is growing up (and running wild) in Jordan College. One day, her brusque, mysterious uncle Asriel \u2013 played by James McAvoy \u2013 appears, fresh from a dangerous mission to the far north. Hard on his heels comes the mortally attractive Mrs Coulter, played by Ruth Wilson at her most silky and acidulated. It is wonderful fun, but it is not just that. Pullman\u2019s world is serious and densely layered with allusion. His epic scale, his cosmological purview, is refined from a lifetime immersed in the poetry of Milton and Homer and Blake. His novels relating to Lyra \u2013 recently refreshed by a new story, The Secret Commonwealth \u2013 are remarkable literary achievements, readable by children and adults with equal pleasure. In television terms, this is precisely the kind of drama that BBC One was made for \u2013 though it is worth recalling that it is not actually made by the BBC, in the traditional sense, but rather by the companies New Line Cinema and Bad Wolf for the BBC and HBO in a co-production deal, with the latter distributing outside the UK.

      "bodyText": "Magnus Carlsen is in dire trouble and losing in his home city by a huge 1.5-10.5 margin after two disastrous days for Norway\u2019s world No 1 in a world championship final in Oslo which finishes on Saturday. Carlsen is meeting America\u2019s Wesley So in a $125,000 head-to-head for the first official global title in Fischer Random chess, devised by Bobby Fischer 25 years ago. It has 960 possible starting positions of the back row pieces and is fast gaining popularity among elite grandmasters. A mass of opening theory is avoided and there are fewer draws compared with classical chess. After a scrappy draw in the first game, Carlsen\u2019s form dipped alarmingly, recalling the speed games at St Louis in August where he made numerous blunders. Losing three games in a row is almost unheard of in his entire career, and his play deteriorated during the sequence. In his third defeat he began with a bizarre advance of his flank a2 pawn to a6, while So calmly took control of the centre and remained with the advantage throughout. Games at slower speeds count for three points, against two points for fast rapid and one for blitz. Although eight games remain, So\u2019s nine-point lead with just 12 points left on the table should be decisive, but he remains wary: \u201cIt\u2019s Magnus. Had I played against others I would have said that it\u2019s over, but not now. I think he\u2019s going to get into good shape tomorrow and will fight hard.\u201d A year ago Carlsen won an unofficial Fischer Random title match convincingly and he was confident before the start this week: \u201cWhenever there are titles to be won, I want to have them. That\u2019s my general mindset.\u201d His 12.5-7.5 semi-final victory against his old rival Fabiano Caruana seemed to confirm his good form. Carlsen won that match with a day to spare, not needing the four scheduled blitz games. He was specially proud of one win. In a game where the queens started on f1 and f8 with bishops at a1 and h8, Caruana opened 1 g3,which was countered by d5 2 b3 e6 3 Qh3?! g5! 4 Bxh8 Rxh8 5 0-0 h5! Carlsen said later \u201cThis is why we like Fischer Random. You play g5 and h5 and suddenly your position is great.\u201d The final continues online on chess.com/tv and twitch.tv/chess, starting at 4pm on Saturday, where viewers can study Carlsen and So up close with full coverage and move-by-move commentary . England\u2019s team, who won silver at the world championships in March, were again in medal contention this week in the European championships at Batumi, Georgia. In round eight (of nine) England\u2019s chances against the No 1 seeds, Russia, deteriorated in the fourth hour when Luke McShane\u2019s defensive position crumbled under attack from Nikita Vitiugov and the Englishman lost decisive material. But then David Howell drew with Kirill Alekseenko, Gawain Jones recovered from the verge of defeat against Maxim Matlakov while Michael Adams on top board nursed an extra pawn to victory against Dmitry Andreikin, to make the score England 2 Russia 2. Scores after eight rounds were Ukraine and Russia 13, England 12, Armenia, Germany and Croatia 11. So England have a medal chance in Saturday\u2019s final round, which starts early, at 7am in London. Russia\u2019s Daniil Dubov, the world rapid champion and aide to Carlsen in his title match against Caruana, scored the most brilliant win of the Euroteams, and one of the outstanding wins of the year in Russia v Germany when he chased the black king all the way across the board and checkmated it inside the white camp. 3643 (Black moves first) 1 Kb2 Rd5 2 Kc3 Rc5+ 3 Kd4 Nb3 mate.

      "bodyText": "People\u2019s Vote staff are writing to clients of the public relations company run by its chairman, Roland Rudd, to ask if they are comfortable with his involvement in an extraordinary row that has brought the campaign group to a grinding halt. The angry staff members, who are refusing to work under a new chief executive summarily appointed by Rudd, ask whether he has \u201cdemonstrated good PR skills\u201d in a vicious conflict that has coincided with the start of the general election campaign. Finsbury, the leading public relations firm run by the multi-millionaire, specialises in advising FTSE 100 companies and the letter is part of an attempt by the estranged People\u2019s Vote staff to \u201chit him in the wallet\u201d in the escalating dispute. Last weekend Rudd fired the People\u2019s Vote\u2019s chief executive, James McGrory, a former adviser to Nick Clegg, and its director of communications, Tom Baldwin, who used to work with Ed Miliband, prompting a mass walkout by colleagues. People\u2019s Vote has a database of 500,000 emails and 600,000 Facebook contacts and insiders said that it has accumulated a six-figure war chest to be used during the election campaign to continue to call for a second referendum. Insiders complain that the campaign plan has been totally disrupted by the row, to the delight of some Conservatives. One said they had met a former Tory cabinet minister in a Westminster pub this week who said, \u201ccongratulate Roland Rudd for me\u201d. The campaign had planned this week to deliver a mass signature letter to Downing Street and the European parliament, and unveil a tactical voting website advising voters which candidate to support to achieve a second referendum. Rudd\u2019s supporters, however, say that he wants to professionalise the campaign organisation and accuse McGrory and Baldwin of leading \u201ca cult-like walk out.\u201d Some of the estranged staff have begun to return, they said. Some politicians and public figures associated with People\u2019s Vote, which had been behind a string of successful mass rallies in London and around the country, have expressed their dismay as the row has unfolded. Earlier this week, Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s spin doctor and an ally of Baldwin\u2019s, said: \u201cWhile the staff have been busy fighting for a People\u2019s Vote \u2026 Rudd has been engaged close to full time in boardroom politics, a board which with few exceptions has done little for the campaign.\u201d A dossier on Rudd compiled by rebel staff says that he earned \u00a35.9m from Finsbury, as the highest paid director in its company accounts, lives in a \u00a320m Kensington townhouse and has a Georgian mansion in Somerset. It even references using publicly available data an application for planning permission to install a spiral staircase to a wine cellar in his London home. Behind the row is a dispute over the long-term future direction of the campaign, prompting some Labour supporting staff in the group to accuse Rudd of wanting to push the group closer to the Liberal Democrats. They say that Rudd wants to abandon campaigning for a second referendum and instead turn People\u2019s Vote into a pro-remain organisation campaigning for a return to the EU post-Brexit, while they believe the second referendum idea could come back on to the agenda if Labour wins the election or the result is indecisive. But allies of Rudd say that he has no political ambitions and accused Labour figures of wrongly suggesting he wants to push the organisation towards the Lib Dems. \u201cRudd met with key campaign MPs, such as Caroline Lucas, Dominic Grieve and Sam Gyimah this week and they were happy,\u201d a source close to Rudd said. Lucas, however, said that she was very unhappy with Rudd\u2019s manoeuvre and several other MPs who had supported the organisation have raised concerns. Gyimah added subsequently that he was \u201clistening\u201d to the debate but was otherwise uninvolved. The coup was able to take place because Rudd had quietly taken control of Open Britain, the largest of the constituent organisations in the People\u2019s Vote umbrella, using another company called Baybridge \u2013 before moving to fire its two leading employees. They were replaced by Patrick Heneghan, a former head of campaigns for the Labour party, who has been running the organisation with a handful of staff, most of whom are understood to be new recruits. The bulk of the 60 staff in the People\u2019s Vote organisation were employed by Open Britain and hence Baybridge, but they have refused to return to work. \u201cRudd has used the tactics of city boardrooms to take control of the campaign, which means we have to respond in kind,\u201d the staffer added. Staffers are also preparing to send a second letter to the board members of WPP, the advertising and marketing giant that owns Finsbury, asking them whether they feel comfortable with Rudd engaging \u201cin a matter of of great political controversy\u201d, in the hope of further ratcheting up the pressure.",

      "bodyText": "What is at stake in north-east Syria is more than the fate of the Kurdish people or the autonomous homeland of Rojava or even the fight against Isis. What is at stake is humanity\u2019s ability to survive our current civilisational crisis and to imagine new alternatives before it\u2019s too late. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s brutal invasion of Rojava is using 20th-century techniques of extreme violence and genocide, despite a proclaimed \u201cceasefire\u201d. Turkey\u2019s air force is raining down napalm and white phosphorus on innocent civilians. At the same time, jihadi squads are massacring fleeing civilians as retribution for Rojava\u2019s fight against Isis and their role as arguably the most important ally to the west in the region. The US, the UK, France, Russia and other alleged superpowers are actively betraying both international law and the Geneva convention by allowing and facilitating the ethnic cleansing and occupation of Rojava. Turkey\u2019s aim is clear: to eradicate what all fascist powers fear most, a free people daring to create brave and successful experiments outside the globalised, extractive system. Since 2012, around 5 million people \u2013 Kurds, Arabs, Assyrians, Turkmen, Yazidis and others \u2013 have built the autonomous region of Rojava, demonstrating how a multi-ethnic society can respectfully coexist beyond the constraints of nation state, patriarchy and capitalism. By promoting radically democratic and decentralised self-governance, equity between genders, regenerative agriculture, a justice system based on reconciliation and inclusion of minorities, the Rojava experiment has presented a living example of possibility under the most impossible of circumstances. We encourage readers to review the Rojavan Charter of the Social Contract for inspiration. Western leaders are feigning empathy while American, German and British weapon manufacturers are actively selling weapons to Turkey. It is clear that the dominant system cannot and will not defend those seeking to explore other ways of knowing and being. As the imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah \u00d6calan writes: \u201cThe real power of capitalist modernity isn\u2019t its money and its weapons, [but] its ability to suffocate all utopias [\u2026] with its liberalism.\u201d However, a growing chorus of allies are rising up around the world. From Haiti to Lebanon, from Chile to Iraq, from Cameroon to the US, from the UK to Hong Kong, social revolutions are confronting the rise of fascism, short-termism, greed, climate destruction and warfare that are required to prop up our existing economic paradigm. The battle lines are becoming clearer. Domination versus cooperation, colonisation versus autonomy, oppression versus freedom, patriarchy versus partnership \u2013 these values are the warp and weft of the defining struggle for the future of humanity. For Rojava to survive and for justice to truly prevail, those rising up in their local context must stand together creatively with shared voice, values and visions for global systems change. Rojava is fighting for the same reasons as the awakening majority from around the world. It has shown that the way out of social and ecological crisis is not through GDP-focused \u201cdevelopment\u201d, but rather with decentralised autonomous communities. Making such communities work in more and more places, by regenerating ecosystems, healing our collective trauma and creating social structures of solidarity and trust, is the transformational work of our times. Once we see our struggles as inherently interdependent with each other, and with the web of life itself, no army on the planet will be able to stop the inevitable transition. As leaders from social movements, communities and First Nations from around the world, we stand in solidarity with the vision and work of Rojava. We pray for their resilience, protection and perseverance. We pray that we will listen to and learn from the living Earth as she continues to show us how to create societies which live in cooperation with all beings. We pray that those in positions of power be reminded of their humanity and end this invasion immediately.

Patrick Wallace London \u2022 The Steve Bell cartoon featuring Jo Swinson sitting in the middle of the road waiting to be run over (If\u2026, G2, 31 October) also implies that if you drive too close to the edge you will end up in the ditch, and that would apply to both of the two main tribes. Peter Baldwin North Walsham, Norfolk \u2022 Where is Larry the cat? He has not been seen outside No 10, making his regular TV appearances, for some time now. Has he suffered Boris\u2019s \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d fate? What role has Dilyn played in all this? I think we should be told \u2013 before 12 December. Wolf and Linda Gruellich Edinburgh \u2022 Unaware until too late that you need to display a pumpkin to have children calling at Halloween (they came last year), I waited with 38 chocolate bars to see the children\u2019s costumes but had no callers.

      "body": "<p>In 1957 the artist Ed Clark, who has died aged 93, was in his New York studio making a painting for a forthcoming show when he decided to introduce an element of collage, a stretch of paper that hung over the side of the canvas. In doing so, Clark came to be regarded as the first American artist to have created a shaped painting, in which the composition breaks free of the medium\u2019s traditional rectangle \u2013 one of several artistic innovations he made during a seven-decade career.</p> <p>The piece he created was an abstract, expressionistic composition of red, white, blue and green, interrupted by two torn sheets of paper painted in similar hues, overlaid on the canvas and dramatically hanging over the top and right edge of the frame. \u201cI looked at it and looked at it and looked at it, and I thought it had a punch,\u201d Clark recalled in 2014.</p> <p>The painting won immediate praise when it was exhibited in 1958 at the artist-run Brata gallery in New York. \u201cUp and down, over and across, forward and backward \u2013 one is always aware of the canvas edge as a positive element,\u201d wrote the poet James Schuyler, then a critic at Art News. \u201cClark is a craftsman; he has a control over his means.\u201d</p> <p>Clark went on to create a series of vast oval-shaped works, typically featuring thickly applied swathes of different coloured paint running in horizontal parallel. The shape, he said, was a reference to the eye.</p> <p>In 1956, while in Paris, Clark had started to use a broom to paint, laying the canvas on the studio floor and pushing a block of pigment across its surface with considerable force. The technique, to which he would return time and again, produced abstract paintings in which the broom strokes demonstrate a strength of movement and energy unobtainable with a brush.</p> <p>For much of his career, Clark was an artist\u2019s artist, appreciated and supported by fellow abstract painters and members of the New York School. In 1979 he was included in an exhibition at Louisiana State University and in 1981 he had a solo show at the Studio Museum in Harlem, but his success was for many years mainly within artist co-operatives and smaller commercial galleries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c2dd5528c7bae8172b73b59250e876c28e00999\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c2dd5528c7bae8172b73b59250e876c28e00999/105_408_3315_1988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exhibits by Ed Clark in the touring exhibition Soul of a Nation, as shown in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exhibits by Ed Clark in the touring exhibition Soul of a Nation, as shown in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Dorado</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1993, however, the Studio Museum included his work in 25 Years of African-American Abstraction, the first of several group exhibitions there that Clark participated in. His belated big break came in 2014 when his fellow artist <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/artists/2486\" title=\"\">David Hammons</a> curated a <a href=\"https://jacktiltongallery.com/exhibitions/past/clark/\" title=\"\">solo show of his work</a> at Tilton gallery in New York. Tilton showed more paintings in 2017, the year Clark\u2019s work was included in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/11/soul-of-a-nation-review-lost-history-of-black-power-art-tate-modern\" title=\"\">Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power</a> at Tate Modern, in London, an exhibition that is still touring internationally.</p> <p>In 2018 the Mnuchin gallery, New York, held <a href=\"http://www.mnuchingallery.com/exhibitions/ed-clark\" title=\"\">a retrospective</a> of works from 1962 to 2013, and earlier this year Hauser &amp; Wirth, who are currently exhibiting later works at their New York gallery, began representing him.</p> <p>Ed was born in New Orleans to Merion (nee Hutchinson), a seamstress, and Edward Clark, who worked at Western Electric and on the railways, but also made money gambling. When Ed was six, the family moved to a house in Baton Rouge that had an outside toilet and no electricity, before relocating to Chicago, to the area of Woodlawn, described by Clark as \u201ca nice neighbourhood for high-class black people\u201d.</p> <p>His father was absent for days on end and, despite his mother\u2019s best efforts, the family were evicted. Clark went to Englewood high school and then Moseley school, leaving aged 17 to enlist in the US Army Air Corps for second world war service. He was shipped out to Guam and Saipan in the western Pacific, but saw no action and returned to Chicago.</p> <p>Dyslexic but with a talent for drawing, Clark enrolled at the city\u2019s Art Institute in 1947. During his four years of study, his teacher, the impressionist painter <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/louis-ritman/\" title=\"\">Louis Ritman</a>, proved inspirational: Clark recalled that it was from him he learned how colours could change dramatically when juxtaposed. A self-portrait made in his first year there, showing a handsome Clark staring sullenly out to the viewer, demonstrates an early awareness of palette.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"069485a24b4a25d2662d8d520fed14e7f20b1ffe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/069485a24b4a25d2662d8d520fed14e7f20b1ffe/0_0_3508_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled, 2005, by Ed Clark.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"820\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled, 2005, by Ed Clark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Barratt/Courtesy the artist and Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On being told that Paris was the centre of the art world, in 1952 Clark applied to the Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Montparnasse and, using the money received from the GI Bill, a fund to benefit ex-service personnel, bought a passage to France on the SS Libert\u00e9.</p> <p>Arriving in the city he recalled: \u201cIt must have been nine at night when I got out. I looked to my right and it was all lit up. I just walked towards the light \u2013 somebody I studied with was sitting at Cafe du D\u00f4me. You could see anybody. Giacometti would be at the cafe every night.\u201d Clark fell easily into bohemian society, mixing with fellow African-American artists and writers also in Paris, including <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/beauford-delaney/\" title=\"\">Beauford Delaney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a> and Haywood Bill Rivers, as well as Europeans.</p> <p>At the Salon d\u2019Automne he saw one of Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl\u2019s football paintings, semi-abstract works of bright colour showing a match in play, which had a profound effect on his own art. He experimented first with a series of geometric expressionist still lifes, and then took up the broom, a technique he dubbed \u201cthe big sweep\u201d. One early work from 1960, titled Blue Force, features a great slick of blue paint driving through splashes of red and turquoise.</p> <p>Clark had solo shows in Paris at Galerie Raymond Creuze in 1955, which sold well, and 1956, which did not. Desperately poor, but attractive and charismatic, he survived by the generosity of various women. \u201cI was never a gigolo, but they\u2019d be living with me,\u201d he said. In 1957 Clark returned to New York, where he showed at the Brata, and continued to make work while earning cash as an assistant at the <a href=\"https://www.theartstory.org/gallery-janis-sidney.htm\" title=\"\">Sidney Janis gallery</a>, then the centre of the New York School showing artists such as Mark Rothko. The latter passed the young Clark his old canvases to use.</p> <p>In 1966 Clark married Hedy Durham, the third of his four wives, and in 1968 the couple spent the year at the French house of the American painter Joan Mitchell, in V\u00e9theuil, near Paris, a palatial spot with gardens backing down to the Seine. It was there that Clark began to experiment with oval canvases. In 1969 he showed his work at the American embassy in Paris.</p> <p>Back in New York, Clark received a national endowment grant in 1972, a year after <a href=\"https://juddfoundation.org/artist/biography/\" title=\"\">Donald Judd</a> had given him a solo exhibition at his loft on Spring Street. He continued to paint and exhibit, and his work is held in collections across the US, including Moma and the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p> <p>Clark was married four times, to Muriel Nelson, Lola Owens, Durham, with whom he had a daughter, Melanca, and Liping An; each marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by Melanca and two grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Ed Clark, artist, born 6 May 1926; died 18 October 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1957 the artist Ed Clark, who has died aged 93, was in his New York studio making a painting for a forthcoming show when he decided to introduce an element of collage, a stretch of paper that hung over the side of the canvas. In doing so, Clark came to be regarded as the first American artist to have created a shaped painting, in which the composition breaks free of the medium\u2019s traditional rectangle \u2013 one of several artistic innovations he made during a seven-decade career. The piece he created was an abstract, expressionistic composition of red, white, blue and green, interrupted by two torn sheets of paper painted in similar hues, overlaid on the canvas and dramatically hanging over the top and right edge of the frame. \u201cI looked at it and looked at it and looked at it, and I thought it had a punch,\u201d Clark recalled in 2014. The painting won immediate praise when it was exhibited in 1958 at the artist-run Brata gallery in New York. \u201cUp and down, over and across, forward and backward \u2013 one is always aware of the canvas edge as a positive element,\u201d wrote the poet James Schuyler, then a critic at Art News. \u201cClark is a craftsman; he has a control over his means.\u201d Clark went on to create a series of vast oval-shaped works, typically featuring thickly applied swathes of different coloured paint running in horizontal parallel. The shape, he said, was a reference to the eye. In 1956, while in Paris, Clark had started to use a broom to paint, laying the canvas on the studio floor and pushing a block of pigment across its surface with considerable force. The technique, to which he would return time and again, produced abstract paintings in which the broom strokes demonstrate a strength of movement and energy unobtainable with a brush. For much of his career, Clark was an artist\u2019s artist, appreciated and supported by fellow abstract painters and members of the New York School. In 1979 he was included in an exhibition at Louisiana State University and in 1981 he had a solo show at the Studio Museum in Harlem, but his success was for many years mainly within artist co-operatives and smaller commercial galleries. In 1993, however, the Studio Museum included his work in 25 Years of African-American Abstraction, the first of several group exhibitions there that Clark participated in. His belated big break came in 2014 when his fellow artist David Hammons curated a solo show of his work at Tilton gallery in New York. Tilton showed more paintings in 2017, the year Clark\u2019s work was included in Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power at Tate Modern, in London, an exhibition that is still touring internationally. In 2018 the Mnuchin gallery, New York, held a retrospective of works from 1962 to 2013, and earlier this year Hauser &amp; Wirth, who are currently exhibiting later works at their New York gallery, began representing him. Ed was born in New Orleans to Merion (nee Hutchinson), a seamstress, and Edward Clark, who worked at Western Electric and on the railways, but also made money gambling. When Ed was six, the family moved to a house in Baton Rouge that had an outside toilet and no electricity, before relocating to Chicago, to the area of Woodlawn, described by Clark as \u201ca nice neighbourhood for high-class black people\u201d. His father was absent for days on end and, despite his mother\u2019s best efforts, the family were evicted. Clark went to Englewood high school and then Moseley school, leaving aged 17 to enlist in the US Army Air Corps for second world war service. He was shipped out to Guam and Saipan in the western Pacific, but saw no action and returned to Chicago. Dyslexic but with a talent for drawing, Clark enrolled at the city\u2019s Art Institute in 1947. During his four years of study, his teacher, the impressionist painter Louis Ritman, proved inspirational: Clark recalled that it was from him he learned how colours could change dramatically when juxtaposed. A self-portrait made in his first year there, showing a handsome Clark staring sullenly out to the viewer, demonstrates an early awareness of palette. On being told that Paris was the centre of the art world, in 1952 Clark applied to the Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Montparnasse and, using the money received from the GI Bill, a fund to benefit ex-service personnel, bought a passage to France on the SS Libert\u00e9. Arriving in the city he recalled: \u201cIt must have been nine at night when I got out. I looked to my right and it was all lit up. I just walked towards the light \u2013 somebody I studied with was sitting at Cafe du D\u00f4me. You could see anybody. Giacometti would be at the cafe every night.\u201d Clark fell easily into bohemian society, mixing with fellow African-American artists and writers also in Paris, including Beauford Delaney, James Baldwin and Haywood Bill Rivers, as well as Europeans. At the Salon d\u2019Automne he saw one of Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl\u2019s football paintings, semi-abstract works of bright colour showing a match in play, which had a profound effect on his own art. He experimented first with a series of geometric expressionist still lifes, and then took up the broom, a technique he dubbed \u201cthe big sweep\u201d. One early work from 1960, titled Blue Force, features a great slick of blue paint driving through splashes of red and turquoise. Clark had solo shows in Paris at Galerie Raymond Creuze in 1955, which sold well, and 1956, which did not. Desperately poor, but attractive and charismatic, he survived by the generosity of various women. \u201cI was never a gigolo, but they\u2019d be living with me,\u201d he said. In 1957 Clark returned to New York, where he showed at the Brata, and continued to make work while earning cash as an assistant at the Sidney Janis gallery, then the centre of the New York School showing artists such as Mark Rothko. The latter passed the young Clark his old canvases to use. In 1966 Clark married Hedy Durham, the third of his four wives, and in 1968 the couple spent the year at the French house of the American painter Joan Mitchell, in V\u00e9theuil, near Paris, a palatial spot with gardens backing down to the Seine. It was there that Clark began to experiment with oval canvases. In 1969 he showed his work at the American embassy in Paris. Back in New York, Clark received a national endowment grant in 1972, a year after Donald Judd had given him a solo exhibition at his loft on Spring Street. He continued to paint and exhibit, and his work is held in collections across the US, including Moma and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Clark was married four times, to Muriel Nelson, Lola Owens, Durham, with whom he had a daughter, Melanca, and Liping An; each marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by Melanca and two grandchildren. \u2022 Ed Clark, artist, born 6 May 1926; died 18 October 2019",

      "bodyText": "Thursday was Boris Johnson\u2019s 100th day in office \u2013 and when he took charge, he would have hoped that on Friday he would be spending the day celebrating Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Instead, it has been a rollercoaster ride of broken promises, false dawns and embarrassing defeats \u2013 and an election is looming. 24 July Johnson officially succeeds Theresa May as prime minister. His first act is to purge the cabinet of Tory \u201cwets\u201d. The next day, in his first speech, he pledges that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October \u201cno ifs or buts\u201d. Stressing that he takes personal responsibility and that \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d, he adds: \u201cI have every confidence that in 99 days\u2019 time we will have cracked it.\u201d 3 September Johnson leads a minority government after 21 Conservative MPs, including heavyweights such as Philip Hammond, Ken Clarke and Justine Greening, have the whip removed for voting in favour of a move to force an extension in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It will not be until 15 October, 84 days into his premiership and at the eighth time of asking, that Johnson finally wins a government vote (on air quality). Johnson\u2019s first 100 days \u2013 votes Number of votes won: eight Number of votes lost: 15 5 September In a pledge that would come back to haunt him, Johnson said \u201cI would rather be dead in a ditch [than delay Brexit].\u201d As well as this soundbite, the speech is memorable for being delivered in front of an audience of police cadets, one of whom fainted during the speech after standing in the heat for too long. 18 September Angry father Omar Salem tells Johnson his baby daughter had nearly died because the ward on which she was treated was \u201cnot safe for children\u201d after years of austerity. With parliament not sitting much of the time and an election in the offing, the PM has spent much of his time on the road but not always with positive results. On 5 September, a polite gentleman in Morley, Leeds, asked him to \u201cplease leave my town\u201d. Johnson\u2019s first 100 days \u2013 visits Number of hospitals visited: at least six Number of schools visited: at least four 22 September A Sunday Times article is the catalyst for a series of stories \u2013 and investigations, including by the police watchdog \u2013 into possible conflicts of interest in Johnson\u2019s friendship with Jennifer Arcuri while he was mayor of London. The US businesswoman accompanied Johnson on three overseas trade missions led by the then mayor, after initially being turned down for two of them. Her companies were also awarded \u00a3126,000 of public money. 24 September As well as losing parliamentary votes, Johnson was embarrassed in the supreme court, when judges ruled that his advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful. Parliament went into recess on 10 September, in what was viewed by political opponents as an attempt to minimise MPs\u2019 ability to block a no-deal Brexit. In the event, it resumed the day after the judgment. Johnson\u2019s first 100 days \u2013 accountability Number of days parliament has sat under Johnson: 25 Number of days parliament has been prorogued under Johnson: 14 Number of PMQs appearances: three Number of YouTube \u2018people\u2019s questions\u2019 appearances: two 2 October In parliament, the former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, accuses Johnson\u2019s chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, of lying to undermine MPs. Cummings, the former head of the Vote Leave campaign, was a controversial appointment, having been found in contempt of parliament in March for refusing to appear before MPs. He has been blamed for a number of incendiary and/or fanciful briefings to the press. 10 October After talks, Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, who had previously expressed scepticism, announce they have agreed that there is a \u201cpathway to a possible Brexit deal\u201d, unexpectedly raising hopes. Days earlier, the taoiseach had poured cold water on the prospects of a deal, warning that finding an agreement would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d and his talks with Johnson were expected to flounder. 17 October After an EU summit in Brussels, Johnson announces a new withdrawal deal which \u201ctakes back control\u201d and abolishes the \u201canti-democratic backstop\u201d. Amid smiles and backslapping from other EU leaders, he hails it as a \u201cgreat deal\u201d for the UK. but doubts are raised back home about how different it is to Theresa May\u2019s deal. 19 October Billed as Super Saturday and the chance to finally pass the withdrawal bill, it ends with Johnson being forced to write to the EU to request a Brexit extension. A substantive vote on the bill fails to materialise after an amendment tabled by Oliver Letwin delays approval. Johnson grudgingly sends an unsigned letter requesting a further delay beyond 31 October, accompanied by a signed one arguing against it. 29 October At the fourth attempt (the first was on 4 September) Johnson wins the backing of two-thirds of MPs, the number required to call an early general election. It comes after abandoning the withdrawal bill despite it having passed a second reading a week earlier. Minutes after it passed, MPs had rejected the \u201cprogramme motion\u201d, which set out a blistering three-day timetable for them to scrutinise the 110-page withdrawal agreement bill, finally killing the possibility of Britain leaving the EU on 31 October.

      "body": "<p>Mustapha Matura, who has died aged 79 after a heart attack, was a pioneering black playwright who opened the doors for his successors. He was the first British-based dramatist of colour to have a play in the West End when in 1974 Play Mas, dealing with the annual Trinidad carnival, moved from the Royal Court to the <a href=\"https://www.thephoenixtheatre.co.uk/\">Phoenix theatre</a> on Charing Cross Road. It is also worth recalling, as<a href=\"https://nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/three-sisters\" title=\"\"> Inua Ellam\u2019s relocation of Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters to Nigeria</a> is about to open at the National Theatre, that Matura did his own transposition of the play, Trinidad Sisters, in 1988.</p> <p>\u201cI have tried,\u201d Matura once said, \u201cto examine the effects of colonialism, political and psychological, on the colonisers and the colonised.\u201d His great achievement was to have done this in plays that have a deceptive lightness of touch.</p> <p>Matura\u2019s early life in Trinidad was rich in experience that later fed into his plays. Born Noel Mathura (he changed his name when establishing himself as a writer in 1960s London) in the capital, Port of Spain, to Chandra Bhan Mathura, a struggling car salesman of Indian origin, and his wife, Violet Ashbrook (nee Rivers), a department-store assistant of mixed Creole, Scottish and African heritage, he went to Belmont boys\u2019 Roman Catholic school in the city. He then did various jobs as an office boy, hotel stocktaker, insurance salesman and tally clerk on the docks. But he was a voracious reader of European literature and once claimed that it was Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar that determined his ultimate choice of career.</p> <p>Moving to the UK in 1961, Matura again worked in a variety of jobs including hospital porter and garment factory assistant. Even more crucially, he became fascinated by the Black Power movement and began to see the potential of being a mouthpiece for Caribbean immigrant culture.</p> <p>He started out by writing three short plays, Black Pieces, dealing with London\u2019s West Indian community, which were staged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/08/roland-rees\" title=\"\">Roland Rees</a> at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1970. Among the people who saw it was the producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/mar/09/michael-white-producer-obituary\" title=\"\">Michael White</a>, who commissioned a new play from Matura that made its debut in Edinburgh at the Traverse before moving to the Royal Court\u2019s Theatre Upstairs in 1971.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ac2ca2fae1ed7cf4c6252e3a47d6d2ee9bf1fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96ac2ca2fae1ed7cf4c6252e3a47d6d2ee9bf1fd/0_251_4299_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Victor Romero Evans, Seun Shote and Llewella Gideon in Play Mas by Mustapha Matura at the Orange Tree theatre, Richmond, in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Victor Romero Evans, Seun Shote and Llewella Gideon in Play Mas by Mustapha Matura at the Orange Tree theatre, Richmond, in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Its title was As Time Goes By and it offered a highly entertaining portrait of a Jonsonian rogue living in Notting Hill who made a profit out of solving other people\u2019s problems while his wife longed to return to Trinidad.

Under its ebullient surface the play shows how the movement towards independence contained an element of masquerade; when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/15/play-mas-orange-tree-review\" title=\"\">revived at the Orange Tree</a>, Richmond, in 2015, it was seen to have lost none of its bite.</p> <p>After this, Rum an\u2019 Coca Cola (1976), capturing the degradation of calypso by the Yankee dollar, felt rather slight, but in Independence (1979) and Meetings (1981) Matura returned more robustly to his favourite theme of the political impact of colonialism. He was also on top form in Playboy of the West Indies (1984), which transferred JM Synge\u2019s famous Irish tragicomedy <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Playboy_of_the_Western_World\" title=\"\">The Playboy of the Western World</a> from Mayo in 1907 to Trinidad\u2019s Mayaro in 1950.

General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule.</p>\n    <p>The repression intensified under Castelo Branco\u2019s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called \u201canos de chumbo\u201d (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened during the dictatorship?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supporters of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic \u201cmiracle\u201d.</p>\n    <p>It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio\u2019s Guanabara bay.</p>\n    <p>But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.</p>\n    <p>It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil\u2019s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did it end?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.</p>\n    <p>But the pro-democracy \u201cDiretas J\u00e1\u201d (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte.</p>\n    <p>Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988.

Almost a century after the Egyptian king\u2019s tomb was first cracked open by a British-led expedition, and 47 years after crowds queued for hours outside the British Museum to catch a glimpse of its contents, a new exhibition will once again showcase the astonishing riches that were buried to accompany the Egyptian king into the afterlife more than 3,300 years ago. Of course the real Tutankhamun, who died around 1,326BC, was never a diva past his prime, having lived, married, ruled and died all before his 20th birthday. But the boy king now finds himself obliged to take another turn on the world stage for motives which, as Egypt\u2019s minister of antiquities Khaled El-Anany acknowledged on Friday, are financial as much as cultural. The new London exhibition, staged to a moody musical backdrop at the Saatchi gallery by the global sport and entertainment promoter IMG, is the third stop in a 10-city world tour whose purpose, El-Anany volunteered with admirable frankness, was \u201cpromotion of Egypt. And to motivate tourists to come to Egypt.\u201d The country has seen an alarming slump in visitor numbers in recent decades thanks to turbulent politics, including the 2011 revolution and the unrest that followed, and a number of devastating terrorist attacks. The 2015 bombing of a Russian tourist jet over the Sinai peninsula led to the suspension of all flights between the UK and Sharm el-Sheikh \u2013 British Foreign Office restrictions on travel to the area were lifted only last month. And thus, said El-Anany: \u201cWe are sending a very few of the treasures that we have, like a teaser for tourists all over the world, to motivate them to come back.\u201d To the voluble Zawi Hawass, one of Egypt\u2019s most eminent archaeologists, the purpose is even more plain. \u201cEgypt\u2019s name will be every day for six months in the TV or newspaper. And it brings money to Egypt.\u201d King Tut\u2019s pitstop in Paris earlier this year \u2013 the second leg of the tour after Los Angeles \u2013 became the most popular exhibition in France\u2019s history and raised $10m for Egypt, Hawass noted. The money will be spent on the enormous and much-delayed Grand Egyptian Museum project in Giza, which authorities insist will finally open late next year. All of which may explain the London ticket prices, which will set you back almost \u00a3120 for a family of four on a weekend visit \u2013 that\u2019s before audio guides, programmes or a brief but illuminating VR \u201cexperience\u201d for which tickets are sold separately. The world\u2019s most classy trade stall this may be, but even in the absence of the king\u2019s most famous artefacts \u2013 Tutankhamun\u2019s spectacular gold death mask and three gold coffins are barred by Egyptian law from leaving the country \u2013 this remains a breathtaking collection. There is plenty of bling, of course \u2013 from the gilded wooden representations of the boy king steering a ship or riding a panther or hunting lions, to the spectacular solid gold chains and rings and pectoral ornaments, which were laid on his body and folded into his mummy wrappings. An exquisite gold and carnelian coffinette, barely 40cm tall and made to house his mummified liver, evokes his funerary mask on a diminutive scale. But the exhibition also contains items that come closer to capturing the humanity of the teenager behind the mask, including a tiny wooden chair which the curator, Tarek El Awady, said was likely to be the throne on which the nine-year-old Tutankhamun was crowned, and a collection of plainly painted wooden boxes, one shaped like a chicken carcass, into which were packed cuts of meat to feed the king on his journey to the afterlife. So spectacular are the riches at the country\u2019s disposal, indeed, that it is hard to believe Egypt will be able to resist the temptation in future to take the treasures of Tutankhamun on the road again, whatever their marketing-led vows are now. But Hawass insisted \u2013 \u201cWe are 100% certain, yes\u201d \u2013 that King Tut\u2019s treasures will never again be seen outside Egypt once the Grand Museum finally opens. \u201cTutankhamun is tired. He has to relax at home. He has to go home and drink some nice beer and live at home for a long time.\u201d Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh is at the Saatchi Gallery from 2 November 2019 \u2013 3 May 2020. www.tutankhamun-london.com",

But the young campaigners say they are determined to continue their journey to hold other civil society meetings in South America, and may only consider charting a new course if the United Nations accepts Spain\u2019s offer to act as an emergency host of the summit. The shock announcement by the Chilean president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, was the latest in a series of setbacks for the 36 young European campaigners on board the Regina Maris sailboat, which left Amsterdam on 2 October. The vessel had to make an unexpected stop in France because of problems with the water purification system. The weather has been rough and several passengers were seasick, including 18-year-old Adela\u00efde Charlier, a co-organiser with Anuna De Wever of the Youth for Climate movement in Belgium. News of the cancellation of the Santiago summit reportedly came as a heavy blow to the activists, some of whom have also endured online trolling and death threats, during the past year. \u201cQuite a number of people started to cry, including Anuna and Adelaide,\u201d De Wever\u2019s mother, Katrien Van der Heyden, said. \u201cThey\u2019d been planning this trip for months and the COP would be the ultimate climax of their trip. Obviously this changes the entire perspective of what they do, and is extremely disappointing.\u201d But the group discussed the options and decided to push ahead. \u201cWe are continuing our journey to Bel\u00e9m, Brasil today, while our thoughts are with #Chile!\u201d they tweeted. \u201cFrom there we can still make it to a #COP25 held in Costa Rica or Bonn, most likely options at the moment. #ClimateAction is unstoppable!\u201d They are not the only activists who have sailed the Atlantic to attend the talks and then been left in limbo while the UN attempts to reorganise the event. The Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg is currently in Los Angeles and was due to sail to Chile shortly. On Friday she appealed for a lift back to Europe by sea, tweeting: \u201cIt turns out I\u2019ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way:) Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November \u2026 If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.\u201d She continued: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019ll not be able to visit South and Central America this time, I was so looking forward to this. But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. We\u2019re in a climate and ecological emergency.\u201d The British film-maker James Levelle is halfway through a 100-day, 7,000-mile fossil-free journey to Santiago. Supporters say he may not even be aware that the climate summit has been cancelled. Other climate groups are also reeling from the immense financial hit of non-refundable airline tickets and the complications of getting visas to a new venue. \u201cWe had big plans to bring indigenous representatives and partners to the summit,\u201d said Nicole Oliveira, Latin America team leader of 350.org, which planned to bring about 60 people to a climate defenders gathering ahead of the summit, in addition to 16 staff and a dozen other regional partners. The group says the cost of airfares and accommodation could double if the climate conference moves to Spain \u2013 which would eat up 10-15% of their budget for the event. \u201cWhat may not mean anything to the large corporations of the fossil fuel industry, to us as non-profit civil society organizations \u2013 and even more to the indigenous organizations \u2013 can often represent our survival as active agents of change,\u201d Oliveira said. \u201cWe expect now that the climate talks move forward with a new focus on public participation and human rights. For far too long, this process has prioritized the voices of big business and corporate polluters. The UN must kick the fossil fuel industry out of the climate talks and make more space for the voices of the people.\u201d",

But Villa boss Dean Smith is hopeful he can return. \u201cJack has been out there training today. He\u2019s still a little bit sore but he is in contention to start and he wants to start,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI said earlier in the week that when there\u2019s contact injuries on soft tissues then you\u2019re going to get a small bleed in there, which he\u2019s got. But it\u2019s not going to do too much harm to him going out there, once adrenaline kicks in you feel very little anyway. There\u2019s no long term issue with that type of injury, the decision I have to make is whether he is fit enough to start because we are up against the current champions of Europe and you need all 11 players to be physically right to go and produce on that day. My only call is whether he can go and produce the standards that we expect of him.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbc53e68f08cb84c60a2f72\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T15:59:39.318Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Let\u2019s cross to Spain to check in on Eden Hazard.</strong> Just over a year ago, then Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri was suggesting that the Belgian could score 40 goals that season.

We can all see he\u2019s playing better. Perhaps he could score a bit more often but we\u2019re not concerned. We\u2019re happy with what he\u2019s doing on the pitch and he\u2019s getting better every day. Players of Hazard\u2019s quality can see things that others simply aren\u2019t capable of seeing. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been timid, quite the opposite. Everyone wants to see him get better and I think he\u2019s improving every day. We\u2019ll all be happy with him but we have to take it easy.\u201d Fair enough, but who would have predicted that we\u2019d reach November and find that Tammy Abraham has scored eight times as many goals as the cover star of FIFA 20?</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T16:07:41.078Z\">at 4.07pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dbc50c78f08d669cdab12f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T15:42:18.368Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Liverpool have temporarily suspended the fan responsible for the offensive Divock Origi banner</strong> spotted during the Reds\u2019 Champions League game at Genk last week.

Norwich boss Daniel Farke says his side will not become obsessed by league position as they look to climb the table with victory at Brighton this weekend. The Canaries have slipped to second bottom after four defeats in the last five although they did manage a 0-0 draw at Bournemouth in their last away game. \u201cWe can\u2019t doubt ourselves. We have to be self-critical but believe in our principles. We have to stick together,\u201d parped Farke. \u201cOur supporters know we face a tough time, but the players try everything. We\u2019re not addicted to looking at the table. We want to win games and let it take care of itself. That\u2019s the approach we had last season and we had a brilliant finish.\u201d As for team news, goalkeeper Tim Krul is fit again after being injured against Manchester United but Onel Hernandez could be an absentee as his partner awaits the birth of their child. Mario Vrancic misses out through illness, while Todd Cantwell (hamstring) and Ibrahim Amadou (knee) are doubts. Ready for The Fiver? Your fifth-favourite tea-timely football email asks if you can spare a thought for Nathan Jones, his hopes of becoming \u201cthe world\u2019s best manager\u201d temporarily dashed after being given the boot by Stoke. If Aston Villa want to upset leaders Liverpool on Saturday, having Jack Grealish available would be a big help. The midfielder suffered a calf injury at Manchester City last weekend and missed the Carabao Cup win against Wolves. But Villa boss Dean Smith is hopeful he can return. \u201cJack has been out there training today. He\u2019s still a little bit sore but he is in contention to start and he wants to start,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI said earlier in the week that when there\u2019s contact injuries on soft tissues then you\u2019re going to get a small bleed in there, which he\u2019s got. But it\u2019s not going to do too much harm to him going out there, once adrenaline kicks in you feel very little anyway. There\u2019s no long term issue with that type of injury, the decision I have to make is whether he is fit enough to start because we are up against the current champions of Europe and you need all 11 players to be physically right to go and produce on that day. My only call is whether he can go and produce the standards that we expect of him.\u201d Let\u2019s cross to Spain to check in on Eden Hazard. Just over a year ago, then Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri was suggesting that the Belgian could score 40 goals that season. He didn\u2019t, managing 21 instead. For Real Madrid this term he\u2019s managed just one in eight. This is what boss Zinedine Zidane makes of it: \u201cHazard? We can all see he\u2019s playing better. Perhaps he could score a bit more often but we\u2019re not concerned. We\u2019re happy with what he\u2019s doing on the pitch and he\u2019s getting better every day. Players of Hazard\u2019s quality can see things that others simply aren\u2019t capable of seeing. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been timid, quite the opposite. Everyone wants to see him get better and I think he\u2019s improving every day. We\u2019ll all be happy with him but we have to take it easy.\u201d Fair enough, but who would have predicted that we\u2019d reach November and find that Tammy Abraham has scored eight times as many goals as the cover star of FIFA 20? Liverpool have temporarily suspended the fan responsible for the offensive Divock Origi banner spotted during the Reds\u2019 Champions League game at Genk last week. The PA news agency reports that the supporter has been informed by letter/e-mail and must reply within 14 days. In the meantime, he has been denied access to any Liverpool matches after a meeting of the club\u2019s Sanctions Panel. Final punishments range from a full ban, a ban and education, education on its own or other minor sanctions. Liverpool condemned the Photoshopped banner of the striker for \u201cperpetuating a racial stereotype\u201d. Some fulsome praise from Brendan Rodgers for midfielder Wilfred Ndidi. \u201cHe is an incredible player. The offensive players get the credit but he does the dirty work,\u201d cooed Rodgers. \u201cHe has this brain for the game, where he can smell danger and always finds himself there. The timing of his challenge is very good and he\u2019s up there with the top players at winning the ball back. When you play a pressing game you need someone like Wilf. His passing is good too, he\u2019s always smiling.\u201d Good to know he smiles a lot but the stats also confirm what his boss says. Ndidi has made more interceptions (32) than anyone in the Premier League this season and ranks second for tackles (45). Brendan Rodgers hasn\u2019t been sat in his underpants at home, rewinding the goals in Leicester\u2019s 9-0 win at Southampton whilst chewing through a bag of Haribo Fantasy Mix. Oh, no. The Foxes boss has resisted any such temptations to bask. \u201cNo, we\u2019ve already had a game (3-1 Carabao Cup win at Burton). We\u2019ve already reflected on the performance, you have got to take the real positives from it. There were other areas where we could have scored more, there was a period between the 58th minute and the 84th minute where we didn\u2019t score. Throughout the game our pressing, our intensity, was very good and it shows the players have learned.\u201d Some news from Scotland now, where Celtic are preparing to take on Hibs in the Betfred Cup semi-final at Hampden Park on Saturday. It looks as if they\u2019ll have to do so without skipper Scott Brown, who is struggling with a thigh strain. Then again, there\u2019s a fair chance they\u2019ll cope having won the last nine domestic trophies on offer in Scotland. Lennon isn\u2019t resting on his laurels, though, and wants to extend that run into double figures and beyond: \u201cIt is part of the domestic trophy haul we have kept hold of for the last three years. The players are highly motivated to defend the trophy, they are in great form, so there is a lot of incentive there for us.\u201d Let me be Frank with you - to quote cult comedian Frankie Tan. Anyway, here are some bog-standard \u2018respect the opposition\u2019 quotes from Frank Lampard, uttered in complete sincerity despite his rampant young Chelsea bucks being ruthless on the road (four straight Premier League away wins; 16 goals scored in the process) and ready to create more havoc at winless Watford: \u201cWe saw what they did last year, getting big results and regularly being a very strong team and making the FA Cup final. We cannot underestimate the team that will be hurting because they haven\u2019t won for a while and will have every ambition to try and win this game, so I certainly have even more focus on what we need to do.\u201d Thanks Ben. I\u2019ll open with some Everton teams news. Marco Silva will make a late call on defender Yerry Mina ahead of the home game against Spurs on Sunday. The Colombian was forced off with a knee problem in the first half of the Toffees\u2019 2-0 Carabao Cup win over Watford on Tuesday. \u201cHe worked with the team this morning. It was nothing serious, what he has in his knee at this moment. It\u2019s just a matter of him having the conditions to support the pain he has in this moment,\u201d said Silva. \u201cIf he can do that, he can train and possibly he can play as well. Today he did in the morning all the session, let\u2019s see how he will react tomorrow and after we will take the decisions. We hope it\u2019s nothing really special and it looks nothing special.\u201d There was certainly nothing special about Everton\u2019s performance in this fixture last season as Tottenham ran riot to win 6-2. Righto, David Tindall will guide you through the rest of the goings-on in the Premier League and beyond. Brendan Rodgers and Marco Silva are still to come. Granit Xhaka may not be signed up for the Wolves game but it\u2019s not all bad news for Arsenal: after two assists in midweek, Unai Emery says Mesut \u00d6zil and Gabriel Martinelli are ready to \u201chelp\u201d on Saturday. \u201cWe are playing a lot of matches and for them it is a challenge each match to show how they are and how they can help us,\u201d Emery said. \u201cThe performance on Wednesday in Liverpool was positive. I am thinking how they can help us tomorrow.\u201d Zing! There would be a few solutions possible but there was not one day where Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League, the Football League and the other leagues sit at a table and think about the players and not about their wallet. Pep Guardiola has sent Eddie Jones his best wishes, with the Manchester City manager wishing the England rugby union coach good luck in the World Cup final against South Africa on Saturday. Jones has previously studied Guardiola\u2019s coaching techniques. \u201cGood luck,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour for England to be in the final. For Eddie Jones, for his staff, for his players. All the best. It\u2019s an incredible event.\u201d There has been speculation this week that the Premier League may be set to ban under-12 players at academies from heading the ball, following a landmark report studying dementia in former players. Bournemouth have already acted to stop heading at their academy and Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was asked about the proposal during his press conference ahead of the away trip to Everton. It is a sensitive subject and we need to stay open to help the people that can provide us the better information and advice. We need to be open and try to provide the best to our kids because they are the future of football, the country, life and world. It is a sensitive thing that we need to listen to people that have the knowledge.\u201d Emery looks pretty weary and seems unsure how best to cope with the storm surrounding Xhaka. He leans forward and says he does not plan to involve Xhaka against Wolves at the Emirates and it is difficult to envisage that changing. After being jeered off against Crystal Palace, the Swiss midfielder said he \u201creached boiling point\u201d as a result of threats to his wife and daughter. Xhaka has started all but one of Arsenal\u2019s league games this season: More from Unai Emery on Xhaka-gate: He is training. He didn\u2019t play in Liverpool for me he is continuing, above all [we are] focusing on tomorrow. The human, like everyone, feels. Xhaka\u2019s issues last week is one issue that needs time. He needs time to recover the normality in him. He said sorry, he gave the apology to the supporters and to everybody. Now is the focus on the match. We were waiting on [until] Monday and Tuesday [to sort out the captaincy]. Now we need to be focussed 100 per cent only on the match. We are going to do the training today but at the moment it is not in my mind. I want to speak about the players who are going to play.\u201d Pochettino says Dele Alli needs support, and not stick: We need to remember that he\u2019s so young and the pressure is massive. He\u2019s English and everybody expects big things from him but he\u2019s still 23 years old. He was fantastic then he dropped a bit in his performance but we must back him. We have to pay attention, to focus and try to improve in the way that everyone expects.\u201d Roma are keen on making Chris Smalling a permanent addition: Chelsea team news: Frank Lampard says Antonio R\u00fcdiger is not fit and that the defender has an appointment with a consultant on Monday, with a view to sussing out a pelvic problem. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is closing on a return but this weekend comes too early for the France midfielder. \u201cRoss Barkley is still not quite right, he\u2019s not far away. Andreas Christensen is pretty much fit as well, so it\u2019s the finishing touches for a few of these ones. There is a difference between fit and match-fit.\u201d Give this a whirl: Pep Guardiola says he sympathises with J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who has said elite players are simply playing too much football. \u201cI\u2019m completely with Jurgen when he makes these statements, it\u2019s too much,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we have bigger squads, how do we pay them? We need less fixtures, less competitions, more recovery. But I have been in meetings and it\u2019s always the same. We just talk about it. I had to prioritise Ilkay G\u00fcndogan for the last game \u2013 no Kevin de Bruyne, no David Silva. Other clubs do the same.\u201d Unai Emery says his club captain will not play a part. Mauricio Pochettino is not a happy bunny. The Tottenham manager says he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with Argentina calling up of Giovani Lo Celso, who has only just returned to the Spurs fold after picking up a muscle injury on international duty in September. Meanwhile, Jan Vertonghen is a doubt for Sunday\u2019s game at Everton with a hamstring injury. \u00c9rik Lamela remains injured after missing the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool, while Danny Rose will miss out through suspension. Hodgson says Andros Townsend is unlikely to be fit for Sunday after sustaining a muscle strain against Arsenal. \u201cLeicester are coming in off the back of two good results \u2013 last weekend and the Carabao Cup,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cWe hope they don\u2019t play like they did against Southampton.\u201d You can say that again Roy ... Roy Hodgson is in talks over extending his Crystal Palace stay, with a contract that will take him beyond his 73rd birthday. Hodgson, who turned 72 in August, is out of contract next summer but the club are keen to hand him a new deal following Palace\u2019s good start to the season. Palace, who host high-flying Leicester on Sunday, are sixth after the opening 10 Premier League matches. \u201cI heard today that Donald Trump who is a bit older than me is planning to stay on as President of the USA for another five years,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important job, but not quite as important as being the leader of the free world.\u201d Manchester United are offering free flights to fans for their Europa League game at Khazakstan\u2019s Astana in late November, following Thomas Cook\u2019s insolvency. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been working through a range of contingency plans to minimise the impact of the Thomas Cook situation for our supporters. We are pleased to be able to confirm that Manchester United will be operating a complimentary trip to the forthcoming match against FC Astana in Kazakhstan for those who were impacted by the insolvency of Thomas Cook.\u201d It sounds as though Fabinho could be given a breather by Klopp this weekend, with the Brazilian a booking away from suspension. Much could hinge on Naby Ke\u00efta \u2013 a doubt for Saturday \u2013 overcoming an injury sustained during the second half against Arsenal in midweek but taking Fabinho out of the firing line is the only way to guarantee the midfielder will be available face Manchester City on 10 November. Klopp has Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Adam Lallana, while he could always turn to his raft of youngsters, with Curtis Jones, Pedro Chirivella and Herbie Kane alternative midfield options, if need be. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible playing against Villa to play without [making] challenges,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThe player knows this, I know this. Maybe he has to deal with it on the pitch or I have to deal with it with the line-up. I didn\u2019t make a final decision yet so we will see.\u201d Klopp has told the game\u2019s bigwigs to think \u201cabout the players and maybe not their wallet\u201d when it comes to fixture congestion. The German said he does not want to be drawn over whether clubs simply play too many games ... and then ends up flowing into a mild-mannered and passionate rant of sorts: The discussion is obvious, that it is too much. Everyone involved in the game knows. Nobody wants to touch it, nobody really discusses about it. Then Uefa decides to make the Nations League, give the successful players a couple of more intense games. People then say you need a bigger squad. The game is not made for bigger squads. At the moment there is a imbalance between the number of players in the squad, the competitions you play and a big gap between the breaks the boys need. They have two weeks off a year, in a physically demanding game. The solutions, I think there are a few possible, but the leagues have to sit and really discuss and think about the players and maybe not their wallet. We discuss it always on the back of the money we earn. Somebody has to think about how many games.\u201d Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to make his 100th Liverpool appearance against Aston Villa on Saturday and Klopp has been effusive in his praise of the England defender, who turned 21 last month. Klopp says it\u2019s a pleasure to work with him: He\u2019s so young and already so experienced. It\u2019s a wonderful story for different reasons. I know that in Liverpool everyone was desperate to have a \u2018scouse\u2019 hero making his way into the first team. When he made his first appearance he said \u2018great, but it\u2019s not about having one game, it\u2019s about having 100\u2019. Now we can talk about that, and there was not a lot of bad games in that 100. I wish for him to stay healthy and fit, and then the future\u2019s bright for him and for us. He\u2019s a great role model. He\u2019s relaxed about that but feels responsible as well.\u201d Right, let\u2019s get a load of J\u00fcrgen Klopp. The Liverpool boss says Naby Ke\u00efta is a doubt to face Aston Villa, while the defender Jo\u00ebl Matip is still a few weeks away from returning to action. On the subject of fixture congestion in December, Klopp says the club is yet to find a solution and could send select different squads for the Carabao Cup and Club World Cup games, if need be: We have discussed it already and we have to because there\u2019s not much time to make that decision. If we do play [the Carabao Cup] while we are in Qatar, that will be two different teams. But we cannot leave any players at home for the Carabao Cup. We have two games in a busy period and it\u2019s not like we can go there [Qatar] with 11 players. It doesn\u2019t work like this. We have to make a decision but not yet.\u201d Where did it all go wrong for Nathan Jones? We haven\u2019t got all day, but here are a few pointers to get the ball rolling. After 14 games, only Barnsley\u2019s inferior goal difference prevented the most expensively assembled squad in the Championship \u2013 at more than \u00a3143m \u2013 from sitting bottom of the pile. There are more than \u00a350m-worth of players out on loan, including the club\u2019s \u00a318.3m record signing, Giannelli Imbula, and Kevin Wimmer, for whom they paid \u00a318m, indicators of where this malaise began. There will be a slew of press conferences to get stuck into shortly but first: confirmation that Stoke have indeed sacked Nathan Jones. Stoke say they will make a new managerial appointment \u201cas swiftly as possible\u201d but, until then, Rory Delap, Kevin Russell and Andy Quy will take caretaker charge. \u201cI would like to thank John and Peter Coates, firstly for the opportunity to manage this football club and then for the continued support and patience throughout my time here,\u201d Jones said in a statement. \u201cI would also like to thank the supporters for their fantastic support. Finally, I wish the club the very best for the future.\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp will be chewing the fat shortly. The Liverpool manager will likely be waxing lyrical about the several youngsters that shone, and kept their cool, in the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal on Wednesday. It was a memorable occasion for Curtis Jones, Neco Williams and Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg, while the 20-year-old goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher was arguably the hero on the night. Rhian Brewster was also involved. Whether any youngsters feature at Villa Park on Saturday remains to be seen \u2013 it feels unlikely \u2013 but all enhanced their reputations. A bit of breaking news in the Championship ... Stoke are understood to have sacked Nathan Jones, with the club set to confirm his dismissal shortly. Stoke are second bottom in the division having lost 10 of their 14 games this season, including their past two matches at Sheffield Wednesday and Millwall. Stoke take on league leaders West Brom on Monday. After victory over Swansea last month, Jones, who has won just six of his 38 matches in charge, said: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of thinking and soul searching over the last week and I\u2019m a passionate guy, [and] that\u2019s got me the career I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve had to work my socks off to get where I am because I was never blessed with any ability. I never had four-year contracts where I could chill out, relax and get a cigar out. I had to fight for every part of my career and it\u2019s the same as a manager.\u201d What more could you want? [Thierry] Henry tells me to shut up, this time with a lot of swear words included. And in hindsight it is good advice. But I am not taking it on. I shout back that he is the one who should shut up. He runs in my direction, confronts me, yells into my face, says all kinds of things. He totally ignores the fact that the game is going on around us. Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell get involved: \u2018Carry on, Nicklas, keep on running and shut your mouth.\u2019 And I do. I become unusually calm. That is what happens if one of the best forwards in the world stands there and shouts at you.\u201d How high can Leicester go this season? The sense seems to be that it will again be a two-horse race for the title, with Liverpool out in front, closely followed by Manchester City but Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side, and indeed Chelsea, are not so far behind. As Dean Smith said before Aston Villa were swept aside last weekend, City are not infallible and Liverpool, too, are not flawless. When Rodgers was asked about odds on his side winning the league shortening to around 50/1 following their 9-0 demolition of Southampton, he smiled and said: \u201cWe just want to finish as high as possible and I\u2019d never put any limits on that.\u201d Leicester travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday in search of a fourth straight win. J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Mauricio Pochettino and Unai Emery will be chatting a little later but, until then, a quick glance at the Championship. Bottom club Barnsley host Bristol City at Oakwell in Friday only\u2019s game, before a bumper Saturday, with Derby taking on Middlesbrough and Leeds entertaining QPR. Then second-placed Preston travel to Charlton on Sunday. Amazingly, Preston\u2019s entire starting XI last time out cost a grand total of ... \u00a31.6m: How about these for grand plans? Crystal Palace are determined to tap into the hotbed of south London talent by building a \u00a320m academy centre. In today\u2019s Rumour Mill, Palace are credited with an interest in Liverpool\u2019s Rhian Brewster but, down the line, maybe they will develop their own striking prodigy: Solskj\u00e6r has heralded the October international break as a key factor in easing Manchester United back to form. The Norwegian says it was a much-needed breather before earning a draw against Premier League pacesetters Liverpool and picking up wins at Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and Chelsea. [It] came at a great time for us. We did some work, prepared for the Liverpool game, and when you get a decent performance and result against the league leaders it gives you more energy and from then on the boys have been happy with the work we\u2019ve done. Maybe the change of system has helped and the coaches have done a great job.\u201d A dab more from Solskj\u00e6r. There is no chance of Luke Shaw, Axel Tuanzebe or Nemanja Matic facing Bournemouth. \u201cThey\u2019re not ready for tomorrow, that\u2019s the update,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably after the international break [they\u2019ll be back]. It is always a risk if you push them back too early, but if we have the two extra weeks after the international break they should all be ready for then.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r says Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindel\u00f6f are indeed injury doubts. The Manchester United manager said the trio are touch-and-go to face Bournemouth. Hopefully we can get them back on the pitch tomorrow. They had some treatment yesterday, a little more today, [they took part in] a light session and hopefully they\u2019re ready. Since Anthony Martial came back then Marcus has blossomed as well. He\u2019s probably happier facing goal, being direct and taking players on, rather than that target man with his back to goal. Marcus wants to master all the skills.\u201d Steve Bruce has been bigging up Newcastle\u2019s chances of rocketing up the Premier League. His side take on West Ham at the London Stadium on Saturday having won one of their past eight matches. As for team news, Andy Carroll could feature against his former club, while Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Matt Ritchie will miss out. Sch\u00e4r, Bruce says, could return against Bournemouth next weekend. Man United are seventh and they\u2019ve won three games. Two or three points separate a vast amount of teams. If you put back-to-back wins together, you shoot up the table, and that has to be our aim. We\u2019re quietly confident we can go to West Ham and get a result. I think we all feel as though we\u2019re not far off. We\u2019ve had a couple of magic moments by beating Spurs and Man United. The consistency looks to have arrived defensively. The front three are still settling in. We\u2019re aware of it, we have to improve, but I think we\u2019ll get there. The players enjoy coming in \u2013 there\u2019s a good spirit among the group and around the training ground.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be previewing Manchester United\u2019s trip to Bournemouth shortly, with the manager likely to give an update on the fitness of Victor Lindel\u00f6f, Marcus Rashford and Harry Maguire, who all picked up niggles at Stamford Bridge in midweek. Paul Pogba is sidelined until December but, by next summer, United get their hands on a new prized possession: \u201cIs Batshuayi going to get a chance again after that goal against Manchester United, or will he be back on the bench?\u201d asks Machine2481 below the line. It was a goal that will only enhance Batshuayi\u2019s chances of game-time but, more than anything, it will probably just cement his place as Tammy Abraham\u2019s deputy for the time being, with Olivier Giroud not given a minute of action off the bench. Giroud has scored in three of his past four appearances for France but has barely had a sniff for Chelsea. \u201cThey [Chelsea fans] love Tammy, but the outstanding moment of the game from our point of view was Michy in terms of finish and strength,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when another striker\u2019s scoring and you\u2019re not getting involved much, but he has shown something in training.\u201d Whet the appetite for the weekend: Eddie Howe is an early bird. The Bournemouth manager has been previewing Manchester United\u2019s visit on Saturday lunchtime. \u201cThey have played very well recently, they have quality players and a manager that\u2019s given them real stability. We have to show more than our last home game [0-0 against Norwich] and get the supporters on our side.\u201d Dan Gosling, who underwent surgery in the summer, could make his first appearance of the season. After some riveting cup action, back into the thick of it. First thing\u2019s first, and as scarcely believable as it may seem, Manchester United could win a fourth successive game on Saturday, if they pick up three points at not so sunny Bournemouth. Then there\u2019s Granit Xhaka v The Emirates part II, as Arsenal host Wolves and the small fry of Liverpool going to Villa Park. Plus, there is a 6-1 shellacking to look forward to, with Southampton determined to avoid another pasting at Manchester City. We\u2019ll be hearing from managers and hoovering up nuggets from across the Premier League and beyond. Saturday Bournemouth v Manchester United 12.30pm (GMT) Arsenal v Wolves Aston Villa v Liverpool Brighton v Norwich Manchester City v Southampton Sheffield United v Burnley West Ham v Newcastle Watford v Chelsea 5.30pm Sunday Crystal Palace v Leicester 2pm Everton v Tottenham 4.30pm *all 3pm kick-offs unless specified",

      "body": "<p>Thirty years ago this coming Monday, a vast crowd of East Germans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPgviMTBx48\">streamed into Alexanderplatz in </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPgviMTBx48\">then-divided Berlin</a> to protest against the regime they lived under. The German Democratic Republic was crumbling around them. Erich Honecker, the reviled leader of the GDR, had been forced out. Thousands of people had already fled. Five days later, after a party functionary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTBnOoBEJP0\">mistakenly announced that anyone who wanted to leave the country was free to do so</a>, hordes began to clamber over the Berlin Wall.</p> <p>As journalists observed \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/nov/04/berlin-wall-british-theatre\">numerous playwrights have realised</a> \u2013 the events of 4 November 1989 were so dramatic, they would have been impossible to script. Who would believe a play in which a country gave up the ghost without a shot being fired, and that this helped bring about the end of European communism? All because an apparatchik fumbled his lines.</p> <p>What is intriguing is that the collapse of East Germany was, in many ways, a piece of theatre. The Alexanderplatz demonstration, one of the largest in GDR history, had <a href=\"http://revolution89.de/en/revolution/major-demonstration-on-alexanderplatz/\">been </a><a href=\"http://revolution89.de/en/revolution/major-demonstration-on-alexanderplatz/\">planned by actors and directors from leading East German theatres</a>. They invited playwrights and actors to address the crowds, alongside dissidents and politicians. They even had a baddie: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Wolf\">former deputy head of the Stasi secret police spoke \u2013 and was booed</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"afffbb0817dea24900320f03f666908e7853e3ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afffbb0817dea24900320f03f666908e7853e3ca/0_76_3543_4427/800.jpg\" alt=\"Countdown to collapse \u2026 playwright Heiner M\u00fcller, who was once banned, at the Alexanderplatz protest.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Countdown to collapse \u2026 playwright Heiner M\u00fcller, who was once banned, at the Alexanderplatz protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For many, the rallying cry was \u201cWir sind das Volk!\u201d or \u201cWe are the people!\u201d \u2013 a line from <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dantons-Death-play-by-Buchner\">Danton\u2019s Death</a>, Georg B\u00fcchner\u2019s 1835 drama about the French Revolution. Adding to the atmosphere of insurrection that autumn \u2013 or seeking to give reality a nudge \u2013 several theatres were staging the play.</p> <p>I came across these stories a few years ago and didn\u2019t know what to make of them. It didn\u2019t seem surprising that theatre-makers had been involved in the protest movement.

      "bodyText": "Thirty years ago this coming Monday, a vast crowd of East Germans streamed into Alexanderplatz in then-divided Berlin to protest against the regime they lived under. The German Democratic Republic was crumbling around them. Erich Honecker, the reviled leader of the GDR, had been forced out. Thousands of people had already fled. Five days later, after a party functionary mistakenly announced that anyone who wanted to leave the country was free to do so, hordes began to clamber over the Berlin Wall. As journalists observed \u2013 and numerous playwrights have realised \u2013 the events of 4 November 1989 were so dramatic, they would have been impossible to script. Who would believe a play in which a country gave up the ghost without a shot being fired, and that this helped bring about the end of European communism? All because an apparatchik fumbled his lines. What is intriguing is that the collapse of East Germany was, in many ways, a piece of theatre. The Alexanderplatz demonstration, one of the largest in GDR history, had been planned by actors and directors from leading East German theatres. They invited playwrights and actors to address the crowds, alongside dissidents and politicians. They even had a baddie: the former deputy head of the Stasi secret police spoke \u2013 and was booed. For many, the rallying cry was \u201cWir sind das Volk!\u201d or \u201cWe are the people!\u201d \u2013 a line from Danton\u2019s Death, Georg B\u00fcchner\u2019s 1835 drama about the French Revolution. Adding to the atmosphere of insurrection that autumn \u2013 or seeking to give reality a nudge \u2013 several theatres were staging the play. I came across these stories a few years ago and didn\u2019t know what to make of them. It didn\u2019t seem surprising that theatre-makers had been involved in the protest movement. This was the case in other eastern bloc countries: in Czechoslovakia, the dissident playwright V\u00e1clav Havel even became president. Theatre has often stood in for politics in repressive societies, a debating chamber in another form. And as the old joke goes, in Germany theatre is taken more seriously than real life. But it seemed a stretch, particularly from the perspective of Britain 30 years on, where political theatre often seems a sideshow to the turmoil of real events. It left me with questions. What was it like to make theatre in one of the most surveilled societies on Earth? Why did writers and directors stay in the GDR when so many others fled?

And the absolute truth of it is that it was in fact the Ukip vote that disproportionately hurt the Labour party in the 2015 general election. And, actually, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Conservative majority if it hadn\u2019t been for the effects of the Ukip vote.</p> \n   <p>So this continued lazy thinking, that somehow Brexit voters are all Conservatives, is nonsense. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the academic Rob Ford argues that in this election the Conservatives would be more likely than Labour to lose votes to the Brexit party. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/01/general-election-news-latest-brexit-farage-restates-call-for-brexit-party-pact-with-tories-live-news?page=with:block-5dbc2c228f08cb84c60a2d6b#block-5dbc2c228f08cb84c60a2d6b\"> 1.04pm.) </a>And two academics from the British Election Survey, <strong>Jon Mellon </strong>and<strong> Geoffrey Evans</strong>, have just published <a href=\"https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/uncategorized/is-nigel-farage-a-threat-to-labour/#.XbxWim_7RHe\">a blog on the BES website</a> arguing the same point. Here is their conclusion.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>How might this play out with the Brexit party this time? Our most recent data was collected right after the European parliament elections in June when the Brexit party was briefly leading the polls. Taken together, the Brexit party drew 72% of its support from 2017 Conservatives and 17% from 2017 Labour voters. In Labour-held seats, this gap narrows slightly to 64% Conservatives and 24% Labour voters. There are some caveats. It is possible that there may be some small subset of seats where the Brexit party is more attractive to recent Labour voters, and the Conservatives have done a good job of reclaiming Brexit party voters since June. But even with these caveats, it is hard to see how the Brexit party will hurt Labour more than the Conservatives.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T16:34:46.637Z\">at 4.34pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dbc541a8f08c428d8934dee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T15:50:09.490Z\">3.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From the Press Association\u2019s chief political photographer <strong>Stefan Rousseau</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/StefanRousseau/status/1190290933557972997\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Photo du Jour: Brexit Pasrty leader, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Nigel_Farage</a> arrives in Westminster for his party\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GE2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GE2019</a> campaign launch.

Farage said Johnson had to \u201cdrop the deal\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So I\u2019m going to say this to Boris Johnson, drop the deal. Drop the deal, because it\u2019s not Brexit, drop the deal, because as these weeks go by, and people discover what it is that you\u2019ve signed up to, they will not like it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is crucial. A lot of the media discussion about a Conservative/Brexit party pact has been premised on the notion that it would create a majority in parliament for Johnson\u2019s version of Brexit. But that is not what Farage is saying at all. He is asking Johnson to abandon what has been the one success of his short premiership (negotiating a version of Brexit acceptable to the EU and to almost the entire Conservative party) and so there is no chance at all of Johnson agreeing to this.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage said the UK should instead negotiate a quick and limited free trade deal with the EU. </strong>He claimed this amounted to a compromise on his behalf, because until now Farage has been calling for a no-deal Brexit. But Farage also said that if this Canada-style deal could not be agreed by July next year, the point at which the UK will have to ask for an extension of the transition if it wants one, the UK should just leave and then trade with the EU on WTO terms, with a view to negotiating a trade deal at some point in the future. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage said that Brexiter supporters backing his proposal (see paragraph above) should then join forces at the election and fight as a \u201cleave alliance\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that, if Johnson did not agree to a pact, the Brexit party would put up candidates in every seat in Britain.</strong> Assuming the Tories refused to join the \u201cleave alliance\u201d, the Brexit party would do two things, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The first is to make sure that every house in this land is informed as to what is in the treaty, and what is in the political declaration, what the costs of this are, what the time implications are, to make people truly understand the extent to which this is a sellout.</p> \n   <p>And the second thing in those circumstances that we will do is we will contest every single seat in England, Scotland and Wales.</p> \n   <p>Please don\u2019t doubt that we are ready. Don\u2019t underestimate our determination, or our organisation. Indeed next Monday we have 500 candidates coming to London, and they will all be signing their candidate forms on that day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked for details of how this might work, Farage said this would have to be negotiated. He accepted that, as the bigger party, the Tories would get a free run in all or most of their seats. But he argued that it would make sense of the Conservatives to stand down in the 150 seats they have never won, allowing the Brexit party to maximise its chances in those constituencies. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/01/general-election-news-latest-brexit-farage-restates-call-for-brexit-party-pact-with-tories-live-news?page=with:block-5dbc16758f08c428d8934ac1#block-5dbc16758f08c428d8934ac1\"> 11.28am.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage claimed that the Brexit party might make an exemption in seats where rival candidates oppose Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now of course I\u2019m open and flexible to local exceptions, and already we are in communication with a number of MPs who are prepared to renounce the withdrawal agreement, to renounce the deal, and they themselves to stand on a ticket of a genuine free trade agreement or leave on WTO terms.</p> \n   <p>In those cases, where MPs say this, we will view them as our friends and not our enemies.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there are few, if any, seats where sitting MPs will renounce Johnson\u2019s deal and propose a harder, Farage-style Brexit instead. All the hardline Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group ended up backing Johnson\u2019s deal. If they were to give Farage the sort of public pledge he is demanding, Conservative HQ might think twice about having them as party candidates because Johnson wants MPs elected who will vote for his deal \u2013 not vote against it. It was telling that Farage did not name any places where he expected this to happen.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage also claimed that there might be informal, non-aggression pacts in certain areas. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>More interestingly, already we\u2019re being approached to put together informal arrangements on the ground, constituencies in which they may have a better chance of winning and we won\u2019t bother to campaign, but equally constituencies in which we have got a better chance of winning and we won\u2019t campaign. And that is already beginning to come together. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This would presumably involve the Brexit party still putting up candidates against Brexiter MPs, but just deciding not to try very hard. It is possible that some prominent Tory or Labour Brexiter MPs could benefit from this sort of arrangement, because they would not have to publicly sign up to the Farage-style Brexit.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d723176575e33caec383002b8dcded5defb6e11\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d723176575e33caec383002b8dcded5defb6e11/0_177_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage at the Brexit party launch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage at the Brexit party launch.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T12:39:36.315Z\">at 12.39pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dbc17e98f08c428d8934ad4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T11:34:14.163Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Are the Tories looking at the polls and thinking they don\u2019t need you?</em></p> \n  <p>If they think that, that\u2019s fine, says Farage.</p> \n  <p>But if the Tories think that, they are wrong.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are not interested in doing any pacts with the Brexit party, or, indeed with anybody else. We are in this to win it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In the past the Conservatives have rejected the idea of a pact with the Brexit party in even stronger terms. In September <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/11/nigel-farage-wont-be-allowed-anywhere-near-government-say-tories\">a Tory source told journalists</a> that Nigel Farage and his close ally Arron Banks were not \u201cfit and proper persons\u201d and that \u201cthey should never be allowed anywhere near government\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But that briefing sounded as if it had been inspired by Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy chief, Dominic Cummings, who has been a harsh critic of Farage\u2019s for years and who spent much of his time as the campaign director of Vote Leave ensuring that Farage had as little as possible to do with the leave campaign, because Cummings thought he was electorally toxic to the people whom Vote Leave needed to win over.</p> \n  <p>However, others in government have got a much higher opinion of Farage. For example, at the Tory conference in Manchester, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/sep/29/brexit-latest-news-tory-conference-boris-johnson-conservative-suggests-his-critics-had-eu-help-drafting-benn-act-to-stop-no-deal-live-new?page=with:block-5d90db438f084ab84172f635#block-5d90db438f084ab84172f635\">described Farage as \u201cin many ways admirable\u201d</a>. In his LBC interview yesterday Donald Trump also claimed that Boris Johnson has \u201ca lot of respect and like\u201d for Farage.</p> \n  <p>(I\u2019ve asked Johnson\u2019s aides if this is correct, but have not had a reply yet. However, given that this was a comment from one person notorious for lying about what he had been told by another person also notorious for being casual with the truth, it would be unwise to treat it as gospel.)</p> \n  <p>Surveys have also shown consistently that around half of Conservative party members do favour a pact with the Brexit party. There is <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2019/11/our-survey-just-over-half-of-party-members-agree-with-trump-and-want-a-conservative-brexit-party-pact.html\">a new one out today from ConservativeHome</a>.</p> \n  <p>In practice, there is almost zero chance of any formal alliance between the two parties. But that does not necessarily rule out some kind of informal, non-aggression pact (Labour and the Lib Dems had one in 1997, which seemed to have an impact in some seats), although if there were any arrangement of this kind, the two parties would do their best to keep it secret.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T10:07:36.494Z\">at 10.07am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dbbf86b8f08d669cdab0e8c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T09:31:18.070Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the Today programme this morning<strong> Barry Gardiner</strong>, the shadow international trade secretary, dismissed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">President Trump\u2019s criticism of Jeremy Corbyn</a> in his LBC interview yesterday. Gardiner said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course he sides with the super-rich, Labour doesn\u2019t.

It\u2019s 1 November. Boris Johnson spent three months swearing blind that by now the UK would be out of the EU. But, for now, we\u2019re still in (and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/31/uk-general-election-2019-poll-tracker\">Johnson\u2019s poll ratings</a>, far from being harmed, are looking as good as they ever have).</p> \n  <p>Today we should get an announcement that will have some bearing on Johnson\u2019s election chances. <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Brexit party leader, is holding his election campaign launch, and he should tell us how many seats his party will fight. There has been speculation that, instead of fighting most seats, as originally planned, it might only concentrate on a few dozen. The conventional wisdom is that that would benefit Labour but, as <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Rowena Mason</strong> reports <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">in the Guardian\u2019s overnight election lead</a>, there is an argument that in some seats having the Brexit party on the ballot will actually help the Tories because it will hoover up more Labour votes.</p> \n  <p>Speaking on LBC this morning, before the launch at 11am, Farage refused to give clues as to whether his party would be fighting a national campaign, or a narrowly focused, constituency-specific one. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Some newspapers are suggesting that we will fight vast numbers of seats, others think we will fight as few as 20 seats. I run a very tight ship, we don\u2019t leak. I will reveal all later on today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But he did restate his call for some sort of alliance with the Conservative party. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can assure you that most of what I say will be about Boris\u2019s deal and the need, in my view, for some kind of Brexit alliance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p>9am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the Scottish National party leader, takes part in a campaign event in Edinburgh.</p> \n  <p>11am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, launches his party\u2019s election campaign at the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster.</p> \n  <p>10.30am: Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, takes part in a campaign event in Fife.</p> \n  <p>Midday: Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, launches a campaign ad van in Aberdeen.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on general election developments.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Farage has launched his general election campaign by saying his Brexit party will contest every seat in the country unless Boris Johnson agrees to drop his deal with the EU and sign up to a \u201cleave alliance\u201d. See 12.27pm for a full summary. Nigel Farage has \u201ceffectively handed\u201d seats such as Hartlepool to Labour with his pledge to contest every seat and potentially split the leave vote in December\u2019s election, the chairman of the town\u2019s Conservative party has said. Boris Johnson\u2019s government has been accused of going on a spending spree using taxpayers\u2019 money to woo voters in swing seats in the run up to the general election. Britain\u2019s factories suffered a sixth consecutive month of falling new orders in October as ongoing Brexit uncertainty hit demand from domestic customers. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. In his speech this morning Nigel Farage suggested that Labour could lose out more than the Conservatives if the Brexit party stood in every seat in Britain. (See 11.08am.) He said: Something I think that was completely misunderstood the last time I did this, which was in 2015, when I lead Ukip into that general election \u2013 everyone seemed to think that because Ukip were fielding hundreds of candidates, we would have a very negative effect on the Conservative party. And the absolute truth of it is that it was in fact the Ukip vote that disproportionately hurt the Labour party in the 2015 general election. And, actually, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Conservative majority if it hadn\u2019t been for the effects of the Ukip vote. So this continued lazy thinking, that somehow Brexit voters are all Conservatives, is nonsense. But the academic Rob Ford argues that in this election the Conservatives would be more likely than Labour to lose votes to the Brexit party. (See 1.04pm.) And two academics from the British Election Survey, Jon Mellon and Geoffrey Evans, have just published a blog on the BES website arguing the same point. Here is their conclusion. How might this play out with the Brexit party this time? Our most recent data was collected right after the European parliament elections in June when the Brexit party was briefly leading the polls. Taken together, the Brexit party drew 72% of its support from 2017 Conservatives and 17% from 2017 Labour voters. In Labour-held seats, this gap narrows slightly to 64% Conservatives and 24% Labour voters. There are some caveats. It is possible that there may be some small subset of seats where the Brexit party is more attractive to recent Labour voters, and the Conservatives have done a good job of reclaiming Brexit party voters since June. But even with these caveats, it is hard to see how the Brexit party will hurt Labour more than the Conservatives. From the Press Association\u2019s chief political photographer Stefan Rousseau Steve Baker, the Conservative MP who chairs the European Research Group, which represents hardline Tory Brexiters, has accused Nigel Farage of putting Brexit at risk. Echoing comments by his ERG colleague Mark Francois (see 1.55pm), Baker told the Press Association: The reason every Conservative Eurosceptic MP backed the deal is that it can deliver a Brexit worth having. But Boris will only negotiate a great future for the UK if he has a good majority of resolute Conservative MPs. Nigel now risks that and our future. It is completely inconceivable that the Conservative party would now go for no deal and a pact. Is Nigel a statesman or a campaigner? We are about to find out. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said she is confident that a Labour government would allow Edinburgh to hold a second independence referendum. Speaking at an election event this morning, she said she would send a letter \u201cbefore Christmas\u201d to whoever was in 10 Downing Street requesting powers under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998 for the Scottish parliament to have the right to hold another vote. Asked if she thought Labour would grant a section 30 order, Sturgeon replied emphatically: \u201cYes.\u201d Asked to explain why she was so confident, she replied: \u201cI\u2019m a believer in the power of democracy.\u201d She also said she would interpret a strong vote for the Scottish National party at the election as backing for a second independence referendum. She explained: If people in Scotland demonstrate the desire \u2013 as I believe they will in this election \u2013 for an independence referendum, then I don\u2019t believe Westminster opposition to the principle or to the timetable to that will prove to be sustainable. Everybody knows there\u2019s going to be an independence referendum. The opposition parties might not have got round to conceding that point in public, but they know it and everybody knows it. Jeremy Corbyn has not ruled out allowing Scotland to hold a second independence referendum, but he has said he would not want to allow this in the early years of the next parliament. Sturgeon said she met Corbyn last week but that their focus then, and in other recent discussions, was on Brexit and parliamentary tactics. She added: I don\u2019t think Jeremy Corbyn is under any illusions, though, about my position around independence and a referendum. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford This morning I got this question from a reader BTL (below the line). I didn\u2019t have an answer myself, but I asked the Electoral Commission, and a spokesperson sent me this reply. It\u2019s not possible to suspend or postpone polling in case of bad weather. It\u2019s important to remember that local councils have plenty of experience of providing public services throughout the year and are used to the winter weather conditions in their area. They have contingency plans in place to help them respond quickly to minimise any disruption to polling, and will do everything they can to ensure voters are able to cast their vote on 12 December. Mark Francois, the MP and deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents hardline Tory Brexiters, told the BBC\u2019s World at One that he thought Nigel Farage had \u201cscrewed up\u201d this morning because his rejection of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was unreasonable. Francois explained: I think Nigel screwed it up. If you genuinely want to work with another political party, you don\u2019t go on live national television and call them liars, which is what he did. He said Boris\u2019s deal doesn\u2019t take us out of the European Union. That is not true. It does take us out of the European Union. That\u2019s why I and my fellow so-called Spartans [the 28 Tory Brexiters who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times] voted for it. We would never, ever have voted for it if we thought it kept us in. I\u2019m sorry, but Nigel is just simply mistaken. If that was meant to be to be an olive branch, Nigel completely cocked it up. Francois also said he did not think any of his fellow Tory Brexiters would be intimidated by the prospect of the Brexit party standing against them. He said: Do you really think he is going to bully people like Bill Cash or IDS or Owen Paterson? Have you never met these people? Look at the MPs who voted for the deal \u2013 Sir Bill Cash, Owen Paterson, John Redwood, Andrew Bridgen, Steve Baker, myself \u2013 all lifelong Eurosceptics. Do you really think we would have voted for that deal if we thought it kept us into the European Union? Of course not. I\u2019m sorry, Nigel is a very talented politician, but anyone who works with him will tell you he\u2019s often his own worst enemy. And his ego has got the better of him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to bully any Tory MP into doing anything they don\u2019t want to do. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley There is some new polling out today, from Panelbase. Of course, the usual caveats apply. Rob Ford, the politics professor and co-author of a seminal book on the Ukip vote, thinks that if the Brexit party does stand candidates all over Britain, the Conservatives will lose out more than Labour. If you want to know more about the \u201cecological fallacy\u201d, there is an explanation here. This is what journalists and commentators are saying about Nigel Farage\u2019s speech. From the Economist\u2019s Philip Coggan From my colleague Jonathan Freedland From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the Financial Times\u2019 Robert Shrimsley From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall The Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, has put out this statement in response to Nigel Farage\u2019s speech. Cleverly said: A vote for Farage risks letting Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street via the back door \u2013 and the country spending 2020 having two referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence. It will not get Brexit done \u2013 and it will create another gridlocked parliament that doesn\u2019t work. (As stated before, the \u2018two referendums\u2019 claim is not strictly true.) From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Here are the main points from what Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, was saying in his speech and Q&amp;A about the conditions he is offering for a pact with the Conservative party. Farage said he wanted Boris Johnson to abandon the withdrawal agreement he has negotiated with the EU. Echoing the arguments made by President Trump in his LBC interview yesterday, Farage said it did not amount to proper Brexit because the level playing field conditions in the political declaration meant the UK would end up being tied to EU regulations, making trade deals with countries like the US impossible in practice. Farage said Johnson had to \u201cdrop the deal\u201d. So I\u2019m going to say this to Boris Johnson, drop the deal. Drop the deal, because it\u2019s not Brexit, drop the deal, because as these weeks go by, and people discover what it is that you\u2019ve signed up to, they will not like it. This is crucial. A lot of the media discussion about a Conservative/Brexit party pact has been premised on the notion that it would create a majority in parliament for Johnson\u2019s version of Brexit. But that is not what Farage is saying at all. He is asking Johnson to abandon what has been the one success of his short premiership (negotiating a version of Brexit acceptable to the EU and to almost the entire Conservative party) and so there is no chance at all of Johnson agreeing to this. Farage said the UK should instead negotiate a quick and limited free trade deal with the EU. He claimed this amounted to a compromise on his behalf, because until now Farage has been calling for a no-deal Brexit. But Farage also said that if this Canada-style deal could not be agreed by July next year, the point at which the UK will have to ask for an extension of the transition if it wants one, the UK should just leave and then trade with the EU on WTO terms, with a view to negotiating a trade deal at some point in the future. Farage said that Brexiter supporters backing his proposal (see paragraph above) should then join forces at the election and fight as a \u201cleave alliance\u201d. He said that, if Johnson did not agree to a pact, the Brexit party would put up candidates in every seat in Britain. Assuming the Tories refused to join the \u201cleave alliance\u201d, the Brexit party would do two things, he said: The first is to make sure that every house in this land is informed as to what is in the treaty, and what is in the political declaration, what the costs of this are, what the time implications are, to make people truly understand the extent to which this is a sellout. And the second thing in those circumstances that we will do is we will contest every single seat in England, Scotland and Wales. Please don\u2019t doubt that we are ready. Don\u2019t underestimate our determination, or our organisation. Indeed next Monday we have 500 candidates coming to London, and they will all be signing their candidate forms on that day. Asked for details of how this might work, Farage said this would have to be negotiated. He accepted that, as the bigger party, the Tories would get a free run in all or most of their seats. But he argued that it would make sense of the Conservatives to stand down in the 150 seats they have never won, allowing the Brexit party to maximise its chances in those constituencies. (See 11.28am.) Farage claimed that the Brexit party might make an exemption in seats where rival candidates oppose Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan. He said: Now of course I\u2019m open and flexible to local exceptions, and already we are in communication with a number of MPs who are prepared to renounce the withdrawal agreement, to renounce the deal, and they themselves to stand on a ticket of a genuine free trade agreement or leave on WTO terms. In those cases, where MPs say this, we will view them as our friends and not our enemies. But there are few, if any, seats where sitting MPs will renounce Johnson\u2019s deal and propose a harder, Farage-style Brexit instead. All the hardline Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group ended up backing Johnson\u2019s deal. If they were to give Farage the sort of public pledge he is demanding, Conservative HQ might think twice about having them as party candidates because Johnson wants MPs elected who will vote for his deal \u2013 not vote against it. It was telling that Farage did not name any places where he expected this to happen. Farage also claimed that there might be informal, non-aggression pacts in certain areas. He said: More interestingly, already we\u2019re being approached to put together informal arrangements on the ground, constituencies in which they may have a better chance of winning and we won\u2019t bother to campaign, but equally constituencies in which we have got a better chance of winning and we won\u2019t campaign. And that is already beginning to come together. This would presumably involve the Brexit party still putting up candidates against Brexiter MPs, but just deciding not to try very hard. It is possible that some prominent Tory or Labour Brexiter MPs could benefit from this sort of arrangement, because they would not have to publicly sign up to the Farage-style Brexit. Q: Are the Tories looking at the polls and thinking they don\u2019t need you? If they think that, that\u2019s fine, says Farage. But if the Tories think that, they are wrong. No one party owns the Brexit vote, he says. And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary soon. Q: What if Boris Johnson offers you something, and then changes his mind once nominations have closed? Farage says Johnson has changed his mind in the past. Q: Is there at least a risk of you splitting the vote? Farage does accept this. That is what happened in the Peterborough byelection, he says. His party could have won that seat if the Tories were not standing, he says. And in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection the Tories would have won if the Brexit party had not been standing. He says the mathematics of a deal work. Q: So you could be risking Brexit? No, says Farage. He says Johnson\u2019s deal is not Brexit. Q: Won\u2019t you damage the Tory prospects, and stop Brexit happening? Farage says Johnson is like a used-car salesman. The car may look fine from the outside. But it isn\u2019t. This is not real Brexit, he says. Q: Do you blame Dominic Cummings for the Tories\u2019 refusal to offer a pact? Farage says he does not know. But he is sure Cummings is a charming chap, he says sarcastically. Q: What are the terms? Do they have to let you stand in those 150 seats? Farage says there will be a negotiation. But he has set out the upper end of his negotiation. Q: How many seats could you win? Farage says he knows how difficult it is winning seats under first-past-the-post. But the two-party system is crumbling, and now parties can win seats with just over 30% of the vote. So it has better prospects than in the past. Q: Boris Johnson will never accept this. Isn\u2019t this just a waste of time? Farage says he is not wasting time. He is selecting candidates. But he is prepared to put country before party. He says he thinks there will come a point in the next couple of weeks when the Tories realise they have no choice. He does not mind if they agree a pact out of principle, or because they are worried. He just wants it to happen. Q: Will you stand, and where? Farage says he will announce this in the next few days. But he does not want to say today, because it would be a distraction. Q: Could a vote for the Brexit party stop Brexit, by costing the Tories votes? Farage says what Johnson is planning is \u201cnot Brexit\u201d. He says Brexiters will be appalled when they realise exactly what Johnson is planning. Q: What conversations are you having with the Tories about this? Farage says he has not had formal talks. But informal conversations are taking place, including some in the PM\u2019s \u201cinner sanctum\u201d. He says some of them are interested. Some would rather lose than have a pact. But he says there is a big majority in the Conservative party that wants this. Farage has now finished his opening speech. He is now taking questions. Q: How many candidates will you stand if the Tories do accept this deal? And when must they decide? Farage says nominations close on 14 November. He says he recognises the Tories are a much bigger party. But there are 150 seats that the Tories have never won in their history. He says these are the seats where the Brexit party would do better, he says. There could be a non-aggression pact. That would benefit the Brexit cause, he says. He says the Johnson deal is so bad it would amount to \u201cthe end of Brexit\u201d. Farage says he is open to being flexible in particular seats. He suggests if MPs are willing to renounce Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, his party will stand aside. And he says there could be informal pacts on the ground between Brexit supporters. But he says he hopes common sense will prevail, and Johnson will agree to a pact. But if he doesn\u2019t, the Brexit party will fight the Tories, he says. Farage says the only way to solve the Brexit impasse is to create a leave alliance. That does not just mean Tories and the Brexit party, he says. He says there are other leavers who might join. He says, if that were to happen, they could become, as President Trump said yesterday, \u201can unstoppable force\u201d. If that does not happen, the Brexit party will be the only party standing up for Brexit. He says it will make sure that every house in the land gets information about how the deal is a sell-out. And he says the party will contest every seat in Britain. Farage says Boris Johnson claims his plan is a great deal. But it isn\u2019t. It is not Brexit, he claims. Farage says Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has been a much more brilliant negotiator than anyone on the UK side. The EU is heading for regulatory alignment, he says. And he says he is glad President Trump made it clear last night that the Johnson plan would obstruct a UK-US trade deal. The Johnson plan would give the UK all of the disadvantages of EU membership, but none of the advantages of being out. He says if the UK adopted that plan, it would trigger a campaign to rejoin the EU. And he says that campaign would succeed. Farage claims Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal so bad that it would lead to the UK deciding to rejoin the EU. Johnson should drop this deal, he says. Farage says he will be in the east Midlands, the north-east, south Wales, London and Workington next week. In 2015, when he led Ukip into the general election, people thought it would have a negative effect on the Conservative party. But in fact the Ukip vote disproportionately hurt the Labour party, he says. He says that is why the Tories were able to get a majority. He says the idea that Brexit party supporters are all Tories is \u201clazy thinking\u201d. Farage suggests Labour, not Tories, could lose out most from his party\u2019s campaigning. Nigel Farage says the UK is still in the EU, even though it was meant to be out by now. That is why people have lost faith in politics. And that is why he has come back to frontline politics. The sheer level of broken promises is astonishing. Farage says Labour said it would respect the referendum result. But now it is planning to offer voters a choice between remain and remain. (Farage argues that a soft Brexit amounts to remain.) That is a \u201cbetrayal\u201d, he says. Richard Tice, the party chair, is speaking again. He says the Brexit party has turned anger into hope. It has hundreds of prospective candidates, led by Nigel Farage, ready to fight the election. Farage takes to the stage. Fox says Labour is also keen to avoid talking about Brexit. She says it should be embarrassed about the way remainers have depicted leavers as ignorant. And she says Labour has not been willing to challenge the pro-business features of the EU. She goes on: Labour\u2019s radicalism is, in truth, rather timid. She says the Brexit party is an insurgent party that could change politics for good. Claire Fox, another Brexit party MEP, is speaking now. She says the election has already shown that stereotypes about Brexit party voters are wrong. There have been claims that \u201cWorkington man\u201d is now the archetypal leave voter. But people in Workington reject this, she says. She says she is alarmed by Boris Johnson talking about the need to get Brexit done, so he can focus on domestic issues. That ignores the radical promise offered by Brexit, she says. She says Brexit should be a chance to have \u201croot and branch democratic reform\u201d, as highlighted by the constitutional reform plans mentioned by Richard Tice earlier. (See 10.42am.) Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory minister who is now a Brexit party MEP, is speaking now. She says she wants to explain the reasons, beyond Brexit, why she supports the party. She says the behaviour of parliament has been outragreous. When she was an MP, parliamentarians did not lie, she says. She says Theresa May claimed her deal would not involve the UK being trapped in the customs union forever. But, when the full text of the attorney general\u2019s legal advice was published, it became clear that what May had said was untrue. The AG said the UK could be trapped in the customs union. Widdecombe says, for her, that was the moment when she decided to act. She says Boris Johnson promised that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October even though \u201che knew darn well\u201d that parliament would probably block this. I do believe that we have rotten, rotten politics in this country at the moment. She says she has now \u201clost all confidence\u201d in both the two main parties. Tice says the Brexit party would introduce a \u00a3200bn spending programme. He says the money would come from three areas. 1 - Scrapping HS2 would save \u00a3100bn, he says. 2 - The UK could save \u00a339bn by not paying its divorce bill to the EU, he claims. And he claims British officials wasted another \u00a37bn by not recovering money from the European Investment Bank. 3 - And the UK should also halve its aid spending, and use the money for domestic projects. Tice says \u00a3100bn of this money should be spent in the left-behind regions, in particular on \u201coven-ready\u201d road and rail projects. He says high-speed wifi should be rolled out across the whole country. And he says business rates should be cut to help high streets thrive. Tice says politics needs to change. And that change needs to start in this \u201cstinking, rotten borough of Westminster\u201d, he says. He says the electoral system needs to be reformed. Millions of votes do not count, and millions of people do not vote because they know their vote does not count. He says we need proportional representation. The House of Lords needs to be replaced with a smaller, elected second chamber, he says. He says, if MPs change parties, a recall system should allow a byelection to be called. There is too much postal voting, he says. He says the government should revert to the previous system. And he calls for the supreme court to be subject to political scrutiny. That is because it is now a political court, he says. And he says that begs the question as to whether a written constitution is needed. The Brexit party launch has just started. Nigel Farage, the party leader, is due to speak at 11am, but we are getting various speeches first. Richard Tice, the party chair, is opening proceedings. He says it should be clear now that the Conservatives cannot deliver Brexit. We are just about to install a live feed at the top of this blog. From the Times\u2019s Steven Swinford From my colleague Josh Halliday On the Today programme this morning Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, restated the party\u2019s opposition to a pact with the Brexit party. He said: We are not interested in doing any pacts with the Brexit party, or, indeed with anybody else. We are in this to win it. In the past the Conservatives have rejected the idea of a pact with the Brexit party in even stronger terms. In September a Tory source told journalists that Nigel Farage and his close ally Arron Banks were not \u201cfit and proper persons\u201d and that \u201cthey should never be allowed anywhere near government\u201d. But that briefing sounded as if it had been inspired by Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy chief, Dominic Cummings, who has been a harsh critic of Farage\u2019s for years and who spent much of his time as the campaign director of Vote Leave ensuring that Farage had as little as possible to do with the leave campaign, because Cummings thought he was electorally toxic to the people whom Vote Leave needed to win over. However, others in government have got a much higher opinion of Farage. For example, at the Tory conference in Manchester, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, described Farage as \u201cin many ways admirable\u201d. In his LBC interview yesterday Donald Trump also claimed that Boris Johnson has \u201ca lot of respect and like\u201d for Farage. (I\u2019ve asked Johnson\u2019s aides if this is correct, but have not had a reply yet. However, given that this was a comment from one person notorious for lying about what he had been told by another person also notorious for being casual with the truth, it would be unwise to treat it as gospel.) Surveys have also shown consistently that around half of Conservative party members do favour a pact with the Brexit party. There is a new one out today from ConservativeHome. In practice, there is almost zero chance of any formal alliance between the two parties. But that does not necessarily rule out some kind of informal, non-aggression pact (Labour and the Lib Dems had one in 1997, which seemed to have an impact in some seats), although if there were any arrangement of this kind, the two parties would do their best to keep it secret. On the Today programme this morning Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, dismissed President Trump\u2019s criticism of Jeremy Corbyn in his LBC interview yesterday. Gardiner said: Of course he sides with the super-rich, Labour doesn\u2019t. So, it\u2019s no surprise to me that he thinks it would be bad news for people like him. Given Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the UK, his non-endorsement is almost certainly a boost to Corbyn. It adds a bit more plausibility to the claim that voting Labour would stop the NHS being opened up to US companies by a Tory UK-US trade deal (\u2018That must be why Trump is so opposed to Corbyn\u2019). And, as the huge anti-Trump demonstrations in the UK have shown, there are a lot of people who would like to find a way of expressing their opposition to the US president. As the Times\u2019s Matt Chorley points out with the polling figures below, the Trump intervention could firm up Corbyn\u2019s standing among possible Lib Dem voters, because Lib Dem supporters seem to dislike the US president even more than Labour ones do. Good Morning. It\u2019s 1 November. Boris Johnson spent three months swearing blind that by now the UK would be out of the EU. But, for now, we\u2019re still in (and Johnson\u2019s poll ratings, far from being harmed, are looking as good as they ever have). Today we should get an announcement that will have some bearing on Johnson\u2019s election chances. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is holding his election campaign launch, and he should tell us how many seats his party will fight. There has been speculation that, instead of fighting most seats, as originally planned, it might only concentrate on a few dozen. The conventional wisdom is that that would benefit Labour but, as Rowena Mason reports in the Guardian\u2019s overnight election lead, there is an argument that in some seats having the Brexit party on the ballot will actually help the Tories because it will hoover up more Labour votes. Speaking on LBC this morning, before the launch at 11am, Farage refused to give clues as to whether his party would be fighting a national campaign, or a narrowly focused, constituency-specific one. He said: Some newspapers are suggesting that we will fight vast numbers of seats, others think we will fight as few as 20 seats. I run a very tight ship, we don\u2019t leak. I will reveal all later on today. But he did restate his call for some sort of alliance with the Conservative party. He said: I can assure you that most of what I say will be about Boris\u2019s deal and the need, in my view, for some kind of Brexit alliance. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the Scottish National party leader, takes part in a campaign event in Edinburgh. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, launches his party\u2019s election campaign at the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster. 10.30am: Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, takes part in a campaign event in Fife. Midday: Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, launches a campaign ad van in Aberdeen. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing almost exclusively on general election developments. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "body": "<p>A report on Russian interference in British politics allegedly being sat on by Downing Street includes evidence from Christopher Steele, the former head of MI6\u2019s Russia desk whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/15/christopher-steele-trump-russia-dossier-accurate\">investigation into Donald Trump</a>\u2019s links with Moscow sparked a US political scandal.</p> <p>Steele made submissions in writing to parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC), it is understood. A counter-intelligence specialist, Steele spent his career tracking Russian influence operations around the world and investigated Alexander Litvinenko\u2019s 2006 murder.</p> <p>The cross-party committee has been examining Russian interference in British politics for more than a year. It took evidence from both the UK\u2019s spy agencies and experts on Kremlin intelligence and disinformation tactics such as Steele.</p> <p>Members examined claims that the Kremlin tried to distort the result of the 2016 EU referendum, starting work after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/13/theresa-may-accuses-russia-of-interfering-in-elections-and-fake-news\">former prime minister Theresa May had warned that Russia was sowing discord by \u201cweaponising information\u201d</a> in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/boris-johnson-accused-report-russia-dominic-grieve\">Johnson accused of withholding key report on Russia from voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report was due to be published on Monday. However on Thursday, Dominic Grieve, the MP who chairs the committee, accused Boris Johnson of sitting on the report \u2013 potentially preventing its publication before the general election.</p> <p>Downing Street is normally given 10 working days to clear an ISC report, to ensure it contains no classified matters, according to ISC sources \u2013 although No 10 has disputed this, saying the process typically takes six weeks.</p> <p>No 10 sources said that clearance was not expected to be given on Friday, leaving only Monday and Tuesday for the document to appear before parliament dissolves. It cannot be published when the Commons does not sit, meaning if approval is withheld it will not appear before next month\u2019s general election, which has already prompted allegations by opposition politicians of a cover-up.</p> <p>Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Grieve said no explanation had been given for the \u201capparent delay\u201d, with the report passed to Downing Street on 17 October. Sources said Britain\u2019s spy agencies had already signed off the report before it was passed to No 10 for final sign off.</p> <p>Two sources told BuzzFeed that British intelligence found no evidence of Russian meddling in either the 2016 referendum vote or the 2017 general election. However, Steele\u2019s involvement in the committee\u2019s unpublished dossier raises the stakes considerably. Before going into private business intelligence, Steele spent 22 years as an MI6 officer, including four years at the British embassy in Moscow, where he watched the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>In 2006 Steele led the MI6 investigation into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">polonium killing of Litvinenko</a>, a former FSB officer turned dissident. Steele swiftly concluded the Russian state was responsible. A 2015-16 public inquiry ruled that Vladimir Putin had \u201cprobably approved\u201d the hit carried out by two Moscow assassins.</p> <p>Steele\u2019s privately commissioned dossier on Trump and Russia \u2013 leaked in January 2016 \u2013 said that the Kremlin had been cultivating the future US president for at least five years. In April the US special counsel Robert Mueller corroborated Steele\u2019s central claim that the Russians ran a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d operation in 2016 to help Trump win.</p> <p>Since then Steele\u2019s firm Orbis has documented attempts by Russia to influence election outcomes in several European states. Unlike in Soviet times, when the Kremlin supported western communists, Moscow now uses covert and overt methods to boost populist far-right parties, including via social media.</p> <p>The intelligence and security committee exists to provide cross-party oversight of the government\u2019s security and intelligence activities. It meets weekly in secret at undisclosed locations, although its reports are made public.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s inquiry in Russian activity in the UK began in November 2017, and research was commissioned from the intelligence agencies, while submissions were sought from third-party experts.</p> <p>Four months later, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/novichok-poisonings\">novichok poisoning</a> of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury intensified the committee\u2019s programme of work. Written evidence was collected by the end of June 2018, and oral hearings were held in the second half of 2018.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s annual report said that members examined allegations about \u201cRussia\u2019s interference in the UK\u2019s EU referendum and the possible interference with UK political parties\u2019 data\u201d.</p> <p>Experts who gave evidence were informed on Wednesday evening that the report was due to be published imminently. The decision to stop it from coming out is being seen inside Whitehall as unusual.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A report on Russian interference in British politics allegedly being sat on by Downing Street includes evidence from Christopher Steele, the former head of MI6\u2019s Russia desk whose investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s links with Moscow sparked a US political scandal. Steele made submissions in writing to parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC), it is understood. A counter-intelligence specialist, Steele spent his career tracking Russian influence operations around the world and investigated Alexander Litvinenko\u2019s 2006 murder. The cross-party committee has been examining Russian interference in British politics for more than a year. It took evidence from both the UK\u2019s spy agencies and experts on Kremlin intelligence and disinformation tactics such as Steele. Members examined claims that the Kremlin tried to distort the result of the 2016 EU referendum, starting work after the former prime minister Theresa May had warned that Russia was sowing discord by \u201cweaponising information\u201d in the UK. The report was due to be published on Monday. However on Thursday, Dominic Grieve, the MP who chairs the committee, accused Boris Johnson of sitting on the report \u2013 potentially preventing its publication before the general election. Downing Street is normally given 10 working days to clear an ISC report, to ensure it contains no classified matters, according to ISC sources \u2013 although No 10 has disputed this, saying the process typically takes six weeks. No 10 sources said that clearance was not expected to be given on Friday, leaving only Monday and Tuesday for the document to appear before parliament dissolves. It cannot be published when the Commons does not sit, meaning if approval is withheld it will not appear before next month\u2019s general election, which has already prompted allegations by opposition politicians of a cover-up. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Grieve said no explanation had been given for the \u201capparent delay\u201d, with the report passed to Downing Street on 17 October. Sources said Britain\u2019s spy agencies had already signed off the report before it was passed to No 10 for final sign off. Two sources told BuzzFeed that British intelligence found no evidence of Russian meddling in either the 2016 referendum vote or the 2017 general election. However, Steele\u2019s involvement in the committee\u2019s unpublished dossier raises the stakes considerably. Before going into private business intelligence, Steele spent 22 years as an MI6 officer, including four years at the British embassy in Moscow, where he watched the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 2006 Steele led the MI6 investigation into the polonium killing of Litvinenko, a former FSB officer turned dissident. Steele swiftly concluded the Russian state was responsible. A 2015-16 public inquiry ruled that Vladimir Putin had \u201cprobably approved\u201d the hit carried out by two Moscow assassins. Steele\u2019s privately commissioned dossier on Trump and Russia \u2013 leaked in January 2016 \u2013 said that the Kremlin had been cultivating the future US president for at least five years. In April the US special counsel Robert Mueller corroborated Steele\u2019s central claim that the Russians ran a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d operation in 2016 to help Trump win. Since then Steele\u2019s firm Orbis has documented attempts by Russia to influence election outcomes in several European states. Unlike in Soviet times, when the Kremlin supported western communists, Moscow now uses covert and overt methods to boost populist far-right parties, including via social media. The intelligence and security committee exists to provide cross-party oversight of the government\u2019s security and intelligence activities. It meets weekly in secret at undisclosed locations, although its reports are made public. The committee\u2019s inquiry in Russian activity in the UK began in November 2017, and research was commissioned from the intelligence agencies, while submissions were sought from third-party experts. Four months later, the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury intensified the committee\u2019s programme of work. Written evidence was collected by the end of June 2018, and oral hearings were held in the second half of 2018. The committee\u2019s annual report said that members examined allegations about \u201cRussia\u2019s interference in the UK\u2019s EU referendum and the possible interference with UK political parties\u2019 data\u201d. Experts who gave evidence were informed on Wednesday evening that the report was due to be published imminently. The decision to stop it from coming out is being seen inside Whitehall as unusual.",

That\u2019s always the danger when you are up against Kolbe and even if it doesn\u2019t happen, he makes defenders think about it, he spooks them. In the semi-final against Wales, we saw South Africa rely on their kick-chase tactics and I do expect them to do the same again.

The Springboks are being criticised in South Africa for their style of play but I do not think that is fair, not when Kolbe is in the side.

      "bodyText": "The great irony of this South Africa team is that while there has been so much talk of how physical they are, how they are direct, belligerent, and even boring, their most dangerous weapon is 5ft 7in and 75kg wet through. Cheslin Kolbe is one the most lethal attacking players in the world at the moment and there is every chance that if the final is close and cagey, as a lot of people think it will be, he could make all the difference. Four years ago it was Nehe Milner-Skudder, another pint-sized wing, who lit up the World Cup and now it is Kolbe. Jonny May has a job on his hands up against him and as much as May has improved defensively over the last couple of years and, as quick as he is, if he finds himself isolated one-one-one with Kolbe \u2026 well let\u2019s just say I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in that position. England, it must be said, have been outstanding at maintaining their defensive integrity throughout the competition and particularly against the All Blacks. I thought Manu Tuilagi had a blinding match against them, as much without the ball as with it. He was able to get in Richie Mo\u2019unga\u2019s eyeline, force him back inside and that allowed Sam Underhill and Tom Curry to do their damage. That is going to be crucial again because if South Africa dominate the gainline and the ruck area and can get quick ball for Faf de Klerk to feed on, Kolbe will be heavily involved. England will also have to kick well and chase well. If not, Kolbe can rip anyone to shreds in the broken field. England will also have to be mindful in terms of their discipline. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much Kolbe\u2019s height, but his ability to change direction so quickly that can cause all manner of problems. As a committed defender you are desperate to shut down his space but if, all of a sudden, he goes from left to right or vice versa, at a rate of knots and you just stick out an arm, you are going to be in trouble.

England had won four Tests straight, so the grand slam was on the line. Thomas had not played a rugby union Test for six years, but after playing 103 of them he knew as well as anyone what it took to win the big games. And as he watched England warm up, he could see they didn\u2019t have it. \u201cI looked at England\u2019s so-called match-winners, like Owen Farrell, and saw a bunch of boys,\u201d he wrote later. \u201cTheir game faces were on, but I saw something else in their eyes, they weren\u2019t prepared.\u201d England lost, 30-3.</p> \n<p>Six years, seven months later, and it is the World Cup semi-final at the International Stadium in Yokohama. The All Blacks, back-to-back world champions, have gathered into a pyramid to start the haka. In response, England have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/29/england-fined-new-zealand-haka-world-cup\" title=\"\">split into a V</a>, two diagonal lines of 11 leading back to Farrell, their captain, at the centre. The camera cut to him standing, hands on hips. And what did we see in his eyes then, as the director moved in for a close-up, but a man who knew, who felt, with complete and utter confidence that he and his team were ready for what was in front of them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/01/band-brothers-world-cup-final-wisdom-england-sibling\">Band of brothers: World Cup final words of wisdom from England siblings</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>You could have a good conversation with Farrell about leadership.

      "bodyText": "Gareth Thomas tells it like this. It was Saturday 16 March 2013, the last weekend of the Six Nations, and England were playing Wales in Cardiff. England had won four Tests straight, so the grand slam was on the line. Thomas had not played a rugby union Test for six years, but after playing 103 of them he knew as well as anyone what it took to win the big games. And as he watched England warm up, he could see they didn\u2019t have it. \u201cI looked at England\u2019s so-called match-winners, like Owen Farrell, and saw a bunch of boys,\u201d he wrote later. \u201cTheir game faces were on, but I saw something else in their eyes, they weren\u2019t prepared.\u201d England lost, 30-3. Six years, seven months later, and it is the World Cup semi-final at the International Stadium in Yokohama. The All Blacks, back-to-back world champions, have gathered into a pyramid to start the haka. In response, England have split into a V, two diagonal lines of 11 leading back to Farrell, their captain, at the centre. The camera cut to him standing, hands on hips. And what did we see in his eyes then, as the director moved in for a close-up, but a man who knew, who felt, with complete and utter confidence that he and his team were ready for what was in front of them. You could have a good conversation with Farrell about leadership. Last year he wrote a 12,000 word dissertation on reflective learning as part of his degree course in management and leadership. But you won\u2019t get him to open up about it in public. There isn\u2019t a player around who is less interested in the trimmings of the game. He disdains his publicity. The only time you ever see him retreat is when there is a camera in his face. A photographer hired to take his portrait tells how Farrell spent their three-minute shoot refusing to look at the camera, and muttering \u201cI fucking hate this\u201d under his breath. So you have that conversation with everyone else. \u201cI think he\u2019s been a captain ever since he was born, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d says Lawrence Dallaglio, talking at an event to promote Land Rover\u2019s sponsorship of the tournament. \u201cHe\u2019s probably heard moves even before he was born.

      "body": "<h2>AND ALL YOU NEEDED WAS JUST A LITTLE TIME</h2> <p>2019 hasn\u2019t been kind to many of us, not least your fifth-favourite tea-timely football email. But spare a thought for Nathan Jones. The Welshman\u2019s hopes of becoming \u201cthe world\u2019s best manager\u201d have stalled during a dreadful 10-month spell at Stoke, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/01/stoke-city-sack-nathan-jones-championship-club-relegation-zone-football\">mercifully brought to an end</a> on Friday. Let\u2019s relive the coach\u2019s year in quotes:</p> <p><strong>9 January:</strong> Jones leaves League One high-flyers Luton to replace Gary Rowett at Stoke. \u201dThis is not a job for me, this is a lifestyle,\u201d he tells assembled hacks. \u201cIf the players buy into that from the beginning, just think how good they will feel years down the line when we are where we want to be. In the words of Miley Cyrus, it\u2019s the climb.\u201d</p> <p><strong>26 January:</strong> Stoke are knocked out of the FA Cup by Shrewsbury, but bounce back to beat Nasty Leeds (\u201cWe sat in the Holiday Inn and planned it on Tuesday night\u201d). A home defeat to Preston follows.</p> <p><strong>February:</strong> Three draws and two defeats. Jones: \u201cMy staff will earn every single penny. It\u2019s good for the club that we don\u2019t get paid by the hour! If we did, we\u2019d be far more expensive.\u201d</p> <p><strong>March:</strong> Victory over Nottingham Forest is followed by four consecutive 0-0 draws. Jones: \u201cWe are evolving into a real fluent side.\u201d</p> <p><strong>April:</strong> A 1-0 win at Blackeye Rovers is backed up with a five-game winless run. Jones: \u201cWhen we recruit, we will recruit what we call \u2018Stoke City players\u2019. They will play in a certain way, act in a certain way, will be athletic, will be courteous.\u201d</p> <p><strong>May:</strong> Stoke finish 16th after a draw at home to promoted Sheffield United. \u201cIt is a glimpse of what we will turn into,\u201d Jones trumpets. \u201cI sacrificed a promotion at Luton to come here. We\u2019ve made great inroads and I\u2019m excited by what we can achieve.\u201d</p> <p><strong>August:</strong> The new season begins with defeats to QPR and Charlton. Jones: \u201cPeople are not having to score good goals against us at the moment. We\u2019ve got to be better in both boxes \u2013 in between, not a problem.\u201d</p> <p><strong>September:</strong> A home defeat to Bristol City leaves Stoke with one point from seven games (\u201cThere are teams with far more points than us, but are playing worse than us\u201d). The month ends with another home loss, to Forest. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was much wrong with the performance apart from the errors, three big errors,\u201d Jones muses.</p> <p><strong>19 October:</strong> Wins over Swansea and Fulham earn Jones an unexpected reprieve: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get some continuity. I am a passionate guy and that is what has got me the career I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve gone back to being me and I like me.\u201d</p> <p><strong>26 October:</strong> Stoke lose at Sheffield Wednesday and Rowett\u2019s Millwall. \u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted.\u201d</p> <p><strong>1 November:</strong> Jones is sacked after six wins from 38 games. Stoke are second-bottom of the Championship, six points below promoted Luton.</p> <p>According to the bookies, Chris Hughton, Michael O\u2019Neill, David Moyes and Sam Allardyce are vying to rip up Jones\u2019s philosophy and bludgeon their way to safety. Stoke may even turn, baseball cap in hand, to Tony Pulis. As for Jones, at least his claim that he would never \u201cuse [Luton] as a stepping stone\u201d remains intact.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cOne day I miss the lesson on purpose and from the ladies\u2019 toilet I hear how they run around yelling for me like they are mad. When Liam Brady [the head of the academy] comes up to me in the canteen later he grabs hold of me and says: \u2018What are you thinking, young man? Where have you been?\u2019 He has heard a story about how I was hiding underneath a table. That\u2019s not true and I tell him that with a clear conscience. That is not the only clash\u201d \u2013 an extract from the new Nicky Bendtner book, you say? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/01/nicklas-bendtner-book-extract-arsenal-academy-henry\">Oof</a>!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4857809efd561a78b2afb130a723bd15b4b3af6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4857809efd561a78b2afb130a723bd15b4b3af6/0_347_4314_2610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Praise the Lord!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"605\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Praise the Lord!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liselotte Sabroe/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>FIVER LETTERS</strong></h2> <p>\u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver.

      "bodyText": "AND ALL YOU NEEDED WAS JUST A LITTLE TIME 2019 hasn\u2019t been kind to many of us, not least your fifth-favourite tea-timely football email. But spare a thought for Nathan Jones. The Welshman\u2019s hopes of becoming \u201cthe world\u2019s best manager\u201d have stalled during a dreadful 10-month spell at Stoke, which was mercifully brought to an end on Friday. Let\u2019s relive the coach\u2019s year in quotes: 9 January: Jones leaves League One high-flyers Luton to replace Gary Rowett at Stoke. \u201dThis is not a job for me, this is a lifestyle,\u201d he tells assembled hacks. \u201cIf the players buy into that from the beginning, just think how good they will feel years down the line when we are where we want to be. In the words of Miley Cyrus, it\u2019s the climb.\u201d 26 January: Stoke are knocked out of the FA Cup by Shrewsbury, but bounce back to beat Nasty Leeds (\u201cWe sat in the Holiday Inn and planned it on Tuesday night\u201d). A home defeat to Preston follows. February: Three draws and two defeats. Jones: \u201cMy staff will earn every single penny. It\u2019s good for the club that we don\u2019t get paid by the hour! If we did, we\u2019d be far more expensive.\u201d March: Victory over Nottingham Forest is followed by four consecutive 0-0 draws. Jones: \u201cWe are evolving into a real fluent side.\u201d April: A 1-0 win at Blackeye Rovers is backed up with a five-game winless run. Jones: \u201cWhen we recruit, we will recruit what we call \u2018Stoke City players\u2019. They will play in a certain way, act in a certain way, will be athletic, will be courteous.\u201d May: Stoke finish 16th after a draw at home to promoted Sheffield United. \u201cIt is a glimpse of what we will turn into,\u201d Jones trumpets. \u201cI sacrificed a promotion at Luton to come here. We\u2019ve made great inroads and I\u2019m excited by what we can achieve.\u201d August: The new season begins with defeats to QPR and Charlton. Jones: \u201cPeople are not having to score good goals against us at the moment. We\u2019ve got to be better in both boxes \u2013 in between, not a problem.\u201d September: A home defeat to Bristol City leaves Stoke with one point from seven games (\u201cThere are teams with far more points than us, but are playing worse than us\u201d). The month ends with another home loss, to Forest. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was much wrong with the performance apart from the errors, three big errors,\u201d Jones muses. 19 October: Wins over Swansea and Fulham earn Jones an unexpected reprieve: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get some continuity. I am a passionate guy and that is what has got me the career I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve gone back to being me and I like me.\u201d 26 October: Stoke lose at Sheffield Wednesday and Rowett\u2019s Millwall. \u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted.\u201d 1 November: Jones is sacked after six wins from 38 games. Stoke are second-bottom of the Championship, six points below promoted Luton. According to the bookies, Chris Hughton, Michael O\u2019Neill, David Moyes and Sam Allardyce are vying to rip up Jones\u2019s philosophy and bludgeon their way to safety. Stoke may even turn, baseball cap in hand, to Tony Pulis. As for Jones, at least his claim that he would never \u201cuse [Luton] as a stepping stone\u201d remains intact. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cOne day I miss the lesson on purpose and from the ladies\u2019 toilet I hear how they run around yelling for me like they are mad. When Liam Brady [the head of the academy] comes up to me in the canteen later he grabs hold of me and says: \u2018What are you thinking, young man? Where have you been?\u2019 He has heard a story about how I was hiding underneath a table. That\u2019s not true and I tell him that with a clear conscience. That is not the only clash\u201d \u2013 an extract from the new Nicky Bendtner book, you say? Oof! FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver. In the part of northern England where I grew up (where Boris Johnson was politely asked to leave: no, not that part, nor that part, nor even that part, the other part), Mischief Night was 4 November, due to the Gunpowder Plot being discovered the next day\u201d \u2013 Darren Leathley (ex-Morley. Well, just off J28 of the M62). \u201cWhen I read the headline referencing \u2018Mizzy Night\u2019 I was sure The Fiver had taken the opportunity to take the Fizzy Milk theme to the next level. But, of course, The Fiver missed this opportunity, opting to instead continue down the \u2018Being useless at your job\u2019 theme\u201d \u2013 Spencer Weills. \u201cI think Tony Crawford (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) might have overestimated the amount of readers The Fiver gets if he thinks we could club together to buy an election. We may be able to scrape enough together to buy a pack of chocolate digestives, mind you\u201d \u2013 Oliver Billenness. \u201cI\u2019ve never met the poor thing but I suspect Fiver Jr needs to go out on loan to aid his development\u201d \u2013 Patrick O\u2019Brien. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Patrick O\u2019Brien. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS An anonymously run Telegram account has indicated that it wants to sell a tranche of emails relating to Russia\u2019s 2018 World Cup bid, after reports that they contain a dossier compiled by Russian officials on how to bribe Fifa ExCo members. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will take over as Arsenal skipper against Wolves after Granit Xhaka was left out. Meanwhile, a 13-2 aggregate hosing of Slavia Prague has booked Arsenal\u2019s spot alongside Glasgow City in Women\u2019s Big Cup last eight. Good news for the Glazers\u2019 dividend: Roma have got \u20ac15m with Manchester United\u2019s name on it in return for Chris Smalling. Liverpool boss J\u00fcrgen Klopp wants football authorities to start putting players\u2019 interests first. Good one! \u201cThere would be a few solutions possible but there was not one day where Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League, the Football League and the other leagues sit at a table and think about the players and not about their wallet,\u201d he tooted. And Bayern Munich gro\u00df K\u00e4se Uli Hoeness has been reflecting on his love of the club after his spell in the slammer. \u201cI can only smile about [the criticism],\u201d he parped. \u201cI think the fans know that, deep down, I have always ripped open my @rse and given everything for them.\u201d STILL WANT MORE?

From the French fourth-tier to Europe\u2019s top tackler: Aston Villa\u2019s Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert talks to Paul Doyle about his improbable journey. Why should Granit Xhaka apologise?

      "body": "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On Thursday\u2019s Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed the day\u2019s big news out of Washington: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/oct/31/trump-news-today-live-impeachment-inquiry-tim-morrison\">House vote to formalize the impeachment process</a> against Donald Trump, which means America is \u201cone step closer to getting Trump out of the White House\u201d. The resolution passed 232-196, led by Colbert\u2019s guest of the evening, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. No Republicans supported the measure, leaving Colbert to wonder: \u201cAre they just complaining about process with those zero votes? Or are they really so lacking any honor that they are willing to publicly state that blackmailing a foreign government to interfere in our election is OK?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS4vRbpl-h8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aS4vRbpl-h8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Earlier Thursday, a reporter asked House Republicans, led by the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, if they were willing to go on the record that the president did nothing inappropriate. \u201cVery clear, yes,\u201d McCarthy answered.</p> <p>Colbert had a follow-up question: \u201cThe Titanic just hit an iceberg; the captain is saying, \u2018It was a perfect iceberg, now we can make all the Slurpees for everyone,\u2019 and he\u2019s asking you all to handcuff yourself to the port side rail and swallow the keys. Are you all willing to do that?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/31/seth-meyers-donald-trump-stephen-colbert-samantha-bee-trevor-noah\">Seth Meyers: 'Every minute with Donald Trump feels like a horror movie'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cVery clear, yes,\u201d McCarthy says in the replayed clip. \u201cGood to know,\u201d Colbert nodded.</p> <p>The Republican congressmen who vehemently opposed the impeachment process vote \u201chave a small problem\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cIt is \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 <em>evidence</em>. We keep getting more and more of it.\u201d On Thursday, it was revealed that immediately after Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a witness to the call, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, reported his concerns to a White House lawyer. That lawyer then moved the record of the call to an unusual, top-secret server.</p> <p>In other words, \u201cit\u2019s a cover-up!\u201d said Colbert in the style of the Price is Right. \u201cHe\u2019s won an all-you-can-televise impeachment hearing, a trial in the world-famous Capitol building and a free helicopter ride out of Washington on Marine One. Marine One: ride away in shame in style.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers also took a closer look at the House\u2019s impeachment vote, which left Trump and his allies \u201cfreaking out\u201d. Trump was so \u201cwildly grasping at straws\u201d about the vote, according to Meyers, that on Thursday morning he merely tweeted: \u201cREAD THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, we did,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cThat\u2019s how we found out about the crimes you committed. Trump\u2019s like a bank robber who screams: \u2018Watch the tape!\u2019 And the jury watches the tape and it\u2019s just him smiling straight into the camera holding up a bag of cash.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qncrY2e5QU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2qncrY2e5QU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Several Republican congressmen spoke in defense of Trump \u2013 or, more accurately, as Meyers noted, spoke in confusing opposition to the impeachment inquiry process. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, for example, demanded the American people ask questions of history in a speech Meyers summarized as: \u201cHistory will write this moment and then history will ask you a question so you want them to ask the historian a question and then answer the questions themselves?\u201d His reasoning \u201csounds like you asked Siri to read a quote from Alexander Hamilton after spilling water on your phone\u201d.</p> <p>The House vote allows for more witnesses to be called for public testimony, including the former national security adviser John Bolton, who contentiously left the White House in September. Since then, tensions have escalated between Trump and Bolton, \u201cbut the best part is these are all awful guys\u201d, Meyers said. \u201cBolton\u2019s an unrepentant warmonger, Trump of course is Trump, so it\u2019s fun to watch them turn on each other and try to take each other down.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like watching nature shows where a lion kills a baby antelope but when they show a spider and a scorpion going at it, I am in.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrPSB5wZuGw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IrPSB5wZuGw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel took the stage dressed as an orange circus peanut for Halloween. \u201cI think I said I wanted to dress the same color as the president\u2019s face and this is what happened,\u201d he said of the costume.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not a happy Halloween for the Sour Patch Kid in the Oval Office,\u201d said Kimmel. The House voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry, \u201cwhich means \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it means\u201d, Kimmel admitted. \u201cIt means it will go to the Senate, and Republicans in the Senate will do nothing about it, and he\u2019ll say he won, is probably what it means.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Trump was not happy, tweeting that the impeachment inquiry was the greatest witch-hunt in American history on Halloween, and \u201cREAD THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich, this is like Lori Loughlin saying, \u2018Check my kid\u2019s SAT scores!\u2019\u201d said Kimmel.</p> <p>No House Republicans voted in favor of the impeachment resolution, and the Senate\u2019s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, blasted Democrats for \u201ctaking a vacation from the needs of the American people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, instead of wasting time on this, you should be sending over more legislation for me to kill,\u201d Kimmel explained. McConnell, Kimmel noted, is sitting on more than 100 bills right now \u2013 \u201che uses them to nest his terrarium\u201d.</p>",

No Republicans supported the measure, leaving Colbert to wonder: \u201cAre they just complaining about process with those zero votes? Or are they really so lacking any honor that they are willing to publicly state that blackmailing a foreign government to interfere in our election is OK?\u201d Earlier Thursday, a reporter asked House Republicans, led by the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, if they were willing to go on the record that the president did nothing inappropriate. \u201cVery clear, yes,\u201d McCarthy answered. Colbert had a follow-up question: \u201cThe Titanic just hit an iceberg; the captain is saying, \u2018It was a perfect iceberg, now we can make all the Slurpees for everyone,\u2019 and he\u2019s asking you all to handcuff yourself to the port side rail and swallow the keys. Are you all willing to do that?\u201d \u201cVery clear, yes,\u201d McCarthy says in the replayed clip. \u201cGood to know,\u201d Colbert nodded. The Republican congressmen who vehemently opposed the impeachment process vote \u201chave a small problem\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cIt is \u2013 what\u2019s the word? \u2013 evidence. We keep getting more and more of it.\u201d On Thursday, it was revealed that immediately after Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a witness to the call, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, reported his concerns to a White House lawyer. That lawyer then moved the record of the call to an unusual, top-secret server. In other words, \u201cit\u2019s a cover-up!\u201d said Colbert in the style of the Price is Right. \u201cHe\u2019s won an all-you-can-televise impeachment hearing, a trial in the world-famous Capitol building and a free helicopter ride out of Washington on Marine One. Marine One: ride away in shame in style.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also took a closer look at the House\u2019s impeachment vote, which left Trump and his allies \u201cfreaking out\u201d. Trump was so \u201cwildly grasping at straws\u201d about the vote, according to Meyers, that on Thursday morning he merely tweeted: \u201cREAD THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d \u201cYeah, we did,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cThat\u2019s how we found out about the crimes you committed. Trump\u2019s like a bank robber who screams: \u2018Watch the tape!\u2019 And the jury watches the tape and it\u2019s just him smiling straight into the camera holding up a bag of cash.\u201d Several Republican congressmen spoke in defense of Trump \u2013 or, more accurately, as Meyers noted, spoke in confusing opposition to the impeachment inquiry process. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, for example, demanded the American people ask questions of history in a speech Meyers summarized as: \u201cHistory will write this moment and then history will ask you a question so you want them to ask the historian a question and then answer the questions themselves?\u201d His reasoning \u201csounds like you asked Siri to read a quote from Alexander Hamilton after spilling water on your phone\u201d. The House vote allows for more witnesses to be called for public testimony, including the former national security adviser John Bolton, who contentiously left the White House in September. Since then, tensions have escalated between Trump and Bolton, \u201cbut the best part is these are all awful guys\u201d, Meyers said. \u201cBolton\u2019s an unrepentant warmonger, Trump of course is Trump, so it\u2019s fun to watch them turn on each other and try to take each other down. \u201cI don\u2019t like watching nature shows where a lion kills a baby antelope but when they show a spider and a scorpion going at it, I am in.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel took the stage dressed as an orange circus peanut for Halloween. \u201cI think I said I wanted to dress the same color as the president\u2019s face and this is what happened,\u201d he said of the costume. \u201cIt was not a happy Halloween for the Sour Patch Kid in the Oval Office,\u201d said Kimmel. The House voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry, \u201cwhich means \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it means\u201d, Kimmel admitted. \u201cIt means it will go to the Senate, and Republicans in the Senate will do nothing about it, and he\u2019ll say he won, is probably what it means.\u201d Still, Trump was not happy, tweeting that the impeachment inquiry was the greatest witch-hunt in American history on Halloween, and \u201cREAD THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich, this is like Lori Loughlin saying, \u2018Check my kid\u2019s SAT scores!\u2019\u201d said Kimmel. No House Republicans voted in favor of the impeachment resolution, and the Senate\u2019s top Republican, Mitch McConnell, blasted Democrats for \u201ctaking a vacation from the needs of the American people\u201d. \u201cIn other words, instead of wasting time on this, you should be sending over more legislation for me to kill,\u201d Kimmel explained. McConnell, Kimmel noted, is sitting on more than 100 bills right now \u2013 \u201che uses them to nest his terrarium\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The suspension of priority MI5 investigations into the ringleader of the London Bridge attacks before the atrocity is a matter of \u201clegitimate public concern\u201d, the chief coroner for England and Wales has said. In his Prevention of Future Deaths report, published on Friday, Mark Lucraft QC also suggested that further measures should be introduced to reduce the risk of rental vehicles being used in terrorist attacks. Eight people were killed when three terrorists led by Khuram Butt, 27, drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then began stabbing people in a 10-minute rampage on 3 June 2017. MI5 had been been investigating Butt since 2015 over concerns he wanted to stage an attack. But the investigation was suspended twice, in 2016 and again from 21 March to 4 May 2017, weeks before the attacks. During the inquests, which concluded on 28 June after more than seven weeks of harrowing evidence, lawyers for the victims argued that valuable intelligence could have been lost as a result of the suspensions. Lucraft\u2019s report raises a number of other concerns about the actions of the security services before the attacks, as well as the response by emergency services on the night. The families of the bereaved have accused MI5 of missing \u201copportunities galore\u201d to stop the attack. Among the failings was a two-month delay in translating a request from Italian authorities for information about another of the attackers, Youssef Zaghba, 22. Additionally, material recovered from Butt\u2019s phone and laptop during an October 2016 raid included Isis propaganda about martyrdom and suicide missions but the inquest heard no criminal charges resulted. The families also criticised the response of the London Ambulance Service, whose staff did not enter the area where most of the victims lay dying until hours after the attack because it was designated a \u201chot zone\u201d. Police officers were left to treat the wounded with the the help of members of the public, not knowing that ambulances were parked nearby on Borough High Street. The chief coroner\u2019s recommendations included: Fresh laws on possessing the most serious material that glorifies or encourages terrorism. Improving communications and co-working between MI5 and counter-terrorism police officers working on the same investigation. Improving facilities for translating communications received from foreign security and intelligence services. Increasing flexibility of the emergency response to marauding terrorist attacks. Improving communications between the Met police and the London Ambulance Service. Enhancing the first aid capabilities and equipment of either police officers generally or certain categories of officers. He also suggested there were doubts about the \u201cpotential lone actor\u201d tool twice used by MI5 to assess Butt\u2019s risk. In September 2015, he was assessed as being of \u201cmedium risk\u201d, and in May 2017 the assessment was \u201cunresolved risk\u201d. On the suspension of investigations, Lucraft said: \u201cAlthough MI5 must be able to prioritise and divert resources at times of greatest demand, the suspension of priority investigations is a matter of legitimate public concern. Accordingly, the systems for suspending such investigations (including the criteria for suspension, recording of suspension decisions and systems for rebuilding intelligence after suspensions) should be specifically considered in the continuing work of review and improvement.\u201d In relation to the risk of rental vehicles being used in terrorist attacks, the chief coroner said possible measures included introducing a scheme for real-time reporting of rentals and automated checking of the results against lists of subjects of interest. At the conclusion of the inquest in June, Lucraft said he was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d that the authorities had missed clues that could have helped thwart the atrocity, although the families voiced their disagreement. But he did criticise the failure to erect protective barriers on the bridge to thwart a vehicle attack three months after an attack on Westminster Bridge. In Friday\u2019s report, he highlighted the need for greater awareness around protective security, including the introduction of legal obligations, if necessary. Helen Boniface, a senior associate at Hogan Lovells, who represented six families in the inquest, said: \u201cGiven the real risk of future deaths, we hope that the government, police, ambulance service and all other organisations named will now respond fully and ultimately implement effective measures in a timely fashion to address all issues that have been identified.\u201d Those killed by Butt, Zaghba and Rachid Redouane, 30, were Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada; S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, from France; Kirsty Boden, 28, from Australia; Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda, 39, from Spain; James McMullan, 32, from Brent, north-west London; Alexandre Pigeard, 26, a French national; Xavier Thomas, 45, a French national; and Sara Zelenak, 21, an Australian national.",

By the end of this week New Zealanders were permitting themselves to get enthusiastic again \u2013 about, of all things, cricket.</p> <p>It is, heaven help me, now 35 years since I first arrived in New Zealand to cover a cricket tour. The cricket was most memorable for the Test in Christchurch, which was a close contest \u2013 the battle was between the England bowlers and batsmen to see who could be more incompetent.

It drifted 12,000 miles away, to the Mail on Sunday \u2013 even though the fragrance was almost certainly non-existent. Or non-existent exactly then and there, anyway.</p> <p>But a few spliffs were a very reasonable antidote to New Zealand in the 1980s. The definitive comment on the country at the time is attributed to Clement Freud: \u201cI went to New Zealand. It was closed.\u201d This was, if you arrived between Friday afternoon and Monday morning, true (only family-run corner shops could open at weekends). Or after about 7.30pm on weeknights. The restaurant food, if you could find any, was basic; the wine undrinkable.</p> <p>The shut-most-hours policy came from a reforming Labour government of the 1930s, led by an unsung (outside NZ) hero called Michael Savage who pursued worker-friendly policies to guide his country safely through the Depression. By the 80s, this aspect of it was way past its sell-by date. Memo to Jeremy Corbyn: do not try this trick at home.</p> <p>The phone boxes still had buttons marked A and B, which were already forgotten in the UK. The cars were even more antique. The small towns were stultifying. My major problem was that I have a lifelong fetish about making notes with a transparent black Bic pen, ubiquitous everywhere else. New Zealand had one sort of biro and that wasn\u2019t it. I was traumatised.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong. The country was indeed beautiful, though in a strange protean way: one minute you think you\u2019re near Malvern; next it\u2019s the surface of the moon. But the main problem is that we were on a cricket tour in a land where the sporting monoculture resembled the Kansas wheat fields. Rugby, nothing but rugby. Everything else was a minor diversion.</p> <p>Everyone was kind and welcoming but the cricketers were not a big deal. It was like being on a bowls tour. At the time, this was emphatically not the case anywhere else. A year later, England\u2019s Test in Calcutta was watched by 80,000-90,000 a day; there were big home crowds for full-length matches across Planet Cricket. New Zealand was a major trendsetter in losing interest in the traditional game and they weren\u2019t that interested in the first place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still, those Kiwis do like the hit-and-giggle. Especially this week, when they wanted some solace. The spectators didn\u2019t get much on the pretty suburban cricket field in Christchurch but they went home to cheer the All Blacks to the bronze medal. Well, whoop-de-doo!</p> <p>Most of England\u2019s games on this tour will be on small, rustic, agreeable grounds, a privilege not afforded to visiting rugby teams. In 1984, all the Tests and one-day internationals were played in the three largest cities. The two Tests this time are being played in Hamilton, the seventh largest, and Mount Maunganui, a suburb of Tauranga, the ninth largest. It looks delightful, with a lovely beach but Lord\u2019s should retaliate by staging the return fixture at Swanage.</p> <p>I do feel a pang, though. In February, I went back to New Zealand for the first time in more than two decades. I had a marvellous time, including two of the best meals I\u2019ve had in years; the sauvignon blanc and pinot noir were sensational. I loved seeing friends; enjoyed the countryside all over again; and the whole place had a new vibrancy and worldliness without losing its old charm. I steered clear of cricket, though, and took a supply of black Bics. Just in case some things hadn\u2019t changed.</p>",

It drifted 12,000 miles away, to the Mail on Sunday \u2013 even though the fragrance was almost certainly non-existent. Or non-existent exactly then and there, anyway. But a few spliffs were a very reasonable antidote to New Zealand in the 1980s. The definitive comment on the country at the time is attributed to Clement Freud: \u201cI went to New Zealand. It was closed.\u201d This was, if you arrived between Friday afternoon and Monday morning, true (only family-run corner shops could open at weekends). Or after about 7.30pm on weeknights. The restaurant food, if you could find any, was basic; the wine undrinkable. The shut-most-hours policy came from a reforming Labour government of the 1930s, led by an unsung (outside NZ) hero called Michael Savage who pursued worker-friendly policies to guide his country safely through the Depression. By the 80s, this aspect of it was way past its sell-by date. Memo to Jeremy Corbyn: do not try this trick at home. The phone boxes still had buttons marked A and B, which were already forgotten in the UK. The cars were even more antique. The small towns were stultifying. My major problem was that I have a lifelong fetish about making notes with a transparent black Bic pen, ubiquitous everywhere else. New Zealand had one sort of biro and that wasn\u2019t it. I was traumatised. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The country was indeed beautiful, though in a strange protean way: one minute you think you\u2019re near Malvern; next it\u2019s the surface of the moon. But the main problem is that we were on a cricket tour in a land where the sporting monoculture resembled the Kansas wheat fields. Rugby, nothing but rugby. Everything else was a minor diversion. Everyone was kind and welcoming but the cricketers were not a big deal. It was like being on a bowls tour. At the time, this was emphatically not the case anywhere else. A year later, England\u2019s Test in Calcutta was watched by 80,000-90,000 a day; there were big home crowds for full-length matches across Planet Cricket. New Zealand was a major trendsetter in losing interest in the traditional game and they weren\u2019t that interested in the first place. Still, those Kiwis do like the hit-and-giggle. Especially this week, when they wanted some solace. The spectators didn\u2019t get much on the pretty suburban cricket field in Christchurch but they went home to cheer the All Blacks to the bronze medal. Well, whoop-de-doo! Most of England\u2019s games on this tour will be on small, rustic, agreeable grounds, a privilege not afforded to visiting rugby teams. In 1984, all the Tests and one-day internationals were played in the three largest cities. The two Tests this time are being played in Hamilton, the seventh largest, and Mount Maunganui, a suburb of Tauranga, the ninth largest. It looks delightful, with a lovely beach but Lord\u2019s should retaliate by staging the return fixture at Swanage. I do feel a pang, though. In February, I went back to New Zealand for the first time in more than two decades. I had a marvellous time, including two of the best meals I\u2019ve had in years; the sauvignon blanc and pinot noir were sensational. I loved seeing friends; enjoyed the countryside all over again; and the whole place had a new vibrancy and worldliness without losing its old charm. I steered clear of cricket, though, and took a supply of black Bics. Just in case some things hadn\u2019t changed.",

Halep could have crumbled, but it was impressive to see her rise to meet the high bar set by Pliskova. Throughout the second set, she soaked up so many of Pliskova\u2019s body blows and pushed back whenever possible. There are few players as good at flipping a point with a spectacular down-the-line shot while on the run.</p> <p>Pliskova is one of the least expressive players on the court and she is not known for her competitive fire, but there are plenty of examples of her summoning it. From *0-2 down in the third set, she provided another example by keeping her composure to see out the victory as Halep battled both the opponent and herself.</p> <p>Of course, this match will be remembered for Halep\u2019s coach, Darren Cahill, walking onto the court after Pliskova won her third consecutive game for 3-2 and branding her attitude a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. It was a strange decision after a hard-fought game and it didn\u2019t seem to help much. As a viewer, it was an ugly sight. But when Pliskova checks out the highlights of this brilliant victory, she\u2019ll be satisfied by how much she made her rival despair.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbc482a8f08c428d8934d3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T14:59:44.520Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The semi-finals in Shenzhen are now set:</strong></p> <p>Ashleigh Barty vs Karolina Pliskova</p> <p>Elina Svitolina vs Belinda Bencic</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbc47098f08d669cdab1254\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T14:57:58.624Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The final game was quite something. </strong>Halep led 30-0 and seemed to be strolling towards levelling the match, but then Pliskova came alive. The Czech has been mute throughout the match, as she almost always is, yet after she snapped an incredible crosscourt angled backhand for 30-30, she growled loudly in celebration. A shanked backhand error from Halep brought up match point, which Pliskova converted with the greatest slice of luck: her forehand drive volley clipped the net and then dribbled over. </p> <p>That was one of the best, most dramatic matches of the week.

Thanks to the injuries that have pillaged this event over the past three days, there hasn\u2019t been much need to wipe the thick dust from our calculators in a desperate attempt to figure out the group scenarios. The scenario here is simple: win or die.</p> <p>The rivalry between Halep and Pliskova has always been good fun. Halep leads the series 7-3 and won the first three meetings without dropping a set, but Halep is 4-3 since those initial encounters. Their games contrast nicely, with Pliskova\u2019s big serving and aggression off the ground meeting Halep\u2019s great defence. However, Pliskova is much more patient than the average 6\u20192 big server and Halep has her weapons. There are always a pleasant variety of staccato points and longer, attritional rallies.<br></p> <p>The one thing they do have in common is that both players have expressed their displeasure at playing on such a slow court so late in the season. Neither could hit through Svitolina for extended periods during their earlier matches and, like seemingly everyone but Svitolina, they both seem to be feeling the physical and mental effects after another long year. With so much prize money and so many points on offer, we\u2019ll see which player is prepared to bring their best tennis one final time.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T13:10:04.199Z\">at 1.10pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "There were low expectations after the performances from both Halep and Pliskova against Svitolina this week, but Pliskova entered the match hitting absurd winners from all parts of the court, absolutely obliterating Halep and refusing to relinquish a single game. Halep could have crumbled, but it was impressive to see her rise to meet the high bar set by Pliskova. Throughout the second set, she soaked up so many of Pliskova\u2019s body blows and pushed back whenever possible. There are few players as good at flipping a point with a spectacular down-the-line shot while on the run. Pliskova is one of the least expressive players on the court and she is not known for her competitive fire, but there are plenty of examples of her summoning it. From *0-2 down in the third set, she provided another example by keeping her composure to see out the victory as Halep battled both the opponent and herself. Of course, this match will be remembered for Halep\u2019s coach, Darren Cahill, walking onto the court after Pliskova won her third consecutive game for 3-2 and branding her attitude a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. It was a strange decision after a hard-fought game and it didn\u2019t seem to help much. As a viewer, it was an ugly sight. But when Pliskova checks out the highlights of this brilliant victory, she\u2019ll be satisfied by how much she made her rival despair. The semi-finals in Shenzhen are now set: Ashleigh Barty vs Karolina Pliskova Elina Svitolina vs Belinda Bencic The final game was quite something. Halep led 30-0 and seemed to be strolling towards levelling the match, but then Pliskova came alive. The Czech has been mute throughout the match, as she almost always is, yet after she snapped an incredible crosscourt angled backhand for 30-30, she growled loudly in celebration. A shanked backhand error from Halep brought up match point, which Pliskova converted with the greatest slice of luck: her forehand drive volley clipped the net and then dribbled over. That was one of the best, most dramatic matches of the week. Brilliant. What a match. Pliskova advances to the semi-final and will face Ashleigh Barty. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 5-4* Simona Halep: This was already a gripping match, but these last few games have been extraordinary. After being admonished by her coach Cahill, Halep eventually picked herself and stepped into the court. Halep played a great, aggressive return game to break. However, there was absolutely no reaction from her and she spent the break staring blankly ahead. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *5-3 Simona Halep: Halep picks herself up and holds to love with little fanfare. Pliskova will serve for a place in the final. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 5-2* Simona Halep: Too easy. Pliskova holds for 15 with more great serving, punctuated with an unreturned slider out wide. Halep is completely off the boil. It certainly is unacceptable in a match like this but Cahill\u2019s pep talk only seems to have made things worse. Bizarre scenes in Shenzhen. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *4-2 Simona Halep: Halep just played one of her worst games of the entire match to lose her serve to love. She sprayed errors from all parts of the court and finished with a forehand error well long. Meanwhile, Darren Cahill just came on the court and called Halep\u2019s behaviour over the past few games a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. The commentators are in shock. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 3-2* Simona Halep: Pliskova continues to live dangerously on her serve, brilliantly digging out a tight deuce game from 0-30 down. She sealed the game with a screaming forehand down the line winner, but even more impressive was the prior point. Halep had her on the ropes, moving her side to side, yet Pliskova defended well and was able to flip the point on its head. Pliskova is not immediately known for her fight, but here she is. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *2-2 Simona Halep: Halep opened her service game with a bad forehand into the net and that seemed to set the tone for the remainder of the game. She hit double fault at 0-30 and then her forehand flew desperately long. A love break. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 1-2* Simona Halep: Earlier on in this match, it was Halep who was having to work desperately hard for each point, but now it\u2019s Pliskova who is fighting tooth and nail. Some great serving from the Czech to dig out a 0-30 hold, but even so many of her first serves are coming back now. At 40-30, Pliskova hit about three violent blows that would have been winners against most other players, but she remained calm and threaded a backhand down the line winner to hold. Despite how Halep has turned this around, Pliskova is still right there. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 *0-2 Simona Halep: Halep holds to consolidate her break and she has now won 8 of the last 10 games. Pliskova isn\u2019t really playing that much worse, but Halep continues to soak up Pliskova\u2019s biggest blows and redirect Pliskova\u2019s missiles whenever she can. This is such an impressive effort. Third set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 0-1* Simona Halep: Halep\u2019s momentum from the second set has carried into the third and she breaks with a brilliant backhand down the line return winner. Pliskova continues to attack, but Halep is soaking up so much more now and she is so good at flipping defence to offence so well on the move. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-6 Simona Halep: Simona Halep saves three break points to hold and level Pliskova at one set all! Even down a double break, Pliskova refused to let Halep breathe, absolutely crushing her second serve throughout that game. But Halep served just well enough to keep her at bay, taking the set with the most unexpected shot of all: a second serve ace down the T. Game on. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-5* Simona Halep: Things are moving very quickly here and the winners are now flying off Halep\u2019s racquet. Pliskova misses some first serves, which allows Halep to further impose her game. What an incredible running backhand down the line winner from Halep to seal the double break. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 *2-4 Simona Halep: A big hold for Halep, who continues to show Pliskova that she is here to fight. At 30-30, she put just enough angle on her crosscourt backhand to push Pliskova wide and force an error. She sealed the hold by forcing another Pliskova error, this time with a heavy forehand crosscourt. She is imposing her game more and more in this set. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 2-3* Simona Halep: Halep is starting to find some joy by opening up the court with angles. She generates a first break point by forcing Pliskova out wide on her forehand, who sprays an ambitious forehand down-the-line wide. Pliskova saves the break point with a big serve and forehand combination, but on the second break point, Halep chases down a drop shot and takes the break with a brilliant forehand volley at full stretch. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 *2-2 Simona Halep: Pliskova breaks back to love with another emphatic return game, converted with a heavy crosscourt forehand that forced a forehand error from Halep. After all the talk about how slow this court is, it is startling to see Pliskova just uncompromisingly hitting through it today. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 1-2* Simona Halep: After opening the second set with an erratic service game, Pliskova reverts to type with another great hold. Along with more untouchable serving, she held with a fizzing down the line backhand winner. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 *0-2 Simona Halep: A very important hold from Halep to consolidate the break. She saved a break point by grinding Pliskova down in a long, attritional rally, but she was otherwise trying to impose herself well inside the baseline. Karolina Pliskova finished the first set with 11 winners to 3 unforced errors. Unplayable. Second set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 0-1* Simona Halep: Halep\u2019s coach Darren Cahill was out between sets. He told Halep to forget the first set and suggested putting more spin on the ball and getting it out of Pliskova\u2019s strike zone. She was listening. Pliskova opens the set with a couple of errors off higher balls, then she inexplicably double faults on break point to drop serve easily. This is already a different match. First set: Karolina Pliskova 6-0 Simona Halep: Karolina Pliskova snaps a backhand down the line winner to break Halep for a third time and take the first set with a bagel. Just an incredible set of tennis from Pliskova, who is attacking brilliantly and moving to the net whenever she can. The bad news for Pliskova is that she now has to do it all over again. First set: Karolina Pliskova 5-0* Simona Halep: It\u2019s clear that Pliskova\u2019s form is stemming from how well she is serving so far. She holds with another easy service game, sealed with an ace down the T. Halep isn\u2019t even playing badly. She just can\u2019t live with this at the moment. First set: Karolina Pliskova *4-0 Simona Halep: More brilliant play from Pliskova as she moves up a double break. Early in the game, she crushed a backhand return then slipped into the net and she brought up break point with a whistling inside out forehand winner. She couldn\u2019t convert the first break point, but a couple of minutes later she hooked a heavy forehand crosscourt and forced an error to take the break. First set: Karolina Pliskova 3-0* Simona Halep: That was a statement love hold from Pliskova to consolidate the break. Huge serving and there wasn\u2019t much that Halep could do. First set: Karolina Pliskova *2-0 Simona Halep: Simona Halep did not play a bad service game, but she\u2019s already down. Pliskova looks great so far. She is dominating the baseline exchanges, peppering her game with some variety and crushing Halep\u2019s second serve. She breaks by eliciting a Halep error with some heavy forehands. First set: Karolina Pliskova 1-0* Simona Halep: Good start for Pliskova, who is serving well out of the blocks and already showing her variety. A great drop shot from the Czech early on, then she slammed down a trademark huge serve. She sealed the first game by moving to the net after a big forehand and picking off a nice volley. Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova are now on-court. As noted earlier, not much has separated them in recent years and Halep won a particularly delightful three-set match in the Fed Cup at the beginning of the year. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s in store today. As for Svitolina, she has been the player of this event by far. She hasn\u2019t dropped a single set and the big question is whether anyone in the world still has the energy, patience and weapons to hit through her defence on these slow courts. For a dead rubber including an alternate, that was a pretty entertaining match between Elina Svitolina and Sofia Kenin. Keep an eye out for 20 year-old Kenin, who has had a brilliant breakthrough year and finishes her breakthrough season ranked 13th with a huge win-loss record of 48-22 and three titles. Kenin is pretty under the radar for a young American who will have a good shot at reaching the top 10 next season. Elsewhere, Kyle Edmund has been announced as the fifth Davis Cup player for Great Britain. Here\u2019s Leon Smith\u2019s statement: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to name Kyle as the final nominated player to our GB Davis Cup team. Whilst Kyle has had a tough few months, he showed at the Paris Masters what level of tennis he is capable of producing. It\u2019s been a difficult decision to make as Cam Norrie has had a very good year on tour and is finishing the year ranked around number 50 in the world. It\u2019s a strong position for our team to be in when we have such high quality players vying for selection. The same is true for Joe Salisbury who is in great form and we wish him all the best for the ATP Tour finals. I\u2019m excited about getting our team together and preparing for the finals in Madrid.\u201d Hello! Welcome to the final day of the round robin group stages, where we have a decisive match between longtime rivals Simona Halep and Karolina Pliskova after Elina Svitolina clinched the Purple Group with a hard-fought 7-5 7-6(10) win over Sofia Kenin. Thanks to the injuries that have pillaged this event over the past three days, there hasn\u2019t been much need to wipe the thick dust from our calculators in a desperate attempt to figure out the group scenarios. The scenario here is simple: win or die. The rivalry between Halep and Pliskova has always been good fun. Halep leads the series 7-3 and won the first three meetings without dropping a set, but Halep is 4-3 since those initial encounters. Their games contrast nicely, with Pliskova\u2019s big serving and aggression off the ground meeting Halep\u2019s great defence. However, Pliskova is much more patient than the average 6\u20192 big server and Halep has her weapons. There are always a pleasant variety of staccato points and longer, attritional rallies. The one thing they do have in common is that both players have expressed their displeasure at playing on such a slow court so late in the season. Neither could hit through Svitolina for extended periods during their earlier matches and, like seemingly everyone but Svitolina, they both seem to be feeling the physical and mental effects after another long year. With so much prize money and so many points on offer, we\u2019ll see which player is prepared to bring their best tennis one final time.",

We met in our early </strong><strong>20s and started our relationship long-distance. I </strong><strong>relocated to the UK and we moved in together. Early on, </strong><strong>he would go out and come back much later than he had promised, leaving me unsure if I should be worried or angry. </strong><strong>We would have massive and </strong><strong>unproductive fights.

I relocated to the UK and we moved in together. Early on, he would go out and come back much later than he had promised, leaving me unsure if I should be worried or angry. We would have massive and unproductive fights. We had to cancel plans as he was too hungover. I made up my mind that I would leave him if his behaviour did not change. The next time it happened, I left for the day. He finally took me seriously, became scared of losing me, and this behaviour stopped. But in the following years, we got into a cycle of me finding empty bottles of alcohol hidden around the house, him promising to change, then me finding empty bottles again. We got married, bought a house and he ran up debts. When confronted, he lied then came clean: most of the money had been used to buy alcohol.

Survey respondents continue to report widespread concerns over issues such as tariffs, the auto sector\u2019s ongoing malaise, a lack of pricing power amid weak demand and uncertainty about the economic and political situation over the coming year.

Mahony explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Fears over a continued slowdown in manufacturing have been allayed somewhat with the release of a surprisingly positive Caixin manufacturing PMI survey. With the survey focusing on SMEs, there is a strong chance that these less internationalised firms will lead the recovery ahead of their larger competitors. </p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>US-China trade remains a key concern for traders, with top negotiators from both sides due to take a phone call that could enhance the chance of a phase one trade deal.

A surprise jump in the manufacturing PMI provided the best reading in six-months, as the sector shifted back towards expansion territory. </p> \n   <p>However, markets should be wary of these gains, as it is likely to be a reflection of the stockpiling that occurs ahead of each Brexit deadline.

      "bodyText": "The pound is stable against the dollar and the euro, after enjoying its strongest monthly rise since 2009 in October. It rose 5.2% over the month from around $1.22 to just below $1.30 (last week it went above $1.30). At the moment it is trading at $1.2961 against the dollar, up 0.14%, and at \u20ac1.1611 against the euro, up 0.03%. With this, we are signing off for the day. Thank you for all your comments, and have a great weekend. We\u2019ll be back next week. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at UK consultancy Capital Economics, has sent us his thoughts. The muted rebound in the ISM manufacturing index to 48.3 in October, which left it only slightly higher that September\u2019s 10-year low of 47.8, may dampen some of the enthusiasm in the markets following the better-than-expected payrolls data released earlier today. The drags on the economy from weak global growth and lingering trade uncertainty haven\u2019t yet dissipated and we suspect that the Fed still has a little more work to do. However, US stocks are unfazed by the ISM manufacturing survey. Traders have been cheered by the stronger-than-expected US jobs data. Earlier, a surprise bounce in China\u2019s manufacturing sector sent stocks higher across Asia and Europe. Here are the latest moves. Dow Jones up 0.91% at 27,292.32 S&amp;P 500 up 0.79% at 3061.75 Nasdaq up 0.91% at 8367.41 UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.52% at 7286.21 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.8% at 12,970.11 France\u2019s CAC up 0.68% at 5768.52 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.03% at 22,926.59 James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, says the ISM survey suggests the US manufacturing sector is in recession due to weak global growth, trade tensions and a strong dollar. There is little reason to expect an imminent turnaround with more support from the Federal Reserve likely needed. And here is the second US manufacturing survey, from the Institute for Supply Management. It shows manufacturing shrank at a slower pace last month, but did not improve as much as expected. The headline index rose to 48.3 from 47.8 in September. More on that Trump tweet. I suspected he might have added several months together. Heather Long, economics correspondent at the Washington Post, has spoken to the White House. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit says: Tentative signs of renewed vigour are appearing in the US manufacturing sector, with the survey\u2019s production gauge having now risen for three successive months to suggest that the soft patch bottomed out in July. Growth of new orders hit a six-month high, fuelled in part by a renewed increase in exports, prompting producers to take on more staff, with payroll numbers rising at the quickest pace since May. The improvement in current conditions was matched by a lifting of business optimism about the year ahead to the highest seen since June. It was also encouraging to see this optimism feed through to an upturn in demand for investment goods, such as plant and machinery, as this hints that firms are moving back into expansion mode, albeit only tentatively so far. However, while the outlook has improved, further growth is by no means assured. Survey respondents continue to report widespread concerns over issues such as tariffs, the auto sector\u2019s ongoing malaise, a lack of pricing power amid weak demand and uncertainty about the economic and political situation over the coming year. While the survey data are moving in the right direction, the overall picture therefore remained one of only very modest growth and guarded optimism. The IHS Markit US manufacturing PMI is out. It shows a modest improvement in factory activity, with the headline index rising to 51.3 in October, from 51.1 in September. On the US jobs numbers, which showed the economy added 128,000 workers in October. Fitbit has more than 28m active users and was founded about 12 years ago. Rick Osterloh, senior vice president in charge of devices &amp; services at Google, says: Fitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created terrific products, experiences and a vibrant community of users. News flash: The smartwatch maker Fitbit has agreed to be bought by Google for $2.1bn, or $7.35 a share in cash. You can read the full announcement here. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at fund manager Premier Asset Management: The jobs data was distorted by the General Motors strike, one of the biggest this century, but the number of jobs created was quite a bit higher than expected. This appears to back up the Fed\u2019s comments on Wednesday night about the economy being in decent shape and its shift in policy stance. This is more good news for equites and the dollar, but we may see bond yields higher. Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab, a bank and stock brokerage firm based in San Francisco, says: Today\u2019s numbers beat expectations, but the job market has cooled significantly since last month, as slowing global growth and trade war concerns continue to fester. Despite the FOMC\u2019s decision to cut rates a third time this year earlier in the week, US economic activity has failed to pick up meaningfully, which has aided the argument that rate cuts are unlikely to be the elixir for what ails the broader economy. Separately, larger structural issues \u2013 such as falling inflation expectations, an ageing population, and muted productivity\u2014have somewhat diminished the effects of monetary policy. Without a comprehensive and definitive trade deal with China, we will continue to see bouts of market volatility that could undermine market confidence, impact hiring, and put pressure on capital spending intentions. Here is some instant reaction to the data. James Ingram, investment manager at stockbroker MB Capital, says: With the labour market somewhat beyond full employment, past tight labour markets have shown payroll growth tending to reaccelerate in October (for example in 2007 and 1999). Accordingly, we believe some firms likely pulled forward hiring into October. This may be holiday related. This is somewhat stronger than our estimates and suggests the underlying economy remains resilient to trade disputes and the pace of job growth remains good. A huge beat on non-farm payrolls and a figure Trump can continue to boast about with his eye on his next term. Coupled with an inflation figure that continues to be sluggish and below the Fed target of 2% positively shows there isn\u2019t any sign of the tight job market causing a risk of overheating the economy. The dollar has shrugged off its earlier weakness and risen on the US jobs data \u2013 which means the pound has lost ground against the greenback, and is now flat at $1.2945. It is still up 0.19% against the euro at \u20ac1.1629. The US jobs figures have boosted European stocks further. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.46% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.68% France\u2019s CAC up 0.59% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.69% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.55% So US employers hired more people than expected last month, despite a strike at General Motors, and hiring in the previous two months was also stronger than expected. September\u2019s rise in jobs was revised up to 180,000. The October figure includes a strike-driven 41,600 decline in car industry jobs and 20,00 temporary census workers leaving their jobs. About 46,000 workers went on strike at GM factories in Michigan and Kentucky until last Friday, and striking workers who do not receive a pay cheque are counted as unemployed. The jobless rate edged up to 3.6%. The manufacturing sector lost 36,000 jobs last month, the most since October 2009. US stock index futures jumped after the data, pointing to a good open on Wall Street this afternoon. News flash: US non-farm payrolls rose 128,000 in October, much stronger than the 89,000 forecast by economists. This means the US economy added more workers than expected. European stock markets are still trading higher ahead of the US jobs numbers, out at 12:30 GMT. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 0.33% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.42% France\u2019s CAC up 0.38% Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib up 0.45% Sterling has held its nerve, despite Nigel Farage\u2019s threat that his Brexit party would fight the ruling Conservatives for every seat if Boris Johnson does not abandon his Brexit deal. The pound is trading higher against the dollar and the euro, at $1.2963, up 0.15%, and at \u20ac1.1626, up 0.18%. Farage dismissed reports that his party would pull hundreds of candidates to avoid damaging the Tories as \u201cidle speculation\u201d. As flagged up earlier, today is Alison Rose\u2019s first day as the boss of Royal Bank of Scotland. She has has pledged to make the climate crisis a priority as she seeks to build a more \u201copen, accessible and inclusive\u201d bank following years of scandal, writes our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff. In a letter sent to staff on her first day as chief executive, Rose said she would share the details of her new strategy for the bank \u2013 still 64% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 in the new year, but sought to draw a line under the past as she takes on the top job following the departure of Ross McEwan, who led the bank since 2013. \u201cAt the heart of how I will run the bank is my conviction that if our customers do well, if our economy does well and if our communities do well, then we all succeed together,\u201d Rose wrote. \u201cShared success also means playing our part to help tackle the problems that can hold the country back, like the threat from climate change, a lack of financial confidence and barriers to enterprise and growth. These pillars will form part of our strategy.\u201d Here is our full story on the profit warning from the car dealership Lookers. Returning to the UK manufacturing PMI, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, says it its clearly good news against the backdrop of election and Brexit uncertainty. However she reckons the sector is still in recession. While the manufacturing PMI recovered in October from September\u2019s extremely weak level, it is still consistent with a recession in the manufacturing sector. Overall, it seems likely that the manufacturing sector has remained a drag on GDP growth at the start of the fourth quarter. And with the other sectors showing little growth, we are expecting the economy to expand by no more than 0.2%-0.3% q/q in the next few quarters. Admittedly, the monetary policy committee still looks set to stand pat at its meeting next Thursday. But if Brexit is delayed again beyond 31st January, and the economy remains weak as we expect, then we still think that the Bank of England will cut rates \u2013 perhaps by 25 basis points in May 2020. More on Mike Ashley - who has called Jeremy Corbyn \u201ca liar\u201d and \u201cclueless\u201d in an interview with the Financial Times. It has emerged that the retail tycoon has spent millions of pounds on flights by helicopter and private jet as his company\u2019s annual profit fell 80%. The Sports Direct owner\u2019s family also received more than \u00a3100,000 of hospitality at Newcastle United, Ashley\u2019s football club. Ashley\u2019s spending was revealed in the annual accounts for Mash Holdings, through which the billionaire owns his businesses. You can read the full story here: And Goals Soccer Centres, the five-aside-pitch operator, has been bought by Scottish firm Soccerworld backed by private equity, saving 750 jobs, our retail correspondent Sarah Butler reports. Goals, which is part-owned by retail tycoon Mike Ashley, also admitted that it may have overstated its profits by as much as \u00a340m as it collapsed into administration and was immediately bought out by Northwind 5s, a new company backed by Soccerworld and Inflexion Private Equity. Goals\u2019 shares were de-listed from the London stock exchange in September after it uncovered a tax accounting scandal stretching back at least a decade. Shares in Lookers, one of Britain\u2019s biggest car dealerships, plunged as much as 30% this morning after the company issued its second profit warning in less than four months, and parted company with its chief executive and chief operating officer. Lookers predicted profit would fall by more than two-thirds this year and announced the closure of 15 branches. It also said Andy Bruce, who had run the company since 2014, and the operations chief Nigel McMinn had agreed to step down immediately. In the latest corporate news, Whirlpool has been slammed by MPs for using \u201cdisgraceful\u201d tactics to \u201csilence\u201d customers who had been victims of fires caused by faulty tumble dryers. The cross-party Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee (BEIS) said the company\u2019s use of non-disclosure agreements in at least 24 cases was \u201cchilling\u201d. As many as 800,000 defective Whirlpool tumble dryers could still be in people\u2019s homes, four years after it emerged that they are a fire risk, the committee said. The pound has given up most of its gains versus the dollar and is trading at $1.2952 now, up 0.07%. Against the euro, it has risen 0.13% to \u20ac1.1623. At 11am GMT, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, will launch his party\u2019s election campaign at the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster. You can read more on our politics live blog: Sterling rose from around $1.22 at the start of October to over $1.30 last week and notched up its biggest monthly rise (of 5.2%) since 2009 in October, on relief that the UK wasn\u2019t going to crash out of the EU at Halloween. But further moves will depend on how December\u2019s general election pans out. Two days ago, US investment bank Goldman Sachs advised currency traders to beat a \u201ctactical retreat\u201d from sterling until the outcome of the election on 12 December becomes clear. Markets are now waiting for the US non-farm payrolls jobs data, out at 12:30 GMT, followed by the US manufacturing PMIs. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at online trading platform IG, has looked at the main moves today. He expects the Dow Jones to open 55 points higher, at 27,101. With the jobs report ahead, traders are buckling up for volatility, although the Fed\u2019s decision to hold off could limit the impact of today\u2019s report. Markets are pricing in one more cut in January, yet that is expected to provide the final move in this recent phase of easing. The latest private business survey for China\u2019s factories was at odds with the gloomy official manufacturing PMI the day before. Mahony explains: Fears over a continued slowdown in manufacturing have been allayed somewhat with the release of a surprisingly positive Caixin manufacturing PMI survey. With the survey focusing on SMEs, there is a strong chance that these less internationalised firms will lead the recovery ahead of their larger competitors. US-China trade remains a key concern for traders, with top negotiators from both sides due to take a phone call that could enhance the chance of a phase one trade deal. Tensions remain high between the two-sides, yet the market perspective is that we simply need some form of progress to maintain the bullish bias for stocks. As for sterling, Mahony says: The pound is on the rise today, as it continues to highlight market optimism in response to the scheduling of the election in December. A surprise jump in the manufacturing PMI provided the best reading in six-months, as the sector shifted back towards expansion territory. However, markets should be wary of these gains, as it is likely to be a reflection of the stockpiling that occurs ahead of each Brexit deadline. With the extension being granted, the stockpiling boost evident this month is likely come to the detriment of the November survey. Corbyn has promised that a Labour government would go after super-rich people who exploit a \u201crigged system\u201d to benefit themselves at the expense of the many, writes our wealth correspondent Rupert Neate. The Labour leader named five members of \u201cthe elite\u201d he would target if he becomes prime minister: Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct; Crispin Odey, a hedge fund boss who made millions betting against the pound in the run-up to the EU referendum; Jim Ratcliffe, the chief executive of the petrochemicals company Ineos; Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times; and Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, who controls a large central London property empire. As the election campaign in the UK gets underway, the retail tycoon Mike Ashley has lashed out at Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader accused him of being one of the \u201cbad bosses\u201d in his first speech of the general election campaign. Ashley, the founder and majority shareholder of Sports Direct who also owns a number of other retail brands, hit back saying Corbyn was \u201cnot only a liar but clueless\u201d in an interview with the Financial Times. Corbyn said Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United football club, \u201cwon\u2019t pay his staff properly\u201d and is \u201crunning Newcastle United into the ground\u201d. In response, Ashley said that the system was corrupt \u2014 proven by the recent case of Debenhams and Goals, where yet again the independent shareholders get wiped out. The real problem is politicians such as Corbyn being unwilling to do anything about it. Asked about Corbyn\u2019s allegations against him, Ashley added: Corbyn is not only a liar but clueless. Time to look at the stock markets again. The FTSE 100 index has pushed 0.36% higher and is trading up 26.6 points at 7274.42 \u2013 welcome relief after yesterday\u2019s 1.1% decline. A surprise bounce in a Chinese manufacturing survey has cheered traders, and the UK manufacturing PMI for October has also improved, although it remains in negative territory. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has gained 0.38%. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.37% France\u2019s CAC up 0.39% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.34% Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, is gloomy despite the improvement in the headline index. The manufacturing downturn continued at the start of the final quarter as uncertainties surrounding Brexit, the economic outlook and domestic politics all took their toll. However, the underlying picture looks even darker than even these disappointing headline numbers suggest, as output and new orders fell despite short-term boosts from stock-building activity in advance of the October 31st Brexit deadline, which included a rise in exports as clients in the EU sought to mitigate supply risk. He said the ongoing uncertainty is hitting two areas of the manufacturing economy especially hard. The first is the trend in employment, as job losses resulting from disappointing sales are exacerbated by manufacturers implementing hiring freezes until the outlook clears. The second is the investment goods industry, where output and new orders are falling sharply as clients postpone capital spending plans. With a further Brexit extension confirmed and the prospect of a December general election, it looks as if the spectre of uncertainty will cast its shadow over manufacturing for the remainder of 2019. More from the survey. A number of firms revisited their Brexit preparations during October, leading to higher levels of input purchasing and a build-up of safety stocks. Growth in inventories of finished goods and purchases were at six-month highs, but remained below the survey-record rates reached during the first quarter. IHS Markit says: Ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit, the economic outlook and the political situation continued to weigh on the UK manufacturing sector during October. Output and new order inflows contracted, leading to further job losses. Firms also ramped up stock-building and purchasing activity in the lead-up to the (postponed) October Brexit departure date. The UK manufacturing PMI rose for the second month, but remained below the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion. British manufacturing has been in decline for the last six months, according to the survey. The last time it was above the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction was in April when the PMI recorded 53.1, before falling to 49.4 in May. News flash: the UK manufacturing PMI from IHS Markit/CIPS rose to 49.6 in October from 48.3 in September. This is the highest reading since April \u2013 although the sector continues to shrink. Anything below the 50 mark indicates contraction. Activity was boosted by manufacturers building stocks ahead of the 31 October deadline for Brexit, which was extended to 31 January, says IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has said Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could prevent the UK from striking a trade deal with the US. Speaking to Nigel Farage on LBC Radio, the US president said the US \u201ccan\u2019t make a deal with the UK\u201d under \u201ccertain aspects of the deal\u201d, despite Johnson\u2019s claim that it would allow Britain to have an independent trade policy. However, the announcement of a successor for Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England has been postponed until after the general election. Our economics team reports: With only days to go until parliament is dissolved, the chancellor Sajid Javid has abandoned plans to announce his choice for Threadneedle Street\u2019s top job during the autumn. The chancellor is believed to have made the decision to delay because he felt that making a choice at a politically sensitive time might damage the independence of the Bank. The BBC\u2019s business editor Simon Jack reported last night that he\u2019s been told that Dame Minouche Shafik is the top pick for the next Bank of England governor. She would be the central bank\u2019s first female governor in its 325-year history. The Egyptian-born British-American economist has already worked at the Bank, as deputy governor, and is currently director of the London School of Economics. Even though Brexit has been postponed for a second time, carmakers are going ahead with costly production shutdowns designed to avoid Brexit disruption. The latest extension, to 31 January, came too late for carmakers who had already agreed closures with staff and suppliers. My colleague Jasper Jolly writes: More than half of the UK\u2019s car manufacturing capacity had some form of shutdown planned to coincide with the 31 October deadline in case of disruption to the supply of parts, a repeat of similar production pauses in April after the original 31 March Brexit date. Jaguar Land Rover will stop making cars and engines at Halewood, Castle Bromwich, Wolverhampton and Solihull from Monday to Friday, with employees instead assigned to maintenance and training. BMW\u2019s plant in Oxford is busy ramping up production of its new electric Mini, which the company hopes will be a mass-market battery-powered vehicle. However, workers did not come in for the Thursday night shift and the plant will remain shut from Friday until Monday. Toyota\u2019s plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire, remained closed on Friday, with a return planned on Monday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The US dollar has hit a three month low today ahead of today\u2019s jobs numbers, while the pound has continued to make gains after its best one month performance since January 2018 [in points terms], as expectations about a no deal Brexit recede. The biggest risk now would appear to be the risk of a Labour government, however given current polling that doesn\u2019t look likely right now. Of course that could change, given what happened in 2017, but for now there appear to be a lot of sterling short positions being pared back, as optimism grows that the worst for the pound may well be behind it. The pound is trading slightly higher against the dollar and the euro. It has benefited from dollar weakness following the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut on Wednesday. The pound is now hovering just below $1.30, at $1.2970, up 0.2% (last week it went through $1.30 and hit a five-month high). Against the euro, it has edged 0.1% higher to \u20ac1.1621. Sterling had its best month since the financial crash in October as the risks of a no-deal Brexit receded. The pound rose more than 5% over the month, from $1.2287 at the start to $1.2940 yesterday. Despite Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge that Britain would leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die,\u201d the deadline has passed. He secured agreement for a general election on 12 December after the EU granted a further Brexit extension to 31 January. European stock markets have also opened higher. Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.4% France\u2019s CAC up 0.34% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.27% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.3% And we\u2019re off. The FTSE 100 index has gained more than 30 points, or 0.46%, to 7282.61 in early trading. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A surprise bounce in Chinese manufacturing has boosted shares in Asia to three-month highs, and stock markets in Europe are expected to follow their lead. Markets had a bit of a rough day yesterday, after news that Hong Kong slid into recession and poor official Chinese factory data. The FTSE 100 index lost 1.1% while on Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 0.5%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.3% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.14%. However, the latest Caixin/Markit monthly survey showed China\u2019s factories ramped up activity at the fastest pace in more than two years in October as export orders rose. Its manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 51.7 from 51.4 in September, marking the third month of expansion. Economists had expected a reading of 51.0. China\u2019s CSI 300 blue-chip stock index jumped 1.69%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng is up 0.66%, while the South Korean Kospi has gained 0.8%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed down 0.33%, after Japanese factory activity sank to a three-month low. MSCI\u2019s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan touched three-month highs, and was later up 0.29%. Sentiment was dampened by a Bloomberg report citing unnamed Chinese officials expressing doubts over whether China and the US can reach a comprehensive long-term trade deal, as the two sides inch closer to signing a \u201cphase one\u201d agreement in an effort to end the 16-month trade war. Markets are now waiting for a key UK manufacturing survey out later this morning and US non-farm payrolls jobs data for October, released at lunchtime. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says on the UK manufacturing PMI: The consensus estimate is 48.1, which would be a decline from the 48.3 in the previous update. The past five report have shown the sector is in contraction territory as Brexit anxiety has taken its toll on the industry. On US non-farm payrolls, he says: The headline figure is expected to be 89,000, which would be a decline from the 136,000 posted in September. Unemployment is tipped to creep up from the 50-year low of 3.5% to 3.6%. Average earnings are expected to edge up to 3% from 2.9%. Broadly speaking, the number of jobs being created has been growing at a slower pace in the past six months. It could be a sign the US economy is cooling, or else it might be because the labour market is close to topping out. The average earnings component will be in focus too as workers who earn more tend to spend more, also a move higher could be sign the jobs market is tightening. Today is Christine Lagarde\u2019s first day as president of the European Central Bank following Mario Draghi\u2019s departure, and Alison Rose starts her new role as chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the UK\u2019s biggest banks. The Agenda 9:30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI for October 12:30pm GMT: US non-farm payrolls for October 1:45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for October (final) 2pm GMT: US ISM Manufacturing survey for October",

      "bodyText": "The Maltese government has seized a massive shipment of unofficial Libyan banknotes believed to have been destined for Khalifa Haftar, the military commander leading an offensive to dislodge the UN-backed government in Tripoli. Security services in Malta confirmed two 2,000-cubic-foot (56-cubic-metre) containers packed full of the recently introduced currency were discovered at the end of September when the shipment stopped in Malta. The cash is thought to have originated from a Russian-owned mint, which has been printing money for the unrecognised Libyan government, based in the eastern city of Bayda. It is claimed the money has been used to fuel the war on Tripoli. Libya has been gripped by a civil war broadly between the east and west of the country leading to rival institutions, including governments, central banks and military forces. Haftar has been bombing the Libyan capital, Tripoli, since April in an attempt to dislodge the government of national accord. Malta recognises the government in Tripoli, led by Fayez al-Sarraj, who visited the island in May to rally support weeks after the Libyan National Army launched the attack on Tripoli. Although Russia claims to be neutral in Libya, Moscow has allowed the eastern government to print billions of Libyan dinars in Russia, some of which has been used to bankroll the LNA and its war efforts. Haftar has also visited Moscow and been provided with firearms. A source from Malta\u2019s security services told the Times of Malta: \u201cI would not interpret this as anti-Russia but as pro-legality. This was about Malta enforcing UN resolutions on Libya, which we have signed up to and backed all along.\u201d Nonetheless, the recognised central bank in Tripoli has so far failed to declare the Russian printed notes as illegal, so it is unclear under which sanctions framework the seizure was made. In April, the island turned down two requests by the Russian government to be granted permission for military aircraft traveling from Syria to Venezuela to fly over Maltese airspace. Shortly after, Malta reportedly also refused to allow a Russian warship to stop over. The Russian government described these developments as \u201cnot friendly\u201d, saying it would take this into account when dealing with the country in future. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has been in Libya and the region in the past week attempting to garner support for a peace conference in Berlin later this month aimed at reducing interference by outside powers, including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar. The UN special envoy Ghassan Salam\u00e9 has admitted the security council is split, with some countries backing Sarraj and others Haftar. A UN call urging Haftar to end his assault on Tripoli has been blocked, leaving the international community to call for a general ceasefire. The fighting has led to 1,000 deaths and in a sign of the impact of Haftar\u2019s assault, 600 detainees have been released from Abu Salim detention centre on to the streets.

      "bodyText": "A level of hype usually reserved for streetwear drops in London\u2019s Soho or Tokyo\u2019s Harajuku could be found at the Wembley branch of Ikea on Friday morning, as the collaboration between the Swedish homeware store and one of the hottest names in fashion, Virgil Abloh, finally went on sale. The Louis Vuitton menswear designer and the founder of the streetwear brand Off-White is known for having a cult following, which explains the throngs who turned up next to a rainy North Circular to buy items from his 15-piece collection. The designs include a backlit take on the Mona Lisa for \u00a365 and a chair with a doorstop attached to one of its legs (\u00a399). Called Markerad, the collection has been generating huge amounts of buzz since it was announced at Paris fashion week last year.

      "bodyText": "Bentley Motors has lost a long-running high court trademark battle with a small, family-owned business, which could mean the luxury carmaker has to destroy all of its branded clothing. The high court in London on Friday ruled that Bentley Motors had infringed trademarks owned by Manchester-based Brandlogic, which owns the Bentley Clothing brand. Bentley Motors said the company was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the decision, and added it would consider an appeal. If it does not win permission to appeal, Bentley Motors could be forced to destroy its stock of branded clothing \u2013 including that worn by staff in its dealerships \u2013 or hand it over to Brandlogic. The court could also award damages. The British carmaker, which is owned by Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, makes luxury cars in Crewe whose list prices start at about \u00a3135,000 for its cheapest model, ranging to more than \u00a3275,000 before extras are added. It makes clothes to match. Bentley Motors\u2019 website still offers a variety of clothing bearing the Bentley name, including a \u00a32,400 leather jacket, knitted jumpers costing \u00a3215, and a set of matching father and child striped polo shirts for a combined \u00a3167. Lawyers for the carmaker argued that there would not be confusion between the two brands. However, in his judgment, Judge Hacon wrote that a trademark search would have revealed \u201cBentley\u201d could not be used. Bentley Clothing started trading in 1962, and its clothes have previously been sold in stores such as House of Fraser and Fenwick. It makes T-shirts, sweatshirts and hats for men, women and children, priced between \u00a325 and \u00a345. Christopher Lees, a director of Brandlogic, said he was \u201cvery relieved\u201d by the judgment, and hoped the ruling would allow him to start to grow the Bentley Clothing business, which has declined to an annual turnover of less than \u00a3100,000 from a peak of more than \u00a35m. \u201cIt has been a battle for a long time,\u201d Lees said. \u201cIt has given us a lot of hardship in my family.\u201d Brandlogic first approached the carmaker about the trademark in 1998, but Bentley Motors continued to make clothing bearing the Bentley name, and at one point made a \u201cfalse claim of ownership\u201d of the trademark, the ruling said. The judge wrote that he thought Bentley Motors made a \u201cconscious decision\u201d to gradually increase the prominence of its logo \u201cin the hope that no one stage would provoke a reaction from Bentley Clothing\u201d. In a statement, Bentley Motors said: \u201cBentley Motors was founded 100 years ago and is an internationally recognised brand operating in 60 different markets around the world. We have been selling clothing for more than 30 years in the UK and at no point has there been any evidence of confusion with another company\u2019s trademark.\u201d",

When huge numbers of industrial workers in the north of England took up rugby in the 1880s, the privately educated leaders of the Rugby Football Union tried to restrict access to the game by making it an amateur sport. \u201cWhy should we hand it over without a struggle to the hordes of working men players who would quickly engulf all others?\u201d asked rugby and cricket international Frank Mitchell in 1897.</p> <p>But men working in mines, docks and factories had to take unpaid leave from work to play rugby. Amateurism meant they could not be compensated for the wages lost playing the game, so the northern rugby clubs proposed that players be given \u201cbroken time\u201d payments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/31/workington-man-swing-voter-north-rugby-league-towns\">Workington Man is London\u2019s latest stereotype for the northern voters it neglects | Lisa Nandy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rugby\u2019s leaders refused. Threatened with expulsion, the top northern clubs broke away in 1895 to form the Northern Union, which would become known as rugby league.</p> <p>In response, RFU banned for life anyone connected with rugby league. Players were ostracised for even talking to rugby league officials. In no other sport was Britain\u2019s class divide so starkly illustrated.</p> <p>Rugby league became a sport outside the establishment, with its own traditions of equality and democracy. Eddie Waring, the legendary commentator, hailed the sport as \u201cthe most democratic in the world\u201d. Trade union leaders such as the miners\u2019 Joe Gormley and TUC general secretary John Monks were regulars on the terraces of Wigan and Swinton.</p> <p>Rugby league also has a history of racial integration unique in British sport. In 1935 George Bennett became the first black international rugby league player, over 40 years before the first black English football international.

      "bodyText": "Will the decisive battles of the 2019 general election be fought on the playing fields of the north of England? Maybe so, now that the Conservative thinktank Onward has identified so-called Workington Man and his \u201cstrong rugby league traditions\u201d as a key target for Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign. The idea that \u201crugby league traditions\u201d have anything in common with the Old Etonians in charge of Britain is laughable. Rugby league was actually born out of a radical revolt against the stranglehold of the privately educated over rugby. When huge numbers of industrial workers in the north of England took up rugby in the 1880s, the privately educated leaders of the Rugby Football Union tried to restrict access to the game by making it an amateur sport. \u201cWhy should we hand it over without a struggle to the hordes of working men players who would quickly engulf all others?\u201d asked rugby and cricket international Frank Mitchell in 1897. But men working in mines, docks and factories had to take unpaid leave from work to play rugby. Amateurism meant they could not be compensated for the wages lost playing the game, so the northern rugby clubs proposed that players be given \u201cbroken time\u201d payments. Rugby\u2019s leaders refused. Threatened with expulsion, the top northern clubs broke away in 1895 to form the Northern Union, which would become known as rugby league. In response, RFU banned for life anyone connected with rugby league. Players were ostracised for even talking to rugby league officials. In no other sport was Britain\u2019s class divide so starkly illustrated. Rugby league became a sport outside the establishment, with its own traditions of equality and democracy. Eddie Waring, the legendary commentator, hailed the sport as \u201cthe most democratic in the world\u201d. Trade union leaders such as the miners\u2019 Joe Gormley and TUC general secretary John Monks were regulars on the terraces of Wigan and Swinton. Rugby league also has a history of racial integration unique in British sport. In 1935 George Bennett became the first black international rugby league player, over 40 years before the first black English football international. In 1972 Clive Sullivan became the first black Briton to captain a national side, and led Great Britain to a world cup triumph. The sense that the game reflected wider social divisions was highlighted during the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike, which was fought out in many towns and villages in the north where rugby league was the dominant sport. Rugby league clubs became organising centres for feeding and supporting striking miners and their families. When Rupert Murdoch\u2019s BSkyB tried to force clubs to merge after it bought the game\u2019s TV rights in 1995, many of those who had been on the picket lines in 1984 once again turned out to protest. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken our jobs, now they want to take away our leisure,\u201d was how one demonstrator expressed their anger. Rugby league communities have been devastated by deindustrialisation, austerity and government policies over the past 30 years. Half of the English teams in the Super League come from areas that are in the most deprived 10% in Britain. Workington itself has lost its coal and steel industries, and is a long way from the prosperous town that launched its professional rugby league club in 1945. The attitudes that gave birth to rugby league remain strong. Hostility to the establishment and suspicion of the ruling elite, whether in Westminster or in business, has not diminished. Indeed, the strong Brexit vote in rugby league-playing regions can be seen as a protest vote against a two-party parliamentary system that has continually let down the \u201cpost-industrial\u201d north. Unlike Essex Man or Worcester Woman, Workington Man (Johnson\u2019s consultants appear to be ignorant of the fact that women are also rugby league fans and players) has none of the advantages of living in the economic bubble of the south of England. While dissatisfaction with Labour also runs deep, it is unlikely that traditional rugby league areas in the north of England will fall to the Tories. Although the Brexit party has picked up votes in these areas, Nigel Farage\u2019s Dulwich College accent and golf club-bore demeanour is too great a barrier for him to make any significant breakthrough in areas where stubborn resistance to self-appointed authority is deeply ingrained. As one contemporary writer remarked about the 1895 split, northern rugby and its communities had rejected the \u201cthraldom of the southern gentry\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia who won the Nobel peace prize last month, is facing the most serious crisis of his term in office after the death of scores of people in a wave of violent disorder. Billene Seyoum, Abiy\u2019s spokesperson, blamed \u201ca very senseless act of violence\u201d and said the death toll of 78 could rise. Seyoum said 409 people had been detained over the unrest and that this figure too could rise. The violence began when political protests rapidly evolved into clashes fuelled by ethnicity and religion. The unrest in the Oromia region \u2013 the heartland of the majority Oromo ethnic group \u2013 underlines the significant challenges for Abiy before next May\u2019s scheduled elections. Abiy is the country\u2019s first leader from the Oromo community, who have long complained of economic, cultural and political marginalisation. The 43-year-old was awarded the Nobel prize for the peace deal he concluded with neighbouring Eritrea last year, three months after coming to power. The agreement resolved nearly two decades of military stalemate following a border war that ended in 2000. Abiy has also pushed through reforms at home, dramatically changing the atmosphere in what was regarded as a repressive state. Measures have included the lifting of a ban on political parties, the release of imprisoned journalists and the sacking of previously untouchable officials, some of them accused of torture. The former military intelligence officer\u2019s public renunciation of past abuses drew a line between his administration and those of his predecessors, as did the appointment of former dissidents and large numbers of women to senior roles. The trigger for the recent violence was a Facebook post by Jawar Mohammed, an Oromo activist and media mogul, claiming that security forces had tried to orchestrate an attack against him. Supporters took to the streets last week to protest. Crowds of young men from his Oromo ethnic group quickly turned their anger against Abiy, saying that he had betrayed them by mistreating Jawar. Jawar is a polarising figure who is accused by critics of fomenting ethnic divisions. Though he helped Abiy come to power last year, he has recently criticised some of the new prime minister\u2019s policies. Officials have denied Jawar\u2019s claim that he was targeted. Abiy was booed by protesters on Thursday during a visit to Ambo, a site of earlier violence 50 miles (80km) west of the capital, Addis Ababa. Analysts say Abiy\u2019s reforms have lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions between the country\u2019s many ethnic groups. Temesgen Ababa, 17, described how security forces opened fire in Adama, a city of 300,000 people south-east of the capital, hitting an eight-year-old boy. When Temesgen rushed over to help the boy, he was shot in the chest. \u201cHow can shooting at people like that become an appropriate response?\u201d Temesgen asked from his hospital bed. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission estimates that 10 of the deaths last week were at the hands of security forces. \u201cAdama is a melting pot of Ethiopian ethnic and religious groups, with many different groups, so these incidents of violence rooted in religion and ethnicity can be very dangerous,\u201d said Fisseha Tekle, a researcher with Amnesty International. \u201cIt can be a premonition for mass atrocities.\u201d Attacks on churches and at least one mosque were also reported during the clashes. At Adama hospital, nearly 200 people sought treatment and 16 died \u2013 numbers hospital staff said were unprecedented. Medics described scrambling to find beds and supplies for patients who had been shot and beaten as protests erupted last Wednesday. \u201cMost of the people were under stress, even including the staff, because this was sudden and the first time like this in this town,\u201d Dr Desalegn Fekadu, a surgeon, said. There are signs that Abiy, who welcomed Jawar home, may now move to close down political space that has opened up since he took power. With elections due next year, Abiy must balance demands for political freedoms with the need to restrain political actors who are mobilising ethnic identities by demanding more access to land, power and resources for their communities. Abiy\u2019s feud with Jawar also complicates his plans to pursue controversial reforms such as transforming Ethiopia\u2019s ruling coalition into a political party, analysts and diplomats say. The coalition of four parties has been in power since a Marxist dictatorship was ousted in 1991. Officials recently expressed anger at some media outlets that they described as unprofessional and partisan. Ethiopia\u2019s economic transformation is one of the continent\u2019s success stories but could easily be derailed by instability or widespread violence.

It feels like a no-brainer. Emery\u2019s side have been crying out for his ability to create something from nothing to feed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. One decision that has been made is that Granit Xhaka will play no part in proceedings.

The seven listed oil majors - including ExxonMobil, BP and Shell - would need to cut the total amount of oil and gas they produce every day by 35% to avoid driving temperatures 1.5C higher than pre-industrialised levels. Global governments would also need to stop issuing new oil and gas licences for fossil fuel exploration, according to the report. The study was produced by Carbon Tracker, a financial thinktank, using publicly available oil company data to measure their carbon footprints today and by 2040.

But European oil firms such as Shell and BP, considered the greenest of the world\u2019s major oil companies, would also need to make a step-change in their business models to avoid contributing to a climate catastrophe. The report found that all major oil companies would need to cut their fossil fuel production below 2019 levels by 2040: Shell would still need to cut its fossil fuel production by 10% BP would require cuts of 25% French oil major Total and US major Chevron would both require cuts of 35% Italy\u2019s oil major Eni would require cuts of 40% US oil major ExxonMobil would need cuts of 55% And ConocoPhillips would face the biggest production cuts of 85% An investigation by the Guardian earlier this month revealed that many companies are planning to increase their fossil fuel output by more than a third rather than cut their oil and gas production by a similar amount. It revealed that Shell and ExxonMobil will be among the leaders in the expected fossil fuel harvest with a projected output increase of more than 35% between 2018 and 2030. The increase is a sharper rise than over the previous 12 years, despite growing calls from activist investors and green groups that the next decade will be crucial in keeping a cap on rising global temperatures. Shell has said it does not disclose future production plans but it was on course to sustain output to meet demand, which requires continued investment.",

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.<br></p>\n    <p>The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>According to arcane&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf\">Senate rules</a>, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

I won\u2019t go back to [Andrew] Johnson because that was a little before my time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they did things wrong. I did nothing wrong.\u201d Nixon was at the head of a conspiracy and cover-up that centered on the break-in of the Democratic National Committee office in the Watergate building in Washington in 1972 to steal dirt on his political opponents. Johnson was impeached in 1868 on congressional charges relating to political corruption. On Thursday, for only the third time in the history of the modern presidency, the US House of Representatives voted to formalize the impeachment proceedings. In a largely party-line vote of 232-196, the House embarked on a path that seemed likely to lead to Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 if not necessarily his removal from office. Pelosi presided over the vote and marked it with a bang of her gavel. Republicans held ranks to vote uniformly against the process, while two Democrats crossed party lines to join them. The House\u2019s sole independent, former Republican Justin Amash of Michigan, voted to advance the resolution. The vote set rules for the public phase of the inquiry, laying out a plan for impeachment that could produce dramatic televised public hearings within two weeks and a vote on impeachment itself by the end of the year. For weeks, congressional investigators have been interviewing witnesses \u2013 15 and counting \u2013 behind closed doors about alleged misconduct by Trump, who stands accused of using the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 US election. Witnesses have been called to appear behind closed doors next week, before a shift to open hearings and the drawing up of official articles of impeachment. A simple majority vote in favor in the House would then move the process to the Senate for a likely trial of the president.",

      "body": "<p>There was one of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/liamsteevenson/status/1173356049585332225?s=20\" title=\"\">those opinionated Twitter exchanges</a> recently about the world\u2019s most over-rated wines. It naturally prompted vigorous disagreement depending on the standpoint and loyalties of those involved, but Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Napa Valley and, surprisingly to me, New Zealand were the most commonly mentioned suspects.</p> <p>As with most things on Twitter, it was also wildly oversimplified. Of course there are good wines from all those regions, though I struggle to find much to write about in the Napa Valley. The problem is that there is often a disconnect between value for money and reputation. Big names, both producers and region, generally command high prices that are not always warranted, or that you\u2019d be willing to pay. For example, you\u2019d be better off buying Benjamin Leroux\u2019s very delicious <strong>Bourgogne C\u00f4te d\u2019Or Pinot Noir 2018 </strong>(13%) at <a href=\"https://www.bbr.com/search/?text=Leroux\" title=\"\">\u00a323.30 from Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</a> than his <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbr.com/products-53285-2016-berry-bros-and-rudd-nuits-st-georges-benjamin-leroux\" title=\"\">Nuits St Georges 2017 </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.bbr.com/products-53285-2016-berry-bros-and-rudd-nuits-st-georges-benjamin-leroux\" title=\"\">at \u00a337.50</a>, unless you were going to tuck it away for several years. There is a lot of decent basic bordeaux around that won\u2019t cost an arm and a leg, but St Emilion rarely justifies its high cost.</p> <p>Things move on, too. At one time, chablis was hugely over-rated, but own-label chablis is, I think, both reliable and fairly priced, and a downright bargain if you get it on promotion or on a supermarket discount. By contrast, albari\u00f1o, which is rather more fashionable these days, often disappoints this drinker, at any rate, despite steadily creeping up in price.</p> <p>Consistency is definitely a factor in whether something is over- or under-rated. That\u2019s partly due to vintage, true, but it is more a question of style and price point. Brands and blends tend to be consistent, while wines from producers that essentially just buy in juice on price are less so. It\u2019s also a question of taste: if you like a traditional, oak-dominated crianza or reserva rioja, say, you may find some more modern examples too forward and fruity; and if you love New Zealand sauvignon blanc, you may not appreciate more restrained versions that don\u2019t have that pungent, gooseberry and passionfruit character. And Italian wines, with a few notable exceptions such as Gavi, are more than usually hard to pin down in style.</p> <p>There are also wines (mainly French, it has to be said) that just fall under the radar. Muscadet has been eclipsed by picpoul. Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 is almost always cheaper \u2013 and better \u2013 than a comparable sancerre. Riesling is almost always reasonable. Sherry ditto. Take advantage, people!</p> <h2>Four wines that punch above their price point</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"dsh\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height: 1px; display: block; background: #DCDCDC; margin: 12px 0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb4214ddb01dbec3e601cc9014e68af86683bf17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4214ddb01dbec3e601cc9014e68af86683bf17/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wm Morrison The Best Petit Chablis 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Wm-Morrison-Petit-Chablis-/119837011\" title=\"\">Wm Morrison The Best Petit Chablis 2017</a></strong></p> <p>\u00a38.75 on promotion, 12%.</p> <p>Classy little chablis with a year\u2019s bottle age.

      "bodyText": "There was one of those opinionated Twitter exchanges recently about the world\u2019s most over-rated wines. It naturally prompted vigorous disagreement depending on the standpoint and loyalties of those involved, but Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Napa Valley and, surprisingly to me, New Zealand were the most commonly mentioned suspects. As with most things on Twitter, it was also wildly oversimplified. Of course there are good wines from all those regions, though I struggle to find much to write about in the Napa Valley. The problem is that there is often a disconnect between value for money and reputation. Big names, both producers and region, generally command high prices that are not always warranted, or that you\u2019d be willing to pay. For example, you\u2019d be better off buying Benjamin Leroux\u2019s very delicious Bourgogne C\u00f4te d\u2019Or Pinot Noir 2018 (13%) at \u00a323.30 from Berry Bros &amp; Rudd than his Nuits St Georges 2017 at \u00a337.50, unless you were going to tuck it away for several years. There is a lot of decent basic bordeaux around that won\u2019t cost an arm and a leg, but St Emilion rarely justifies its high cost. Things move on, too. At one time, chablis was hugely over-rated, but own-label chablis is, I think, both reliable and fairly priced, and a downright bargain if you get it on promotion or on a supermarket discount. By contrast, albari\u00f1o, which is rather more fashionable these days, often disappoints this drinker, at any rate, despite steadily creeping up in price. Consistency is definitely a factor in whether something is over- or under-rated. That\u2019s partly due to vintage, true, but it is more a question of style and price point. Brands and blends tend to be consistent, while wines from producers that essentially just buy in juice on price are less so. It\u2019s also a question of taste: if you like a traditional, oak-dominated crianza or reserva rioja, say, you may find some more modern examples too forward and fruity; and if you love New Zealand sauvignon blanc, you may not appreciate more restrained versions that don\u2019t have that pungent, gooseberry and passionfruit character. And Italian wines, with a few notable exceptions such as Gavi, are more than usually hard to pin down in style. There are also wines (mainly French, it has to be said) that just fall under the radar. Muscadet has been eclipsed by picpoul. Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 is almost always cheaper \u2013 and better \u2013 than a comparable sancerre. Riesling is almost always reasonable. Sherry ditto. Take advantage, people! Four wines that punch above their price point Wm Morrison The Best Petit Chablis 2017 \u00a38.75 on promotion, 12%. Classy little chablis with a year\u2019s bottle age. Good for drinking now. Sainsbury\u2019s Taste the Difference Douro Red 2017 \u00a310.50, 14.5%. As rich and full-flavoured as you\u2019d expect from a wine based on port grapes, Douro reds rarely disappoint. Think beef stew. Morrisons The Best Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine 2018 \u00a36.50 on promotion, 12%. Massively under-rated, crisp, fresh seafood wine \u2013 drink with oysters or moules marini\u00e8res. Cune Rioja Gran Reserva 2013 \u00a311.50 Tesco. Eleven (or so) quid is really terrific value for this elegant, sophisticated gran reserva: Cune is a reliable name to look out for. \u2022 For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine.com",

Ministers released details on Wednesday of plans to improve dilapidated town centres of key marginal seats mainly across the north of England and the Midlands. Public money is being spent to publicise the scheme using targeted Facebook advertisements sent to local people. In an announcement on a government website, the department of housing, communities and local government claimed that part of a \u00a33.6bn fund would be spent boosting rundown high streets across dozens of towns. Adverts inform the public that \u201cthe government is investing up to \u00a325m\u201d in their local area, featuring the name and image of the local town. In reality, the sum going to each settlement is likely to be much smaller. The seats being targeted include Wakefield, Bolton, Northampton, Milton Keynes, Mansfield, Lincoln, and Newcastle-under-Lyme as well as some coastal towns such as Lowestoft. It also appears that public funding may have been used to buy adverts promoting government investment in Workington \u2013 the home of \u201cWorkington Man\u201d, which some Tory-backing groups have suggested is the stereotypical individual who needs to be won over to win the election.

Ads about social issues, elections or politics that appear on our platforms should include a disclaimer provided by advertisers. \u201cWe are currently working with the advertiser to help them better understand our policies and correctly label ads in the future.\u201d The decision to use public funds to promote the adverts showed how the government was able to skirt rules that restrict public advertising spending during elections, as parliament has yet to be dissolved and the campaign has not formally begun. The adverts were also not recorded initially by Facebook as being of a political nature, making it harder to see how much money the government is spending on the campaign and raising questions about the effectiveness of the social network\u2019s political transparency measures.

Parliament has not yet dissolved and the civil service has not officially entered the pre-election period when it must remain neutral. The advertisements were published after Labour had acknowledged it would back an election. Under the MyTown scheme, each local authority will receive a share of capacity funding to kickstart plans to redevelop town centres. Ministers said the funding could be used to redevelop vacant buildings and land, drive private-sector investment by supporting small businesses and ensure that young people have the skills they need to get good jobs. Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has come under pressure to follow Twitter in banning political ads, but has refused. A government spokesman told the news website that ministers would respond to Lucas\u2019s letter. \u201cThese posts were published before the election was called and parliament has not yet been dissolved. All towns selected were chosen according to the same selection methodology, including analysis of deprivation, exposure to Brexit, productivity, economy resilience and investment opportunities,\u201d he said.",

Of all the people in all the world you would not expect to see browsing clothing racks and looking for presents on a Friday afternoon it would be England\u2019s head coach on the eve of the biggest game of his life.</p> <p>The middle-aged couple who persuaded him to pose for a selfie just around from the leisurewear section could scarcely believe their luck. Jones does not come across as a habitual high street browser \u2013 nor, after eight weeks of press conferences, could you blame him for not looking delighted to see the man from the Guardian \u2013 but the caption wrote itself. England are so well prepared for the final their coach has already begun his Christmas shopping.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/01/band-brothers-world-cup-final-wisdom-england-sibling\">Band of brothers: World Cup final words of wisdom from England siblings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The players seem particularly relaxed and calm, too. Barely had Jones left the shop than the internet was creaking afresh under the weight of training ground pictures of Jonny Wilkinson coaching the squad\u2019s current captain, Owen Farrell, in the art of drop-goals. Again it was a snapshot that neatly reflected England\u2019s state of mind. Sixteen years on from their last great golden era, sealed by Wilkinson\u2019s immortal extra-time drop, they feel they have every base covered.</p> <p>This is not to say rugby\u2019s great prize is automatically coming home to Twickenham for the first time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/28/vault-rugby-world-cup-2003-england-victory\" title=\"\">since 2003</a>. What is indisputable is that England have spent four years painstakingly working towards this moment. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/26/england-new-zealand-rugby-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">against New Zealand</a> they delivered their best performance in many years. If it all goes pear-shaped from here they can hardly blame their preparation, their management, their available budget or the weather, which has turned beautifully clear and sunny in the past couple of days.</p> <p>All of which explains why England, as a nation, has not looked forward this expectantly to a game of rugby in ages. In clubhouses, pubs and sitting rooms across the land, they will be lying back and thinking of an England in which everything, in these days of political division and intolerance, is gloriously rosy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\" title=\"\">The cricket World Cup has already been reeled in</a> and here is a another high-profile global opportunity. If Jones\u2019s boys come good even Ben Stokes\u2019s compelling case to be Sports Personality of the Year may have to be reassessed.</p> <p>It would, of course, be pushing it to suggest the 2019 squad are anything like as well-known or feted as their 2003 predecessors were at this same juncture. The faces of Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Jason Robinson and Wilkinson had already been carved on Twickenham\u2019s equivalent of Mount Rushmore before that Sydney final. Even now, if Jamie George and Elliot Daly popped out for a quick lunchtime coffee in Slough the staff member serving them would still be asking what names he or she should write on their takeaway cups.</p> <p>This says less about George or Daly, both starting Lions and excellent role models, as crowd-pleasing athletes and rather more about the public\u2019s complex relationship with rugby union. There will always be those who want to read George Eliot instead and would never contemplate venturing to the Stoop or Sandy Park on an average Premiership weekend. Others still regard it as a pumped-up minority sport and will forever stick to watching Chelsea or Wolverhampton Wanderers. Rare are the days outside World Cups and Six Nations when the oval ball reaches a peak terrestrial audience or penetrates the consciousness of those who can just about recognise Wilkinson and, at a stretch, Will Carling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75fbf2f5b36efebe509c3878afed855b9469ec68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75fbf2f5b36efebe509c3878afed855b9469ec68/0_30_5375_3225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Jones looks relaxed during England\u2019s final training session in Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Jones looks relaxed during England\u2019s final training session in Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor has the Rugby Football Union always been brilliant at preaching to the unconverted, particularly since the national side crashed and burned in the pool stages of the home 2015 World Cup. What should have been the springboard to a whole new level of popularity was ultimately the biggest missed opportunity in the history of English team sport. Which is why the RFU owes a significant debt of gratitude to this current group of players, now on the verge of digging their currently cash-strapped union out of a sizeable hole by selling the game afresh to the next generation.</p> <p>Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill \u2026 the fact the 21-year-old Curry is the only Englishman on the shortlist for World Rugby Player of the Year should not obscure the fact his country have an array of twinkling new stars emerging. When they last made the final in 2007, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/15/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20078\" title=\"\">already lost 36-0</a> to their opponents South Africa in their pool, no one expected much and the highest-profile fan to send a message in final week was the singer Kenny Rogers, whose song \u201cThe Gambler\u201d had become an unlikely dressing-room favourite. This time even Prince Harry has been sending pictures of his son in an England babygro and there is far more belief, both inside and outside the camp.</p> <p>Much of it is based on the compelling evidence of the past couple of months. On their travels between Miyazaki, Sapporo, Kobe, Tokyo, Oita and Yokohama, Jones\u2019s side have yet to be seriously challenged on the scoreboard. They have not just beaten all the southern hemisphere opposition put in front of them but have stuck 39 and 40 points respectively on Argentina <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/19/england-australia-rugby-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">and Australia</a> and left the whole of New Zealand practically speechless.</p> <p>They have, moreover, defended with such physicality that opponents have often been unable to establish a consistent foothold in games. By the time the so-called \u201cfinishers\u201d have appeared, the tone has already been set. Nothing \u2013 from typhoons and humidity to Brodie Retallick and Ardie Savea \u2013 has inconvenienced them for too long. Those drawing similarities between England and Saracens \u2013 serial winners in Europe and domestically in recent seasons \u2013 have been doing so with good reason.</p> <p>There is just one fly in the miso soup \u2013 and a substantial one at that. Virtually every World Cup final in the modern era, save for New Zealand\u2019s spectacular dismissal of Australia four years ago \u2013 has been tight and tense.

      "bodyText": "Around 37 million inhabitants live in Japan\u2019s sprawling capital city, enough to make the chances of bumping into Eddie Jones in a random shop in a non-touristy part of town the day before a World Cup final almost comically remote. Of all the people in all the world you would not expect to see browsing clothing racks and looking for presents on a Friday afternoon it would be England\u2019s head coach on the eve of the biggest game of his life. The middle-aged couple who persuaded him to pose for a selfie just around from the leisurewear section could scarcely believe their luck. Jones does not come across as a habitual high street browser \u2013 nor, after eight weeks of press conferences, could you blame him for not looking delighted to see the man from the Guardian \u2013 but the caption wrote itself. England are so well prepared for the final their coach has already begun his Christmas shopping. The players seem particularly relaxed and calm, too. Barely had Jones left the shop than the internet was creaking afresh under the weight of training ground pictures of Jonny Wilkinson coaching the squad\u2019s current captain, Owen Farrell, in the art of drop-goals. Again it was a snapshot that neatly reflected England\u2019s state of mind. Sixteen years on from their last great golden era, sealed by Wilkinson\u2019s immortal extra-time drop, they feel they have every base covered. This is not to say rugby\u2019s great prize is automatically coming home to Twickenham for the first time since 2003. What is indisputable is that England have spent four years painstakingly working towards this moment. Last week against New Zealand they delivered their best performance in many years. If it all goes pear-shaped from here they can hardly blame their preparation, their management, their available budget or the weather, which has turned beautifully clear and sunny in the past couple of days. All of which explains why England, as a nation, has not looked forward this expectantly to a game of rugby in ages. In clubhouses, pubs and sitting rooms across the land, they will be lying back and thinking of an England in which everything, in these days of political division and intolerance, is gloriously rosy. The cricket World Cup has already been reeled in and here is a another high-profile global opportunity. If Jones\u2019s boys come good even Ben Stokes\u2019s compelling case to be Sports Personality of the Year may have to be reassessed. It would, of course, be pushing it to suggest the 2019 squad are anything like as well-known or feted as their 2003 predecessors were at this same juncture. The faces of Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Jason Robinson and Wilkinson had already been carved on Twickenham\u2019s equivalent of Mount Rushmore before that Sydney final. Even now, if Jamie George and Elliot Daly popped out for a quick lunchtime coffee in Slough the staff member serving them would still be asking what names he or she should write on their takeaway cups. This says less about George or Daly, both starting Lions and excellent role models, as crowd-pleasing athletes and rather more about the public\u2019s complex relationship with rugby union. There will always be those who want to read George Eliot instead and would never contemplate venturing to the Stoop or Sandy Park on an average Premiership weekend. Others still regard it as a pumped-up minority sport and will forever stick to watching Chelsea or Wolverhampton Wanderers. Rare are the days outside World Cups and Six Nations when the oval ball reaches a peak terrestrial audience or penetrates the consciousness of those who can just about recognise Wilkinson and, at a stretch, Will Carling. Nor has the Rugby Football Union always been brilliant at preaching to the unconverted, particularly since the national side crashed and burned in the pool stages of the home 2015 World Cup. What should have been the springboard to a whole new level of popularity was ultimately the biggest missed opportunity in the history of English team sport. Which is why the RFU owes a significant debt of gratitude to this current group of players, now on the verge of digging their currently cash-strapped union out of a sizeable hole by selling the game afresh to the next generation. Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill \u2026 the fact the 21-year-old Curry is the only Englishman on the shortlist for World Rugby Player of the Year should not obscure the fact his country have an array of twinkling new stars emerging. When they last made the final in 2007, having already lost 36-0 to their opponents South Africa in their pool, no one expected much and the highest-profile fan to send a message in final week was the singer Kenny Rogers, whose song \u201cThe Gambler\u201d had become an unlikely dressing-room favourite. This time even Prince Harry has been sending pictures of his son in an England babygro and there is far more belief, both inside and outside the camp. Much of it is based on the compelling evidence of the past couple of months. On their travels between Miyazaki, Sapporo, Kobe, Tokyo, Oita and Yokohama, Jones\u2019s side have yet to be seriously challenged on the scoreboard. They have not just beaten all the southern hemisphere opposition put in front of them but have stuck 39 and 40 points respectively on Argentina and Australia and left the whole of New Zealand practically speechless. They have, moreover, defended with such physicality that opponents have often been unable to establish a consistent foothold in games. By the time the so-called \u201cfinishers\u201d have appeared, the tone has already been set. Nothing \u2013 from typhoons and humidity to Brodie Retallick and Ardie Savea \u2013 has inconvenienced them for too long. Those drawing similarities between England and Saracens \u2013 serial winners in Europe and domestically in recent seasons \u2013 have been doing so with good reason. There is just one fly in the miso soup \u2013 and a substantial one at that. Virtually every World Cup final in the modern era, save for New Zealand\u2019s spectacular dismissal of Australia four years ago \u2013 has been tight and tense. South Africa\u2019s pack are every bit as physical as their opposite numbers and have a set piece that has so far ground down all comers. To date the Boks have lost only one lineout in the whole tournament and have a pair of half-backs in Faf de Klerk and Handre Pollard capable of kicking any side where it hurts. Some of Pollard\u2019s goal-kicking against Wales in the semi-final was as sweet as anything in this tournament, while the brilliant Cheslin Kolbe can make mugs of even the best defenders. While England stand within sight of becoming the first team to beat the Wallabies, the All Blacks and the Springboks at a single World Cup, it is also the case that no side have gone on to lift the trophy after beating New Zealand en route for 28 years. Listening to Pollard and his captain, Siya Kolisi, explaining how much it would mean to South Africa to replicate their triumphs of 1995 and 2007 from what was virtually a standing start two years ago was to suspect Farrell and co will have to withstand a serious barrage at some stage. These two sides just happen to be strong in several of the same areas and the Springbok bench, wryly nicknamed the \u201cBomb Squad\u201d, is also as explosive as any. Kolisi, furthermore, will be winning his 50th cap, while his father has travelled out of Africa for the first time in his life to watch him play. On the face of it the game is unlikely to match the Kiwi pyrotechnics at Twickenham four years ago, with Pollard among those ruling out many \u201cdisco lights\u201d when it comes to the Bok gameplan. The battle for gainline supremacy, however, will be a match for any dohyo, the ring in which Japan\u2019s sumo wrestlers grapple. Slow down England\u2019s ball consistently at the breakdown and the hungry Springboks will be in the hunt, particularly if they are a score ahead with half an hour left. If their opponents, on the other hand, display the same dynamism, precision and class which scuppered New Zealand, Wilkinson\u2019s 11th-hour drop-goal tuition should not be required.

He didn\u2019t enjoy the farm so he left me to do most of that and spent most of his time kicking a rugby ball around in the garden with our cousin, Monty, both of them wearing rugby tops and pretending to kick the winning goal.</p> <p>But seriously, I am so so proud of what he has done. He was always destined to be an England player. He wasn\u2019t the biggest but it was his speed, he would score nine tries in a match. He was always one step in front of everyone and he could read the game so well. He was always the standout player, scoring a miracle try of some sort!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31215a80e824ac2e459ada706fb0af7c1ea6e1cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31215a80e824ac2e459ada706fb0af7c1ea6e1cf/0_0_3134_3056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Youngs, right, says Ben is no use on the family farm because he knows nothing about tractors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"975\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Youngs, right, says Ben is no use on the family farm because he knows nothing about tractors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Dwyer/Seconds Left/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been a lot of FaceTiming and texts, we\u2019ve spoken two to three times a week while he\u2019s been in Japan. We talk about everything, rugby chat, family chat, but, no, there\u2019s been no talk about tractors! Bendoesn\u2019t even know what we do on the farm at this time of year! Because we do the same job, we\u2019re professional rugby players, and internationals, I know what he\u2019s going through. He can talk to me about things that are going on that he can\u2019t with other people.</p> <p>Speaking to him the other day, the players just really want to finish the job. I was telling him to just enjoy the week, enjoy the occasion, it\u2019s going to go in a flash and you might never experience this again. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p> <p>Dad is out there but mum doesn\u2019t really like watching the games live so she is looking after Ben\u2019s kids so his wife, Charlotte, can go to Japan. I\u2019m going to watch it in the morning before our game, but I\u2019ve got to keep a lid on the emotions because otherwise I\u2019ll be exhausted and we need a win too.</p> <p>If I was there I would want to tell him how amazingly proud the whole family are of him. Everything that he has achieved is more than we could ever have imagined already. Think of all the sacrifices you have made over the past four years for this and enjoy this moment. It\u2019s very, very special \u2013 take it all in. I can\u2019t tell you how much I will celebrate if we both win on Saturday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Marcus Watson, 28, Wasps wing, Olympic silver medallist and elder brother of Anthony, 25, England\u2019s right wing</strong></p> <p>Well, the brotherly competition worked out pretty well for Anthony! I guess we were both pretty competitive \u2013 all three of us \u2013 because we\u2019ve got the youngest one, Callum, as well. Anthony always used to be that kid who when he would lose he would cry no matter what. I remember my dad would beat him at races and stuff when we were young and he would cry so much. Now it comes out in a different way. You don\u2019t see many tears but he still really hates losing at anything, literally anything.</p> <p>When I was in England Under-18s or 20s and he was in Under-16s you always picture what things will be like in the future and to be honest, I thought we would play together for England! When I got into the full-time academy the coaches started to give me a bit of banter that Anthony was coming up and going to be better than me. I thought, well, it\u2019s just banter, but he has ended up doing pretty well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarcusWatson11/status/1189896954509168641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A massive thanks to Dai and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WaspsRugby?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WaspsRugby</a> for letting me go.

When I was about 17 or 18 I knew Anthony was going to be a similar sort of player to me and then you look at his frame and he\u2019s a lot bigger than me and it was then I realised, he\u2019s going to be a pretty serious rugby player.</p> <p>I\u2019ve FaceTimed him earlier this week and he texted me on Tuesday saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to try to get you to Japan\u201d. I messaged him back, saying: \u201cThe Wasps team\u2019s already been announced for this weekend, so I think we\u2019re going to struggle.\u201d I said we should start a tweet #getmarcustojapan.

But beforehand? He will understand the magnitude of the game so for me it would be more about reminding him about the reason he started playing the game in the first place, because he enjoyed it. Try your best to enjoy the situation.

We were pretty normal as brothers I think, we fought a bit, argued but we would always be there for each other.</p> <p>We must be pretty similar and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve ended up moving into the same positions on the pitch, from back-row to loosehead and then to hooker but no, he didn\u2019t take my position. We were moved there by different people over the years. Some might say we\u2019re pretty similar as people too, although I like to think I\u2019m the nicer one \u2026 some might disagree!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b81fdad7d978deab8771e5677bc31b5afae258e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b81fdad7d978deab8771e5677bc31b5afae258e8/0_300_3280_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Cowan-Dickie says Luke did not learn any of his rugby skills by handling slippery fish on their father\u2019s boat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"820\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Cowan-Dickie says Luke did not learn any of his rugby skills by handling slippery fish on their father\u2019s boat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ppauk/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ve both done a few trips out with Dad [Adam, a deep-sea fisherman] but, to answer the question, we definitely didn\u2019t learn anything from handling slippery fish that was any use when it comes to throwing the ball into the lineout in the wet!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/31/eddie-jones-england-rugby-world-cup-final-south-africa\">Eddie Jones urges England to inspire the nation with World Cup glory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How would I describe him in a few words? Confident, a winner, good at everything he does, multi-talented at sports. He was very annoying! When he was playing under-16 and under-18 level, some of the things that he could do for a front-row forward, the skills that he had, I knew then the kid could be special as a rugby player.</p> <p>We play a lot of Xbox and we\u2019ve been chatting on that while he\u2019s been in Japan. He\u2019s really good at that too. At one point he was No 1 in the world on Call of Duty, search and destroy. Everything he picks up, he does well at.</p> <p>We\u2019re playing on Friday night in Nottingham so I\u2019ll be watching the match in the hotel on Saturday morning. If I was there, I would just tell him: do what you do. Enjoy it, don\u2019t worry about it \u2013 at the end of the day rugby is rugby whatever happens. Do what you can and we will proud of you all the way.</p> <p><strong>Ben Curry, 21, Sale flanker and by 90 minutes the elder of identical twin brother Tom, the England blindside flanker</strong></p> <p>We were pretty similar when we were growing up \u2013 that\u2019s why we clashed so many times and had so many arguments. We were very competitive. Mind, playing him on PlayStation was not really a competition \u2013 he\u2019s rubbish at it. We\u2019re like an old married couple, we don\u2019t say too much to each other \u2013 we\u2019ve just lived together all our lives and you kind of get bored with each other.</p> <p>I knew he was good when he won his first England cap! Anyone who grows up playing rugby wants to play for England, he\u2019s done very well. And through his own doing and his hard work he has been given that chance. I am very proud of him.</p> <p>As a family we support each other in whatever we do, whether its an under-15 final or this, which happens to be one of the biggest stages in sport. We are on two separate journeys, we are two separate people, we are not always going to be in the same place at the same time \u2013 although I\u2019m very grateful to the club for sending me out to Japan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"183075f624fe4890864daf84c2c7699c5d046d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/183075f624fe4890864daf84c2c7699c5d046d3d/0_203_3120_1873/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At home with Tom (left) and Ben Curry in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At home with Tom (left) and Ben Curry in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Quigley/ANL/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What would I say to him before the final?

He\u2019s got to the final without my messages so I don\u2019t think he needs anything from me to succeed! It is a World Cup, and it does mean a lot, but at the end of the day there\u2019s a lot more to life than a rugby game.</p> <p><strong>Will Joseph, 17, London Irish academy and England U18 outside centre, on his older brother Jonathan, 28, England\u2019s centre among the replacements</strong></p> <p>Jonathan was easygoing, very relaxed and a fun big brother. Although he was very focused on his rugby, he always found time for family. I remember hours spent with him messing around with a rugby ball in the garden and l loved going to watch my big brother play when he started out with London Irish.</p> <p>His achievements have made me realise anything is possible. I never really thought about a moment when I knew he was really good; he was just my big brother. Playing rugby at a high level was simply Jonathan\u2019s job.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1O87Xcg0gX/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Joe Ford, 29, the player-coach at Yorkshire Carnegie and elder brother of George, 26, England\u2019s fly-half George was always 100% dedicated to everything he did, everything was done early and always to the best of his ability, whether that be homework, cleaning his boots \u2013 from the age of eight! \u2013 or a gym session late at night in Greenfield. People always asked why he was so good and, yes he had the talent and ability, but it was his mind that set him apart from everyone, and why he has gone on to achieve what he has. He is very focused and he likes things to be clean! He even has a hoover in his car, at the first sign of mud he gets it out and it\u2019s gone. He\u2019s got a dog but it\u2019s the most perfect dog you will ever see! We weren\u2019t really competitive, we\u2019ve just always really got on, but being the older brother, when I started out playing rugby league, he came along \u2013 a four-year-old playing under sevens. Playing age group rugby league he always played the age above himself, simply because he needed a challenge. When he played against Wigan St Pats, who are renowned for always having the best teams, he still scored seven tries playing the age above! I sent him a message straight after the All Blacks game on the family WhatsApp group. I just said what an unbelievable achievement to do what you have done. He responded straight after the match with: \u201cThank you, we have given ourselves an opportunity, that is all.\u201d I found that incredible after such a big win against the world\u2019s best team; it\u2019s probably testament to the mindset Eddie and the coaching group have gotten these players into. The last thing I would say to G before the game would be \u2026 Be Yourself, Back Yourself, Fuck It, something we spoke a lot about together last year at Leicester and I\u2019m sure it will be written on his hand somewhere for the final. Tom Youngs, 32, Leicester Tigers\u2019 hooker and captain and elder brother of Ben, 30, the England scrum-half Ben was pretty cheeky when he was growing up. He didn\u2019t enjoy the farm so he left me to do most of that and spent most of his time kicking a rugby ball around in the garden with our cousin, Monty, both of them wearing rugby tops and pretending to kick the winning goal. But seriously, I am so so proud of what he has done. He was always destined to be an England player. He wasn\u2019t the biggest but it was his speed, he would score nine tries in a match. He was always one step in front of everyone and he could read the game so well. He was always the standout player, scoring a miracle try of some sort! There has been a lot of FaceTiming and texts, we\u2019ve spoken two to three times a week while he\u2019s been in Japan. We talk about everything, rugby chat, family chat, but, no, there\u2019s been no talk about tractors! Bendoesn\u2019t even know what we do on the farm at this time of year! Because we do the same job, we\u2019re professional rugby players, and internationals, I know what he\u2019s going through. He can talk to me about things that are going on that he can\u2019t with other people. Speaking to him the other day, the players just really want to finish the job. I was telling him to just enjoy the week, enjoy the occasion, it\u2019s going to go in a flash and you might never experience this again. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Dad is out there but mum doesn\u2019t really like watching the games live so she is looking after Ben\u2019s kids so his wife, Charlotte, can go to Japan. I\u2019m going to watch it in the morning before our game, but I\u2019ve got to keep a lid on the emotions because otherwise I\u2019ll be exhausted and we need a win too. If I was there I would want to tell him how amazingly proud the whole family are of him. Everything that he has achieved is more than we could ever have imagined already. Think of all the sacrifices you have made over the past four years for this and enjoy this moment. It\u2019s very, very special \u2013 take it all in. I can\u2019t tell you how much I will celebrate if we both win on Saturday. Marcus Watson, 28, Wasps wing, Olympic silver medallist and elder brother of Anthony, 25, England\u2019s right wing Well, the brotherly competition worked out pretty well for Anthony! I guess we were both pretty competitive \u2013 all three of us \u2013 because we\u2019ve got the youngest one, Callum, as well. Anthony always used to be that kid who when he would lose he would cry no matter what. I remember my dad would beat him at races and stuff when we were young and he would cry so much. Now it comes out in a different way. You don\u2019t see many tears but he still really hates losing at anything, literally anything. When I was in England Under-18s or 20s and he was in Under-16s you always picture what things will be like in the future and to be honest, I thought we would play together for England! When I got into the full-time academy the coaches started to give me a bit of banter that Anthony was coming up and going to be better than me. I thought, well, it\u2019s just banter, but he has ended up doing pretty well. We have both done OK but despite the silver medal if he wins the World Cup he\u2019s got bragging rights! When I was about 17 or 18 I knew Anthony was going to be a similar sort of player to me and then you look at his frame and he\u2019s a lot bigger than me and it was then I realised, he\u2019s going to be a pretty serious rugby player. I\u2019ve FaceTimed him earlier this week and he texted me on Tuesday saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to try to get you to Japan\u201d. I messaged him back, saying: \u201cThe Wasps team\u2019s already been announced for this weekend, so I think we\u2019re going to struggle.\u201d I said we should start a tweet #getmarcustojapan. And then it happened and thanks to the club I\u2019m here! We\u2019re both quite relaxed, but I know that he\u2019s as switched on as you can get. I\u2019ve been thinking about what I will hopefully say to him when they win. But beforehand? He will understand the magnitude of the game so for me it would be more about reminding him about the reason he started playing the game in the first place, because he enjoyed it. Try your best to enjoy the situation. Don\u2019t let it pass you by because these opportunities don\u2019t come around too often. Tom Cowan-Dickie 28, Cornish Pirates hooker and elder brother of Luke, 26, England\u2019s replacement hooker All my life everyone wants to talk about Luke! We were pretty normal as brothers I think, we fought a bit, argued but we would always be there for each other. We must be pretty similar and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve ended up moving into the same positions on the pitch, from back-row to loosehead and then to hooker but no, he didn\u2019t take my position. We were moved there by different people over the years. Some might say we\u2019re pretty similar as people too, although I like to think I\u2019m the nicer one \u2026 some might disagree! We\u2019ve both done a few trips out with Dad [Adam, a deep-sea fisherman] but, to answer the question, we definitely didn\u2019t learn anything from handling slippery fish that was any use when it comes to throwing the ball into the lineout in the wet! How would I describe him in a few words? Confident, a winner, good at everything he does, multi-talented at sports. He was very annoying! When he was playing under-16 and under-18 level, some of the things that he could do for a front-row forward, the skills that he had, I knew then the kid could be special as a rugby player. We play a lot of Xbox and we\u2019ve been chatting on that while he\u2019s been in Japan. He\u2019s really good at that too. At one point he was No 1 in the world on Call of Duty, search and destroy. Everything he picks up, he does well at. We\u2019re playing on Friday night in Nottingham so I\u2019ll be watching the match in the hotel on Saturday morning. If I was there, I would just tell him: do what you do. Enjoy it, don\u2019t worry about it \u2013 at the end of the day rugby is rugby whatever happens. Do what you can and we will proud of you all the way. Ben Curry, 21, Sale flanker and by 90 minutes the elder of identical twin brother Tom, the England blindside flanker We were pretty similar when we were growing up \u2013 that\u2019s why we clashed so many times and had so many arguments. We were very competitive. Mind, playing him on PlayStation was not really a competition \u2013 he\u2019s rubbish at it. We\u2019re like an old married couple, we don\u2019t say too much to each other \u2013 we\u2019ve just lived together all our lives and you kind of get bored with each other. I knew he was good when he won his first England cap! Anyone who grows up playing rugby wants to play for England, he\u2019s done very well. And through his own doing and his hard work he has been given that chance. I am very proud of him. As a family we support each other in whatever we do, whether its an under-15 final or this, which happens to be one of the biggest stages in sport. We are on two separate journeys, we are two separate people, we are not always going to be in the same place at the same time \u2013 although I\u2019m very grateful to the club for sending me out to Japan. What would I say to him before the final? Er, win? Nothing needs to be said. He knows what he needs to do and he\u2019ll get told what he needs to do so there\u2019s nothing I can say which will change anything. He\u2019s got to the final without my messages so I don\u2019t think he needs anything from me to succeed! It is a World Cup, and it does mean a lot, but at the end of the day there\u2019s a lot more to life than a rugby game. Will Joseph, 17, London Irish academy and England U18 outside centre, on his older brother Jonathan, 28, England\u2019s centre among the replacements Jonathan was easygoing, very relaxed and a fun big brother. Although he was very focused on his rugby, he always found time for family. I remember hours spent with him messing around with a rugby ball in the garden and l loved going to watch my big brother play when he started out with London Irish. His achievements have made me realise anything is possible. I never really thought about a moment when I knew he was really good; he was just my big brother. Playing rugby at a high level was simply Jonathan\u2019s job. Like high-performing professionals in sport or any other career, he is dedicated and works hard to achieve results. We\u2019re a close family and we always stay in touch, and have talked and texted about the usual things brothers chat about while he\u2019s been in Japan. If I was there with him on Saturday, I would say: \u201cThis is the moment. Run onto the pitch and give it all you\u2019ve got. Your family believe in you and are always proud of you. And when you and the team lift the World Cup, the whole country will be proud of you too!\u201d",

But with his wiry frame, camouflage jacket and eyebrows thicker than a Gallagher brother\u2019s, Dougie Isaacs is one. Isaacs can skim a stone 121.8 metres, further than anyone on the planet. Bottle of beer in one hand, cigarette in the other, he brings a frisson of danger to a sport that is beginning to take itself rather seriously. As one French skimmer says of Isaacs, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d To take part in a previous world record attempt, Isaacs missed his grandmother\u2019s funeral. He has won the World Stone Skimming Championships eight times \u2013 six more than anyone else. But his last win was in 2016, and there is an influx of new skimmers on the scene who smell blood. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/11/archive-zip/giv-3902UlNBnPns8x8H/\" data-alt=\"Easdale island\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/11/archive-zip/giv-3902UlNBnPns8x8H/\">Easdale island</a> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/27/easdale-argyll-video-island-settlers-scotland\" title=\"e\">Easdale island</a> lies off the west coast of Scotland and has hosted the World Stone Skimming Championships since 1997, raising money for the local community. Each year, people from all over the world arrive on a 10-person ferry from the neighbouring island of Seil, to watch and take part. This year I\u2019m one of them. My interest was piqued by an online clip of an exuberant Japanese skimmer called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WWwnMmb2so\" title=\"K\">Keisuke Hashimoto</a> \u2013 the winner in 2017. I take a bus from Oban to Seil, where I meet some of the event\u2019s stars in the pub. Guy Tarring, a ruddy man in his 60s, who carries cigars and looks like Iggy Pop if he had gone into marketing instead of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, tells us that he has twice come second in the Old Tossers category (the event has only ever been won by Ron Long, a 75-year-old Welshman with a moustache like a paintbrush). Tarring once paid Isaacs to train him in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, where Isaacs practises on the River Ericht. He remembers one drunken night when Isaacs waded across the river and painted white lines on a wall to indicate how far his skims had travelled. Tarring says the key to a good skim is \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cthrust\u201d, but then he points to his head. Ultimately, he says, \u201cit\u2019s about up here\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ffb01abd852e527bf83ae68139e3fa349434d91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ffb01abd852e527bf83ae68139e3fa349434d91/849_1420_6031_3619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Szep of Hungary is the defending champion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Szep of Hungary is the defending champion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that day, I head to Easdale. It\u2019s a haven of striking beauty, dotted with quarriers\u2019 cottages. It was a bastion of the British slate industry until 1850, when a vast storm struck, flooding the quarries and devastating the island. The population dropped to four. Now, around 60 people live here. It\u2019s the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business; in 2014 a baby was born on the island for the first time in 80 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"566c63e021d8fa051d997f0e663b86ee016015c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/566c63e021d8fa051d997f0e663b86ee016015c4/165_183_5089_6361/800.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Szep\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Szep says there\u2019s nothing to do but try your best. \u2018Most of the time it\u2019s luck.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the world championships descend, the population swells to around 1,000. \u201cMost people come to an island like this for peace and quiet,\u201d says Ruth Barratt, who is trying to sell the B&amp;B she runs. \u201cAlthough we appreciate the income, it\u2019s not something we enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>Her partner, Dughall Macleod, tells me about one of the young pretenders to the stone throne \u2013 Alex Lewis, 22, who beat Isaacs in July to become the current English champion. He has also held the British championship title since 2017, and has won the Swiss and Welsh championships once each. The world championship, however, has remained elusive. \u201cWhen he lost last year\u2026 oh Jesus,\u201d Macleod says. \u201cThere was no consoling the guy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b435ea44a3991b529b0dbf22f98be393e4674f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b435ea44a3991b529b0dbf22f98be393e4674f39/1577_452_3845_4806/800.jpg\" alt=\"ideal stone\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ideal stone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the sun sets, I walk down to the water for some practice. It\u2019s frustrating to be bad at something that seems so simple. Yet each time I think I\u2019m finished, another stone calls to me, demanding to be skimmed. I head to the pub again, where I meet Lewis. He has a tiny moustache and looks a little suspicious as I sidle up. One of the reasons he has never won here, he says, is because the rules don\u2019t work in his favour. He can\u2019t understand why the organisers stipulate that all stones be no more than three inches in diameter. \u201cThe organisers aren\u2019t bothered about changing the rules because they make tons of money out of this regardless,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For stone skimming to get to the next level, 'there needs to be an open-water competition, that can take huge numbers'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The championships have become too successful, Lewis thinks, and should move. The island is so small that only a few hundred people can watch at a time. And when skimmers skim, they must keep the stone within a designated lane and only throw a maximum of 63 metres \u2013 the distance to the back wall at the end of the flooded quarry. At the British championship, Lewis skimmed 111 metres. \u201cIn order for stone skimming to get to the next level,\u201d he says, \u201cthere needs to be a competition that is open-water, that can take huge numbers of attendants, that is bigger than this competition.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1e74235a53eba57cf3fe248cb54e6e551f987a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1e74235a53eba57cf3fe248cb54e6e551f987a2/328_556_5029_6286/800.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Lewis\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Lewis has held the British championship title since 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lewis has investigated the science of the skim. He has done \u201cvariable tests\u201d \u2013 throwing 50 stones of different weight and thickness; drawing charts to compare movement. He throws at about five degrees to the horizontal. The first bounce should be around 10 metres from you, he says \u2013 or 18-20 metres in windier conditions. \u201cYou get a relatively flat stone that\u2019s got a hook in it, that you can get your finger into, then when you release, you get spin,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you can get it so the stone lands flat on the water, you\u2019ll do OK.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the people I meet, Lewis is most alert to the money-making potential of skimming, a sport that offers no cash prizes. He recently wore a T-shirt to a skimming event that, by chance, had a photo of a chalet on it. The chalet owner got in touch to tell Lewis that if he continued to wear it, he could stay in the chalet for nothing. Lewis hates social media, but wants to be filmed by a drone and has his sights set on a photogenic place in Germany called Devil\u2019s Bridge. As I leave, he hands me a business card. It says \u201cAlex Lewis: international stone skimmer\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec2c1d9e31b3ea5183487cef8078b45793023714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec2c1d9e31b3ea5183487cef8078b45793023714/443_323_4837_6046/800.jpg\" alt=\"Five-time women\u2019s world champion Lucy Wood (UK).\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Five-time women\u2019s world champion Lucy Wood (UK).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The morning of the championships arrives and I practise with some kids at the quarry. Worryingly, there is an eight-year-old here who looks more promising than me. A man turns up and launches some stones. This turns out to be Peter Szep, the defending champion. He says there\u2019s nothing to do but try your best. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s luck,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I find \u201cOld Tosser\u201d Ron Long, who seems to be something of a media star. Long was a fireman who got caught by a collapsing roof in a hotel fire in 1992. \u201cAll of my upper-body muscles atrophied and so it was necessary to rebuild them,\u201d he says. \u201cStone skimming came into it at that stage, as an upper-body activity that didn\u2019t require too much head movement.\u201d</p> <p>Long wants \u201cfull and complete recognition of stone skimming as a genuine, bona fide sport\u201d. He believes the stones should be standardised, comparing the idea of picking your own stones to someone turning up to an Olympic javelin event with their own spear. He knows a manufacturer of decorative stone products who could do the job. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cba404baa270a200c4aff39b4aea59fd8bc474c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cba404baa270a200c4aff39b4aea59fd8bc474c9/292_441_4813_6016/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ron Long\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veteran Ron Long was crowned Old Tosser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis was always a family day out before the professionals turned up,\u201d says Dughall Macleod from the B&amp;B. \u201cThey take it too seriously.

He built a pond in the lab and they used motion-tracking technology to capture a 3D image of Wood in action. They also used force plates to examine her weight distribution and high-speed video to record her skims. \u201cYou don\u2019t throw from your arm, you throw from your body,\u201d Wood says, comparing skimming to a car braking with objects on the back seat. \u201cThe stone is part of your body.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"32e7680a44315a696ed44fafc9b510cfad2199e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32e7680a44315a696ed44fafc9b510cfad2199e8/0_996_6880_4128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Favourite Dougie Isaacs (Scotland) in action.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Favourite Dougie Isaacs (Scotland) in action.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Tonks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tournament begins at the quarry. A hush descends as Isaacs, a favourite here, steps up. When he hits the back wall with his first and third skim there is an almighty cheer from the 350-strong crowd. To qualify for the final, you need to strike the wall with one of your first three throws. Isaacs, Szep, Lewis, Long and seven other men do it, the highest number ever.

      "bodyText": "There aren\u2019t many actual rock stars in the world of competitive stone skimming. But with his wiry frame, camouflage jacket and eyebrows thicker than a Gallagher brother\u2019s, Dougie Isaacs is one. Isaacs can skim a stone 121.8 metres, further than anyone on the planet. Bottle of beer in one hand, cigarette in the other, he brings a frisson of danger to a sport that is beginning to take itself rather seriously. As one French skimmer says of Isaacs, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d To take part in a previous world record attempt, Isaacs missed his grandmother\u2019s funeral. He has won the World Stone Skimming Championships eight times \u2013 six more than anyone else. But his last win was in 2016, and there is an influx of new skimmers on the scene who smell blood. Easdale island lies off the west coast of Scotland and has hosted the World Stone Skimming Championships since 1997, raising money for the local community. Each year, people from all over the world arrive on a 10-person ferry from the neighbouring island of Seil, to watch and take part. This year I\u2019m one of them. My interest was piqued by an online clip of an exuberant Japanese skimmer called Keisuke Hashimoto \u2013 the winner in 2017. I take a bus from Oban to Seil, where I meet some of the event\u2019s stars in the pub. Guy Tarring, a ruddy man in his 60s, who carries cigars and looks like Iggy Pop if he had gone into marketing instead of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, tells us that he has twice come second in the Old Tossers category (the event has only ever been won by Ron Long, a 75-year-old Welshman with a moustache like a paintbrush). Tarring once paid Isaacs to train him in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, where Isaacs practises on the River Ericht. He remembers one drunken night when Isaacs waded across the river and painted white lines on a wall to indicate how far his skims had travelled. Tarring says the key to a good skim is \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cthrust\u201d, but then he points to his head. Ultimately, he says, \u201cit\u2019s about up here\u201d. Later that day, I head to Easdale. It\u2019s a haven of striking beauty, dotted with quarriers\u2019 cottages. It was a bastion of the British slate industry until 1850, when a vast storm struck, flooding the quarries and devastating the island. The population dropped to four. Now, around 60 people live here. It\u2019s the kind of place where everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business; in 2014 a baby was born on the island for the first time in 80 years. When the world championships descend, the population swells to around 1,000. \u201cMost people come to an island like this for peace and quiet,\u201d says Ruth Barratt, who is trying to sell the B&amp;B she runs. \u201cAlthough we appreciate the income, it\u2019s not something we enjoy.\u201d Her partner, Dughall Macleod, tells me about one of the young pretenders to the stone throne \u2013 Alex Lewis, 22, who beat Isaacs in July to become the current English champion. He has also held the British championship title since 2017, and has won the Swiss and Welsh championships once each. The world championship, however, has remained elusive. \u201cWhen he lost last year\u2026 oh Jesus,\u201d Macleod says. \u201cThere was no consoling the guy.\u201d As the sun sets, I walk down to the water for some practice. It\u2019s frustrating to be bad at something that seems so simple. Yet each time I think I\u2019m finished, another stone calls to me, demanding to be skimmed. I head to the pub again, where I meet Lewis. He has a tiny moustache and looks a little suspicious as I sidle up. One of the reasons he has never won here, he says, is because the rules don\u2019t work in his favour. He can\u2019t understand why the organisers stipulate that all stones be no more than three inches in diameter. \u201cThe organisers aren\u2019t bothered about changing the rules because they make tons of money out of this regardless,\u201d he says. The championships have become too successful, Lewis thinks, and should move. The island is so small that only a few hundred people can watch at a time. And when skimmers skim, they must keep the stone within a designated lane and only throw a maximum of 63 metres \u2013 the distance to the back wall at the end of the flooded quarry. At the British championship, Lewis skimmed 111 metres. \u201cIn order for stone skimming to get to the next level,\u201d he says, \u201cthere needs to be a competition that is open-water, that can take huge numbers of attendants, that is bigger than this competition.\u201d Lewis has investigated the science of the skim. He has done \u201cvariable tests\u201d \u2013 throwing 50 stones of different weight and thickness; drawing charts to compare movement. He throws at about five degrees to the horizontal. The first bounce should be around 10 metres from you, he says \u2013 or 18-20 metres in windier conditions. \u201cYou get a relatively flat stone that\u2019s got a hook in it, that you can get your finger into, then when you release, you get spin,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you can get it so the stone lands flat on the water, you\u2019ll do OK.\u201d Of all the people I meet, Lewis is most alert to the money-making potential of skimming, a sport that offers no cash prizes. He recently wore a T-shirt to a skimming event that, by chance, had a photo of a chalet on it. The chalet owner got in touch to tell Lewis that if he continued to wear it, he could stay in the chalet for nothing. Lewis hates social media, but wants to be filmed by a drone and has his sights set on a photogenic place in Germany called Devil\u2019s Bridge. As I leave, he hands me a business card. It says \u201cAlex Lewis: international stone skimmer\u201d. The morning of the championships arrives and I practise with some kids at the quarry. Worryingly, there is an eight-year-old here who looks more promising than me. A man turns up and launches some stones. This turns out to be Peter Szep, the defending champion. He says there\u2019s nothing to do but try your best. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s luck,\u201d he says. I find \u201cOld Tosser\u201d Ron Long, who seems to be something of a media star. Long was a fireman who got caught by a collapsing roof in a hotel fire in 1992. \u201cAll of my upper-body muscles atrophied and so it was necessary to rebuild them,\u201d he says. \u201cStone skimming came into it at that stage, as an upper-body activity that didn\u2019t require too much head movement.\u201d Long wants \u201cfull and complete recognition of stone skimming as a genuine, bona fide sport\u201d. He believes the stones should be standardised, comparing the idea of picking your own stones to someone turning up to an Olympic javelin event with their own spear. He knows a manufacturer of decorative stone products who could do the job. \u201cThis was always a family day out before the professionals turned up,\u201d says Dughall Macleod from the B&amp;B. \u201cThey take it too seriously. It\u2019s like a bunch of Hells Angels turning up to a kindergarten.\u201d In 2013, Lucy Wood, five-time women\u2019s world champion, asked Max Farrand, a sports technology research technician at Loughborough University, to help her. He built a pond in the lab and they used motion-tracking technology to capture a 3D image of Wood in action. They also used force plates to examine her weight distribution and high-speed video to record her skims. \u201cYou don\u2019t throw from your arm, you throw from your body,\u201d Wood says, comparing skimming to a car braking with objects on the back seat. \u201cThe stone is part of your body.\u201d The tournament begins at the quarry. A hush descends as Isaacs, a favourite here, steps up. When he hits the back wall with his first and third skim there is an almighty cheer from the 350-strong crowd. To qualify for the final, you need to strike the wall with one of your first three throws. Isaacs, Szep, Lewis, Long and seven other men do it, the highest number ever. Long\u2019s skim is controversial though, according to Lewis, who claims it didn\u2019t touch the wall. I came to the championships with lofty ambitions, but my first skim goes outside the designated boundary. When my next travels 43 metres, I think there\u2019s a chance. Then my final skim goes out of bounds, too. I realise that to be a champion, you must skim as if no one is watching. I skim as though everyone is watching, and am punished accordingly. The final score is cumulative, the best possible being 189 metres (three back walls). Skim outside the boundaries even once at this level, and you have almost certainly bungled it.

Isaacs, wearing a khaki jacket and a white T-shirt with the word \u201cBawbags\u201d on it, hits the wall with his first throw, then skims 61 and 54 metres. Ultimately, however, Szep defends his title, clinching it with three back walls. Isaacs, joint second, will fight another day. The women\u2019s champion is Christina Bowen Bravery, who won the English championships this year. Long, as ever, is crowned Old Tosser. \u201cThat was the toughest final,\u201d Lewis says.

Ribollita uses one of my favourite flavour-packed things that is usually wasted: parmesan rind, which lends its umami flavour to the soup. It is worth noting that most parmesan is not vegetarian, so do check. Prep 30 min Cook 1 hr Serves 6 Olive oil 2 onions, peeled, or 2 leeks; washed and finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 2 medium carrots, finely chopped 6 sticks celery, trimmed and chopped, yellow leaves reserved A few sprigs rosemary or thyme, roughly chopped 4 fresh tomatoes or 1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes 300g root veg (potato, sweet potato, parsnip or squash), peeled and chopped into 2cm pieces 1 whole parmesan rind (optional; I use a vegetarian parmesan-style cheese) 1 \u00d7 400g tin white beans or chickpeas (or 250g home-cooked beans, liquid reserved) 3 big handfuls greens, such as rainbow chard, spinach, cavolo nero (about 400g), leaves picked and roughly chopped 2 litres hot vegetable stock 4 slices good-quality stale bread Good extra-virgin olive oil, to finish Heat a little oil in a large saucepan and fry the onions or leeks, garlic, carrot, celery and picked herbs over a medium heat for 15-20 minutes, until soft, sweet and slightly caramelised. Add the tomatoes, root veg and parmesan rind, if using, squashing the tomatoes with a wooden spoon \u2013 it will look a bit dry, but don\u2019t worry, it is meant to. Cook on a low heat, stirring from time to time, for 15 minutes, until the tomato liquid has been almost completely absorbed and the vegetables look quite dry. Add the beans \u2013 tin juices and all \u2013 cavolo nero and stock, bring to a gentle simmer and leave to cook for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and lay the slices of bread on top of the soup, like a lid. Generously drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and leave to sit for 10 minutes or so. Stir to combine \u2013 the soup should be thick, almost stewy and deeply delicious \u2013 then season with salt, pepper, celery leaves and more extra-virgin olive oil. Ladle into bowls and serve. The soup will thicken as it cools, so if you have leftovers, add more hot stock or water and reheat gently.",

In the biggest tournament, to win you need your most influential player to play well and in the later games, the big games, he has been phenomenal. But I also have to mention Cheslin Kolbe for South Africa. I pray <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/31/rugby-world-cup-final-south-africa-team\" title=\"\">he stays fit for the final</a>, this guy could steal the World Cup away from England. Tackling him is like chasing shadows. South Africa have to get him the ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/30/south-africa-expect-brains-as-well-as-brawn-from-england-in-final\">South Africa expect brains as well as brawn from England in final</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Ugo Monye</strong> For England the way in which this duo of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have forged and worked so well. The quality of it isn\u2019t that surprising, but maybe the timing is. For it to have come together so late but have such a devastating impact on the biggest stages. It was untried and untested in the summer \u2013 it has been a welcome addition, they are world class together. For the Springboks, Bongi Mbonambi. Malcolm Marx this time last year was up for world player of the year. He had an unbelievably year but Mbonambi has come through and built up such a head of steam through the games. I was commentating on South Africa against Namibia and it struck me how their set piece and their driving maul was their point of difference. I wouldn\u2019t have picked him as a starting hooker in a World Cup final 12 months ago when Marx was playing so well.</p> <p><strong>Ben Ryan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/oct/30/george-ford-pivotal-england-winning-rugby-world-cup\" title=\"\">George Ford</a>. Just didn\u2019t think he would be as good as he has been and he has shown his class in attack and his resilience in defence. Gives the attack with Farrell and Tuilagi a lovely and lively balance.</p> <h2><strong>How does this England team compare </strong><strong>with the class of 2003?</strong></h2> <p><strong>NE</strong> Different time and different game, I feel this team revolve around the core group of Saracens players among a few others. Ford, the Vunipolas, Maro Itoje, Farrell. The base cement of leadership for this team to thrive.</p> <p><strong>UM</strong> There are lots of similarities but equally a lot of differences. There were more than half a dozen Premiership captains in that 2003 side. A lot more experience, a little bit older on average. They went into that final as favourites, as do this current team, but on the whole they are a lot younger. There is a lot more diversity in this squad and a lot of this current side could feature heavily in 2023. But a lot of the rugby traits are similar.</p> <p><strong>BR</strong> You just cannot compare. Different eras so players have different skill sets for how the game was played in 2003 and 2019.

      "bodyText": "Which players from either team have most surprised you with their form in this tournament? Nick Evans Owen Farrell. In the biggest tournament, to win you need your most influential player to play well and in the later games, the big games, he has been phenomenal. But I also have to mention Cheslin Kolbe for South Africa. I pray he stays fit for the final, this guy could steal the World Cup away from England. Tackling him is like chasing shadows. South Africa have to get him the ball. Ugo Monye For England the way in which this duo of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have forged and worked so well. The quality of it isn\u2019t that surprising, but maybe the timing is. For it to have come together so late but have such a devastating impact on the biggest stages. It was untried and untested in the summer \u2013 it has been a welcome addition, they are world class together. For the Springboks, Bongi Mbonambi. Malcolm Marx this time last year was up for world player of the year. He had an unbelievably year but Mbonambi has come through and built up such a head of steam through the games. I was commentating on South Africa against Namibia and it struck me how their set piece and their driving maul was their point of difference. I wouldn\u2019t have picked him as a starting hooker in a World Cup final 12 months ago when Marx was playing so well. Ben Ryan George Ford. Just didn\u2019t think he would be as good as he has been and he has shown his class in attack and his resilience in defence. Gives the attack with Farrell and Tuilagi a lovely and lively balance. How does this England team compare with the class of 2003? NE Different time and different game, I feel this team revolve around the core group of Saracens players among a few others. Ford, the Vunipolas, Maro Itoje, Farrell. The base cement of leadership for this team to thrive. UM There are lots of similarities but equally a lot of differences. There were more than half a dozen Premiership captains in that 2003 side. A lot more experience, a little bit older on average. They went into that final as favourites, as do this current team, but on the whole they are a lot younger. There is a lot more diversity in this squad and a lot of this current side could feature heavily in 2023. But a lot of the rugby traits are similar. BR You just cannot compare. Different eras so players have different skill sets for how the game was played in 2003 and 2019. Different environments have been created and different styles of leaders. Both would have at least five players that would be deemed truly world class. And how do South Africa compare with the 2007 champions? NE The 2007 side with Eddie Jones involved was based on low possession and high kicking. A lot like the South Africa we saw in the semi-final against Wales.

      "body": "<p>\u201cEverything about me being here is improbable,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert, the French defender who has won rave reviews since arriving at Aston Villa in the summer. As he chats at Villa\u2019s training ground in the run-up to Saturday\u2019s Premier League joust with Liverpool, the right-back who is likely to be tasked with subduing Sadio Man\u00e9, Mohamed Salah and co describes how he got to this point despite \u2013 and partly because of \u2013 a series of mishaps and misjudgments.</p> <p>But first let us address the fact that in one respect there is nothing surprising about this 24-year-old taking on the European champions. He, after all, has conquered the continent himself. Any analyst could tell you that. He has been a favourite of statisticians since the 2017-18 season when, as a player at Caen, he won more tackles than any other defender in the five main European leagues and ranked second for interceptions. He has been Villa\u2019s most prolific tackler and interceptor despite missing the first two games. Those qualities, along with his forward dashes and crosses, are what make him so exciting to watch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/01/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not big and strong so I have to be able to anticipate,\u201d he says by way of explanation for his exceptional reading of play. But what accounts for his combativeness in one-on-one duels? Does it have anything to do with where he was born: Valognes, a Normandy town that was awarded the Croix de Guerre after the second world war because of the extraordinary valour of its residents?</p> <p>He smiles at that notion. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly to do with what I\u2019ve been through myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI left home when I was 11 to join Caen\u2019s academy. I spent six years there and then they said they didn\u2019t want to keep me.\u201d One coach said it very forcefully.</p> <p>\u201cHe said: \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019ll never be a top-flight player, nor even a second division player. Maybe third-rate, at best.\u2019 That was tough. Caen was the club I loved, the place I grew up.\u201d</p> <p>He got picked up by Cherbourg, a fourth-tier club a stone\u2019s throw from Valognes. \u201cOne day we played against Bordeaux\u2019s reserves. Their manager was Patrick Battiston, the former France international.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger once said that Battiston was the finest tackler he had seen. Battiston saw something he liked in Guilbert. \u201cHe took me to Bordeaux. Within three months I was his reserve team captain. Within six months I was part of the first-team squad. Then Caen called me. \u2018We made a mistake, would you come back?\u2019 I went back [on loan], then they paid to make the transfer permanent. I got this character because I always had that idea of proving to people they were wrong about me. Going back to Caen closed the circle. It\u2019s a nice story.\u201d</p> <p>His performances at Caen attracted English clubs. He turned down Brighton because he did not feel ready to move. Then, last season, he found out Villa were tracking him. \u201cSuso [Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Pitarch, Villa\u2019s sporting director] came to watch a few matches and so did Olivier Monterrubio [Villa\u2019s scout in France].\u201d In January Villa sent their biggest delegation yet, with Suso and Monterrubio joined by the manager, Dean Smith, to watch Caen host Marseille.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e9591cf51f51d32571ca279c34d008ba03716c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e9591cf51f51d32571ca279c34d008ba03716c3/0_58_4181_2653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert battles with Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert battles with Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling. \u2018Sterling wants you one-on-one,\u2019 he says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manchester City FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How did that go? \u201cI got a red card,\u201d says Guilbert, smiling and shaking his head at the memory. The first yellow was for dissent, the second, just after half-time, for catching a player from behind. Guilbert feared he had blown his chance with Villa. \u201cI asked my agent what was happening and he said: \u2018It\u2019s become complicated.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But Villa came again and on the last day of the January transfer window signed him for a reported \u00a35m and loaned him back to Caen until the end of the season. \u201cAt the time Villa were 10th in the Championship and everybody said to me: \u2018Why are you joining them?\u2019 But I said I was not joining a league, I was joining Aston Villa.\u201d He widens his eyes as if to show the magnitude of the club.</p> <p>Then came a strange week in May. On the 24th he walked off the pitch in tears as a home defeat by Bordeaux condemned Caen to relegation from Ligue 1. Three days later he was in the stands at Wembley to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/27/aston-villa-derby-county-championship-playoff-final-match-report\" title=\"\">his new club win promotion to the Premier League</a>. \u201cVilla had invited me and my partner and of course I was happy we went up but, on the other hand, it was hard to celebrate. I had been totally invested with Caen and had this feeling of a job not done. I was with them for eight or nine years overall so you can\u2019t forget about going down so quickly. I popped into the [Villa] players\u2019 victory party for 15-20 minutes to congratulate them and then I went home and started preparing for this season.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>His preparations have paid off. Since his debut in August he has been excellent, solid defensively and a regular threat going forward. Even in last Saturday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/26/manchester-city-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">3-0 defeat at Manchester City</a> he stood out. There he came up against the most challenging opponent he has faced to date. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say which is stronger between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City but I would say Raheem Sterling presents the most challenges to a right-back. [Kylian] Mbapp\u00e9 likes to run in behind and Neymar goes infield a lot but Sterling wants you one-on-one.\u201d</p> <p>Next up are Man\u00e9 and Salah. \u201cYou think you know these players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses because you\u2019ve seen them in action so many times. But watching them and playing against them are completely different. The most important thing is concentration. Against them things can change in an instant. We were good at City for long periods but lost because our concentration lapsed momentarily. Now we have a chance to show we have learned from that.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking of learning lessons, where is that coach who told Guilbert he was third-rate at best? \u201cRetired? Unemployed? I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Guilbert. \u201cI hope he has a TV. Actually, I\u2019ll keep a seat for him at Villa Park. I\u2019m grateful to him.\u201d</p>",

As he chats at Villa\u2019s training ground in the run-up to Saturday\u2019s Premier League joust with Liverpool, the right-back who is likely to be tasked with subduing Sadio Man\u00e9, Mohamed Salah and co describes how he got to this point despite \u2013 and partly because of \u2013 a series of mishaps and misjudgments. But first let us address the fact that in one respect there is nothing surprising about this 24-year-old taking on the European champions. He, after all, has conquered the continent himself. Any analyst could tell you that. He has been a favourite of statisticians since the 2017-18 season when, as a player at Caen, he won more tackles than any other defender in the five main European leagues and ranked second for interceptions. He has been Villa\u2019s most prolific tackler and interceptor despite missing the first two games. Those qualities, along with his forward dashes and crosses, are what make him so exciting to watch. \u201cI\u2019m not big and strong so I have to be able to anticipate,\u201d he says by way of explanation for his exceptional reading of play. But what accounts for his combativeness in one-on-one duels? Does it have anything to do with where he was born: Valognes, a Normandy town that was awarded the Croix de Guerre after the second world war because of the extraordinary valour of its residents? He smiles at that notion. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly to do with what I\u2019ve been through myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI left home when I was 11 to join Caen\u2019s academy. I spent six years there and then they said they didn\u2019t want to keep me.\u201d One coach said it very forcefully. \u201cHe said: \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019ll never be a top-flight player, nor even a second division player. Maybe third-rate, at best.\u2019 That was tough. Caen was the club I loved, the place I grew up.\u201d He got picked up by Cherbourg, a fourth-tier club a stone\u2019s throw from Valognes. \u201cOne day we played against Bordeaux\u2019s reserves. Their manager was Patrick Battiston, the former France international.\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger once said that Battiston was the finest tackler he had seen. Battiston saw something he liked in Guilbert. \u201cHe took me to Bordeaux. Within three months I was his reserve team captain. Within six months I was part of the first-team squad. Then Caen called me. \u2018We made a mistake, would you come back?\u2019 I went back [on loan], then they paid to make the transfer permanent. I got this character because I always had that idea of proving to people they were wrong about me. Going back to Caen closed the circle. It\u2019s a nice story.\u201d His performances at Caen attracted English clubs. He turned down Brighton because he did not feel ready to move. Then, last season, he found out Villa were tracking him. \u201cSuso [Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Pitarch, Villa\u2019s sporting director] came to watch a few matches and so did Olivier Monterrubio [Villa\u2019s scout in France].\u201d In January Villa sent their biggest delegation yet, with Suso and Monterrubio joined by the manager, Dean Smith, to watch Caen host Marseille. How did that go? \u201cI got a red card,\u201d says Guilbert, smiling and shaking his head at the memory. The first yellow was for dissent, the second, just after half-time, for catching a player from behind. Guilbert feared he had blown his chance with Villa. \u201cI asked my agent what was happening and he said: \u2018It\u2019s become complicated.\u2019\u201d But Villa came again and on the last day of the January transfer window signed him for a reported \u00a35m and loaned him back to Caen until the end of the season. \u201cAt the time Villa were 10th in the Championship and everybody said to me: \u2018Why are you joining them?\u2019 But I said I was not joining a league, I was joining Aston Villa.\u201d He widens his eyes as if to show the magnitude of the club. Then came a strange week in May. On the 24th he walked off the pitch in tears as a home defeat by Bordeaux condemned Caen to relegation from Ligue 1. Three days later he was in the stands at Wembley to watch his new club win promotion to the Premier League. \u201cVilla had invited me and my partner and of course I was happy we went up but, on the other hand, it was hard to celebrate. I had been totally invested with Caen and had this feeling of a job not done. I was with them for eight or nine years overall so you can\u2019t forget about going down so quickly. I popped into the [Villa] players\u2019 victory party for 15-20 minutes to congratulate them and then I went home and started preparing for this season.\u201d His preparations have paid off. Since his debut in August he has been excellent, solid defensively and a regular threat going forward. Even in last Saturday\u2019s 3-0 defeat at Manchester City he stood out. There he came up against the most challenging opponent he has faced to date. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say which is stronger between Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City but I would say Raheem Sterling presents the most challenges to a right-back. [Kylian] Mbapp\u00e9 likes to run in behind and Neymar goes infield a lot but Sterling wants you one-on-one.\u201d Next up are Man\u00e9 and Salah. \u201cYou think you know these players\u2019 strengths and weaknesses because you\u2019ve seen them in action so many times. But watching them and playing against them are completely different. The most important thing is concentration. Against them things can change in an instant. We were good at City for long periods but lost because our concentration lapsed momentarily. Now we have a chance to show we have learned from that.\u201d Speaking of learning lessons, where is that coach who told Guilbert he was third-rate at best? \u201cRetired? Unemployed? I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Guilbert. \u201cI hope he has a TV. Actually, I\u2019ll keep a seat for him at Villa Park. I\u2019m grateful to him.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>There were several discordant undertones to Donald Trump\u2019s reporting of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The most noticeable being the breathless, almost sexual excitement in his voice. As if the whole thing had been a snuff movie played out as a video game. But what also struck me was the US president\u2019s description of the Islamic State leader having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-isis-leader-killed-us-donald-trump\">\u201cdied like a dog\u201d</a>. Because I can only assume he has no idea of the value people attach to their dogs. We got Herbert Hound eight years ago when our daughter left home to go to university \u2013 I don\u2019t need a shrink to make the connection \u2013 and from the day he arrived I fell hopelessly in love with him. Now he\u2019s a relatively old man, I am heartbroken at the thought he might die within the next five years. When he gets ill, he will be accorded all the medical care I would begrudge myself, and his death will be marked by a full state funeral. For essential reading on both the meaning of dogs and the meaning of life, I can recommend Anthony McGowan\u2019s wonderful book How to Teach Philosophy to Your Dog, a series of conversations he had with his dog, Monty, while out walking together. The final chapter is a touching meditation on death and the existence \u2013 or not \u2013 of God, that takes in everything from Aristotle to Schopenhauer and leaves you suspecting dogs might already have had many of the answers all along. <em>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio / Than are dreamed of in your philosophy.</em></p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>After weeks of on-off, on-off speculation about when the general election might take place, parliament finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/uk-general-election-confirmed-for-12-december-after-brexit-stalemate\">voted to have one</a> in December. The tipping point had come when the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party indicated they would be willing to vote in favour if they were allowed one last chance to vote against an election on Monday when the government had brought forward a bill under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act for a third time. After that, Labour was rather obliged to come onboard or else it would have appeared frightened of the electorate. Even then, there was some last-minute wrangling. The Tories wanted 12 December on the grounds that was the date they first thought of. Everyone else wanted 9 December because it was a date the government had not proposed. But 12 December got it, which is the worst possible day for me as it is the tail end of the week my daughter and her husband are coming over from the US for a pre-Christmas visit. So now I\u2019ll hardly see them. Thanks everyone. With all the predictions for the 2017 election having been hopelessly inaccurate, everyone is being much more guarded this time round despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/31/uk-general-election-2019-poll-tracker\">Conservatives being well ahead</a> in the polls. No one knows if Labour votes in the north will hold up, whether the Lib Dems will eat into the Tories or if the Brexit party will have any impact. It would be top banter if the election returned another hung parliament that was unable to resolve Brexit.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>The final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/pmqs-verdict-no-clear-winner-leaders-johnson-corbyn-test-election-slogans\">prime minister\u2019s questions</a> of the parliament once again proved something that many of us had already suspected. That Boris Johnson isn\u2019t actually very good at being a leader. He blusters, has no grasp of detail and lacks a fundamental seriousness when required. He is at best an after-dinner corporate speaker for businesses on a tight budget. Johnson may yet not prove to be the asset on the campaign trail the Tories hope. He did OK during the EU referendum because then he was only ever expected to make promises. The more lavish, the better. Now, as prime minister, he is expected to deliver on the promises he makes. And his track record on that is piss-poor, as so often he can only resort to lying. At this PMQs, he once again insisted it was the House of Commons that had blocked his Brexit bill. It hadn\u2019t. It had passed it, but then he had sulked and pulled it. MPs have received a lot of criticism for being a \u201czombie parliament\u201d but actually most have done their jobs with great integrity. The split in the Commons reflected the split in the country and many MPs have withstood acute pressure from their parties to hold the government to account. It is telling that most of the MPs who are standing down at this election \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/diane-abbott-speaks-out-on-online-abuse-as-female-mps-step-down\">many of them women</a> \u2013 are precisely the ones who have done their best not to let the government railroad them into poor decisions. They will be greatly missed. If you think this parliament has been toxic, the next one could be even more so as the new intake will more closely resemble the extremes of their parties.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>I can\u2019t say I would be best pleased if I had been one of the guests who had booked flights and bribed their son to take care of the dog while they were away, but such considerations don\u2019t appear to have entered Simon Cowell\u2019s head when he chose to cancel his 60th birthday party at the last minute. Instead, he just sent out a quick note saying the whole thing was off and he might reschedule something for December and that if he did then they were welcome to drop in. Then again, December might be tricky, so it could be in the new year. Or never. Now it\u2019s possible Simon is so riddled with insecurities that he cancelled because he couldn\u2019t bear the thought half the people might find something better to do with their lives on the night \u2013 get their hair dyed, for instance \u2013 and he\u2019d have loads of empty places round the table. If so, I know how he feels. Whenever I entertain at home \u2013 something I do increasingly rarely \u2013 I\u2019m always tempted to get my cancellations in first. More likely, he\u2019s so self-obsessed he\u2019s unaware that other people really exist. So far, the only reason given for the cancellation is that he wants to concentrate on his work as the X Factor ratings nosedive. As if he couldn\u2019t spare four hours. My guess is that the real reason is he\u2019s actually going through an existential narcissistic breakdown. He literally can\u2019t bear the fact he\u2019s 60. Something I experienced three years ago. Which is why I never even bothered to plan a party.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>I can only hope that if ever I found myself under investigation, the inquiry would be conducted by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.

I\u2019m quite tempted to put in an application myself, just so I can acquire the Lucie Rie and Jennifer Lee ceramics I covet.

A school is forced to become an academy if it is \u201celigible for intervention\u201d under law. The order is triggered by a school being classed as inadequate by Ofsted. Previously it could also be triggered by poor performances in exams but that condition was dropped by the education secretary, Damian Hinds, in 2018.</p>\n    <p><b>Do parents get any say in the matter?</b></p>\n    <p>No. Governing bodies, parents and councils get no input in the DfE\u2019s intervention to force academisation. They also have no say in which trust the school is forced to join, meaning the chain may be based hundreds of miles away. Critics say this is a derogation of local democracy.</p>\n    <p><b>What happens to the school?</b></p>\n    <p>The school\u2019s legal relationship becomes a contract between the trust that manages it and the DfE, cutting ties with local authorities. The school\u2019s land and buildings are effectively leased to the trust. Head teachers are stripped of their autonomy, with budget and staffing decisions made by the trust. In most cases the school\u2019s existing leadership is dismissed. The school\u2019s governors lose legal responsibilities, and there is no requirement for trusts to consult with parents. Often the school is renamed and a new uniform adopted. The trust retains a proportion of the school\u2019s funding for its administration and executive costs.</p>\n    <p><b>Does forced academisation improve schools?</b></p>\n    <p>There is little evidence either way. Previously, three-quarters of schools rated as inadequate by Ofsted later improved without forced academisation. The National Audit Office has concluded there is a lack of capable Mats able to improve schools in difficulty.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some parents have said they will continue to fight. A community petition has gathered more than 1,000 signatures from people opposed to the transfer. Parents say their school has improved since the Ofsted inspection and are concerned about the incoming trust\u2019s record. A <a href=\"https://epi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/EPI-Academy-LA-Performance___.pdf\">report by the Education Policy Institute</a> last year rated NET among the lowest performing school groups at primary level.</p> \n<p>Some parents are also dissatisfied with an investigation into allegations of irregularities in the conduct of key stage 1 Sats tests at Waltham Holy Cross. An external moderator from Essex county council raised concerns about the level of \u201cscaffolding\u201d by teachers who were using planning materials supplied by the incoming trust, raising concerns that pupils had been given too much help for their work to be judged independent.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s standards and testing agency was called in but, according to parents, while the Standards and Testing Agency investigated other NET schools, Waltham Holy Cross was investigated instead by an official from the Department for Education which was responsible for the original academy order.</p> \n<p>NET denied the allegations and the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cSo much has been said about our team over the last few months that has been wrong, unfair and hurtful, and it would have been easier at times to withdraw from the process,\u201d a trust spokesperson said. \u201cBut our guiding principle is to help children get a first-class education so that they are able to live their best lives, and we never want to give up on that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The school is currently closed for half term, reopening on Monday. Kelly Cross, a parent, said: \u201cIt is worrying that ministers are pressing on with this controversial conversion while another MP in their own party is referring them to the ombudsman.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another parent, Jay Tailor, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time. We are all concerned and worried that if NET come in the whole ethos and culture of our school will change. Teachers will leave, and what will they be replaced with? It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like change. It\u2019s just we can see the improvements already, so why are we doing this?\u201d</p> \n<p>The National Education Union said it was saddened by the forced academisation. \u201cConcerns were expressed about the fairness of the original judgment on the school by Ofsted. The DfE, for ideological reasons, were intent on forced academisation,\u201d a spokesman said.</p>",

Parents say their school has improved since the Ofsted inspection and are concerned about the incoming trust\u2019s record. A report by the Education Policy Institute last year rated NET among the lowest performing school groups at primary level. Some parents are also dissatisfied with an investigation into allegations of irregularities in the conduct of key stage 1 Sats tests at Waltham Holy Cross. An external moderator from Essex county council raised concerns about the level of \u201cscaffolding\u201d by teachers who were using planning materials supplied by the incoming trust, raising concerns that pupils had been given too much help for their work to be judged independent. The government\u2019s standards and testing agency was called in but, according to parents, while the Standards and Testing Agency investigated other NET schools, Waltham Holy Cross was investigated instead by an official from the Department for Education which was responsible for the original academy order. NET denied the allegations and the investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. \u201cSo much has been said about our team over the last few months that has been wrong, unfair and hurtful, and it would have been easier at times to withdraw from the process,\u201d a trust spokesperson said. \u201cBut our guiding principle is to help children get a first-class education so that they are able to live their best lives, and we never want to give up on that.\u201d The school is currently closed for half term, reopening on Monday. Kelly Cross, a parent, said: \u201cIt is worrying that ministers are pressing on with this controversial conversion while another MP in their own party is referring them to the ombudsman.\u201d Another parent, Jay Tailor, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time. We are all concerned and worried that if NET come in the whole ethos and culture of our school will change. Teachers will leave, and what will they be replaced with? It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like change. It\u2019s just we can see the improvements already, so why are we doing this?\u201d The National Education Union said it was saddened by the forced academisation. \u201cConcerns were expressed about the fairness of the original judgment on the school by Ofsted. The DfE, for ideological reasons, were intent on forced academisation,\u201d a spokesman said.",

How often did we see it during the World Cup? Another one that spilled off the batsman and made contact almost in slow motion, but you expect at least one bail to dislodge. Turner is the man who again puts the dent in the chase though, hooking the quick over the fine leg boundary for <strong>a second six </strong>in the five balls he\u2019s been out there. Warner <strong>responds with one of his own </strong>to finish the set, lifting across the line and beyond the boundary at cow corner. If Sri Lanka had a window, it has closed in the last two overs.

It\u2019s Turner who goes <strong>BIG</strong> though, launching the off-spinner into the Great Southern Stand!

That\u2019s shown early in the over, twice failing to beat the men in the fielding circle before grabbing a couple to midwicket - good running from Warner, who slaps one down the ground when he gets his chance. Just five off it though, which is a small win for the visitors. Wickets, though.

But given they have lost only three wickets in the two games so far, there is only so much they can do in this respect. </p> <p>For Sri Lanka\u2019s part, it is hard to believe that this is the same team that swept the world-leading Pakistanis before coming here. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how they shake things up here before flying home.</p> <p>Looking out across the ground, it could be a grotty old night. It was hot this afternoon but now, it\u2019s windy and cloudy. Rain isn\u2019t forecast but we know how the weather works in our glorious Melbourne. I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout. <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.freelance@theguardian.com\">Drop me a line</a>, yeah? <br></p> </div>   </div>",

We\u2019ll be back on Sunday for more short-form action, Australia hosting Pakistan in Sydney for the first of their three T20s and New Zealand welcoming England to Wellington for the seond rubber in their five-match run. Until then, enjoy the rugby and have lovely weekends! Bye! David Warner has been named man of the match. And surely the series, too. Yep, he had a shocker in the Ashes but all he could do was come back home and pile on the runs and pile them on he has over the last week. 100, 60 and 57 were his three unbeaten scores. Warner finishes it with a pulled boundary; Australia sweep the series. They\u2019ve got the job done here with 14 balls to spare. The opener finishes the series with 217 runs, not out in each innings. 17.4 overs: Australia 145-3 (Warner 57, Turner 22) Target 143 17th over: Australia 140-3 (Warner 53, Turner 21) Target 143 Bit of speculation on TV that we might be watching Malinga\u2019s final over on Australian soil, but he\u2019ll surely be back for the World T20. I hope so. Three runs left for Australia to win, 18 balls to get it done. 16th over: Australia 132-3 (Warner 50, Turner 19) Target 143 Five low-risk runs taken off Sandakan as this game moves towards its logical end point. 28,568 came along tonight, mostly Sri Lankan fans. They\u2019ve done a great job supporting their team. 15th over: Australia 127-3 (Warner 49, Turner 15) Target 143 Lahiru hits Warner\u2019s stumps but the zing bails don\u2019t come off! How often did we see it during the World Cup? Another one that spilled off the batsman and made contact almost in slow motion, but you expect at least one bail to dislodge. Turner is the man who again puts the dent in the chase though, hooking the quick over the fine leg boundary for a second six in the five balls he\u2019s been out there. Warner responds with one of his own to finish the set, lifting across the line and beyond the boundary at cow corner. If Sri Lanka had a window, it has closed in the last two overs. Australia need 16 off five overs. 14th over: Australia 110-3 (Warner 40, Turner 8) Target 143 The technology shows McDermott would have been reprieved had they reviewed. Hmmm. The crowd are willing their Sri Lankan charges on, easily outnumbering Australian fans here tonight. Jayasuriya, who had 13 taken from his first over, is up again to Warner. It\u2019s Turner who goes BIG though, launching the off-spinner into the Great Southern Stand! With five other singles taken to the sweepers, it moves the runs required tally beneath the balls remaining for the first time in the chase, 34 off 37 the updated equation. Well, then. It looked a bit legside to me but Warner has advised McDermott to cop the decision and walk off. The opener is 37 off 36 and Australia still require 44 off 43. Not far from Game On. 13th over: Australia 99-3 (Warner 37, Turner 0) Target 143 12th over: Australia 91-2 (Warner 30, McDermott 4) Target 143 Right, back to Sandakan at McDermott, playing his first game on home soil. There\u2019ll be some nerves there. That\u2019s shown early in the over, twice failing to beat the men in the fielding circle before grabbing a couple to midwicket - good running from Warner, who slaps one down the ground when he gets his chance. Just five off it though, which is a small win for the visitors. Wickets, though. They need them. Sandakan takes Smith at deep square leg! It\u2019s well hit, so he has to keep his cool to take the catch above his head, and does just that. Can Sri Lanka take advantage of this small opening they now have? 11th over: Australia 86-2 (Warner 28, McDermott 0) Target 143 10th over: Australia 82-1 (Warner 28, Smith 11) Target 143 Two balls, two fours for Smith. As you do. This time, straight back over Sandakan\u2019s head. Nine from it, leaving 61 from 60 balls for the win. 9th over: Australia 73-1 (Warner 26, Smith 4) Target 143 Ridiculous from Smith to begin, somehow finding enough time to adjust his stroke at the very last moment to pull Lahiru around the corner for four first ball, bisecting the fielders with precision. 14 runs and a wicket from the eventful over. It was a costly exercise but Sri Lanka have the captain! Lahiru was launched down the ground by Finch for six to begin the over, and there were a couple of wides in there as he tried to shake things up. In the end, he\u2019s won the scalp with a slower ball, miscued to long on. 8th over: Australia 59-0 (Finch 30, Warner 25) Target 143 Can Sandakan shake things up with his left-arm wrist spin? The only way they are any chance at all is by putting a big dent in Australia\u2019s batting line up over the next few overs - bulk wickets or bust. The incision won\u2019t be coming here though, six singles milked instead. 7th over: Australia 53-0 (Finch 27, Warner 22) Target 143 The captain is getting busy, Jayasuriya not getting a moment to settle with his offies, pumped waaay over long on in classic Finch fashion for SIX. Two hard-run twos follow, keeping the pressure on. 13 from the over with each ball scored off. An important psychological blow. 6th over: Australia 40-0 (Finch 16, Warner 20) Target 143 Two lbw shouts, Pradeep beating Finch\u2019s bat twice, but he\u2019s getting no love. On reflection, both shouts are more in hope than expectation, the second landing on the Australian skipper\u2019s boot but well down leg. Six off it, Australia well placed at the end of the power play. 5th over: Australia 34-0 (Finch 16, Warner 16) Target 143 Lahiru is swung around to bowl from the Artist Formerly Known As the Hilton Hotel End. For about two years at uni, their car park backed onto my dodgy apartment balcony. Living 200m from the \u2018G was quite the experience. And he\u2019s had a chance put down off him too! Finch time time, shelled by Oshada moving to his right. Not a tough catch; not at all. You can\u2019t drop these blokes in consecutive overs. 4th over: Australia 27-0 (Finch 11, Warner 14) Target 143 Lahiru is taken off - not sure about that. He\u2019s replaced by the unluckiest bowler in all the world (aside from maybe Shami): Nuwan Pradeep. The last time I wrote this CricViz repudiated me, but I still believe it. RIGHT ON CUE: Malinga drops Warner at mid-off! There was a dive but the skipper made it look tougher than it was, I fancy. Mark Waugh shares my view on commentary for what that is worth? 3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Finch 7, Warner 12) Target 143 Warner is in some touch at the moment, slamming Malinga from one knee through extra cover for four more of the best. Always the competitor, the veteran slinger bounces back with one that jags off the seam to beat the opener\u2019s outside edge. There\u2019s a bit going on in this game. 2nd over: Australia 15-0 (Finch 7, Warner 7) Target 143 Phwoooooar, Lahiru through Warner with an absolute beauty straight away too, beating him outside the off stump at 148kph! It\u2019s not Warner\u2019s first rodeo though, knowing the short ball was coming next, waiting on it, and smashing it through midwicket for four. Finch gets one in his slot to finish, needing no second invitation to loft a full-blooded drive over long-on for SIX. After all that, 12 from the over. NOT OUT! Umpire\u2019s call on height. Definitely worth a look given it hit Finch on the back leg. At 146kph too - serious wheels first up. IS FINCH LBW? The big quick Lahiru certainly thinks so, insisting on a review when it is given out on the field. To DRS we go. 1st over: Australia 3-0 (Finch 1, Warner 2) Target 143 Finch gives himself a couple of balls before turning one square to get off the mark, Warner doing likewise to the man at deep backward square, racing back for a couple. That\u2019s good MCG running. \u201cHey Adam.\u201d Hi, Jake Santa Maria. \u201cCan you explain how there is another T20 World Cup in 2021 that makes no sense to me.\u201d Nor me. But I suspect for the usual reason: cash money, baby. Warner and Finch are ready to roll. The former is yet to be dismissed in the series, cracking 100 and 60 in the two games so far. Finch was with him in the runs on Sunday but picked up a golden duck on Wednesday, caught down the legside. Malinga to begin. PLAY! BOSH! 20th over: Sri Lanka 142-6 (Rajapaksa 17, Malinga 8) MALINGA... BANG! The captain promotes himself up the order and creams Richardson straight back over his head for SIX! What a shot! It ensures Australia will need at least seven an over in the chase. How many more? He swings hard at the penultimate delivery but doesn\u2019t make contact. Last one, Finch sends third man back and brings up his backward square, so we\u2019re getting the wide yorker, right? Close - it\u2019s a yorker on the stumps, Malinga hacks a single. Well bowled. Both teams would probably take that going into the break. Starc sends Jayasuriya\u2019s leg-stump spiralling when trying to ramp and failing to make contact. \u201cDon\u2019t try and ramp me,\u201d says Isa Guha. But it was a good over for the visitors, 14 runs coming from it. 19th over: Sri Lanka 132-6 (Rajapaksa 16) Shot! Shot! Rajapaksa might be facing Starc - the man who Justin Langer described earlier as the best white-ball bowler in the world - but he doesn\u2019t mind at all. The first blow goes hiiigh into the night sky, landing with the crowd at square leg. The second goes finer and nearly goes the full journey once more, bouncing over the rope. The Sri Lankan fans - and they have filled the bottom deck of both the public stands - are really up and about now. Richardson to now bowl the death over. 18th over: Sri Lanka 118-5 (Jayasuriya 11, Rajapaksa 3) Zampa now to finish his spell and he finishes it well with a combination of hard-spun wrong\u2019uns and toppies. He beats Rajapaksa who dragged his back foot - prompting a third umpire review - but he\u2019s just back. ZOMBIE NATION on between overs, just as it was in Christchurch earlier today when the teams walked out. This is a great development. When I grow up, I want to be the Cricket Ground DJ. \u201cObviously, like all sensible people, I\u2019d dismissed The Hundred as a load of nonsense,\u201d begins Matt Dony. \u201cThen, Welsh Fire drafted Smith and Starc. Suddenly I\u2019m invested. (Yes, and fickle. I know.) I\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on Smith\u2019s form from here on. On the one hand, it seems almost inhuman to expect him to maintain the level he\u2019s been at. On the other hand, I now REALLY want him to.\u201d 17th over: Sri Lanka 111-5 (Jayasuriya 7, Rajapaksa 0) Cummins is actually on a hat-trick, which the TV commentators relay to Smith who tells the bowler and the captain. Perhaps Jayasuriya picked up on it as he elected to leave it through to Carey. Unorthodox in the 17th over of a T20. Rajapaksa can\u2019t get him away through the offside from the last couple of balls. So, just one run along with the wicket of Perera - the perfect over from Australia\u2019s star, finishing with 2/23. Urgh, Perera holes out. That hurts. Of course, it\u2019s Cummins who does the job, winning a top edge that ends up in the hands of mid-off. 16th over: Sri Lanka 110-4 (Perera 57, Jayasuria 6) They\u2019re happy enough playing Agar out to the sweepers, collecting seven runs along the way. He finishes with 0/24. Handy series for him. 15th over: Sri Lanka 104-4 (Perera 56, Jayasuria 2) Bit of confusion when McDermott nearly nails Warner with a throw coming in from cover. In that same direction, Perera clears the fielder inside the ring and gets three for it. 150-160 should be in the frame for Sri Lanka. The strong Australian appeal is agreed to by the on-field umpire as Oshada fails to steer Richardson to third man. He immediately sent it upstairs and hot spot didn\u2019t show anything... but snicko did. That\u2019s enough - snicko stumps all else. Not always for the better. 14th over: Sri Lanka 98-3 (Perera 52, Oshada 6) Zampa is back and Perera immediately goes the switch it and does it well enough to bank a boundary. From the next ball the left-hander raises his half-century with a couple out to the fat side of this MCG field. He adds another boundary to finish, albeit off an edge, but the Sri Lankan fans couldn\u2019t care less in full voice with plenty of flags. Great stuff. 13th over: Sri Lanka 85-3 (Perera 44, Oshada 1) Oshada, into the team tonight, joins Perera. Starc is back for Australia and the more experienced man of the two really should be back in the sheds but Richardson has put down a most straightforward catch at backward point. \u201cIt did him for lack of pace,\u201d is Mark Waugh\u2019s assessment. It came the ball after he put away a half-volley through cover. Maybe that\u2019s the bit of fortune he needs to turn up the volume. Cummins gets the breakthrough, Fernando doing much as his colleague Mendis did earlier in the innings, picking out McDermott who barely had to move a muscle on the deep backward square boundary rope. He didn\u2019t pull the ball so much as place it. 12th over: Sri Lanka 76-3 (Perera 36) 11th over: Sri Lanka 71-2 (Perera 32, Fernando 19) I\u2019ve covered most of the games Steve Smith has played for Australia over the last five years and I reckon that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him misfield a ball at his feet. It only costs the hosts one run, though. Agar gets to the end of the over with six taken. Sri Lanka have to pull the trigger. 10th over: Sri Lanka 65-2 (Perera 31, Fernando 15) Zampa bowls, the batsmen take a picket fence. Gotta have a dip now, Avishka. Give this wonderful Sri Lankan crowd something to really sing about. 9th over: Sri Lanka 59-2 (Perera 28, Fernando 12) Better from Agar in terms of where he\u2019s landing it. They\u2019re able to take runs from ever ball of it, albeit no boundaries. Who will they try and take down? 8th over: Sri Lanka 51-2 (Perera 22, Fernando 10) Zampa now with his leggies, which were excellent in Brisbane on Wednesday. Mark Waugh reveals on TV that the spinner asked him to bring some of his 1990s sunnies along to complete his new look - the mullet hair prominent. On his actual craft, Zampa said he has been bowling 40 per cent wrong\u2019uns in this series, which is the theme of this over too - the stumps are always in play. Just four singles from it. Handy. 7th over: Sri Lanka 47-2 (Perera 20, Fernando 8) With the power play over, it\u2019s time for Agar, who hasn\u2019t conceded a boundary across eight overs in this series so far. Despite a couple of poor short and wide deliveries, he manages to get through the over with this fact in tact. 6th over: Sri Lanka 41-2 (Perera 18, Fernando 4) Cummins again, Fernando straight onto the balls of his feet to punch a couple more through cover. If you haven\u2019t had the pleasure as yet, try and watch this young bloke bat sooner rather than later. He\u2019s very, very good. Now that I\u2019ve said this, he\u2019ll be out in the next five minutes - ask Mitch Marsh, who I feel responsible for ruining. He pulls another single to give Perera a chance, who benefits from a second fat top edge, this time pitching just inside the rope before rolling for four. 5th over: Sri Lanka 34-2 (Perera 14, Fernando 1) My favourite young player in the world, Avishka Fernando, strolls out at No4. He times a nice single to cover to get off the mark first ball but nearly runs himself out when looking for a second. Sent back in time - just. A successful over for Richardson, Mendis his first scalp of the series. Mendis pulls Richardson off the front foot, hits it sweet, but places it straight down the throat of McDermott at deep backward square. 4th over: Sri Lanka 31-1 (Mendis 12, Perera 13) Pat Cummins is on to replace Richardson, with Steve Smith on the mic. Did everyone see his interview the other day where he said he sometimes doesn\u2019t sleep at all during a Test Match? Granted, this is my third OBO since I last slept in a bed having flown back to Australia overnight, but I don\u2019t have to face Jofra Archer bowling 96mph. Anyway, back to Pat who is right on that annoying hip length before too long. They\u2019ve taken to calling Cummins Winx in the dressing room, reflecting his thoroughbred status. A lot better than his alternative moniker. Don\u2019t ask. A SIX to finish, Perera tries to pop him into the Ponsford Stand but instead, his top edge lands in the Olympic. They all laugh. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 21-1 (Mendis 10, Perera 5) Right, so Australia retain their review because the technology wasn\u2019t available. Very strange. Perera tucks a boundary to keep the visitors moving, the big quick losing his radar with the response, spraying down leg. He gets it back quickly, beating Perera with one that really hoops. But the Sri Lankans get the last laugh in a strange over, four leg byes when another poor Starc delivery clips his front pad and beats Carey. NOT OUT. No ball tracking? That\u2019s what the third umpire is saying, that they don\u2019t have the ball tracking technology available. What doing there? I mean, it probably wasn\u2019t out but... what\u2019s going on? HAS STARC PICKED UP MENDIS LBW? Not out on the field. Looked to be missing leg with the swing into the right hander but Finch decides to send it upstairs. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 10-1 (Mendis 10, Perera 0) It was the swing that sorted Dickwella out, Starc generating plenty. Richardson\u2019s turn from the southern end, stringing three dots together to Mendis before the punchy opener gets resourceful, lifting a ball from leg stump up and over the fine leg rope for six - off the front foot, if you don\u2019t mind. Oh dear. First ball the vice-captain faces finds his leading edge and lands safely with McDermott at point. Starc is in the book to complete a very good first over, where Mendis wasn\u2019t comfortable either. 1st over: Sri Lanka 3-1 (Mendis 3) The players are on the field. Mitchell Starc will take the first over, running away from us at the Members End. Kusal Mendis is opening up with Niroshan Dickwella for the Sri Lankans. PLAY! Justin Langer is on the telly. He loves the MCG. He\u2019s very happy with where Australia\u2019s white-ball cricket is at. A lesson from the World Cup is that if you plan early, they can settle on a team for the big tournament here in October - the final to be played at this venue. A lot of love for Glenn Maxwell, reinforcing the support he\u2019s getting. Australia: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Steve Smith, Ben McDermott, Ashton Turner, Alex Carey (wk), Ashton Agar, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Adam Zampa Sri Lanka: Kusal Mendis, Niroshan Dickwella, Kusal Perera (wk), Avishka Fernando, Shehan Jayasuriya, Oshada Fernando, Bhanuka Rajapaksha, Lakshan Sandakan, Lasith Malinga (c), Nuwan Pradeep, Lahiru Kumara Lasith Malinga says he would have batted anyway. The visitors have made two changes - we\u2019ll have those shortly. Aaron Finch says the pitch is good. There is some grass on there but he doesn\u2019t believe it will have an impact on the game. Starc is in for Stanlake and McDermott for Maxwell. \u201cEveryone is right behind him,\u201d he says of his great mate. \u201cHe just needs some support.\u201d They\u2019ve having a bowl Unusually for the MCG, they are playing tonight on the pitch waaaay across to the Punt Road End of the square. It means for a (marignally) shorter boundary to that side. As for the pitch, if it looks like a road and quacks like a road... Welcome to the MCG for the second leg of our T20I double-header on the OBO today. England did the job over New Zealand this afternoon in their series opener this evening, Australia have the chance to sweep Sri Lanka, who have been hapless in their two outings to date - hammered in Adelaide and Brisbane. There will be at least one change to Aaron Finch\u2019s XI with Glenn Maxwell announcing yesterday that he is taking some leave from the game to manage some mental health issues. Justin Langer has already confirmed that Ben McDermott will take his spot. With a view to the T20 World Cup in this country twelve months from now, the home camp will also be fairly keen to give Ashton Turner a hit. But given they have lost only three wickets in the two games so far, there is only so much they can do in this respect. For Sri Lanka\u2019s part, it is hard to believe that this is the same team that swept the world-leading Pakistanis before coming here. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how they shake things up here before flying home. Looking out across the ground, it could be a grotty old night. It was hot this afternoon but now, it\u2019s windy and cloudy. Rain isn\u2019t forecast but we know how the weather works in our glorious Melbourne. I\u2019m looking forward to your company throughout. Drop me a line, yeah?",

Republicans hold ranks as vote splits on party lines The House of Representatives on Thursday voted 232-196 to endorse impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, setting out a road map for the public phase of the inquiry, which could lead to televised hearings within two weeks and a final impeachment vote before the end of the year. No Republicans were persuaded to back the proceedings, though the House\u2019s sole independent, Justin Amash of Michigan \u2013 who quit the GOP in July \u2013 voted to advance the resolution. Rogue policy. In his deposition on Thursday, national security council official Tim Morrison corroborated prior testimony about the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to strike a shady deal with Ukraine. But Morrison also appeared to distance the president from the issue. Trump changes primary residence from New York to Florida Trump has announced he is changing his primary residence from Manhattan to Mar-a-Lago, the exclusive Florida golf club that he describes as the \u201cwinter White House\u201d. \u201cI cherish New York,\u201d the president said in a tweet on Thursday, but added: \u201cDespite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state.\u201d The move could bring Trump tax benefits, and also reflects the importance of Florida to his 2020 re-election campaign. Foreign interference. Trump on Thursday weighed into the UK election, appearing by phone on Nigel Farage\u2019s radio programme to suggest an alliance between Farage and Boris Johnson, and to criticise the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Ring of fires around Los Angeles as California keeps burning Fresh wildfires in Riverside County and the city of San Bernardino added to a growing ring of flames around Los Angeles on Thursday, as southern California\u2019s Santa Ana winds fanned the blazes that have affected millions of people up and down the state. But as bad as this wildfire season has been for California, writes Susie Cagle, it could be much worse if the state \u2013 and the utility blamed for starting many of its fires \u2013 fail to adapt to a future of extreme weather. Fire eaters. The Ronald Reagan library has been saved from the ravages of the Easy fire \u2013 thanks in large part to a team of 500 goats, who chewed through nearby scrubland to create a fire break. Anonymous seller offers Russian emails on \u2018how to bribe Fifa\u2019 An anonymous seller has claimed they have a tranche of emails relating to Russia\u2019s successful bid to host the 2020 Fifa World Cup, reportedly containing a dossier compiled by Russian officials on how to bribe Fifa executive council members. The emails purportedly come from the account of the former head of Russia\u2019s national football academy, and are being offered for sale by a user of the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Character profiles. There is no suggestion Russian officials acted on the dossier, which included extensive character profiles of Fifa council members, including former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner. Cheat sheet In her final speech to the House, the California Democrat Katie Hill condemned a \u201cmisogynistic culture\u201d and the \u201cdouble standard\u201d that led her to resign after being accused of a relationship with a staffer and having nude photos published online without her consent. A group of young climate campaigners wept tears of frustration after learning that Chile had withdrawn as host of the upcoming Cop 25 UN climate conference, while the activists were already sailing across the Atlantic to attend the summit. New York\u2019s city council has voted to build 250 new bike lanes and 1m sq ft of extra pedestrian space, in a bid to \u201cbreak the car culture\u201d of the city, according to council speaker Corey Johnson, who introduced the plan. A haul of apparent Nazi artefacts found behind a wall at a Buenos Aires antiquarian\u2019s home, and about to go on show at Argentina\u2019s Holocaust museum is in fact made up of fakes and counterfeits, a German art historian has claimed.

In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The accounts set out Ashley\u2019s retail spending spree during the year, including the purchases of House of Fraser for \u00a390m, Evans Cycles for \u00a38m, Jack Wills for \u00a312.8m and a shopping park in Hertfordshire for \u00a325.4m.</p> \n<p>Ashley\u2019s splurge on retail assets has raised eyebrows with some analysts questioning his moves to buy up ailing businesses with the high street under pressure.

      "bodyText": "The beers are on ice, the traditional spiced sausages bought, the barbecue coals stacked, and government advisories on the rules of the game circulated on social media. \u201cOf course I\u2019m watching. I\u2019ll be at home, with friends and my husband. It\u2019s a big day for us \u2026 for all South Africans,\u201d said Adelaide Mahlangu, 25, a grocery manager in Johannesburg. When Siya Kolisi leads 14 other players on to the pitch at Yokohama\u2019s International Stadium on Saturday, many will be thinking of another South African captain who led the national team in rugby\u2019s World Cup 24 years ago. The moment when Francois Pienaar received the Webb Ellis cup from Nelson Mandela, the Nobel peace prize-winner and South Africa\u2019s then president, symbolised a new and hopeful future for a country shattered by decades of rule by a repressive, racist apartheid regime. Now, many in the rainbow nation are hoping that the Springboks can win again, and give a similar boost to their troubled and disillusioned country. \u201cEveryone is desperate for a victory here, perhaps even more so than in 1995. People are so desperate for some good news. Defeat might feel like another body blow,\u201d said Daniel Gallan, a South African sports journalist. There has been much progress since the dark days of apartheid, but South Africa remains one of the most unequal countries in the world, with disproportionate wealth in the hands of the white minority. Violent crime is a serious problem, with poor people most likely to be victims. There is deep public frustration with soaring joblessness, patchy delivery of basic services and widespread corruption. Last week Tito Mboweni, the finance minister, forecast cuts and soaring debt. The dreams of 1995 appear very distant. Many of the new hopes are now focused on Kolisi, the Springboks\u2019 first non-white captain. \u201cIf the team was captained by a white guy, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking about how this [match] would reunite the country but because he\u2019s a black guy in a shirt that has meant so many different things at so many different times \u2026 his story is a microcosm of the positivity of new South Africa,\u201d said Gallan. The history of rugby in South Africa \u2013 described as \u201cthe sporting embodiment of white minority rule\u201d \u2013 touches many of the most sensitive issues in a nation where historic grievances are still powerful. Harsh restrictions on non-white players under apartheid led to international bans and South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups. In 1995, the team that Pienaar led to victory in the final included just one black player. In 2007, when South Africa won again, there were two. On Saturday, the team\u2019s coach, Rassie Erasmus, is set to field a team with at least seven black players, possibly more. He has described his squad as a celebration of \u201cso many different cultures, players, languages\u201d. None of his players are old enough to clearly remember the apartheid era and several were born after it ended. \u201cThe Boks have more supporters now than when Mandela was alive,\u201d said Sylvester Clinton, an unemployed resident of Bonteheuwel, near Cape Town. Like many of his compatriots, Clinton, 47, sees Kolisi\u2019s astonishing career as evidence of the ongoing transformation of South Africa. Kolisi grew up in deep poverty but was spotted by scouts and won a rugby scholarship to a prestigious school with a record of producing sporting stars. In 2007 he could not afford a television and watched the World Cup in a pub in the poor township in Eastern Cape province where he grew up. Married to a white woman, Kolisi has two mixed-race children and has legally adopted his two half siblings. \u201cI don\u2019t shy away from where I have come from and I\u2019m aware that my story is a typical South African story in some ways. It\u2019s my motivation,\u201d Kolisi, 28, told the Guardian last year . \u201cI tell my team-mates that you should never play just to represent one group. You can\u2019t play to be the best black player or to be the best white player to appeal to a community; you have to play to be the best for every South African. We represent something much bigger than we can imagine.\u201d Kolisi\u2019s appointment as captain prompted Desmond Tutu, one of the best known and loved leaders of the struggle against apartheid, to praise \u201ca wonderful achievement that \u2026 speaks to the hope we felt 24 years ago that we were developing a special society in which the cream would rise to the top regardless of colour or class.\u201d But recent weeks have been marred by rows over alleged racism \u2013 one involving Kolisi\u2019s friend and teammate Eben Etzebeth which has led to an investigation by the South African Human Rights Commission \u2013 and the example of Kolisi has been criticised as misleading by some prominent commentators. \u201cThe inspirational message is that excellence and flourishing are possible end-goals within anyone\u2019s reach regardless of the circumstances of your early childhood \u2026 That\u2019s a seductive lie,\u201d wrote Eusebius McKaiser, a well-known radio presenter. Ralph Mathegka, a political commentator, said South Africa was \u201cso divided and so cynical\u201d that any relief from a victory would only be temporary, noting that where once criticism of black players came from conservative voices within the white community, particularly those angered by quotas designed to increased diversity in the squad, it now came from those who saw them as \u201cselling out\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Whirlpool has been slammed by MPs for using \u201cdisgraceful\u201d tactics to \u201csilence\u201d customers who had been victims of fires caused by faulty tumble dryers. The cross-party Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee (BEIS) said the company\u2019s use of non-disclosure agreements in at least 24 cases was \u201cchilling\u201d. As many as 800,000 defective Whirlpool tumble dryers could still be in people\u2019s homes, four years after it emerged that they are a fire risk, the committee said. Rachel Reeves, the committee\u2019s chair, said: \u201cThe Whirlpool tumble-dryer saga has dragged on for far too long, leaving customers, now four years on, still fearing they may have potentially unsafe tumble dryers in their homes. \u201cWhirlpool has failed to live up to the duties it owes to its customers. Whirlpool\u2019s prime obligation was to fix the safety issues with its tumble dryers rather than in engage in disgraceful tactics such as using NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] to silence customers who have been the victim of fires involving its products.\u201d The company finally launched a full recall involving 500,000 dryers in July after a lengthy \u201csafety campaign\u201d that resulted in 1.7m products being modified. The recall relates to certain models of Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline dryers built between 2004 and 2015. However, Whirlpool admitted to MPs earlier this year that the true number of faulty tumble dryers in homes across the country could be 800,000 and it was working hard to modify those affected. Whirlpool also revealed that in recent years it had logged 54 fires in its tumble dryers and admitted that three of those were models that had already been updated. The BEIS committee report welcomed the recall but said it took \u201cfar too long\u201d for the government to force the move. It also expressed concerns, shared by safety organisations, about the safety of Whirlpool\u2019s modification. The report calls on the government to press ahead with a new review of the safety of Whirlpool\u2019s modification and to investigate other possible sources of fires in Whirlpool\u2019s tumble dryers. Reeves said: \u201cWhirlpool\u2019s response to fixing safety flaws in its tumble dryers has too often owed more to PR management than to taking the practical steps to make its machines safe for customers. \u201cThe major product safety issues raised by Whirlpool have also highlighted the need for a tough and independent national safety body with the teeth to stand up for consumers.\u201d Whirlpool\u2019s vice-president Jeff Noel said: \u201cPeople\u2019s safety is our top priority, which is why Whirlpool welcomes the report by the BEIS select committee to raise awareness of ongoing safety improvements in the UK. \u201cThrough our ongoing campaign we have resolved this potential safety issue \u2013 which concerns tumble dryers produced by the previous owner of the company \u2013 for more than 1.75 million people. This is up to five times the average success rate for a product recall in the UK. \u201cWe applaud any efforts that create uniform standards that are applied across all industries.\u201d Whirlpool urged those who own an affected tumble dryer and have not already had it replaced or modified to contact the company immediately on 0800 151 0905 or go to www.whirlpool.co.uk/dryerrecall.",

In its attempt to \u201cbreathe new life\u201d into old Amsterdam, a 190-page on-line catalogue of the old stonework has been put online to allow every Amsterdammer to own a piece of their heritage. The stone has been ranked in terms of quality, from \u201ccomplete gables\u201d down to \u201cdebris\u201d. Some of the items come with their original architectural drawings or black and white photographs showing their previous use. All the pieces are being offered free of charge but the criteria for taking ownership is stricter for pieces deemed to be of extra value because \u201cthere is more documentation left or because they are still in relatively good condition\u201d. Today, the epitome of Amsterdam\u2019s wealth and power during the 17th century can be seen in the rows of gabled houses along the three main canals in the centre of the city: Herengracht, Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht. Among the debris on offer is the old facade of a canal house at 126 Herengracht called \u2018t Moortje, due to its Moorish appearance. Applicants must provide a convincing idea for the stoneworks\u2019 future use to take ownership. Potential uses include art projects or new building developments. \u201cThe often special stones, ornaments, frames and, for example, columns can be a wonderful addition to, for example, a new-build project,\u201d the municipality says. Residents have until the end of December to come up with ideas and proposals. The fragments can be collected in spring 2020 but anyone interested needs to organise their own means of transport for the stonework. \u201cMaybe you happen to be a fan and self-builder?\u201d the municipality asks. \u201cThen consider a historic element in your modern Amsterdam facade! But a construction fragment can also be suitable for public spaces or as an application in an art project. And there are even more possibilities, for example, a museum can exhibit it or it can be used as educational material. [The department of] monuments and archeology is open to creative applications!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is not unusual for periodicals to produce books applauding their own achievements, especially on their anniversaries, but this volume, put together by the editorial staff of the London Review of Books to celebrate the 40th anniversary of what they call \u201cthe paper\u201d, is singular. Though a sort of anthology, it is more like a handsomely produced scrapbook, with photographic reproductions of original letters, draft articles and scribbled notes. (Great diplomacy has been shown in getting the permissions to reproduce some of these.) The result is a kind of coffee table book of intellectual contention.</p> <p>The LRB began in 1979, when the labour dispute at the Times meant that the Times Literary Supplement was not appearing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/25/karl-miller\" title=\"\">Karl Miller</a>, former editor of the Listener and head of English at University College London, decided to start a new review. His former deputy at the Listener, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/24/marykay-wilmers-interview-nicholas-wroe\" title=\"\">Mary-Kay Wilmers</a>, joined him. This volume illustrates the LRB\u2019s rickety yet oddly confident beginnings, first as an insert within the New York Review of Books, which initially provided necessary funding. It split off a year later. Wilmers had inherited some money \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t want it \u2026 So I found a use for it\u201d \u2013 and when Miller left in 1992 Wilmers became editor, and is still.</p> <p>The first issue still seems impressive, with William Empson on <em>A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</em>, John Bayley\u2019s review of William Golding\u2019s <em>Darkness Visible</em>, and new poems by Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney. Pages reproduced from early issues are, however, forbidding: unbroken columns of print as far as the eye can see. The LRB demonstrated its intellectual seriousness by allowing contributors unparalleled wordage. (Cannily, the compilers have chosen to reprint only tantalising snippets of interesting items rather than whole pieces.)</p> <p>We see the page from Miller\u2019s jotter with its list of desired contributors, most of whom are eventually nabbed. A few grand refuseniks are commemorated. Karl Popper, both lofty and needy, had his assistant at LSE tell the LRB that he didn\u2019t write reviews but would be \u201cinterested to know if you have published reviews of his own books\u201d. Of the 66 well-known names on Miller\u2019s intellectual celebrity list, just six are women. There is later some fretting about the predominance of male contributors in the LRB\u2019s recent as well as distant history.</p> <p>It may seem odd to have a coffee table book where the pictures are of texts, but many of these are surprisingly expressive. There is the extraordinary typed letter from the poet Laura Riding complaining about Martin Seymour-Smith\u2019s biography of her former partner, Robert Graves. \u201cMr Miller!\u201d it begins, before expressing indignation in rambling sentences, where the very print \u2013 letters overtyped, words crossed out \u2013 is a chart of her feelings. It is a reminder of what an eloquent mess a typewriter could make. In contrast, the thickly but precisely corrected typescript of <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v09/n20/julian-barnes/diary\" title=\"\">Julian Barnes\u2019s Diary article</a> about the Booker prize (\u201cposh bingo\u201d) is a diagram of fastidiousness.</p> <p>We get the graphic drama, as it were, of the handwritten letter, in what looks like blue felt-tip, from Bruce Chatwin in 1988, protesting against <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v10/n10/john-ryle/chronicle-of-an-epidemic\" title=\"\">an article about Aids by John Ryle</a> \u2013 indeed protesting at the very use of the word \u201cAids\u201d. The un-joined-up script somehow makes the repressed fury all the clearer. Differently eloquent is the magnified note of thanks to Frank Kermode, for his review of <em>The Blue Flower</em>, from Penelope Fitzgerald, written in a hand both eccentric and highly legible: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019d agree that writing, like teaching, produces considerable spells of depression &amp; moments of great happiness.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow it is great to see the actual faxed page of an extremely anxious lawyer\u2019s advice about a Christopher Hitchens piece on Conrad Black. \u201cThe real problem comes with Christopher Hitchens\u2019s opinions about Mr Black \u2013 that he is a mad, tyrannical egotist, a sinister eccentric, a megalomaniac.\u201d There is also a problem with the Labour politician Michael Meacher being designated \u201ca prefect with a reputation for frigid sadism\u201d. An editorial pen has written \u201ccut\u201d alongside both offending flowers of rhetoric.</p> <p>There are some good spats. Here is Al Alvarez\u2019s ex\u2011wife, Ursula Creagh, reviewing his book <em><a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v04/n10/ursula-creagh/first-chapters\" title=\"\">Life After Marriage: Scenes from a Divorce</a></em> \u2013 and then, for good measure, Kermode writing to Miller to express his indignation at this \u201cvirtually inexcusable\u201d choice of reviewer. \u201cI do not believe in \u2018unprejudiced\u2019 reviewing,\u201d Miller unanswerably replies, signing off with the sad acknowledgement that \u201cthe time has come for us to have no more to do with one another\u201d. What Dr Johnson called \u201cthe acrimony of scholiasts\u201d gets its delicious due. In 1993 it is both Elaine Showalter v Camille Paglia and Judith Butler portentously denouncing Terry Eagleton.</p> <p>The LRB likes to show the LRB in process. On the one hand, pages proudly display memorandums in which the staff debate hyphens and the best ways to split words across the end of lines. On the other hand, we get the cock-ups over arty covers that turned out to be rubbish. LRB editors are exacting and are often themselves gifted writers (Andrew O\u2019Hagan, Susannah Clapp, John Lanchester). They also have a collective reputation for overconfidence, illustrated in some of these pages.

      "bodyText": "It is not unusual for periodicals to produce books applauding their own achievements, especially on their anniversaries, but this volume, put together by the editorial staff of the London Review of Books to celebrate the 40th anniversary of what they call \u201cthe paper\u201d, is singular. Though a sort of anthology, it is more like a handsomely produced scrapbook, with photographic reproductions of original letters, draft articles and scribbled notes. (Great diplomacy has been shown in getting the permissions to reproduce some of these.) The result is a kind of coffee table book of intellectual contention. The LRB began in 1979, when the labour dispute at the Times meant that the Times Literary Supplement was not appearing. Karl Miller, former editor of the Listener and head of English at University College London, decided to start a new review. His former deputy at the Listener, Mary-Kay Wilmers, joined him. This volume illustrates the LRB\u2019s rickety yet oddly confident beginnings, first as an insert within the New York Review of Books, which initially provided necessary funding. It split off a year later. Wilmers had inherited some money \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t want it \u2026 So I found a use for it\u201d \u2013 and when Miller left in 1992 Wilmers became editor, and is still. The first issue still seems impressive, with William Empson on A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, John Bayley\u2019s review of William Golding\u2019s Darkness Visible, and new poems by Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney. Pages reproduced from early issues are, however, forbidding: unbroken columns of print as far as the eye can see. The LRB demonstrated its intellectual seriousness by allowing contributors unparalleled wordage. (Cannily, the compilers have chosen to reprint only tantalising snippets of interesting items rather than whole pieces.) We see the page from Miller\u2019s jotter with its list of desired contributors, most of whom are eventually nabbed. A few grand refuseniks are commemorated. Karl Popper, both lofty and needy, had his assistant at LSE tell the LRB that he didn\u2019t write reviews but would be \u201cinterested to know if you have published reviews of his own books\u201d. Of the 66 well-known names on Miller\u2019s intellectual celebrity list, just six are women. There is later some fretting about the predominance of male contributors in the LRB\u2019s recent as well as distant history. It may seem odd to have a coffee table book where the pictures are of texts, but many of these are surprisingly expressive. There is the extraordinary typed letter from the poet Laura Riding complaining about Martin Seymour-Smith\u2019s biography of her former partner, Robert Graves. \u201cMr Miller!\u201d it begins, before expressing indignation in rambling sentences, where the very print \u2013 letters overtyped, words crossed out \u2013 is a chart of her feelings. It is a reminder of what an eloquent mess a typewriter could make. In contrast, the thickly but precisely corrected typescript of Julian Barnes\u2019s Diary article about the Booker prize (\u201cposh bingo\u201d) is a diagram of fastidiousness. We get the graphic drama, as it were, of the handwritten letter, in what looks like blue felt-tip, from Bruce Chatwin in 1988, protesting against an article about Aids by John Ryle \u2013 indeed protesting at the very use of the word \u201cAids\u201d. The un-joined-up script somehow makes the repressed fury all the clearer. Differently eloquent is the magnified note of thanks to Frank Kermode, for his review of The Blue Flower, from Penelope Fitzgerald, written in a hand both eccentric and highly legible: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you\u2019d agree that writing, like teaching, produces considerable spells of depression &amp; moments of great happiness.\u201d Somehow it is great to see the actual faxed page of an extremely anxious lawyer\u2019s advice about a Christopher Hitchens piece on Conrad Black. \u201cThe real problem comes with Christopher Hitchens\u2019s opinions about Mr Black \u2013 that he is a mad, tyrannical egotist, a sinister eccentric, a megalomaniac.\u201d There is also a problem with the Labour politician Michael Meacher being designated \u201ca prefect with a reputation for frigid sadism\u201d. An editorial pen has written \u201ccut\u201d alongside both offending flowers of rhetoric. There are some good spats. Here is Al Alvarez\u2019s ex\u2011wife, Ursula Creagh, reviewing his book Life After Marriage: Scenes from a Divorce \u2013 and then, for good measure, Kermode writing to Miller to express his indignation at this \u201cvirtually inexcusable\u201d choice of reviewer. \u201cI do not believe in \u2018unprejudiced\u2019 reviewing,\u201d Miller unanswerably replies, signing off with the sad acknowledgement that \u201cthe time has come for us to have no more to do with one another\u201d. What Dr Johnson called \u201cthe acrimony of scholiasts\u201d gets its delicious due. In 1993 it is both Elaine Showalter v Camille Paglia and Judith Butler portentously denouncing Terry Eagleton. The LRB likes to show the LRB in process. On the one hand, pages proudly display memorandums in which the staff debate hyphens and the best ways to split words across the end of lines. On the other hand, we get the cock-ups over arty covers that turned out to be rubbish. LRB editors are exacting and are often themselves gifted writers (Andrew O\u2019Hagan, Susannah Clapp, John Lanchester). They also have a collective reputation for overconfidence, illustrated in some of these pages. O\u2019Hagan explains how staff disliked the last lines of poems that they were printing. \u201cThey were often too \u2018last-line-y\u2019.\u201d So some were just docked. There is an example here (\u201cCockcrow\u201d) from Patricia Beer, with her terse, infuriated letter of complaint. \u201cThe poem is, of course, ruined,\u201d she writes, with justification. Showing process also means displaying political choices. Here is Wilmers\u2019s letter to Anne Applebaum, explaining that the journal had refused her review of a book on the last days of the Soviet Union because it spent too much time reminding the readers \u201cthat Stalin was bad\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Precisely observed and recorded, these cross-section and elevation scale drawings depict, in forensic detail, the working and living environments of a number of Glasgow\u2019s independent newsagents, all within walking distance of my flat in the city\u2019s West End. My intent was to celebrate their rich individuality, as well as the transformation of their interiors by shopkeepers over time. Unlike the survey drawings of an archaeologist, which are generated to provide an accurate record of a site as left by its inhabitants, these drawings can only be produced through dialogue with the people who shape these places as their own. Crafted in pen and watercolour, my work documents these unique and disappearing frontages and interiors. Since the beginning of the project in 2016, two of the nine newsagents recorded have ceased trading. Newsagents are a rich topic of research, not just architecturally, but also economically and socially. They are often the place where as children we engage in our first monetary transaction, buying sweets or comics; or perhaps our first jobs as paper boys or girls. As we grow older, so might our purchases change, buying lottery tickets, cigarettes or alcohol. These shops are assets to the communities they serve, and the owners know their customers personally; they are of a scale that means they can adapt and update their stock to suit demand. Whereas sales of newspapers and magazines were once the staple of such shops, these businesses are having to change and adjust in order to remain afloat in a digital age. Glasgow-based artist Will Knight studied at the Glasgow School of Art. Critiquing the often sterile, static and impersonal graphic representation of architecture today, Will\u2019s scale drawings depict buildings as a lived-in experience.

      "bodyText": "Despite several attempts against his life \u2013 poisoned food, a smuggled grenade \u2013 drug trafficker Nery L\u00f3pez appeared calm as he spoke to the warden inside a maximum-security prison in western Honduras. He hardly seemed to notice when a guard wearing a ski mask entered the hallway, eyeing L\u00f3pez as he reached for the keys on his belt. Moments later, the masked guard stepped aside from a heavy sliding door as a group of men in T-shirts and shorts burst in, one of them firing a handgun at L\u00f3pez. A second man drew a long knife, hacking at the fallen trafficker before the gunman drew a second weapon and emptied another cartridge of bullets. Within hours of the 26 October murder, footage of the brazen attack had leaked on to social media, sending a shockwave of fear through the nation. The killing came just days after evidence seized from L\u00f3pez helped a New York jury convict a former Honduran politician named Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez on four counts of drug trafficking and related weapons charges. Tony Hern\u00e1ndez is the brother of Honduras\u2019s current president, Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez \u2013 and Lopez\u2019s lawyer was quick to accuse the government of complicity in his client\u2019s murder. \u201cJuan Orlando [Hern\u00e1ndez] silenced him,\u201d said L\u00f3pez\u2019s lawyer, Carlos Chajtur. \u201cThat door opened on purpose.\u201d The murder is the latest embarrassment for the US state department, which continues to ignore the haze of allegations around the Honduran government while pushing the country to cooperate in Donald Trump\u2019s regional crackdown on migration. A week before the trial began, the two countries announced an agreement, allowing the US to send asylum seekers from third countries to the violence-torn Central American nation while their claim is processed. Similar deals have been drawn up with Guatemala and El Salvador. So, while US prosecutors in New York described a situation of \u201cstate-sponsored drug trafficking\u201d, the state department has maintained a business-as-usual approach following Tony Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s conviction. A day after the verdict, the top US diplomat in Honduras was photographed smiling with President Hern\u00e1ndez at a military parade. The Honduran president also featured in the New York case, when prosecutors accused him of having received millions of dollars from drug traffickers, including a $1m bribe from Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. Prosecutors accused Tony Hern\u00e1ndez of conspiring to murder rival traffickers, including a massacre with a bazooka and machine guns that resulted in four deaths. President Hern\u00e1ndez, who was re-elected in a fraud-marred vote in 2017 after the supreme court lifted a single-term limit, has denied all accusations of links to drug trafficking and maintained his brother\u2019s innocence. \u201cWhat can you say about a conviction based on the testimonies of confessed murderers?\u201d he said on Twitter after the verdict was announced. Opposition leaders have called for President Hern\u00e1ndez to resign, but fear, division and a dearth of leadership have prevented sporadic protests from coalescing into a mass movement. At the time of his capture in June 2018, L\u00f3pez was living under an assumed name, after faking his own death a few years earlier by paying bribes to obtain a falsified death certificate and a new identity. He was considered one of the largest drug traffickers in Honduras, so anti-narcotics agents were intrigued to discover hundreds of pages of records itemizing his business welded in a secret compartment in a vehicle seized in the arrest. One of those agents testified at the trial of Tony Hern\u00e1ndez that he had immediately spotted the former legislator\u2019s name in the ledgers, which also list payments to a person identified as \u201cJOH\u201d \u2013 the initials by which President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez is commonly known.

      "body": "<p>On Tuesday, in Chicago, former president Barack Obama joined actress Yara Shahidi in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKLplf-KlTQ\">conversation</a> with activists from his Obama Foundation program. Over the nearly 1.5-hour Obama Foundation summit event, the beloved political figure deployed his trademark charm and humor while discussing the challenges of movement politics.</p> \n<p>Media attention has focused on a particular part of the conversation \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/oct/30/barack-obama-calls-out-politically-woke-social-media-generation-video\">Obama\u2019s criticism of call-out culture</a> and what he perceived as an excessively strident activist left. \u201cWe can\u2019t completely remake society in a minute,\u201d Obama said, \u201cso we have to make some accommodations to the existing structures.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added, \u201cThis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you.\u201d</p> \n<p>He then made a separate point about social media activism:</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or used the wrong verb, I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. \u2018Man you see how woke I was, I called you out.\u2019\u201d But \u201cthat\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb0c9dcf-5934-4efd-9824-f91ffd5ae940\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qaHLd8de6nM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On its face, these are fair remarks. During the session, both Obama and Shahidi drew from examples of the nonviolent civil rights movement of the early 1960s, which required enormous faith, patience and compromise from its activists in the face of threats to their lives and livelihood. Today, as social justice activists\u2019 material conditions have relatively improved, they will encounter people in positions of power with wealth and access, and they have to learn to work with them on some level, Obama implied. And no, tweeting about a verb probably won\u2019t bring about change.</p> \n<p>However, we can\u2019t look at Obama\u2019s remarks in a vacuum. From 2016 \u2013 as he prepared to exert his influence over who would be the next Democratic nominee \u2013 to the present, Obama has often aimed his political critiques at youth-led, black and progressive movements. While upholding the necessity of nuance, Obama himself seems to force these movements into a box, cherry-picking anecdotes for a strawman: that these movements expect purity and demand perfection.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke \u2026 you should get over that. The world is messy. There are ambiguities</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Barack Obama</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In an early instance of this ideological pattern, at a 2016 <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/president-obama-calls-out-black-lives-matter-activists-yelling\">youth town hall in London</a>, Obama spoke generally of Black Lives Matter while referring to the handful of activists who confronted the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her role in criminalizing black youth:</p> \n<p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve highlighted an issue and brought it to people\u2019s attention \u2026 then you can\u2019t just keep on yelling at them. And you can\u2019t refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, in Chicago, former president Barack Obama joined actress Yara Shahidi in a conversation with activists from his Obama Foundation program. Over the nearly 1.5-hour Obama Foundation summit event, the beloved political figure deployed his trademark charm and humor while discussing the challenges of movement politics. Media attention has focused on a particular part of the conversation \u2013 Obama\u2019s criticism of call-out culture and what he perceived as an excessively strident activist left. \u201cWe can\u2019t completely remake society in a minute,\u201d Obama said, \u201cso we have to make some accommodations to the existing structures.\u201d He added, \u201cThis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly. The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you.\u201d He then made a separate point about social media activism: \u201cIf I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or used the wrong verb, I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. \u2018Man you see how woke I was, I called you out.\u2019\u201d But \u201cthat\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change.\u201d On its face, these are fair remarks. During the session, both Obama and Shahidi drew from examples of the nonviolent civil rights movement of the early 1960s, which required enormous faith, patience and compromise from its activists in the face of threats to their lives and livelihood. Today, as social justice activists\u2019 material conditions have relatively improved, they will encounter people in positions of power with wealth and access, and they have to learn to work with them on some level, Obama implied. And no, tweeting about a verb probably won\u2019t bring about change. However, we can\u2019t look at Obama\u2019s remarks in a vacuum. From 2016 \u2013 as he prepared to exert his influence over who would be the next Democratic nominee \u2013 to the present, Obama has often aimed his political critiques at youth-led, black and progressive movements. While upholding the necessity of nuance, Obama himself seems to force these movements into a box, cherry-picking anecdotes for a strawman: that these movements expect purity and demand perfection. In an early instance of this ideological pattern, at a 2016 youth town hall in London, Obama spoke generally of Black Lives Matter while referring to the handful of activists who confronted the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her role in criminalizing black youth: \u201cOnce you\u2019ve highlighted an issue and brought it to people\u2019s attention \u2026 then you can\u2019t just keep on yelling at them. And you can\u2019t refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position. The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room.\u201d A few months later in a Howard commencement address, with Chicago protests of the police killing of Laquan McDonald not far in the distance, he told the audience of mostly black students about his criminal justice reform as a state senator: \u201cI can say this unequivocally: without at least the acceptance of the police organizations in Illinois, I could never have gotten those [criminal justice reform] bills passed \u2026 If you think that the only way forward is to be as uncompromising as possible, you will feel good about yourself, you will enjoy a certain moral purity, but you\u2019re not going to get what you want.\u201d And earlier this year, Obama again raised the amorphous specter of purity politics as people have embraced a leftward policy shift: \u201cOne of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States \u2026 is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, \u2018Uh, I\u2019m sorry, this is how it\u2019s going to be\u2019 and then we start \u2026 a \u2018circular firing squad\u2019, where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues.\u201d Obama has offered these platitudes without much evidence that progressives, Black Lives Matter activists or young voters expect purity. Impatience with the status quo is not purity. A consistent political project is not purity. And being patient has its limits. You can gather from the general direction of Obama\u2019s career, from turning down a route in corporate law to his community organizing, that he has some commitment to social justice. However, his remarks indicate discomfort with more radical tactics in achieving it, reducing them to petulant zeal and not a legitimate strategy among the broad scope of tools needed to dismantle oppressive systems. While discussing Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King as examples of patient progress, he freezes them in time. He failed to note either King\u2019s or Parks\u2019s evolutions. Over time King became more radicalized and questioned integration. When Parks was forced to Detroit to retreat from the backlash against her bus boycott activism, she became a proponent of the Panthers\u2019 self-defense demands and identified Malcolm X as her personal hero. Obama also failed to discuss how, despite King\u2019s strategies negotiating with Lyndon Johnson to sign the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress waffled in passing further civil rights measures until the 1968 riots after King\u2019s assassination, when Congress was forced to swiftly pass the Fair Housing Act. Or go back further: despite the negotiations and patience of abolitionists in the 1800s, it was a steady stream of black uprisings, and an entire civil war, that gave abolition laws and the Emancipation Proclamation any teeth. Obama\u2019s fundamental problem is in confusing a strategy of pragmatism with the strategy. Pragmatic approaches can coexist with more radical politics. But Obama\u2019s pattern of dismissing radical demands altogether shows a serious unwillingness to appreciate the times. Obama is committed to a notion of reaching across the aisle that may have seemed necessary in 2012, but not so much in 2019.

Two years after the article\u2019s publication, it\u2019s impossible not to notice that democracy has been severely degraded under the regimes that the Facebook team helped achieve power. What do Zuckerberg\u2019s bromides about democracy mean to Facebook users in Kashmir, where Modi has blocked the internet for 13 weeks and on Thursday dissolved the constitution? What do his paeans to the free press mean to Facebook users in the Philippines, where Duterte has used his office to attempt to silence an independent journalist working to expose extrajudicial killings and human rights violations? Will Facebook update its \u201cSuccess Story\u201d about playing a \u201ccentral role\u201d in the way Duda is \u201cinnovating communication between the government and the public\u201d as fears grow that democracy in Poland is eroding under his party\u2019s rule? The paradox here is that Facebook is more accountable to US lawmakers and reporters than it is to any other country\u2019s. It is incumbent on American politicians and the American press to keep this in mind \u2013 and push Facebook to answer questions about how its policies will apply to the vast majority of its users. What I\u2019m reading \u201cWhy is the principal of our school on a first-name basis with the CEO of a company who is collecting data about our kids?\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Heather Kelly reports on the proliferation of classroom management apps in elementary and high schools. Microsoft has pledged not to use facial recognition in ways that infringe on democratic freedoms. So why did it fund a startup that is being used to surveil Palestinians in the West Bank, according to this investigation by NBC News\u2019s Olivia Solon? \u201cYou can replace your credit card number, but you can\u2019t replace your genome.\u201d Antonio Regaldo explains how the DNA database that was used to find the Golden State Killer could be a national security threat.

The resulting sweet and sour confection is tremendously moreish and, like the rest of this album, testament to its creator\u2019s skill and superior sonic palate.",

      "bodyText": "Argentina has changed its definition of waste in a move that could allow it to import millions of tonnes of plastic waste discarded in the US. The country\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, signed a decree in August reclassifying some materials destined for recycling as commodities instead of waste, allowing looser oversight of mixed and contaminated plastic scraps that are difficult to process, and are often dumped or incinerated. Social and environmental groups say the decree is illegal and bucks a global trend toward improving controls over waste imports. They worry it could be the first step towards Argentina taking in the plastics that have flooded developed nations after China began to refuse all but the cleanest of shipments in late 2017. Jim Puckett, the executive director of the Basel Action Network, a group that fights the export of toxic waste from industrialised societies to developing nations, said: \u201cThey\u2019re willing to become a sacrificial country where the rest of the world could send their waste and they could profit from it.\u201d Argentinian environment official Alejandra Acosta said advocates are misunderstanding the decree and that it would actually be more stringent than previous policies, although she could not explain why multiple groups are interpreting the change as relaxing plastic import rules. She acknowledged the government did not do enough outreach with advocates and argued that no mixed plastics or plastics destined for \u201cfinal disposal\u201d or \u201cenergy recovery\u201d via incineration would be allowed. More than 180 countries are party to the Basel convention, which governs the international waste trade, but the US is not. Under a recent amendment proposed by Norway, developed nations will not be able to export low-quality plastic waste to developing nations without getting their explicit consent and ensuring the waste can be appropriately handled. The amendments aim to ensure that even abstaining countries, such as the US, follow the Basel convention rules when sending plastic waste to poorer countries. Basel convention countries could still strike separate agreements with the US, as long as they ensure that any plastics they receive will not be disposed of in ways that harm the environment and violate the convention, said P\u00e5l Spillum, the deputy director general of Norway\u2019s environment ministry. Acosta argued that Argentina wanted more stringent policies than Norway did, although advocates following the negotiations said Argentina was set on undercutting the strengthening of the convention. Because of that stance and the new decree, Puckett said he worries that Argentina wants to start taking in America\u2019s waste. It is thought Argentina could fill the void left by China\u2019s decision to stop accepting all but the easiest-to-recycle plastics from the US, the UK and Europe. After that change, in late 2017, US plastic waste first began to flow to countries including Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. When those countries started to ban the imports, they showed up in Cambodia, Laos, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and Senegal, which previously handled virtually no US plastic, as revealed in a Guardian investigation. Spillum said his country\u2019s proposal was meant to \u201cincrease the control of transboundary movement of plastic waste which is not easily recyclable, and therefore likely to become an environmental problem in the country of import\u201d. A spokesperson for the US Environmental Protection Agency said the US supported the Basel convention but opposed the amendments. For plastic scrap to be exempt from the amendments, it would need to \u201cmeet a very narrow and strict set of criteria that is difficult and costly to satisfy\u201d, the EPA spokesperson argued, continuing: \u201cThe United States is concerned that barriers to the responsible movement of plastic scrap for recycling will decrease its value and make virgin plastics more attractive by comparison, likely increasing the overall volume of disposal of plastics from the waste stream.\u201d The EPA said it had \u201cjust become aware\u201d of Argentina\u2019s new waste decree and had not had a chance to assess its impacts. Cecilia Allen, a Buenos Aires-based advocate with the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, said any mixed plastics Argentina accepted from abroad were unlikely to be recycled. In recent months, the value of recycled plastic has declined. It is more expensive to make than the virgin plastic produced from the ethane gas pulled from underground by oil and gas drillers. \u201cOne of the concerns we have is this can boost an incinerator industry in the country, or waste burning in cement plants,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe have a lot of waste here and we are not reducing, we are not recycling, we are not composting. And it makes no sense for us to open the door for more to come.\u201d Incinerators that burn plastic are linked to major health problems from the air pollution they produce. Waste pickers in Argentina, who sift through piles of plastics to collect those that are deemed worth recycling, have protested against the decree, as it is expected to decrease the value of the domestic plastics they retrieve. Carolina Palacio, a representative for the Argentinian waste pickers federation, said the union has fought for better working and living conditions. \u201cInstead of this, they deregulate and bring waste from other parts of the world. Don\u2019t we have enough waste here?\u201d Palacio said. \u2022 This article was updated on 4 November 20119 to add a response from the Argentinian government.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s national airline, Qantas, this week grounded three of its Boeing 737s after cracks were found in a part of the plane known as the \u201cpickle fork\u201d. The plane \u2013 the 737-NG to be precise \u2013 is one of the most commonly used models in the world, with over 7,000 in service globally. So far, 50 aircraft around the world have been found with cracks, including nine in South Korea and three belonging to Southwest Airlines in the US. The Australian aircraft engineers union has called on Qantas to ground all of its 737s. But Qantas and other affected airlines say that they have completed the relevant checks, and are proceeding with an abundance of caution. Dr Garth Pearce, a senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of New South Wales, says this should be enough to ensure the safety of all passengers. What is the pickle fork? The pickle fork lies between the wing and the fuselage. It strengthens the connection between the wing and the body of the plane. But, as this article from the ABC points out, the pickle fork is not the only thing that holds the wing in place. What are the airlines doing? The issue is related to the number of flight cycles a plane has gone through. A cycle is one take-off and landing \u2013 with most commercial planes going through roughly 1,700 cycles a year. Last month, a global aviation regulation was issued requiring all Boeing 737s with more than 30,000 lifetime cycles to be urgently checked \u2013 within seven days. 737s with between 22,600 and 30,000 also need to be checked, but within seven months. Planes below 22,600 do not need to be checked until they reach that milestone. This week, Qantas discovered that three of its planes that were below the 30,000 mark had cracks (at 27,000 cycles). The airline then urgently checked all 737s between 22,600 and 30,000 cycles, completing this within seven days rather than the seven months required. The airline does not have any planes above 30,000. Globally, Boeing has checked all planes above 30,000, and a third of those above 22,600. Of the 1,000 planes they have checked, faults were found in less than 5% of them. How many planes could be affected? This may vary from airline to airline, but we can use Qantas as an example. Out of a total 75 Boeing 737s, Qantas has none above 30,000. There are 33 above 22,600 and 42 are below 22,600. Qantas has said it will not check any of the planes below 22,600. Ryanair has more than 400 737s in service, but has not disclosed whether it has discovered any issues so far. Virgin Australia has inspected all 19 of its 737s over 22,600 cycles, without findings cracks. American Airlines and United Airlines said they are inspecting their entire fleets but have not found any cracks so far. Is it safe to fly? The Australian aircraft engineers union has called on Qantas to ground all of its 737s.

      "body": "<p>Edward Platt travels around Britain in search of the kind of apocalyptic deluge that increasingly swamps the country\u2019s urban and rural landscapes. He is most interested in what people\u2019s accounts of flooding, and his own first-hand observations of wading through sodden fields and streets, can tell him about the experience of such calamity. He writes that he\u2019s \u201cless preoccupied with the point the water reached or the rate at which it went down than with the emotional and psychological marks it left behind\u201d.</p> <p>How we visualise climate catastrophe tends toward the epic, the exotic. We seek to dramatise it through faraway scenes of the Romantic sublime gone awry: the polar ice collapsing from a glacier, the monstrous tsunami hitting a shore on the other side of the world.

      "bodyText": "Edward Platt travels around Britain in search of the kind of apocalyptic deluge that increasingly swamps the country\u2019s urban and rural landscapes. He is most interested in what people\u2019s accounts of flooding, and his own first-hand observations of wading through sodden fields and streets, can tell him about the experience of such calamity. He writes that he\u2019s \u201cless preoccupied with the point the water reached or the rate at which it went down than with the emotional and psychological marks it left behind\u201d. How we visualise climate catastrophe tends toward the epic, the exotic. We seek to dramatise it through faraway scenes of the Romantic sublime gone awry: the polar ice collapsing from a glacier, the monstrous tsunami hitting a shore on the other side of the world. Platt instead locates its effects in the everyday: the flooding experienced by England\u2019s picture postcard towns and occasionally decrepit coastal settlements. He shows how these places are turned upside down by torrents of raging water, as rivers, streams and culverts strain and break under the pressure of extreme rainfall, or sea walls and floodgates give way, and how the flood is merely the starting point for months and often years of misery as houses are dried out, refurbished \u2013 and, frequently, soon deluged again. The Great Flood makes the global local in the same way that the climate emergency does. Platt\u2019s trip takes place during the extreme floods of the winter of 2013-14, the wettest on record in the south of England, and provides him with plenty of opportunities for waterlogged reportage: in one village in the Somerset Levels he accepts a lift in a canoe along the flooded main road to get to his car.

Although for the most part Platt visits these locations in the years before the EU referendum, Brexit seems foreshadowed in the feelings of people who have experienced the misery of flooding: of being ignored by the authorities, of having to get by on their own. Frequently, the Environmental Agency is mentioned as a focus of people\u2019s anger \u2013 a faceless, omnipotent bureaucracy on which every failure can be pinned.

      "body": "<p>I first read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/22/philip-pullman-my-daemon-is-a-raven-la-belle-sauvage-interview-questions\" title=\"\">Philip Pullman</a>\u2019s His Dark Materials trilogy as a young teen; it felt like a revelation. The books had a rough-textured animal-breath closeness that I had rarely encountered before, and at the heart of that was a small child, swift witted and loose handed with the truth, throwing mud at rival children, and her soul companion, her daemon Pantalaimon. I decided there and then, with all acknowledgements to the glory and joy of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/20/alice-in-wonderland-what-does-it-all-mean\" title=\"\">Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em>, of Sophie in Diana Wynne Jones\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/18/howls-moving-castle-by-diana-wynne-jones-fantastical-fun-fantastically-human\" title=\"\">Howl\u2019s Moving Castle</a></em>, of Malorie Blackman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/17/crossfire-by-malorie-blackman-review\" title=\"\">Sephy Hadley </a>in <em>Noughts &amp; Crosses</em> and of Roald Dahl\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/01/matilda-at-30-roald-dahl-quentin-blake\" title=\"\">Matilda</a>, that the greatest heroine in British children\u2019s books was Lyra.</p> <p>There is good evidence that many people of my generation felt the same. Pullman now shares with Shakespeare, Jonathan Swift and Philip Sidney the distinction of having popularised an English-language name that is now part of the lexicon. We owe the name Vanessa to Swift, who gave it as a piglatinish nickname to his lover Esther (Esse for short) Vanhomrigh, and Pamela (pronounced, originally, Pameela) to Sidney. Shakespeare has at least two; the first sighting we have of Miranda (from mirandus, meaning wonderful) is The Tempest, and Jessica, probably in an Anglicisation of the Old Testament Hebrew name Iscah, first appears in English in The Merchant of Venice. And last year, 362 new Lyras were born.</p> <p>The name came, originally, from a misunderstanding. Pullman told the New Yorker: \u201cThere was a hymn I particularly liked called \u2018Jesus Christ Is Risen Today, Alleluia\u2019 \u2026 And under the number of the hymn, printed in small italics, was usually the name of the author. In this case, the name there was Lyra Davidica.\u201d It was, he thought, a good name. \u201cIn fact, what Lyra Davidica means is the \u2018harp of David\u2019. \u2018Lyra\u2019 is a Greek word for a musical instrument like a harp.\u201d</p> <p>Where did Lyra herself come from? She has, I think, DNA from many places: from the tricksters in old English ballads, from William Brown and his Outlaws, from the orphaned Cinderella (not the Disney one; the versions from the 17th and 18th centuries, who had wit and guile and an edge of ruthlessness on their side. In Giambattista Basile\u2019s <em>La Gatta </em><em>Cenerentola</em>, Zezolla murders her stepmother by chopping off her head with the lid of a trunk.) Pullman told me: \u201cLyra just came to me as she was. I didn\u2019t change a bit, or alter anything to her advantage. Having taught in middle schools for 12 years or so, I was well aware that there was a Lyra in every class. The point I always make, when asked about it, is that Lyra is not special. She\u2019s ordinary, not to say common. But it\u2019s the qualities she shares with so many real girls that help her when she finds herself in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Lyra has nothing in her that makes her uniquely suited for her task ahead. She is made, not born, a hero</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So Lyra is in some ways utterly commonplace: solid legged, dirty nailed, a liar without much concern about the consequences of her lies. That ordinariness is what makes her so vivid; despite the fact that the witches have a prophecy about her, she doesn\u2019t have, unlike <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/26/twenty-years-of-harry-potter-the-20-things-we-have-learned\" title=\"\">Harry Potter</a>, any particular magic: she has nothing in her that makes her uniquely suited for her task ahead. She is made, not born, a hero. As Pullman says, \u201cI\u2019m an old-fashioned existentialist in some ways: existence precedes essence, and I\u2019ll fight anyone who says different.\u201d It takes work, the books tell us, to become a heroine: strenuous effort, constant attention to the world, a willingness to peel back the layers of your own heart.</p> <p>But of course she is also not ordinary, because she has in her possession a compass-like device that can tell the truth, one of the loveliest inventions of children\u2019s fiction, alongside Tolkien\u2019s ring and Rowling\u2019s pensieve: an alethiometer (from the Greek <em>aletheia</em>, truth). Her ability to read it gives her, in the world of the book, an extraordinary authority that most children are denied. She is able to transcend that one factor of childhood that I found hardest to bear: the sense of disfranchisement from a world that extends so far beyond your understanding as to be painfully opaque. I read with a fierce hunger to see the world; I hated, above everything, not understanding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638a4d0728cf7198cb29c0abd9efec39efa850a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638a4d0728cf7198cb29c0abd9efec39efa850a6/171_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lyra with her daemon Pantalaimon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It takes work to be a heroine\u2019 \u2026 Lyra with her daemon Pantalaimon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think a true hero or heroine needs to have both something we want or covet (for instance, a princedom in Denmark; a fairy godmother) and something that we are (tormented by our own uncertainties; transformable). Lyra has both in Pantalaimon. The daemons \u2013 animal manifestations of the human soul \u2013 are the reason the books pulse with life: they have, after all, twice the usual amount of life in them. I am often asked, by children I meet at school visits or book festivals, what would be my daemon? It became to a whole generation of readers a kind of taxonomy of self-definition (I think mine would be something that seeks to be up high: a squirrel, or a bird of the less glossy kind. Be wary of people who say \u201ca leopard\u201d: they do not know themselves.)</p> <p>The thing I wanted most, though, changed over the course of the books. By <em>The Amber Spyglass</em>, the final book in the trilogy, what I wanted was not the alethiometer, nor even a daemon, but the love. Lyra falls in love with Will Parry, and finds herself stunned. Their love is physically felt: \u201cI want to kiss you and lie down with you and wake up with you every day of my life till I die.\u201d Sexuality, and the adult love that comes with it, is in Pullman\u2019s world something to cherish: something, seen in its true light, more astonishing and surprising even than riding over snow on an armoured bear. Pullman said in an interview a few years ago that, if the book is a version of <em>Paradise Lost</em>, \u201cwhat I wanted to do was represent the fall as entirely good. It is good for people to know things, to grow up, to become sexual beings.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/28/dafne-keen-his-dark-materials-lyra-bbc-philip-pullman\">Dafne Keen of His Dark Materials: 'Lyra taught me to not follow rules'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And Lyra\u2019s love allows her a different kind of seeing: it is the transformative vision of her love that allows her \u2013 without giving away the plot \u2013 to save Pullman\u2019s world. That is, perhaps, the final reason Lyra has been so loved: she is in part Pullman\u2019s longhand philosophical proof of an argument at the heart of all three books of the trilogy: notice. Lyra and Pan\u2019s eyes are everywhere. She is curious above everything. It is the core demand of the books: pay loving attention to the world. We owe the world our ferocious attention, to fail at that would be the true fall.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been writing children\u2019s books for more than a decade now; when I go to speak at schools, irrespective of country, the children\u2019s questions are often the same. (\u201cWhere do you get your ideas from? Do you ever get stuck? How much money do you make? Do you write with a pen?\u201d These all seem entirely fair questions to me, and in fact are what I long to ask other writers.) But recently at a festival in Italy, I met a more than usually philosophical group of 12 year olds. They asked: \u201cWhat is the colour of happiness?\u201d and \u201cWhat one thing would you change about your life?\u201d \u2013 like being interviewed by a gang of small, glitterpen wielding Kierkegaards. The last question was, \u201cWhat is it you are trying to do when you write?\u201d and I thought of <em>His Dark Materials</em>. As a child those books felt to me like food. So what I am trying to do is informed profoundly by that: I want to build stories that feel like nourishment. <em>His Dark Materials</em> stands as a testament to what children\u2019s books can be: three books that add up to a feast.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000b1v0\" title=\"\">His Dark Materials</a> begins on BBC1 at 8pm on 3 November. Katherine Rundell\u2019s most recent book for children, The Good Thieves (Bloomsbury), is out now.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 November 2019. An earlier version stated incorrectly that Philip Pullman had \u201cinvented\u201d the name Lyra. The text has been changed to clarify that his books have helped popularise the name.</p>",

The books had a rough-textured animal-breath closeness that I had rarely encountered before, and at the heart of that was a small child, swift witted and loose handed with the truth, throwing mud at rival children, and her soul companion, her daemon Pantalaimon. I decided there and then, with all acknowledgements to the glory and joy of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, of Sophie in Diana Wynne Jones\u2019s Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, of Malorie Blackman\u2019s Sephy Hadley in Noughts &amp; Crosses and of Roald Dahl\u2019s Matilda, that the greatest heroine in British children\u2019s books was Lyra. There is good evidence that many people of my generation felt the same. Pullman now shares with Shakespeare, Jonathan Swift and Philip Sidney the distinction of having popularised an English-language name that is now part of the lexicon. We owe the name Vanessa to Swift, who gave it as a piglatinish nickname to his lover Esther (Esse for short) Vanhomrigh, and Pamela (pronounced, originally, Pameela) to Sidney. Shakespeare has at least two; the first sighting we have of Miranda (from mirandus, meaning wonderful) is The Tempest, and Jessica, probably in an Anglicisation of the Old Testament Hebrew name Iscah, first appears in English in The Merchant of Venice. And last year, 362 new Lyras were born. The name came, originally, from a misunderstanding. Pullman told the New Yorker: \u201cThere was a hymn I particularly liked called \u2018Jesus Christ Is Risen Today, Alleluia\u2019 \u2026 And under the number of the hymn, printed in small italics, was usually the name of the author. In this case, the name there was Lyra Davidica.\u201d It was, he thought, a good name. \u201cIn fact, what Lyra Davidica means is the \u2018harp of David\u2019. \u2018Lyra\u2019 is a Greek word for a musical instrument like a harp.\u201d Where did Lyra herself come from? She has, I think, DNA from many places: from the tricksters in old English ballads, from William Brown and his Outlaws, from the orphaned Cinderella (not the Disney one; the versions from the 17th and 18th centuries, who had wit and guile and an edge of ruthlessness on their side. In Giambattista Basile\u2019s La Gatta Cenerentola, Zezolla murders her stepmother by chopping off her head with the lid of a trunk.) Pullman told me: \u201cLyra just came to me as she was. I didn\u2019t change a bit, or alter anything to her advantage. Having taught in middle schools for 12 years or so, I was well aware that there was a Lyra in every class. The point I always make, when asked about it, is that Lyra is not special. She\u2019s ordinary, not to say common. But it\u2019s the qualities she shares with so many real girls that help her when she finds herself in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d So Lyra is in some ways utterly commonplace: solid legged, dirty nailed, a liar without much concern about the consequences of her lies. That ordinariness is what makes her so vivid; despite the fact that the witches have a prophecy about her, she doesn\u2019t have, unlike Harry Potter, any particular magic: she has nothing in her that makes her uniquely suited for her task ahead. She is made, not born, a hero. As Pullman says, \u201cI\u2019m an old-fashioned existentialist in some ways: existence precedes essence, and I\u2019ll fight anyone who says different.\u201d It takes work, the books tell us, to become a heroine: strenuous effort, constant attention to the world, a willingness to peel back the layers of your own heart. But of course she is also not ordinary, because she has in her possession a compass-like device that can tell the truth, one of the loveliest inventions of children\u2019s fiction, alongside Tolkien\u2019s ring and Rowling\u2019s pensieve: an alethiometer (from the Greek aletheia, truth). Her ability to read it gives her, in the world of the book, an extraordinary authority that most children are denied. She is able to transcend that one factor of childhood that I found hardest to bear: the sense of disfranchisement from a world that extends so far beyond your understanding as to be painfully opaque. I read with a fierce hunger to see the world; I hated, above everything, not understanding. I think a true hero or heroine needs to have both something we want or covet (for instance, a princedom in Denmark; a fairy godmother) and something that we are (tormented by our own uncertainties; transformable). Lyra has both in Pantalaimon. The daemons \u2013 animal manifestations of the human soul \u2013 are the reason the books pulse with life: they have, after all, twice the usual amount of life in them. I am often asked, by children I meet at school visits or book festivals, what would be my daemon? It became to a whole generation of readers a kind of taxonomy of self-definition (I think mine would be something that seeks to be up high: a squirrel, or a bird of the less glossy kind. Be wary of people who say \u201ca leopard\u201d: they do not know themselves.) The thing I wanted most, though, changed over the course of the books. By The Amber Spyglass, the final book in the trilogy, what I wanted was not the alethiometer, nor even a daemon, but the love. Lyra falls in love with Will Parry, and finds herself stunned. Their love is physically felt: \u201cI want to kiss you and lie down with you and wake up with you every day of my life till I die.\u201d Sexuality, and the adult love that comes with it, is in Pullman\u2019s world something to cherish: something, seen in its true light, more astonishing and surprising even than riding over snow on an armoured bear. Pullman said in an interview a few years ago that, if the book is a version of Paradise Lost, \u201cwhat I wanted to do was represent the fall as entirely good. It is good for people to know things, to grow up, to become sexual beings.\u201d And Lyra\u2019s love allows her a different kind of seeing: it is the transformative vision of her love that allows her \u2013 without giving away the plot \u2013 to save Pullman\u2019s world. That is, perhaps, the final reason Lyra has been so loved: she is in part Pullman\u2019s longhand philosophical proof of an argument at the heart of all three books of the trilogy: notice. Lyra and Pan\u2019s eyes are everywhere. She is curious above everything. It is the core demand of the books: pay loving attention to the world. We owe the world our ferocious attention, to fail at that would be the true fall. I\u2019ve been writing children\u2019s books for more than a decade now; when I go to speak at schools, irrespective of country, the children\u2019s questions are often the same. (\u201cWhere do you get your ideas from? Do you ever get stuck? How much money do you make? Do you write with a pen?\u201d These all seem entirely fair questions to me, and in fact are what I long to ask other writers.) But recently at a festival in Italy, I met a more than usually philosophical group of 12 year olds. They asked: \u201cWhat is the colour of happiness?\u201d and \u201cWhat one thing would you change about your life?\u201d \u2013 like being interviewed by a gang of small, glitterpen wielding Kierkegaards. The last question was, \u201cWhat is it you are trying to do when you write?\u201d and I thought of His Dark Materials. As a child those books felt to me like food. So what I am trying to do is informed profoundly by that: I want to build stories that feel like nourishment. His Dark Materials stands as a testament to what children\u2019s books can be: three books that add up to a feast. \u2022 His Dark Materials begins on BBC1 at 8pm on 3 November. Katherine Rundell\u2019s most recent book for children, The Good Thieves (Bloomsbury), is out now. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November 2019. An earlier version stated incorrectly that Philip Pullman had \u201cinvented\u201d the name Lyra. The text has been changed to clarify that his books have helped popularise the name.",

He has always had the ability to turn teams around and has a clear vision of how the game should be played. It may not be attractive to some, but for him it is all about winning.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/30/south-africa-expect-brains-as-well-as-brawn-from-england-in-final\">South Africa expect brains as well as brawn from England in final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Erasmus\u2019s personable demeanour and his candour when answering questions disguise his fierce will to win. An error-ridden four minutes against New Zealand on the opening weekend here cost South Africa two tries and the match. The lapse still irks him and, while the manner of England\u2019s victory over New Zealand has made them odds-on favourites, Erasmus has not accepted the status of underdog.</p> <p>He expects to win and he will have a plan not only to thwart the menace of Curry and Underhill at the breakdown but to stop the Vunipola brothers and Kyle Sinckler before they are able to generate momentum. His biggest task will be to stop Itoje disrupting the most efficient lineout in the tournament and the subsequent driving maul. South Africa will come for England as Eddie Jones\u2019s men came for New Zealand.</p> <p>\u201cThe All Blacks played the way England wanted them to,\u201d says the former South Africa centre and Saracens director of rugby, Brendan Venter. \u201cEngland play like Saracens, who want their opponents to play and dominate by putting them under defensive pressure. New Zealand kept playing, but South Africa don\u2019t and won\u2019t. There will be no energy in defence for England and the final will be a different game. When South Africa get into a dogfight, they can win it.\u201d</p> <p>There are common themes throughout Erasmus\u2019s reign: South Africa kick more than their opponents, pass and offload far less and make many more tackles. They also tend to concede the greater number of penalties and if they are to beat England, their discipline, an area that made what should have been a comfortable victory over Wales close, must improve.</p>",

      "bodyText": "South Africa may not indulge in much Rassie\u2011dazzle, but they have recovered the winning formula after two years in which they suffered a number of humiliating defeats. It is based on an uncomplicated gameplan in which they look at their best when the opposition have the ball and get knocked back by a gang of bruising forwards. When Rassie Erasmus took over as head coach at the beginning of last year, he pledged to make South Africa look like South Africa again, physical and strong in the set pieces, and he has been true to his word. Anyone expecting England to turn up in the World Cup final and win the trophy for the second time by taking on where they left off against New Zealand may not enjoy what they see. The All Blacks set out to take the game to England and did not abandon the strategy even after conceding an early try and falling further behind on the scoreboard. They kept trying to play from deep but made no headway and when they did get back into the match with a try in the second half, what looked like an England overthrow at the lineout was caused by Kieran Read leaning on Tom Curry and preventing him from lifting Maro Itoje. South Africa will let England come at them, using their half-backs to kick the ball downfield and only running from their own half if they feel they can counterattack through the pace of their back three. No team defend the gainline with such grim determination and by including a tight-five unit on the bench, Erasmus is able to sustain the physical onslaught for 80 minutes. No one has gone through South Africa yet and England will have to find ways of going around them, one reason for the inclusion of George Ford at fly-half. Japan were the most free-running team in the tournament but the only joy they had against the Springboks was from kicks, with wave after wave of attacks snuffed out. Under Erasmus, South Africa may be physically uncompromising and care not a jot about entertaining the crowd, but they are tactically astute. They reached the final after defeating two very different teams in the knockout stages, Japan and Wales, and they did so by taking them on at their strongest points. Japan kept the ball alive at every opportunity and deployed runners from deep but, with Faf de Klerk lurking behind the lines, they struggled to make ground and their average carry was little more than two metres. South Africa have throughout the tournament tended to kick more than their opponents, even against Italy, and with England having two opensides in the back row, Curry and Sam Underhill, they will again minimise the risk of being turned over. The Springboks exposed the inflexibility of Japan, a side that for all their skill and flair are overly reliant on coaching, and they made Wales go off script by taking their defence out of the game. South Africa kicked almost as often as they passed, forcing opponents to change their half-backs in the third quarter and become more adventurous. South Africa may be attempting to become the first side to win the World Cup having lost a match at the group stage, but they are not in the final by default. Before Erasmus\u2019s arrival, they had, with a couple of exceptions, become so uncompetitive against New Zealand that the All Blacks captain, Read, said last year that the fixture had lost its rivalry. A couple of days later, South Africa won in Wellington, their first victory on New Zealand soil for nine years, and showed it was no fluke by drawing there this July. A glance at the statistics for last year\u2019s Wellington match would suggest a runaway New Zealand victory: they had 75% possession and 79% territory, made 257 passes to 64, covered four times as much ground and attempted 73 tackles to their opponents\u2019 274. They scored six tries but, despite having little ball, South Africa scavenged five. New Zealand won the return match in Pretoria three weeks later by overcoming a 12-point deficit in the final five minutes, having again dominated territory and possession but struggling to break down a defence that gave no ground around the fringes. The All Blacks at times exposed the narrowness of the Springboks\u2019 defence, as England will look to do, but they were more often intercepted or turned over. Robbie Fleck, the Stormers coach and a former Springbok teammate of Erasmus, is not surprised at how quickly South Africa have recovered. \u201cRassie has the mindset of a fighter who never gives up,\u201d he says. \u201cHe is massively competitive and has the respect of his players. He has always had the ability to turn teams around and has a clear vision of how the game should be played. It may not be attractive to some, but for him it is all about winning.\u201d Erasmus\u2019s personable demeanour and his candour when answering questions disguise his fierce will to win. An error-ridden four minutes against New Zealand on the opening weekend here cost South Africa two tries and the match. The lapse still irks him and, while the manner of England\u2019s victory over New Zealand has made them odds-on favourites, Erasmus has not accepted the status of underdog. He expects to win and he will have a plan not only to thwart the menace of Curry and Underhill at the breakdown but to stop the Vunipola brothers and Kyle Sinckler before they are able to generate momentum. His biggest task will be to stop Itoje disrupting the most efficient lineout in the tournament and the subsequent driving maul. South Africa will come for England as Eddie Jones\u2019s men came for New Zealand. \u201cThe All Blacks played the way England wanted them to,\u201d says the former South Africa centre and Saracens director of rugby, Brendan Venter. \u201cEngland play like Saracens, who want their opponents to play and dominate by putting them under defensive pressure. New Zealand kept playing, but South Africa don\u2019t and won\u2019t. There will be no energy in defence for England and the final will be a different game. When South Africa get into a dogfight, they can win it.\u201d There are common themes throughout Erasmus\u2019s reign: South Africa kick more than their opponents, pass and offload far less and make many more tackles. They also tend to concede the greater number of penalties and if they are to beat England, their discipline, an area that made what should have been a comfortable victory over Wales close, must improve.",

Since her 2017 debut, the slowburn Lovers, she has flexed her creative muscles, collaborating with the likes of Tyler, the Creator and Rejjie Snow, while also finding time to record her second album of pillow-soft pop, Dream Girl. <br><em><a href=\"https://heaven-live.co.uk/event/anna-of-the-north/\">Heaven, WC2, Wednesday 6 November</a></em></p> <h2>Burna Boy</h2> <p>Earlier this year, Nigerian Afro-fusion pioneer Burna Boy was so enraged by what he perceived to be a lowly placement on the lineup for Coachella he vented his fury on social media, referring to himself as an African Giant. That title now adorns his new album, his first to break the UK Top 20. He will be keen to prove himself further at these UK dates. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.onaspaceship.com/\">London, Sunday 3; Manchester, Wednesday 6; touring to 10 November</a></em></p> <h2>Deerhunter</h2> <p>Bradford Cox and his band of merry-ish men head out on tour in support of their eighth album, Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?, a rejection of nostalgia in the face of very grim reality. While musically it continues their pop phase (relatively speaking), Cox\u2019s lyrics are as bleak as ever. <br><em><a href=\"https://deerhuntermusic.com/\">Dublin, Saturday 2; Roundhouse, NW1, Sunday 3; Brighton, Monday 4; Bristol, Tuesday 4; Manchester, Wednesday 6; Digbeth, Thursday 7 November</a></em></p> <h2>Lizzo</h2> <p>The breakout star of 2019 \u2013 even if her recent US No 1, Truth Hurts, was first released in 2017, and her new single, Good as Hell, made a small dent in 2016 \u2013 Lizzo arrives in the UK following a summer of festival-owning sets.

Abrahamsen\u2019s tenure begins with three days of events, comprising a Q&amp;A with the composer (Wed) and a pair of concerts: a lunchtime programme including two chamber works for wind instruments, and a performance with the Academy Manson Ensemble conducted by Ryan Wigglesworth featuring ensemble works Winternacht, M\u00e4rchenbilder and Wald. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.ram.ac.uk/about-us/staff/hans-abrahamsen\">Royal Academy of Music, NW1, Wednesday 6 to Friday 8 November</a></em></p> <h2>Sound and Fury</h2> <p>The Scottish Chamber Orchestra has a new composer-in-association, the British-born, US-resident Anna Clyne. Her three-year term is launched with a world premiere, Sound and Fury, inspired by the source of the title, Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, and by Haydn\u2019s 60th Symphony, nicknamed \u201cIl Distratto\u201d. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.sco.org.uk/whats-on/1570-mozart-haydn-and-clyne\">The Queen\u2019s Hall, Edinburgh, Thursday 7; City Halls, Glasgow, Friday 8 November</a></em></p> <h2>Philip Grange</h2> <p>The BBC Philharmonic certainly does its bit for composers from the north of England. Its latest commission is a violin concerto from Grange (professor of music at Manchester University), whose dark-hued music is always distinctive. The premiere of the concerto forms the centrepiece of the BBC Phil\u2019s concert under Ben Gernon. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e84mzc\">The Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Saturday 2 November</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ac2c81f8794231d740c8c9e890132f846174d0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ac2c81f8794231d740c8c9e890132f846174d0d/0_16_2400_3284/731.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Staff\u2019s Prince\u2019s Chain.\" width=\"731\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Staff\u2019s Prince\u2019s Chain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Serpentine Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hayley Newman</h2> <p>In our time of meaningless rhetoric, insults that poison cyberspace and endless antagonistic debate, Newman\u2019s exhibition Tongue-tied explores the absurdities of speech and the attractions of silence.

That is one of the perspective-shifting questions asked in this futuristic installation, which turns a former gunpowder store into a biomorphic system of tubes and vents.

C\u00e9zanne is the godfather of all truly modern art. This small but intense exhibition reveals how he took visible appearances apart until the theme of his nudes and mountains becomes perception itself. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/upcomingexhibitions/cezanneatthewhitworth/\">The Whitworth, Manchester, to 1 March</a></em></p> <h2>Buddhism</h2> <p>Buddhist art has a 2,600-year history and ranges from expressive faces and sublime figures to such abstract monuments as stupa domes. A key phase in its development took place in ancient Afghanistan where classical Greek influences met Asian philosophy to shape a graceful, eloquent concept of art. This show looks at the global history of Buddhism and its images, with special emphasis on manuscripts in the Library\u2019s collection. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/events/buddhism\">British Library, NW1, to 23 February</a></em></p> <h2>Birth</h2> <p>Tracey Emin\u2019s drawings of birth are dark expressionist nightmares. She contributes to this show along with Paula Rego, Boo Saville, Madeline Donahue and many more. Male artists often tend to pass over birth itself, preferring to paint smiling Madonnas looking after chubby babies to depicting the physical experience of bringing a child into the world.

The book is written by Julian \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d Fellowes and this is directed by Richard Eyre, with choreography from Matthew Bourne. Zizi Strallen will play Mary, and Petula Clarke, at the tender age of 86, will be feeding the birds. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.princeedwardtheatre.co.uk/\">Prince Edward Theatre, W1, to 3 May</a></em></p> <h2>Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran</h2> <p>This Fringe First-winning show lands in Manchester. Co-created by Javaad Alipoor and Kirsty Housley, it follows Alipoor\u2019s hit show The Believers Are But Brothers, offering a high-energy ride through the champagne-soaked, social-media-obsessed lives of the Iranian elite. The production is a little rough around the edges but there\u2019s something in its chaotic thrust that feels horribly pertinent. <br><em><a href=\"https://homemcr.org/production/rich-kids-tehran/\">HOME, Manchester, Saturday 2 November</a></em></p> <h2>Deep Night, Dark Night</h2> <p>The candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse \u2013 a stunning, almost spiritual venue \u2013 will host a series of spooky tales for Halloween and beyond. Taking Shakespeare\u2019s work as inspiration, writers including Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, Sami Ibrahim and Diana Evans will delve into London\u2019s dark past. The shows will be separated into two different bills, and the first programme is guaranteed to feature a story from (yes!) Jeanette Winterson.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Sorry We Missed You (15) (Ken Loach, 2019, UK) 101 mins Well into his 80s, Ken Loach is still pumping out strident social-issue fables. Austerity and the gig economy has given Loach new material. He follows I, Daniel Blake with this agonising study of a delivery driver (played by Kris Hitchen) whose life descends into a vicious circle of self-destruction as he struggles to make ends meet. Doctor Sleep (15) (Mike Flanagan, 2019, US) 152 mins Ewan McGregor stars in this film adapted from Stephen King\u2019s follow-up novel to The Shining. McGregor is Danny Torrance, the son of Jack Nicholson\u2019s Jack Torrance (who freezes to death in the Kubrick film). Torrance Jr, of course, has psychic powers (\u201cthe shining\u201d) and has to see off a cult, the True Knot led by Rebecca Ferguson, who feed on kids with these abilities. Brittany Runs a Marathon (15) (Paul Downs Colaizzo, 2019, US) 104 mins Jillian Bell makes a bid to become the new Melissa McCarthy with her breakout performance in this indie comedy that made a splash at Sundance, before being picked up by Amazon. Bell plays a hedonistic party girl who decides to get in shape for the New York marathon; as she gets fitter physically her life changes in ways she is not entirely happy with. Monos (15) (Alejandro Landes, 2019, Col/Arg/Neth/Ger et al) 102 mins Gruelling drama of teen soldiers on a mission in the Colombian jungle, part of a nameless faction in an unidentified civil war. Guarding an American prisoner, and kept in line by \u201cthe Messenger\u201d, the group disintegrates in Conrad-meets-Lord of the Flies style: brawling, sleeping with each other, and generally coming undone at the seams. Terminator: Dark Fate (15) (Tim Miller, 2019, US) 128 mins There is a lot riding on this: can the return of James Cameron (as a producer), Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger spark a revival in the underperforming man v machine franchise? Tim Miller, director of the smartmouth superhero flick Deadpool, has been installed in the director\u2019s chair \u2013 to not a whole lot of effect, it has to be said. With Natalia Reyes as the girl menaced by terminators from the future, and Mackenzie Davis as the fighter helping her, this attempt at a greatest-hits rerun never really hits the heights. AP Five of the best \u2026 rock &amp; pop Anna of the North Norway\u2019s Anna Lotterud, AKA Anna of the North, makes the kind of soothing, tactile electropop that Scandinavia still excels at. Since her 2017 debut, the slowburn Lovers, she has flexed her creative muscles, collaborating with the likes of Tyler, the Creator and Rejjie Snow, while also finding time to record her second album of pillow-soft pop, Dream Girl. Heaven, WC2, Wednesday 6 November Burna Boy Earlier this year, Nigerian Afro-fusion pioneer Burna Boy was so enraged by what he perceived to be a lowly placement on the lineup for Coachella he vented his fury on social media, referring to himself as an African Giant. That title now adorns his new album, his first to break the UK Top 20. He will be keen to prove himself further at these UK dates. London, Sunday 3; Manchester, Wednesday 6; touring to 10 November Deerhunter Bradford Cox and his band of merry-ish men head out on tour in support of their eighth album, Why Hasn\u2019t Everything Already Disappeared?, a rejection of nostalgia in the face of very grim reality. While musically it continues their pop phase (relatively speaking), Cox\u2019s lyrics are as bleak as ever. Dublin, Saturday 2; Roundhouse, NW1, Sunday 3; Brighton, Monday 4; Bristol, Tuesday 4; Manchester, Wednesday 6; Digbeth, Thursday 7 November Lizzo The breakout star of 2019 \u2013 even if her recent US No 1, Truth Hurts, was first released in 2017, and her new single, Good as Hell, made a small dent in 2016 \u2013 Lizzo arrives in the UK following a summer of festival-owning sets. Expect self-help mantras, sweat-tickling choreography and lashings of personality. O2 Academy Brixton, SW9, Wednesday 6 &amp; Thursday 7; O2 Academy Glasgow, Friday 8; touring to 11 November MC Snarky Puppy Popular New York jazz-funk collective Snarky Puppy will always groove your socks off, but on their new album, Immigrance, they temper their discordant instincts with catchy hooks and climactic jamming, as deceptively slow-burning arrangements radiate their own eloquent glow. Bournemouth, Wednesday 6; Nottingham, Thursday 7; Bristol, Friday 8 November JF Three of the best \u2026 classical concerts Hans Abrahamsen The Royal Academy has founded an annual residency in memory of Oliver Knussen, and the first composer to take on that role is the Dane Hans Abrahamsen, championed by Knussen as a conductor. Abrahamsen\u2019s tenure begins with three days of events, comprising a Q&amp;A with the composer (Wed) and a pair of concerts: a lunchtime programme including two chamber works for wind instruments, and a performance with the Academy Manson Ensemble conducted by Ryan Wigglesworth featuring ensemble works Winternacht, M\u00e4rchenbilder and Wald. Royal Academy of Music, NW1, Wednesday 6 to Friday 8 November Sound and Fury The Scottish Chamber Orchestra has a new composer-in-association, the British-born, US-resident Anna Clyne. Her three-year term is launched with a world premiere, Sound and Fury, inspired by the source of the title, Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, and by Haydn\u2019s 60th Symphony, nicknamed \u201cIl Distratto\u201d. The Queen\u2019s Hall, Edinburgh, Thursday 7; City Halls, Glasgow, Friday 8 November Philip Grange The BBC Philharmonic certainly does its bit for composers from the north of England. Its latest commission is a violin concerto from Grange (professor of music at Manchester University), whose dark-hued music is always distinctive. The premiere of the concerto forms the centrepiece of the BBC Phil\u2019s concert under Ben Gernon. The Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Saturday 2 November AC Five of the best \u2026 exhibitions Hayley Newman In our time of meaningless rhetoric, insults that poison cyberspace and endless antagonistic debate, Newman\u2019s exhibition Tongue-tied explores the absurdities of speech and the attractions of silence. Newman is best known as a performance artist but here shows drawings, watercolours and other works that speak for this dumb age. Matt\u2019s Gallery, SE16, Saturday 9 to 24 November Patrick Staff What would life be like on Venus, an intensely hot planet with no oxygen? That is one of the perspective-shifting questions asked in this futuristic installation, which turns a former gunpowder store into a biomorphic system of tubes and vents. Engravings and video haunt this uncanny architecture exploring queer and transgender identity. Serpentine Sackler Gallery, W2, Friday 8 November to 9 February C\u00e9zanne A bequest from the late art dealer Karsten Schubert has given the Whitworth a superb collection of works on paper by the isolated, self-questioning genius who inspired Picasso and Braque to invent Cubism. C\u00e9zanne is the godfather of all truly modern art. This small but intense exhibition reveals how he took visible appearances apart until the theme of his nudes and mountains becomes perception itself. The Whitworth, Manchester, to 1 March Buddhism Buddhist art has a 2,600-year history and ranges from expressive faces and sublime figures to such abstract monuments as stupa domes. A key phase in its development took place in ancient Afghanistan where classical Greek influences met Asian philosophy to shape a graceful, eloquent concept of art. This show looks at the global history of Buddhism and its images, with special emphasis on manuscripts in the Library\u2019s collection. British Library, NW1, to 23 February Birth Tracey Emin\u2019s drawings of birth are dark expressionist nightmares. She contributes to this show along with Paula Rego, Boo Saville, Madeline Donahue and many more. Male artists often tend to pass over birth itself, preferring to paint smiling Madonnas looking after chubby babies to depicting the physical experience of bringing a child into the world. That gets ample correction here. Last chance to see. TJ Boulting Gallery, W1, to 9 November JJ Five of the best \u2026 theatre shows Death of a Salesman Angels in America director Marianne Elliott continues her purple streak of hit theatre shows with a stunning remake of Arthur Miller\u2019s iconic play, co-directed with Miranda Cromwell, starring Wendell Pierce (The Wire, Treme) as Willy Loman and Sharon D Clarke (Caroline, Or Change) as his wife. The cast is uniformly brilliant but it is Clarke\u2019s final lines, and broken singing, that will really move you. Piccadilly Theatre, W1, to 4 January Mary Poppins A spoonful of sugar in these troubled times, Mary Poppins swoops back into the West End following a UK tour. The book is written by Julian \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d Fellowes and this is directed by Richard Eyre, with choreography from Matthew Bourne. Zizi Strallen will play Mary, and Petula Clarke, at the tender age of 86, will be feeding the birds. Prince Edward Theatre, W1, to 3 May Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran This Fringe First-winning show lands in Manchester. Co-created by Javaad Alipoor and Kirsty Housley, it follows Alipoor\u2019s hit show The Believers Are But Brothers, offering a high-energy ride through the champagne-soaked, social-media-obsessed lives of the Iranian elite. The production is a little rough around the edges but there\u2019s something in its chaotic thrust that feels horribly pertinent. HOME, Manchester, Saturday 2 November Deep Night, Dark Night The candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse \u2013 a stunning, almost spiritual venue \u2013 will host a series of spooky tales for Halloween and beyond. Taking Shakespeare\u2019s work as inspiration, writers including Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, Sami Ibrahim and Diana Evans will delve into London\u2019s dark past. The shows will be separated into two different bills, and the first programme is guaranteed to feature a story from (yes!) Jeanette Winterson. Suitable for ages 12 and upwards. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe: Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, SE1, to 5 December Ghost Quartet Soho\u2019s brand new Boulevard Theatre has a revolving stage and, more surprisingly, revolving balconies. The venue\u2019s first show is a musical about love, loss and spectres from Dave Malloy, writer of Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812. The director is Bill Buckhurst, who was behind the small-scale production of Sweeney Todd, which started out in a London pie shop and wound up in New York. Boulevard Theatre, W1, to 4 January MG Three of the best \u2026 dance shows Lady Magma: The Birth of a Cult Probably the most exciting young choreographer in UK dance right now, Belfast-based Oona Doherty\u2019s acclaimed works Hope Hunt and Hard to Be Soft focused on the foibles of the working-class male. Her latest, Lady Magma, turns its attention to women, in a 70s-infused paean to wild femininity and ecstatic Dionysian ritual. The MAC, Belfast, Saturday 2 November Acosta Danza Carlos Acosta\u2019s Havana-based company returns to the UK in Christopher Bruce\u2019s Rooster, set to music by the Rolling Stones. New works by Swedish choreographer Pontus Lidberg and upcoming Cuban Ra\u00fal Reinoso, plus Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui\u2019s seductive Faun, complete the programme. Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, Saturday 2 November Igor &amp; Moreno: Beat This duo first grabbed our attention with a delightfully minimal duet, Idiot-Syncrasy, featuring the two dancers jumping up and down on the spot. Beat has a similarly stark proposition: one DJ, one dancer and a metaphor about the optimism and disappointment of the millennial generation.

      "bodyText": "Only one trainer on either side of the Atlantic has had more runners at the Breeders\u2019 Cup than Aidan O\u2019Brien over the years, and the Irishman has had his share of good luck and bad. But he will head into this year\u2019s edition on Friday having suffered a series of setbacks before a single runner has even seen a starting stall. Magical, his obvious team leader, was ruled out a few days ago and Monday\u2019s draw was also unkind to many of his entries, leaving Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner, as possibly his best chance of a 13th Breeders\u2019 Cup winner this weekend. It is now well over three years since a Derby winner won a subsequent race, and Anthony Van Dyck has come up short in three starts since his narrow success at Epsom in early June. He has disappointed only once, however, when second-last in the King George at Ascot, and steady support for Anthony Van Dyck has forced his price down to 5-2 for the Turf on Saturday. \u201cHe only had one little blip and that was in bad ground in the King George and I shouldn\u2019t have run him,\u201d O\u2019Brien said here on Thursday. \u201cAll his other form is excellent and we\u2019ve been delighted with him since [the Derby]. He had a great run in the Irish Champion and we\u2019d have run in the Arc if the ground had been nice but it wasn\u2019t, so we stayed [at home] and did a piece of work at Dundalk. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to it. The trip, ground, track, draw, everything looks right for him.\u201d Circus Maximus, the favourite for Saturday\u2019s Mile despite a wide draw in stall nine, is another big contender for Ballydoyle this weekend, but O\u2019Brien\u2019s team leader on Friday faces a huge task from the widest stall of all. Arizona, the runner-up to the brilliant Pinatubo in the Dewhurst Stakes last time, is the best horse in the Juvenile Turf by some distance on ratings but he is out in stall 12 in a race that is quickly on the turn on Santa Anita\u2019s tight turf course. \u201cObviously things have to fall a little bit more in your favour when you\u2019re out there,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s in very good form, we\u2019ve always thought that he\u2019d love fast ground and he\u2019s never had it until now, so that will help him.\u201d Friday\u2019s best bets The first British Group One race to be run on a synthetic track is the feature event of the domestic action on Friday and while the Vertem Futurity is only at Newcastle because last weekend\u2019s meeting at Doncaster was abandoned, it is a better and deeper race as a result.

      "body": "<h2><strong>10. Barbarella (1968)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Nothing established Fonda all over the world more resoundingly than her leading role in this bizarre, kitsch sci-fi extravaganza, adapted by Terry Southern from the risque comic-book series and directed by Fonda\u2019s then-husband, Roger Vadim. In France, it made her a sex-symbol to rival Bardot, and her stunning beauty and style achieve something almost extraterrestrial here. She plays Barbarella, an intrepid space adventurer who is entrusted with a vital intergalactic mission by the president of Earth, which involves nursing a blind angel on a distant planet by having sex with him. Fonda carries it off with dedication and style.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3634dc91c30894e4058f17f0a0d2a12f32aacdb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3634dc91c30894e4058f17f0a0d2a12f32aacdb/65_146_2738_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbarella \u2026 established her as a global star.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbarella \u2026 established her as a global star.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>9. Fun With Dick and Jane (1977)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>This satire is, in some ways, a companion piece to her 1967 comedy Barefoot in the Park. It\u2019s a critique of the American dream, which mockingly distorts the picture-book perfection of family life portrayed in the well-known Dick and Jane children\u2019s books, which taught generations of Americans how to read while also perhaps schooling them in conformist attitudes. Dick and Jane are played by George Segal and Fonda, a well-off couple in a lovely home who turn to crime when he becomes unemployed. The film manages to be a spin on Bonnie and Clyde while also playing on Fonda\u2019s own radical image. She has a bizarre broad-comedy scene in which she falls over while doing some amateur fashion modelling in a hotel dining room, causing mayhem.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/26/jane-fonda-accepts-bafta-during-climate-arrest\">Jane Fonda accepts Bafta award during arrest at climate protest</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>8. Youth (2015)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>This extraordinary cameo, hardly more than a few minutes of screen time, is destined to become one of Fonda\u2019s most cult performances. She plays Brenda Morel, a renowned, difficult, ageing movie actor. (There\u2019s a PhD to be written on how older female stars only get his kind of self-parodic role in films.) She furiously berates a director (Harvey Keitel) who is trying to cast her in his new film, and, in an extraordinary scene on an aeroplane, we see her succumb to a full-scale temper tantrum that involves her screaming: \u201cYou fucking bitches!\u201d and hitting a flight attendant before having a catastrophic hairpiece malfunction.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. Barefo</strong><strong>ot in the Park (1967)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Neil Simon adapted his Broadway hit for this movie, which was a key moment in Fonda\u2019s early success during the run of frothy metropolitan comedies that made her name. It\u2019s easy to forget how excellent she was \u2013 and is \u2013 playing comedy, with a droll lilt to her line readings; she puts the free-spirited zing into this movie, which was clearly conscious of being a bit squaresville for its day. She is Corie, a newlywed (that very dated notion) married to super-handsome but conventional Paul (played by Robert Redford, one of the few Hollywood men who could match Fonda for beauty) and yearning for him to loosen up and go frolicking in the park barefoot (a signifier for further bareness?).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4ebbad41f17c1b76f2241d7a69be9f7e991f01d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4ebbad41f17c1b76f2241d7a69be9f7e991f01d/0_89_3228_1937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Sarrazin with Fonda in They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Sarrazin with Fonda in They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6. They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They? (1969)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Fonda became a star to take seriously in this shocking movie about the Great Depression directed by Sydney Pollack. It\u2019s a grim metaphor for the exploitation and suffering of working people, and can be seen as a forerunner of our obsession with reality TV and social-media cruelty. The setting is a dance marathon in the 1930s, in which poverty-stricken people pair up to dance for days on end \u2013 stumbling around like miserable zombies in front of a jaded and sadistic audience \u2013 hoping to be the last couple standing for a big cash prize. Fonda plays Gloria, apparently the most cynical and ruthless contestant in the running, but dealing with an inner hurt.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. California Suite (1978)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Neil Simon gave Fonda another great comic role in this bittersweet portmanteau movie, in which she plays a tough New York professional who flies into Los Angeles on a mission to confront her screenwriter ex-husband (Alan Alda) because their teenage daughter wants to live with him, not her. She has a great confrontation scene with Alda, simmering with contempt, hauteur and a strange unresolved attraction for her ex. The film is often noted for the fact that Fonda looks sensational in a bikini \u2013 this was the seed for her bestselling workout videos. She also looks great in glasses.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Letter to Jane (1972)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>This 50-minute film essay about a famous news photo of Fonda meeting Vietnamese communists in Hanoi in 1972 is directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. It was originally intended as an archly ironic postscript to Godard\u2019s film Tout Va Bien, which also came out that year (and in which Fonda acted, but fell out with the director). Letter to Jane is simply a deconstructionist essay/harangue, narrated by Godard and Gorin, critiquing the photo of Fonda, and also US leftism and Hollywood stardom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1ff5182d4c678204524dfbc3256aaf936a8ea95\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1ff5182d4c678204524dfbc3256aaf936a8ea95/152_44_3456_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fonda with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton in Nine to Five.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fonda with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton in Nine to Five.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3. Nine to Five (1980)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Fonda had that rare thing, a female co-star billing in this smart feminist workplace comedy, in which she plays Judy, who has to get a job in a huge corporate office after her husband runs off with another woman. Like her co-workers Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, she is oppressed, harassed and exploited by her unspeakable male boss. This is an interesting role for Fonda, who is not cast as the overtly funny character nor the explicitly sexy one. Rather, she personifies a kind of benchmark normality. Yet there is something notably powerful and real in an opening scene in which she is yelled at because she doesn\u2019t know how to work a particular piece of equipment; a moment that crystallises her rage.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Coming Home (1978)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>This is one of Fonda\u2019s most courageous and heartfelt performances, which won her a second Oscar. It is also tied up with her activities as anti-Vietnam war campaigner. She plays the wife of a US Marine Corps officer (Bruce Dern) who leaves for service in Vietnam. Left behind, she finds volunteer work in a veterans\u2019 hospital and befriends a wheelchair user played by Jon Voight. They begin a relationship that culminates in a sex scene \u2013 notably forthright in its day \u2013 in which Fonda\u2019s character experiences the first orgasm of her life. It\u2019s a movie that was overshadowed by the more macho take offered by The Deer Hunter \u2013 but it\u2019s a fine performance from Fonda.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S4rxnjwFDg\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3S4rxnjwFDg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The trailer for Klute.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>1. Klute (1971)</strong><br></h2> \n<p>Here is the quintessential Fonda performance, in Alan J Pakula\u2019s psychological thriller: she is smart, beautiful, tough and haunted \u2013 in a film that, like Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Conversation, embodies a proto-Watergate fear of being spied upon. And Fonda provides a new spin on the classic \u201cshady lady\u201d figure that always shows up in noir movies. She is Bree Daniels, a would-be model and actor who is doing escort work to pay the bills. Donald Sutherland plays Klute, the private detective spying on her because a serial killer is on the loose, and she is in danger. Fonda\u2019s character is cool and reserved, having apparently mastered a kind of emotional numbness as part of the play-acting involved in her work, and part of her genuine alienation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "10. Barbarella (1968) Nothing established Fonda all over the world more resoundingly than her leading role in this bizarre, kitsch sci-fi extravaganza, adapted by Terry Southern from the risque comic-book series and directed by Fonda\u2019s then-husband, Roger Vadim. In France, it made her a sex-symbol to rival Bardot, and her stunning beauty and style achieve something almost extraterrestrial here. She plays Barbarella, an intrepid space adventurer who is entrusted with a vital intergalactic mission by the president of Earth, which involves nursing a blind angel on a distant planet by having sex with him. Fonda carries it off with dedication and style. 9. Fun With Dick and Jane (1977) This satire is, in some ways, a companion piece to her 1967 comedy Barefoot in the Park. It\u2019s a critique of the American dream, which mockingly distorts the picture-book perfection of family life portrayed in the well-known Dick and Jane children\u2019s books, which taught generations of Americans how to read while also perhaps schooling them in conformist attitudes. Dick and Jane are played by George Segal and Fonda, a well-off couple in a lovely home who turn to crime when he becomes unemployed. The film manages to be a spin on Bonnie and Clyde while also playing on Fonda\u2019s own radical image. She has a bizarre broad-comedy scene in which she falls over while doing some amateur fashion modelling in a hotel dining room, causing mayhem. 8. Youth (2015) This extraordinary cameo, hardly more than a few minutes of screen time, is destined to become one of Fonda\u2019s most cult performances. She plays Brenda Morel, a renowned, difficult, ageing movie actor. (There\u2019s a PhD to be written on how older female stars only get his kind of self-parodic role in films.) She furiously berates a director (Harvey Keitel) who is trying to cast her in his new film, and, in an extraordinary scene on an aeroplane, we see her succumb to a full-scale temper tantrum that involves her screaming: \u201cYou fucking bitches!\u201d and hitting a flight attendant before having a catastrophic hairpiece malfunction. 7. Barefoot in the Park (1967) Neil Simon adapted his Broadway hit for this movie, which was a key moment in Fonda\u2019s early success during the run of frothy metropolitan comedies that made her name. It\u2019s easy to forget how excellent she was \u2013 and is \u2013 playing comedy, with a droll lilt to her line readings; she puts the free-spirited zing into this movie, which was clearly conscious of being a bit squaresville for its day. She is Corie, a newlywed (that very dated notion) married to super-handsome but conventional Paul (played by Robert Redford, one of the few Hollywood men who could match Fonda for beauty) and yearning for him to loosen up and go frolicking in the park barefoot (a signifier for further bareness?). 6. They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They? (1969) Fonda became a star to take seriously in this shocking movie about the Great Depression directed by Sydney Pollack. It\u2019s a grim metaphor for the exploitation and suffering of working people, and can be seen as a forerunner of our obsession with reality TV and social-media cruelty. The setting is a dance marathon in the 1930s, in which poverty-stricken people pair up to dance for days on end \u2013 stumbling around like miserable zombies in front of a jaded and sadistic audience \u2013 hoping to be the last couple standing for a big cash prize. Fonda plays Gloria, apparently the most cynical and ruthless contestant in the running, but dealing with an inner hurt. 5. California Suite (1978) Neil Simon gave Fonda another great comic role in this bittersweet portmanteau movie, in which she plays a tough New York professional who flies into Los Angeles on a mission to confront her screenwriter ex-husband (Alan Alda) because their teenage daughter wants to live with him, not her. She has a great confrontation scene with Alda, simmering with contempt, hauteur and a strange unresolved attraction for her ex. The film is often noted for the fact that Fonda looks sensational in a bikini \u2013 this was the seed for her bestselling workout videos. She also looks great in glasses. 4. Letter to Jane (1972) This 50-minute film essay about a famous news photo of Fonda meeting Vietnamese communists in Hanoi in 1972 is directed by Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin. It was originally intended as an archly ironic postscript to Godard\u2019s film Tout Va Bien, which also came out that year (and in which Fonda acted, but fell out with the director). Letter to Jane is simply a deconstructionist essay/harangue, narrated by Godard and Gorin, critiquing the photo of Fonda, and also US leftism and Hollywood stardom. 3. Nine to Five (1980) Fonda had that rare thing, a female co-star billing in this smart feminist workplace comedy, in which she plays Judy, who has to get a job in a huge corporate office after her husband runs off with another woman. Like her co-workers Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, she is oppressed, harassed and exploited by her unspeakable male boss. This is an interesting role for Fonda, who is not cast as the overtly funny character nor the explicitly sexy one. Rather, she personifies a kind of benchmark normality. Yet there is something notably powerful and real in an opening scene in which she is yelled at because she doesn\u2019t know how to work a particular piece of equipment; a moment that crystallises her rage. 2. Coming Home (1978) This is one of Fonda\u2019s most courageous and heartfelt performances, which won her a second Oscar. It is also tied up with her activities as anti-Vietnam war campaigner. She plays the wife of a US Marine Corps officer (Bruce Dern) who leaves for service in Vietnam. Left behind, she finds volunteer work in a veterans\u2019 hospital and befriends a wheelchair user played by Jon Voight. They begin a relationship that culminates in a sex scene \u2013 notably forthright in its day \u2013 in which Fonda\u2019s character experiences the first orgasm of her life. It\u2019s a movie that was overshadowed by the more macho take offered by The Deer Hunter \u2013 but it\u2019s a fine performance from Fonda. 1. Klute (1971) Here is the quintessential Fonda performance, in Alan J Pakula\u2019s psychological thriller: she is smart, beautiful, tough and haunted \u2013 in a film that, like Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Conversation, embodies a proto-Watergate fear of being spied upon. And Fonda provides a new spin on the classic \u201cshady lady\u201d figure that always shows up in noir movies. She is Bree Daniels, a would-be model and actor who is doing escort work to pay the bills. Donald Sutherland plays Klute, the private detective spying on her because a serial killer is on the loose, and she is in danger. Fonda\u2019s character is cool and reserved, having apparently mastered a kind of emotional numbness as part of the play-acting involved in her work, and part of her genuine alienation.",

      "body": "<p>The laser-gun-like, pitch-modulating burst of the electronic tom is a cartoonish staple of 1980s music, cropping up everywhere from Duran Duran\u2019s chart-toppers to Prince\u2019s melodramatic rock and even Herbie Hancock\u2019s jazz fusion. Their punctuating fills serve as a constant reminder of the era\u2019s kitsch futurism and one setting in which they find their ideal expression is in the work of Ivory Coast singer and percussionist Antoinette Konan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7511f75c4b1bfb90a44bdd560a2f02f3c8a12743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7511f75c4b1bfb90a44bdd560a2f02f3c8a12743/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antoinette Konan: Antoinette Konan album art work\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antoinette Konan: Antoinette Konan album art work</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Konan\u2019s <a href=\"https://thevinylfactory.com/news/antoinette-konan-awesome-tapes-from-africa/\">eponymous 1986 international debut</a> is a kaleidoscopic jumble of drums \u2013 the electric, the acoustic and, crucially, the ahoko. A ribbed wooden stick with a hollowed-out shell to rub along it, the minimalist instrument is a staple of the indigenous Baoul\u00e9 people of the Ivory Coast and its playing is an integral feature of Konan\u2019s album, now reissued.</p> <p>Konan\u2019s record may be rooted in the 80s but it is thoroughly modern, transplanting the traditional carnivalesque devotional songs of the Baoul\u00e9 to an emerging sacred space of the era: the dancefloor. In mixing the \u201cwestern\u201d electronic sounds of drum samplers, synthesisers and twanging bass with Baoul\u00e9 vocals and the ever-present thrumming of the ahoko, Konan\u2019s record made her music a crate-digger\u2019s must-have for the club.</p> <p>Among the current glut of reissues, this re-pressing sounds remarkably fresh. While downbeat numbers such as Enfants Du Monde and Evignen are dragged down by their somewhat syrupy sweetness, the short and sharp kinetic tracks are irresistible. Opener Kokoloko Tani buzzes in with those inimitable toms and a selection of Baoul\u00e9 tuned bells set to Konan\u2019s tenor, while Abidjan Adja and M\u2019ack\u00f4 are polyrhythmic gems of mid-tempo movement, a new jack swing of Africa\u2019s west coast.</p> <p>Konan produced the entire record and her singular vision shows on its speedy 25-minute runtime. It is a near-perfect combination of tradition and modernism to create an imagining of a future sound, one which can only ever have existed in Konan\u2019s hands some 33 years ago.</p> <h2><strong>Also out this month</strong></h2> <p>The reissue of the 1991 debut of all-female a capella group <strong>Zap Mama</strong>, <a href=\"https://zapmama.bandcamp.com/album/adventures-in-afropea\">Adventures In Afropea</a>, serves as a heart-rending reminder of the history of European blackness amid our current removal from the continent. Comprised of Congolese pop, gospel and medieval chanting, Zap Mama\u2019s sound is an enveloping and deeply soulful testament to cultural exchange.

      "bodyText": "The laser-gun-like, pitch-modulating burst of the electronic tom is a cartoonish staple of 1980s music, cropping up everywhere from Duran Duran\u2019s chart-toppers to Prince\u2019s melodramatic rock and even Herbie Hancock\u2019s jazz fusion. Their punctuating fills serve as a constant reminder of the era\u2019s kitsch futurism and one setting in which they find their ideal expression is in the work of Ivory Coast singer and percussionist Antoinette Konan. Konan\u2019s eponymous 1986 international debut is a kaleidoscopic jumble of drums \u2013 the electric, the acoustic and, crucially, the ahoko. A ribbed wooden stick with a hollowed-out shell to rub along it, the minimalist instrument is a staple of the indigenous Baoul\u00e9 people of the Ivory Coast and its playing is an integral feature of Konan\u2019s album, now reissued. Konan\u2019s record may be rooted in the 80s but it is thoroughly modern, transplanting the traditional carnivalesque devotional songs of the Baoul\u00e9 to an emerging sacred space of the era: the dancefloor. In mixing the \u201cwestern\u201d electronic sounds of drum samplers, synthesisers and twanging bass with Baoul\u00e9 vocals and the ever-present thrumming of the ahoko, Konan\u2019s record made her music a crate-digger\u2019s must-have for the club. Among the current glut of reissues, this re-pressing sounds remarkably fresh. While downbeat numbers such as Enfants Du Monde and Evignen are dragged down by their somewhat syrupy sweetness, the short and sharp kinetic tracks are irresistible. Opener Kokoloko Tani buzzes in with those inimitable toms and a selection of Baoul\u00e9 tuned bells set to Konan\u2019s tenor, while Abidjan Adja and M\u2019ack\u00f4 are polyrhythmic gems of mid-tempo movement, a new jack swing of Africa\u2019s west coast. Konan produced the entire record and her singular vision shows on its speedy 25-minute runtime. It is a near-perfect combination of tradition and modernism to create an imagining of a future sound, one which can only ever have existed in Konan\u2019s hands some 33 years ago. Also out this month The reissue of the 1991 debut of all-female a capella group Zap Mama, Adventures In Afropea, serves as a heart-rending reminder of the history of European blackness amid our current removal from the continent. Comprised of Congolese pop, gospel and medieval chanting, Zap Mama\u2019s sound is an enveloping and deeply soulful testament to cultural exchange. Yemeni band El Khat deconstruct traditional folk songs into a gritty, guitar-fuelled collection of incisive statements on Saadia Jefferson, with highlights including the band\u2019s use of junk instruments to provide a clattering foundation to tracks Atabina and Ya Raiyat. Ghanaian gospel singer Alogte Oho also releases his debut international album Mam Yinne Wa, a remarkable mix of dubby reggae, the choral music of his Frafra people and horn-laden funk \u2013 a sun-drenched, joyous listen.",

In a sports media landscape built on access journalism, Deadspin said, quite simply, screw all that. Instead of stale game recaps, thinly veiled PR fluff profiles, and the empty platitudes and cliches that lined mainstream sports pages, Deadspin went outside of the traditional bounds of sports media. Think of stories such as <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/how-baylor-happened-1828372303\">How Baylor Happened</a>, on the rampant sexual misconduct within Baylor college football, <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/the-hot-stove-and-the-triumph-of-shamelessness-1822247219\">The Hot Stove And The Triumph Of Shamelessness</a>, on the willingness (or lack thereof) of baseball owners to spend money, or <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-stephen-a-smith-1700198846?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">What The Fuck Is Wrong With Stephen A Smith</a>, on \u2013 well, that one is pretty self-explanatory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/30/deadspin-journalists-quit-stick-to-sports\">Star writer Drew Magary quits as Deadspin rebellion against owners continues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Deadspin is dead because Jim Spanfeller and the rest of the private equity suits at G/O Media \u2013 the organization that purchased what remained after Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan sued Gawker Media, Deadspin\u2019s parent company, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/#7095aa7151c5\">into oblivion</a> \u2013 insisted on a \u201cstick to sports\u201d edict under their rule.</p> <p>\u201cTo create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports. And it will be the sole focus,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/go-media-tells-deadspin-staff-in-leaked-memo-stick-to-sport\">G/O editorial director Paul Maidment said</a>. \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d</p> <p>It is an absurd edict. The separation of sports from the real world is a pipe dream. How can you attend a publicly funded stadium filled with primarily white and rich fans watching teams filled with men of color from underprivileged backgrounds in the country with the widest income inequality gap in the world without seeing politics? As the GMG Union representing Deadspin employees succinctly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gmgunion/status/1189671759987040257/photo/1\">put it in a statement Wednesday</a>, \u201c\u2018Stick to sports\u2019 is and always has been a thinly veiled euphemism for \u2018don\u2019t speak truth to power.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The slimy nature of private equity makes it hard to even suss out G/O Media\u2019s motive for tanking Deadspin so efficiently. Deadspin, despite how G/O would make it sound, was a perfectly profitable enterprise doing just what it was doing, running posts <a href=\"https://theconcourse.deadspin.com/this-guy-truly-has-no-idea-what-hes-talking-about-1838500602\">about politics</a> and <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/tag/bear-friday\">posts about bears</a> alongside hard-hitting reporting and irreverent commentary diving deep into the sports world. Any answer as to why this was all worth tearing down is unsatisfying.</p> <p>One of the things that made Deadspin special was its understanding that in modern American culture, the idea of \u201csports\u201d represents so much more than just what occurs on the field. Sports are a huge part of what ties people together, within a community or across regions or groups that might not otherwise intersect. Sports have a tremendous social power, and Deadspin was unique in its ability to understand and communicate that fact.</p> <p>Sports media, for that reason, wields a power that should be subject to criticism. In Deadspin, we are losing one of the last outlets that reliably held sports media to task for carrying water for the leagues they broadcast and cover. Deadspin\u2019s oeuvre of major media criticism stories include Laura Wagner\u2019s incisive takedowns of the sexist, racist cesspool <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/sociopathic-barstool-founder-dave-portnoy-giddy-about-1829033370\">that is Barstool Sports</a>, Timothy Burke and Jack Dickey\u2019s exposure of the utter fabrication of Notre Dame football star Manti Te\u2019o\u2019s origin story <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/manti-teos-dead-girlfriend-the-most-heartbreaking-an-5976517\">peddled by Sports Illustrated and other mainstream outlets</a>, and practically <a href=\"https://kinja.com/dmoskovitz\">Diana Moskovitz\u2019s entire author page</a>.</p> <p>By refusing to stick to sports, Deadspin also provided resistance to the monolithic sports culture. It proved that the sports fan didn\u2019t just have to be one sort of guy \u2013 or, in a concept foreign to much of mainstream sports media, it proved the sports fan didn\u2019t need to be a guy at all. For a number of people who are pushed away by sports at a young age, it\u2019s not necessarily the content of the games that pushes them away. It\u2019s the attitude, the aesthetic, the in-your-face embrace-debate bullshit that define corporate sports broadcasting and writing that suggests other types of people don\u2019t have a place in sports. Deadspin provided another way to engage.</p> <p>Was Deadspin perfect? Of course not. It was responsible for plenty of the <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/in-defense-of-female-objectification-5603577\">frat-bro bigotry </a>that pervades online sports media, and as much as some of the people responsible for that in Deadspin\u2019s early days <a href=\"https://deadspin.com/the-reckoning-always-comes-1819874125?_ga=2.136718456.97876578.1572472312-1605097233.1492288892\">have apologized and attempted to make right</a>, that influence can\u2019t be ignored. But one of the reasons I\u2019m saddest to see Deadspin go when it\u2019s going is that it has grown and evolved out of some of the uglier aspects of its past, and the voice it had become was absolutely necessary in a landscape overrun with right-wing ghouls and mushy centrists.</p> <p>The loss of Deadspin is not just a sad day for people like me, a freelancer who has a personal investment in the continued presence of outlets willing to publish work critical of the sports establishment. It\u2019s a sad day for sports as a whole. The sports media landscape is flatter and duller for Deadspin\u2019s loss, and the rich and powerful are probably feeling like their lives just got a little easier. G/O Media, meanwhile? They won\u2019t feel a thing.</p> <p>Some sports fans will scoff at the idea that Deadspin is a big loss, or the idea that private equity firms like G/O are worth a second thought. They\u2019re just here to watch the games. Honestly, I get it. Life is too hard to stress all the time. But it\u2019s nothing but naivet\u00e9 to assume your games are safe. The same people snapping up sites like Deadspin are adding sports teams to their portfolio just as quickly. At least a third of Major League Baseball teams <a href=\"https://tht.fangraphs.com/from-sportsmen-to-investment-bankers-the-evolution-of-baseballs-owners/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hardballtimes+%28The+Hardball+Times%29\">are now owned</a> by men with ties to the financial services industry,<a href=\"https://tht.fangraphs.com/from-sportsmen-to-investment-bankers-the-evolution-of-baseballs-owners/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hardballtimes+%28The+Hardball+Times%29\"> </a>a growing trend of private equity reaching its tendrils into sports ownership that can be observed in other sports like basketball and soccer as well.</p> <p>Deadspin died in part because G/O doesn\u2019t need it to be wildly successful to make money off it. Meanwhile, in baseball, tanking teams like the Marlins, Pirates, Mariners and Tigers plod along with no hope and offer none for the foreseeable future, all while raking in sweet profits from media deals and revenue sharing. More and more regular season games are becoming guaranteed wins for the few teams who are trying or irrelevant snoozefests between teams trying to lose in service of some nebulous Process\u2122 peddled by front office suits. Don\u2019t pretend your favorite sport is safe from the same flattening forces that stomped Deadspin this week. They\u2019re already at work, and unfortunately, Deadspin was probably one of the best hopes to stop them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week would have been a great time to read Deadspin. The Nationals pulled off two straight wins in Houston to take the World Series in seven games; the basketball season is revving up and the Golden State Warriors are a mess; and the NFL is rounding into midseason form. Sure, you can still point your web browser to deadspin.com, and it will still direct to you a site purporting to give you \u201cSports News Without Access, Favor, Or Discretion.\u201d But Deadspin \u2013 a publication I was privileged enough to write for as a freelancer down the years \u2013 died this week, as the firing of lead editor Barry Petchesky by parent company G/O Media was followed Wednesday by mass resignations. On Thursday Deadspin\u2019s biggest name, Drew Magary, confirmed he had quit. The site is now nothing but a shell of its former self. For the unfamiliar, Deadspin \u2013 a truly horrific pun on ESPN, its constant nemesis \u2013 was a sports-lifestyle blog that helped define the voice of American sportswriting on the internet since such a thing was even a concept. In a sports media landscape built on access journalism, Deadspin said, quite simply, screw all that. Instead of stale game recaps, thinly veiled PR fluff profiles, and the empty platitudes and cliches that lined mainstream sports pages, Deadspin went outside of the traditional bounds of sports media. Think of stories such as How Baylor Happened, on the rampant sexual misconduct within Baylor college football, The Hot Stove And The Triumph Of Shamelessness, on the willingness (or lack thereof) of baseball owners to spend money, or What The Fuck Is Wrong With Stephen A Smith, on \u2013 well, that one is pretty self-explanatory. Deadspin is dead because Jim Spanfeller and the rest of the private equity suits at G/O Media \u2013 the organization that purchased what remained after Peter Thiel and Hulk Hogan sued Gawker Media, Deadspin\u2019s parent company, into oblivion \u2013 insisted on a \u201cstick to sports\u201d edict under their rule. \u201cTo create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports. And it will be the sole focus,\u201d G/O editorial director Paul Maidment said. \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d It is an absurd edict. The separation of sports from the real world is a pipe dream. How can you attend a publicly funded stadium filled with primarily white and rich fans watching teams filled with men of color from underprivileged backgrounds in the country with the widest income inequality gap in the world without seeing politics? As the GMG Union representing Deadspin employees succinctly put it in a statement Wednesday, \u201c\u2018Stick to sports\u2019 is and always has been a thinly veiled euphemism for \u2018don\u2019t speak truth to power.\u2019\u201d The slimy nature of private equity makes it hard to even suss out G/O Media\u2019s motive for tanking Deadspin so efficiently. Deadspin, despite how G/O would make it sound, was a perfectly profitable enterprise doing just what it was doing, running posts about politics and posts about bears alongside hard-hitting reporting and irreverent commentary diving deep into the sports world. Any answer as to why this was all worth tearing down is unsatisfying. One of the things that made Deadspin special was its understanding that in modern American culture, the idea of \u201csports\u201d represents so much more than just what occurs on the field. Sports are a huge part of what ties people together, within a community or across regions or groups that might not otherwise intersect. Sports have a tremendous social power, and Deadspin was unique in its ability to understand and communicate that fact. Sports media, for that reason, wields a power that should be subject to criticism. In Deadspin, we are losing one of the last outlets that reliably held sports media to task for carrying water for the leagues they broadcast and cover. Deadspin\u2019s oeuvre of major media criticism stories include Laura Wagner\u2019s incisive takedowns of the sexist, racist cesspool that is Barstool Sports, Timothy Burke and Jack Dickey\u2019s exposure of the utter fabrication of Notre Dame football star Manti Te\u2019o\u2019s origin story peddled by Sports Illustrated and other mainstream outlets, and practically Diana Moskovitz\u2019s entire author page. By refusing to stick to sports, Deadspin also provided resistance to the monolithic sports culture. It proved that the sports fan didn\u2019t just have to be one sort of guy \u2013 or, in a concept foreign to much of mainstream sports media, it proved the sports fan didn\u2019t need to be a guy at all. For a number of people who are pushed away by sports at a young age, it\u2019s not necessarily the content of the games that pushes them away. It\u2019s the attitude, the aesthetic, the in-your-face embrace-debate bullshit that define corporate sports broadcasting and writing that suggests other types of people don\u2019t have a place in sports. Deadspin provided another way to engage. Was Deadspin perfect? Of course not. It was responsible for plenty of the frat-bro bigotry that pervades online sports media, and as much as some of the people responsible for that in Deadspin\u2019s early days have apologized and attempted to make right, that influence can\u2019t be ignored. But one of the reasons I\u2019m saddest to see Deadspin go when it\u2019s going is that it has grown and evolved out of some of the uglier aspects of its past, and the voice it had become was absolutely necessary in a landscape overrun with right-wing ghouls and mushy centrists. The loss of Deadspin is not just a sad day for people like me, a freelancer who has a personal investment in the continued presence of outlets willing to publish work critical of the sports establishment. It\u2019s a sad day for sports as a whole. The sports media landscape is flatter and duller for Deadspin\u2019s loss, and the rich and powerful are probably feeling like their lives just got a little easier. G/O Media, meanwhile? They won\u2019t feel a thing. Some sports fans will scoff at the idea that Deadspin is a big loss, or the idea that private equity firms like G/O are worth a second thought. They\u2019re just here to watch the games. Honestly, I get it. Life is too hard to stress all the time. But it\u2019s nothing but naivet\u00e9 to assume your games are safe. The same people snapping up sites like Deadspin are adding sports teams to their portfolio just as quickly. At least a third of Major League Baseball teams are now owned by men with ties to the financial services industry, a growing trend of private equity reaching its tendrils into sports ownership that can be observed in other sports like basketball and soccer as well. Deadspin died in part because G/O doesn\u2019t need it to be wildly successful to make money off it. Meanwhile, in baseball, tanking teams like the Marlins, Pirates, Mariners and Tigers plod along with no hope and offer none for the foreseeable future, all while raking in sweet profits from media deals and revenue sharing. More and more regular season games are becoming guaranteed wins for the few teams who are trying or irrelevant snoozefests between teams trying to lose in service of some nebulous Process\u2122 peddled by front office suits. Don\u2019t pretend your favorite sport is safe from the same flattening forces that stomped Deadspin this week. They\u2019re already at work, and unfortunately, Deadspin was probably one of the best hopes to stop them.",

I think we can do many times the numbers we\u2019re doing right now, and certainly much bigger numbers than you\u2019re doing under the EU. Boris wants to be very careful with it.

I wish you two guys could get together, I think it would be a great thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Responding to the US president\u2019s comments, Corbyn accused Trump of \u201ctrying to interfere in Britain\u2019s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was Trump who said in June the NHS is \u2018on the table\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has intervened in the UK\u2019s nascent election campaign, calling on Boris Johnson to team up with Nigel Farage to form an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d and claiming Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cso bad for your country\u201d. Speaking to Farage on LBC Radio, the US president also said Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could prevent the UK from agreeing a trade deal with the US. Trump said the US \u201ccan\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK\u201d under \u201ccertain aspects of the deal\u201d, despite Johnson\u2019s claims it would allow the UK to have an independent trade policy. One of Labour\u2019s main attacks against Johnson has been that the prime minister would be too close to Trump and allow a sell-off of public services to US companies as the price of a trade deal, with the NHS potentially on the line. Trump told LBC listeners that he was not interested in buying the NHS, and criticised Corbyn as \u201cso bad for your country\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019d be so bad, he\u2019d take you in such a bad way. He\u2019d take you into such bad places,\u201d he added. Trump told Farage he had reservations over Johnson\u2019s deal, because it could prevent trade with the US, but he denied Corbyn\u2019s claims it would mean the NHS was up for sale to American health corporations. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where [it] started with respect to us taking over your healthcare system. I mean it\u2019s so ridiculous. I think Corbyn put that out there, but to even think, it was never even mentioned, I never even heard it until I went over to visit with the Queen,\u201d he said. During that trip, Trump had fuelled speculation that the US would want access to NHS contracts for US corporations by saying that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d. He later backtracked by saying: \u201cI don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table.\u201d A No 10 spokesman contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that a UK-US trade deal might not be possible under Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal agreement. \u201cThe PM negotiated a new deal which ensures that we take back control of our laws, trade, borders and money \u2013 a deal which people said he could never negotiate. Under this new deal the whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union, which means we can strike our own free trade deals.\u201d On Johnson, the US president said: \u201cWe want to do trade with the UK but to be honest with you, this deal, under certain aspects of the deal, you can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t trade. We can\u2019t make a trade deal with the UK. I think we can do many times the numbers we\u2019re doing right now, and certainly much bigger numbers than you\u2019re doing under the EU. Boris wants to be very careful with it. Under certain ways we would be precluded, which would be ridiculous.\u201d In remarks that are unlikely to be welcomed in Downing Street, Trump said Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man and [the] exact right guy for the times\u201d, and added that he could form an \u201cunstoppable force\u201d by pairing with Farage. Trump also told Farage that Johnson \u201chas a lot of respect and like for you\u201d. \u201cHe respects you a lot, I can tell you that, he respects you a lot, I don\u2019t know if you know that or not,\u201d Trump told Farage. \u201cBut, cause I have no idea I have enough to do over here without having to worry about the psychology of two brilliant people over there, frankly ... I wish you two guys could get together, I think it would be a great thing.\u201d Responding to the US president\u2019s comments, Corbyn accused Trump of \u201ctrying to interfere in Britain\u2019s election to get his friend Boris Johnson elected\u201d. \u201cIt was Trump who said in June the NHS is \u2018on the table\u2019. And he knows if Labour wins US corporations won\u2019t get their hands on it. Our NHS is not for sale,\u201d Corbyn tweeted. Farage agreed with Trump\u2019s criticism of Johnson\u2019s deal, as he has been arguing that it represents \u201cBrexit in name only\u201d. He vowed the Brexit party would challenge the Conservatives at the ballot box. However, Farage has refused to be drawn over reports the Brexit party is engulfed in a row over how many seats it should contest at the election. Some Brexit party supporters and candidates are concerned that the leave vote could split and boost Corbyn\u2019s chances. Farage described the idea that his party may only focus on 20 to 30 leave-voting Labour seats in the north of England as \u201cidle speculation\u201d. At the Brexit party launch on Friday, Farage will reveal his strategy for the campaign after coming under pressure from two different factions in his party. On the one side, some pragmatists are warning that standing in Tory-Labour marginals could help Corbyn. But many of his candidates are desperate to run and oppose Johnson\u2019s deal, which they see as not being a \u201creal\u201d Brexit. Farage, who has been at a Trump hotel in Washington DC this week, explained his party\u2019s dilemma on a podcast alongside the former Trump aide Steve Bannon. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem.

Bolton reportedly told aides that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal emissary in the Ukraine saga, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/14/fiona-hill-testimony-trump-impeachment-inquiry\">was a \u201chand grenade\u201d that could blow everyone up</a>, and he encouraged multiple aides to take their concerns about Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings to the top lawyer on the national security council.</p> \n<p>That lawyer, John Eisenberg, has also been invited to testify next week before congressional investigators.</p> \n<p>The House vote on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6532420-House-Impeachment-Resolution-on-Procedures.html\">implemented a procedure</a> likely to lead to the drafting of articles of impeachment against Trump in the judiciary committee.</p> \n<p>When Pelosi banged the gavel, Republicans shouted \u201cobjection\u201d, briefly sowing confusion as the clerk strained to be heard and Democrats countered with calls for order. The room eventually settled and the House returned to the rest of its agenda before leaving Washington for a week-long recess.</p> \n<p>Moments after the vote, Republicans began their assault on Democrats in \u201cswing\u201d districts who supported the resolution, sending emails to supporters that accused the Democrats by name of participating in a \u201cfraud\u201d. With only two Democratic defections, that list includes members critical to the party\u2019s majority.</p> \n<p>Analysts have said that Trump is vulnerable to impeachment for abuse of power, obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress, charges familiar from previous impeachment proceedings against presidents Richard Nixon, who resigned, and Bill Clinton, who was impeached but not removed from office.</p> \n<p>The procedure allows for Republicans to request witnesses and documents and provides for the presence of lawyers representing Trump at judiciary committee proceedings.</p> \n<p>Before that stage, however, public hearings would play out before the intelligence committee, chaired by Schiff of California, who has been spearheading the impeachment inquiry.</p> \n<p>Schiff would call witnesses who previously testified in closed-door depositions before investigators, with an eye on presenting to the public the strongest case against Trump. Many Americans who have not been following the twists and turns of the closed-door testimony would be hearing the allegations against Trump \u2013 and meeting the witnesses, who include senior officials in the White House, state department and Pentagon \u2013 for the first time.</p>",

If Trump is impeached, a Senate trial would follow, possibly early next year, with a two-thirds majority vote required to remove Trump from office. Still in question was whether Morrison\u2019s former boss, the then national security adviser John Bolton, who reportedly described the back-room Trump-Ukraine haggling as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d that he wanted no part of, would testify before Congress. A lawyer for Bolton told Congress on Wednesday that while Bolton would not testify without a subpoena, the lawyer stood ready to receive a subpoena. Testimony by Bolton, a Yale-educated lawyer, blistering conservative hawk and expert bureaucratic infighter, could be as damaging for Trump as any so far. Bolton reportedly told aides that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal emissary in the Ukraine saga, was a \u201chand grenade\u201d that could blow everyone up, and he encouraged multiple aides to take their concerns about Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings to the top lawyer on the national security council. That lawyer, John Eisenberg, has also been invited to testify next week before congressional investigators. The House vote on Thursday implemented a procedure likely to lead to the drafting of articles of impeachment against Trump in the judiciary committee. When Pelosi banged the gavel, Republicans shouted \u201cobjection\u201d, briefly sowing confusion as the clerk strained to be heard and Democrats countered with calls for order. The room eventually settled and the House returned to the rest of its agenda before leaving Washington for a week-long recess. Moments after the vote, Republicans began their assault on Democrats in \u201cswing\u201d districts who supported the resolution, sending emails to supporters that accused the Democrats by name of participating in a \u201cfraud\u201d. With only two Democratic defections, that list includes members critical to the party\u2019s majority. Analysts have said that Trump is vulnerable to impeachment for abuse of power, obstruction of justice and contempt of Congress, charges familiar from previous impeachment proceedings against presidents Richard Nixon, who resigned, and Bill Clinton, who was impeached but not removed from office. The procedure allows for Republicans to request witnesses and documents and provides for the presence of lawyers representing Trump at judiciary committee proceedings. Before that stage, however, public hearings would play out before the intelligence committee, chaired by Schiff of California, who has been spearheading the impeachment inquiry. Schiff would call witnesses who previously testified in closed-door depositions before investigators, with an eye on presenting to the public the strongest case against Trump. Many Americans who have not been following the twists and turns of the closed-door testimony would be hearing the allegations against Trump \u2013 and meeting the witnesses, who include senior officials in the White House, state department and Pentagon \u2013 for the first time.",

      "body": "<p>For almost three and a half years, Death Stranding has kept us guessing about its true nature \u2013 and when the credits roll after a gruelling, occasionally magical, 60 hours of delivering parcels-turned-metaphors, you won\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry with relief. Divisive creator Hideo Kojima\u2019s open-world epic resolves its mysteries, but your satisfaction is numbed by painful memories of relentless trekking, jarring menu management and some \u2013 frankly wild \u2013 tonal shifts. Over time, your relationship with Death Stranding may start to shift, but it\u2019s a slow-burn album track, not a pop hit.</p> <p>Your feelings about Hideo Kojima\u2019s longest, most indulgent, project will hinge on how you buy into the game\u2019s theme about the importance of belief when all seems futile. About 80% of your time is spent trudging across mountains delivering parcels. Imagine Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos atoning for his sins in an especially cruel episode of Black Mirror. At times, the act of playing Death Stranding is a test of faith in itself, not only in Hideo Kojima\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/top-10-moments-metal-gear-history/\">ability to surprise</a>, but that your efforts will ultimately be rewarded.</p> <p>For reasons unknown, America has been fractured by the Death Stranding event, causing the dead to roam the world of the living as shadowy spectres known as the beached things, or BTs. People have retreated into isolated communities and your job is to deliver supplies and reconnect the chiral network \u2013 a mega-internet \u2013 to unite the country. You need to cross the shattered landscape and find the president\u2019s daughter Amelie who has been abducted by terrorists called the Homo Demens. There\u2019s obviously more going on, as hero Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) unearths his past, and learns about the mysterious Cliff (Mads Mikkelsen) and your <a href=\"https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Bridge_baby\">ghost</a><a href=\"https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Bridge_baby\"> detecting pod-baby, BB</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyH4KQGehtg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YyH4KQGehtg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Death Stranding defies convention, focusing on \u201cconnection\u201d over combat and (almost) removing the notion of restarting a mission when things go wrong. Case in point: I failed to plan a delivery route and got swamped by BTs, who wrecked my cargo. Having never so much as dented a parcel in the game\u2019s opening hours, the sight of 10 cases being ruined provokes blind panic bordering on remorse. My instinct is to quit and restart the task, but while lost items can be picked up later from a delivery centre, if a cargo is destroyed beyond repair, it\u2019s lost forever. It\u2019s in this moment that Death Stranding is born, as you resolve to push on with a nagging sense of failure, unable to reset and start fresh.</p> <p>Eight hours in, I hadn\u2019t shot a single person. The challenge comes from the surprisingly engaging cargo management, where you trade weight against balance, speed against stamina, and weigh up risky shortcuts over treacherous terrain. Once you adjust, holding L2 and R2 to grab your backpack navigates most scenarios and sloppiness is the threat, for example sprinting into deep water without scanning its depth. The ghost-evading BT sections require stealth, but won\u2019t tax Metal Gear Solid (MGS) veterans. Mules are the main human enemy, and easily dealt with by using basic kicks and punches (all on one button) and a simple evade system. You\u2019ll unlock new kit as you progress, such as \u201cbola\u201d cable tie guns, further reducing the threat.</p> <p>Hideo Kojima\u2019s liberation from the MGS series can feel like X-Men\u2019s Cyclops removing his visor and having a good old look around \u2013 it\u2019s a little much. Think 2001, The Road, The Leftovers, Silent Hill and Planet Earth reinterpreted as three days of UPS contract work. Death Stranding pulverises the player with its overwhelming scale, seemingly unending objectives and fastidious resource management. Yet, despite everything, the game somehow pulls you through, creating a cycle of punishment and reward in a technically brilliant blockbuster experience quite unlike anything that has come before.</p> <p>The opening hours of the game are cut-scene heavy, creating intrigue that just about drives you forward to the point when you\u2019re 35 hours in and losing the will to zigzag up another vertical slope. Initially, Death Stranding\u2019s barren world makes you feel the weight of every footstep, until the dizzy liberation of unlocking your first bike and whizzing along miles of broken ground in a heartbeat. Later on, you\u2019ll find vans which stop your parcels degrading in the rain and upgrades that make a mockery of the game\u2019s early simplicity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c28152d93ddc7d68beb3993c32e491641156a1d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c28152d93ddc7d68beb3993c32e491641156a1d7/395_0_3383_2030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Death Stranding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unlocking new equipment \u2026 Death Stranding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kojima Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The much-touted \u201cstrand\u201d system is a form of collaborative online play, where you can share items with other players, leave pre-set warning signs, and contribute resources to construction projects. You never see your fellow porters, but their items and cargo litter your world. Building your first bridge sparks mild euphoria at never having to tiptoe across a wild river again. Later in the game, players can pool materials to form motorways, and reward players\u2019 philanthropy with likes.</p> <p>Over time, the thrill of acquiring hi-tech items yields to a pang of regret. Other players\u2019 emoji signs litter distribution centre entrances in the quest for cheap likes, and rugged landscapes start to resemble red-light districts. You start to crave undiscovered delivery routes for a reminder of the game\u2019s unspoilt beauty. Thematically, it\u2019s pretty overt: mankind\u2019s attempt to tame nature \u2013 through selfishness, or selflessness \u2013 is storing up an environmental problem.</p> <p>Death Stranding\u2019s focus on meticulous cargo preparation and deliveries that trigger repetitive, intrusive, micro cut-scenes, feel designed to provoke fluster in a world of instant gratification. Parents will shiver at the familiarity \u2013 and necessity \u2013 of equipment preparation, as if packing a bag for a day out. The game\u2019s views on social media are at best nuanced, at worst conflicting. Death Stranding laments social media\u2019s lack of human connection yet rewards players with a dopamine-volcano of stats after each mission, unlocking new equipment, creating a cycle of dependency.</p> <p>The motion-captured performances are exceptional, even if arch villain Higgs (Troy Baker) makes Jared Leto\u2019s Joker look subtle. The game\u2019s exhilarating finale \u2013 long enough to be a game itself \u2013 remixes some of MGS\u2019s greatest moments, but this deadens the impact for hardcore Kojima fans. The final act shakes things up, but the gruelling 15-20-hour mid-section is a seemingly endless toil of literal hills and valleys, rather than emotional highs and lows.</p> <p>Despite everything, you keep going.

      "bodyText": "For almost three and a half years, Death Stranding has kept us guessing about its true nature \u2013 and when the credits roll after a gruelling, occasionally magical, 60 hours of delivering parcels-turned-metaphors, you won\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry with relief. Divisive creator Hideo Kojima\u2019s open-world epic resolves its mysteries, but your satisfaction is numbed by painful memories of relentless trekking, jarring menu management and some \u2013 frankly wild \u2013 tonal shifts. Over time, your relationship with Death Stranding may start to shift, but it\u2019s a slow-burn album track, not a pop hit. Your feelings about Hideo Kojima\u2019s longest, most indulgent, project will hinge on how you buy into the game\u2019s theme about the importance of belief when all seems futile. About 80% of your time is spent trudging across mountains delivering parcels. Imagine Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos atoning for his sins in an especially cruel episode of Black Mirror. At times, the act of playing Death Stranding is a test of faith in itself, not only in Hideo Kojima\u2019s ability to surprise, but that your efforts will ultimately be rewarded. For reasons unknown, America has been fractured by the Death Stranding event, causing the dead to roam the world of the living as shadowy spectres known as the beached things, or BTs. People have retreated into isolated communities and your job is to deliver supplies and reconnect the chiral network \u2013 a mega-internet \u2013 to unite the country. You need to cross the shattered landscape and find the president\u2019s daughter Amelie who has been abducted by terrorists called the Homo Demens. There\u2019s obviously more going on, as hero Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) unearths his past, and learns about the mysterious Cliff (Mads Mikkelsen) and your ghost detecting pod-baby, BB. Death Stranding defies convention, focusing on \u201cconnection\u201d over combat and (almost) removing the notion of restarting a mission when things go wrong. Case in point: I failed to plan a delivery route and got swamped by BTs, who wrecked my cargo. Having never so much as dented a parcel in the game\u2019s opening hours, the sight of 10 cases being ruined provokes blind panic bordering on remorse. My instinct is to quit and restart the task, but while lost items can be picked up later from a delivery centre, if a cargo is destroyed beyond repair, it\u2019s lost forever. It\u2019s in this moment that Death Stranding is born, as you resolve to push on with a nagging sense of failure, unable to reset and start fresh. Eight hours in, I hadn\u2019t shot a single person. The challenge comes from the surprisingly engaging cargo management, where you trade weight against balance, speed against stamina, and weigh up risky shortcuts over treacherous terrain. Once you adjust, holding L2 and R2 to grab your backpack navigates most scenarios and sloppiness is the threat, for example sprinting into deep water without scanning its depth. The ghost-evading BT sections require stealth, but won\u2019t tax Metal Gear Solid (MGS) veterans. Mules are the main human enemy, and easily dealt with by using basic kicks and punches (all on one button) and a simple evade system. You\u2019ll unlock new kit as you progress, such as \u201cbola\u201d cable tie guns, further reducing the threat. Hideo Kojima\u2019s liberation from the MGS series can feel like X-Men\u2019s Cyclops removing his visor and having a good old look around \u2013 it\u2019s a little much. Think 2001, The Road, The Leftovers, Silent Hill and Planet Earth reinterpreted as three days of UPS contract work. Death Stranding pulverises the player with its overwhelming scale, seemingly unending objectives and fastidious resource management. Yet, despite everything, the game somehow pulls you through, creating a cycle of punishment and reward in a technically brilliant blockbuster experience quite unlike anything that has come before. The opening hours of the game are cut-scene heavy, creating intrigue that just about drives you forward to the point when you\u2019re 35 hours in and losing the will to zigzag up another vertical slope. Initially, Death Stranding\u2019s barren world makes you feel the weight of every footstep, until the dizzy liberation of unlocking your first bike and whizzing along miles of broken ground in a heartbeat. Later on, you\u2019ll find vans which stop your parcels degrading in the rain and upgrades that make a mockery of the game\u2019s early simplicity. The much-touted \u201cstrand\u201d system is a form of collaborative online play, where you can share items with other players, leave pre-set warning signs, and contribute resources to construction projects. You never see your fellow porters, but their items and cargo litter your world. Building your first bridge sparks mild euphoria at never having to tiptoe across a wild river again. Later in the game, players can pool materials to form motorways, and reward players\u2019 philanthropy with likes. Over time, the thrill of acquiring hi-tech items yields to a pang of regret. Other players\u2019 emoji signs litter distribution centre entrances in the quest for cheap likes, and rugged landscapes start to resemble red-light districts. You start to crave undiscovered delivery routes for a reminder of the game\u2019s unspoilt beauty. Thematically, it\u2019s pretty overt: mankind\u2019s attempt to tame nature \u2013 through selfishness, or selflessness \u2013 is storing up an environmental problem. Death Stranding\u2019s focus on meticulous cargo preparation and deliveries that trigger repetitive, intrusive, micro cut-scenes, feel designed to provoke fluster in a world of instant gratification. Parents will shiver at the familiarity \u2013 and necessity \u2013 of equipment preparation, as if packing a bag for a day out. The game\u2019s views on social media are at best nuanced, at worst conflicting. Death Stranding laments social media\u2019s lack of human connection yet rewards players with a dopamine-volcano of stats after each mission, unlocking new equipment, creating a cycle of dependency. The motion-captured performances are exceptional, even if arch villain Higgs (Troy Baker) makes Jared Leto\u2019s Joker look subtle. The game\u2019s exhilarating finale \u2013 long enough to be a game itself \u2013 remixes some of MGS\u2019s greatest moments, but this deadens the impact for hardcore Kojima fans. The final act shakes things up, but the gruelling 15-20-hour mid-section is a seemingly endless toil of literal hills and valleys, rather than emotional highs and lows. Despite everything, you keep going. Arduous ascents succumb to the undeniable impact of a stunning vista framed by an inverted rainbow. Your brain starts to blur the journey and focus on fleeting moments of reflection, pride and relief. Death Stranding\u2019s mesmerising scale and repetition starts to weigh on your subconscious. Kojima\u2019s games have always thrived in the empty space that other games seek to eradicate \u2013 such as the legendary ladder climb in MGS3, or MGSV\u2019s infamous Act 2 \u2013 and, for almost 20 hours, it feels like Death Stranding is taking that to clumsy extremes to hammer home a point about society\u2019s excesses and its unsustainability. In a recent interview, Mad Max director George Miller suggested Death Stranding was too radical for its time. \u201cThe risk is that people don\u2019t accept it,\u201d he said. Sceptics will feel vindicated by the game\u2019s bloated indulgence and repetition, while the plot doesn\u2019t quite live up to the wildest speculation by Kojima\u2019s hardcore acolytes. Still, this uncompromising, unashamedly political work of artistic intent is 2019\u2019s most interesting blockbuster game by a distance, and certainly the only one where you will find a frankly brilliant, tonally jarring, Public Enemy gag. Your relationship with Death Stranding will likely shift in waves. After the strain of uncovering the game\u2019s mysteries has subsided, you\u2019ll discover new ways to traverse the world. You find yourself yearning to return, the elegiac soundtrack decorating your idle thoughts. I have resolved to deliver every parcel, despite cursing their existence for 60 hours. Above all, Death Stranding is a sermon on the importance of belief. The power of putting one foot in front of another when hope looks lost, in the belief that things will get better. By working together, a series of small intentional steps can make a difference, and in this often fractured, angry and confusing world; that\u2019s as hopeful as it gets.

      "bodyText": "People of Tamba, inspired by German photographer August Sander\u2019s seminal work, People of the 20th Century, was conceived as a catalogue of the society of Tambacounda, the largest city in the most remote and rural region of Senegal, and the point of departure for the majority of Senegalese migration. Gagnesseri Seck, waitress Bassirou Ndao, music shop owner Samba Sow, tailor Simon Faye, grapefruit seller The series portrays various professionals \u2013 from doctors and bankers to teachers and farmers \u2013 in their work environments to highlight their roles and contribution to society. This dignified series of portraits aims to counter negative and number-based reporting about migration in western media by bringing individuals and their personal stories to the fore. Cheikh Faye, shoe seller Mouhamadou Camara, bicycle repairer Adamo Diallo, cotton farmer M.me Ngom, elementary school teacher M.me Ngom is one of two teachers at the elementary school in Sinthian, where about 120 children attend, and due to shortage of teachers she teaches two classes together at the same time. When Giovanni met her, Adama was picking cotton in a small family field together with her husband, her sister and two nephews. Le Korsa funded the installation of bore-wells outfitted with solar-powered pumps in each village, which provides year-round access to water and helps growing through the harsh dry season. Also featured as part of this project are architectural and landscape images of street installations of the portraits exhibited in key migration destinations in Africa and Europe, including Dakar, Marrakech, Berlin and Milan. In each location, large-scale photographs were printed and displayed across the city, where people could appreciate the pictures and see themselves reflected in their own society. The photographic project is accompanied by Senegal/Sicily, which is a series of short documentaries created with the Italian film-maker Alberto Amoretti. Both projects aim to explore different aspects of clandestine migration. Alpha/Aisadou The first documentary of the series is a dialogue between a mother, Aisadou, speaking from her village in the east part of Senegal, and her son Alpha in Sicily, who has left home to find a better future. Aisadou lives in Sinthian, a village in Tambacounda. This is where the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation built Thread, a community centre and artists\u2019 residence. Aisadou and her son Alpha Alpha lives in Mazzarino, a small town in the centre of Sicily. Mother and son talk about their hopes and their regrets; Aisadou talks of her worries as a mother and Alpha about the hardships he has faced. The documentaries each feature the experiences, dreams and reflections of migrants and their relatives who remained in Senegal. These include the monologues of Aisadou and Alpha, discussions with migrant residents of San Berillo in Catania and interviews with families of migrants who died at sea. \u201cAfter screening in Sinthian, we met a man who had begun to save money to start the trip. Now we don\u2019t know what happened to him, but what it is important is that after seeing the film, he reconsidered,\u201d H\u00e4nninen says. A screening in Tambacounda. The project wants to show to the young people of Tambacounda who are considering leaving a sincere account of the risks of the voyage and the reality of those who made it to Europe. Young Women of Le Foyer Le Foyer de Jeunes Filles in Tambacounda is a home for girls and young women who come to the city to attend secondary school. Coming from villages that only have primary schools, the girls find a safe place to live while they complete their education. If it was not for Le Foyer, they would have abandoned their studies and, most likely, remained in their villages and married underage. The girls at Le Foyer talk about their desire to get the training they need to help their country. They not only want to graduate, but also to become leaders of a new Senegal. Khadidiatou Nadya and Khady Camara, young women of Le Foyer Khadidiatou had to fight to get the permission from her father to finish her schooling to become a nurse. She helps the family with her small savings from her scholarship and her part-time job as tutor at the Foyer de Jeunes Filles. She is the only one in a family of 16 sons to be allowed to have access to secondary school. One of her brothers decided to leave illegally Senegal and reach Europe. At the time of the interview, he was kept in refugee camp in Sicily, waiting for papers. To help disseminate the message of the films, the Albers Foundation and Le Korsa have launched a series of film screenings and discussions throughout the Tambacounda region, specifically targeting remote and rural areas. The screenings unite families, teachers and local leaders in dialogue about the experiences of migrants, and how the financial resources devoted to migration may be better used to improve life locally. One of the screenings in Dakar. The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and Le Korsa will display a selection of images and films from both projects at Also Known as Africa (AKAA) art and design fair held in Paris, 9-11 November 2019.",

For decades criminal groups from Venezuela and Colombia have taken advantage of the porous border to smuggle petrol across the border, says Gimena S\u00e1nchez-Garzoli of the Washington Office on Latin America thinktank. \u201cThese groups often have diverse operations happening at once, including arms, drugs, migrants and smuggling goods,\u201d says S\u00e1nchez-Garzoli. \u201cThey often fight over territory, are violent and corrupt locals to look the other way, or assist in their operations. If public forces pursue them, they conveniently escape to the other side.\u201d Extortions and kidnappings have also been on the rise. Local media is flooded with reports of local business owners being extorted and kidnapped, to pay money to criminal groups. Many public officials and NGOs interviewed were hesitant to comment on these issues. The mayor\u2019s office says locals are \u201cfed up\u201d with the violence, increase in drugs now available in the city, and rising sex work among the migrant population. Andrea, 19, fled Venezuela\u2019s Margarita Island two years ago. She has a four-year old child. \u201cWhen you work as a prostitute on the street, it\u2019s dangerous, but really dangerous here [in Maicao],\u201d she says. A group of refugee transgender sex workers were forced to flee Maicao because of alleged attacks by local officials. The Guardian has seen photos of trans women who had been attacked and had their heads shaved, allegedly by Maicao police. \u201cThe people of Maicao aren\u2019t ready for people like that,\u201d says Santo when questioned about the incident. He denies any police brutality. \u201cThis sexual freedom of expression \u2026 people need time to be able to accept them.\u201d Tensions are likely to be exacerbated as the crisis in Venezuela deepens. Colombia\u2019s foreign ministry estimates that another 1.3 million Venezuelans will cross the border by next year. But Gomez remains positive. \u201cI am going to look for a better life here, but I am not losing hope of returning to my country,\u201d he says.",

Forget to use it at all, and you still pay the \u00a37.99 fee. The move is arguably the biggest change yet to the Clubcard scheme, which was launched in 1995 and now has more than 19 million users. Almost every other supermarket has launched loyalty cards since, although critics say they are less and less worthwhile (see below). Shoppers who want Clubcard Plus will need to have a smartphone to download the new special app, which they will have to present at the checkout to gain the discount. For Tesco customers who don\u2019t want to sign up to the app, the existing free Clubcard rewards scheme will continue to operate as it does now, the store says. Shoppers will, in effect, want to pre-plan their big monthly purchases to use the \u201cdiscount\u201d to best effect.

Tesco Mobile customers get a free doubling of their data allowance, which is worth around \u00a31.50 a month, for up to one mobile account per Clubcard Plus-holding household. Plus holders will have the option to apply for a Tesco Bank credit card, with no foreign exchange fees on purchases abroad, when it opens for applications from next year, although there are plenty of other cards out there that offer that.

Morrison warned that a new breed of #RadicalActivism\u2122 was on the march, \u201capocalyptic in tone, brooks no compromise, all or nothing, alternative views not permitted \u2013 a dogma that pits cities against regional Australia, one that cannot resist sneering at wealth creating and job creating industries, and the livelihoods particularly of regional Australians including here in Queensland\u201d. Apart from this being overhyped, high-velocity bollocks, it pays to remember right at this juncture that the actual purpose of Morrison\u2019s address on Friday was to foreshadow a government crackdown against forms of activism and protests that the Coalition and the mining industry finds inconvenient. So, just in case this unclear, let me spell it out: we were being treated to the spectacle of a prime minister teeing off against intolerance while in the same breath foreshadowing his own bout of government sanctioned intolerance \u2013 the type where police might be involved, and people might be bundled away in vans.

Unremarked in this stirring presentation was the fact that climate-related activism is building right at the moment, both at the community level, from the schoolkids to the grandmas, and also at the shareholder level, in large part because the Coalition has invited it. The government who finds this activism inconvenient is the same government who has sparked the activism, given its purpose and salience and traction, because of its own woeful record on climate change. In some circles, that sort of behaviour \u2013 where you massively bugger things up, and someone has the temerity to call you on it, either individually, or institutionally \u2013 is known as an own goal. But that kind of introspection, the kind where you reflect and arrive at an epiphany that you might just have brought this upon yourself, is of course unhelpful if you are a prime minister intent on making your reality \u2013 a made-up world where there are goodies, and baddies, and you and your mates are the goodies, and everyone else should just shut up, and if you don\u2019t shut up, we just might make you.

Apart from the perversity of a government railing against a set of conditions it has, itself, created, there was also the curiosity about carbon risk, which was presented implicitly by Morrison as a fiction of progressivism, #RadicalActivism\u2122 and the sneering apocalypse. Instead of participants in the economy making clear eyed assessments about the medium and long term, winding down their exposure to carbon intensive businesses given the future that governments have signed up to, including the Morrison government, is one of carbon constraint \u2013 rational behaviour is presented as some kind of pernicious conspiracy against wealth creation. As if wealth can only be created in one way, by one group of people. This strange diktat will be news to the regulators \u2013 the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission \u2013 who are calmly out in the marketplace warning stakeholders on a regular basis to get their houses in order or risk being stranded in the inevitable transition, who present carbon risk as what it is: a threat to financial stability in Australia. They\u2019ll be astonished to learn they are the unwitting tools of the deep progressive state, co-opted by the noisy Australians. Shh, no one tell them.",

After taking into account changes in the population, an increase in deaths from liver cancer remained, with the rate rising 50%, from 5.9 per 100,000 people in 2005-07 to 8.9 per 100,000 in 2015-17.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-31T16:25:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/oct/2019-10-31T16:25:18/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>There was also a 60% increase in the rate of people diagnosed with the disease in the same time period.</p> <p>A number of factors are linked to a higher risk of liver cancer, including older age, having HIV or Aids, having a family history of the disease, and also ethnicity, with liver cancer being more common in black and Asian people.</p> <p>However the CRUK team say the increase in cases of liver cancer was probably down to, at least in part, a rise in obesity and associated health conditions. It is estimated that just under a quarter of all cases of liver cancer are linked to being overweight or obese.</p> <p>Overall, half of all liver cancer cases are thought to be preventable, with smoking, drug abuse and drinking alcohol among the risk factors for the disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/16/offer-cancer-screenings-during-lunch-breaks-report-urges\">Offer cancer screenings during lunch breaks, report urges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A separate analysis of data for England by the National Cancer Research Institute, confirmed that liver cancer was a growing problem, revealing that the rate of new cases of the most common type, as well as deaths from it, tripled between 1997 and 2016. For men, deaths from this type of the disease rose from 1.93 per 100,000 people to 5.97 per 100,000 people in that period, while for women deaths rose from 0.51 per 100,000 people to 1.4 per 100,000 people.</p> <p>Experts say the steep rise in this particular form of liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma, might in part be down to improvements in diagnosing individual types of cancer.</p> <p>The team also found that this form of liver cancer was particularly common among more deprived members of society, with a quarter of cases in the bottom fifth of the population for deprivation.</p> <p>Mitchell added that the rise in deaths looks set to continue, with the number of people diagnosed with liver cancer expected to rise by 38% between 2014 and 2035.</p> <p>Hassan Malik, a consultant hepatobiliary surgeon at University Hospital Aintree, said the new figures should be a call to policymakers to focus on prevention and treatment of liver cancer.</p> <p>\u201cPrevention is always better than cure, and this is particularly the case for liver cancer, which is usually only detected in its advanced stages when it is almost impossible to cure,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Deaths from liver cancer in the UK have shot up in recent years, with a rise of almost 80% in numbers between 2007 to 2017, new figures reveal. Experts say there are several factors behind the rise, including the fact that more people are being diagnosed with the disease, which is notoriously difficult to detect in its early stages, meaning it has a poor prognosis. According to Cancer Research UK, which released the latest figures, if the cancer has progressed to the point that surgery is not an option, survival is often only a matter of months. \u201cA lot of progress has been made saving lives from cancer, but it\u2019s worrying to see deaths from liver cancer increasing at such an alarming rate,\u201d said Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of CRUK, adding that the charity is pursuing research into the biology of the disease to develop better treatments, with immunotherapy one of the options being explored. The figures reveal that deaths from liver cancer in the UK rose from 3,200 in 2007 to 5,700 in 2017, reflecting the 80% rise. After taking into account changes in the population, an increase in deaths from liver cancer remained, with the rate rising 50%, from 5.9 per 100,000 people in 2005-07 to 8.9 per 100,000 in 2015-17. There was also a 60% increase in the rate of people diagnosed with the disease in the same time period. A number of factors are linked to a higher risk of liver cancer, including older age, having HIV or Aids, having a family history of the disease, and also ethnicity, with liver cancer being more common in black and Asian people. However the CRUK team say the increase in cases of liver cancer was probably down to, at least in part, a rise in obesity and associated health conditions. It is estimated that just under a quarter of all cases of liver cancer are linked to being overweight or obese. Overall, half of all liver cancer cases are thought to be preventable, with smoking, drug abuse and drinking alcohol among the risk factors for the disease. A separate analysis of data for England by the National Cancer Research Institute, confirmed that liver cancer was a growing problem, revealing that the rate of new cases of the most common type, as well as deaths from it, tripled between 1997 and 2016. For men, deaths from this type of the disease rose from 1.93 per 100,000 people to 5.97 per 100,000 people in that period, while for women deaths rose from 0.51 per 100,000 people to 1.4 per 100,000 people. Experts say the steep rise in this particular form of liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma, might in part be down to improvements in diagnosing individual types of cancer. The team also found that this form of liver cancer was particularly common among more deprived members of society, with a quarter of cases in the bottom fifth of the population for deprivation. Mitchell added that the rise in deaths looks set to continue, with the number of people diagnosed with liver cancer expected to rise by 38% between 2014 and 2035. Hassan Malik, a consultant hepatobiliary surgeon at University Hospital Aintree, said the new figures should be a call to policymakers to focus on prevention and treatment of liver cancer. \u201cPrevention is always better than cure, and this is particularly the case for liver cancer, which is usually only detected in its advanced stages when it is almost impossible to cure,\u201d he said.",

At another site, Marston Montgomery, Pamela Pigeon, a New Zealander, became in 1943 the agency\u2019s first female commander, overseeing about 100 people who worked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/01/gchq-marks-100-years-by-unveiling-details-of-wartime-spy-work\">fingerprinting individual German radios</a> \u2013 taking advantage of the fact, explains the GCHQ historian Tony Comer, that each crystal at the heart of a radio oscillated slightly differently. \u201cIt presented an easy way to distinguish between a bomber squadron or simply fighter aircraft.\u201d Ivy Farm, in Knockholt in Kent, was the first place to intercept a fax: a diagram showing a typical US bomber formation, being sent from Berlin to Japan.

Antoinette Sandbach, one of the rebel Conservative MPs ejected from the party, is to recontest her seat of Eddisbury for the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems have reshuffled candidates in a number of constituencies to make way for ex-Tory and ex-Labour newcomers. * * * 100 years of secrets \u2013 The spy agency GCHQ is celebrating its centenary today by highlighting little-known wartime eavesdropping and decoding work, much of it done by women, in five secret locations around the country. For example, about 50 linguists listened in to shortwave German radio at Abbots Cliff House near Dover. At another site, Marston Montgomery, Pamela Pigeon, a New Zealander, became in 1943 the agency\u2019s first female commander, overseeing about 100 people who worked fingerprinting individual German radios \u2013 taking advantage of the fact, explains the GCHQ historian Tony Comer, that each crystal at the heart of a radio oscillated slightly differently. \u201cIt presented an easy way to distinguish between a bomber squadron or simply fighter aircraft.\u201d Ivy Farm, in Knockholt in Kent, was the first place to intercept a fax: a diagram showing a typical US bomber formation, being sent from Berlin to Japan. Staff at Ivy Farm were able to grab the communication and pass it on to the Americans so they could adapt. * * * Russia 2018 email trove for sale \u2013 An anonymously run Telegram account has put up for sale emails relating to Russia\u2019s 2018 World Cup bid, after reports that Russian officials compiled a dossier on how to buy the votes of Fifa executive council members. The emails\u2019 existence was first reported by investigative website the Insider. They purportedly belong to Sergei Kapkov, a Russian politician and former head of the country\u2019s national football academy. Separately, an investigative journalist has infiltrated a Polish troll farm to gather evidence of its operations. Katarzyna Pruszkiewicz spent six months working at Cat@Net, an \u201cePR agency\u201d producing both leftwing and rightwing content. A majority of Cat@Net\u2019s employees are understood to be disabled, allowing the company to derive substantial public subsidies. * * * Alarm over firework injuries \u2013 Fireworks should have to carry graphic warnings and be sold in plain packaging to stop people getting maimed, NHS surgeons have said. A&amp;E units are likely to end up treating those injured on bonfire night next Tuesday because fireworks have been misused or exploded near people. \u201cHand surgeons see devastating injuries caused by fireworks throughout the winter months, with people often losing large portions of their hand,\u201d said David Newington, president of the British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH). Mark Henley, president of Britain\u2019s plastic surgeons\u2019 association, said: \u201cAlthough packaged as toys, these are serious explosives, and the types of reconstructive surgery being required would not be out of place in a war zone.\u201d * * * Trump dumps big apple \u2013 Donald Trump has officially changed his primary place of residence from Trump Tower, New York, to Mar-a-Lago, Florida. \u201cI cherish New York,\u201d Trump tweeted, but \u201cdespite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state.\u201d New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, replied: \u201cGood riddance. It\u2019s not like [Trump] paid taxes here anyway ... He\u2019s all yours, Florida.\u201d The US House of Representatives has voted as expected to carry on with impeachment proceedings against the nascent Floridian. Meanwhile on the 2020 election trail, Kamala Harris has been taking drastic action to boost her flagging campaign for the Democratic nomination. But Harris has faced daunting odds before: in 2003 she had a polling average of 5% when entered the race for district attorney of San Francisco. By the end she had become California\u2019s first African American DA. Today in Focus podcast: Trafficked into UK slavery Last week 39 people were found dead in a refrigerated lorry trailer in Essex. Annie Kelly discusses the case of Minh, a Vietnamese teenager who was trafficked into the UK in 2013 and found himself enslaved on a cannabis farm. Plus: Robert Kitson on England making it to the Rugby World Cup final. Lunchtime read: A sit-down with De Niro and Pacino Do Robert Niro and Al Pacino still enjoy the job? De Niro is pithy: \u201cIt\u2019s different, but I like it just as much.\u201d Pacino goes long: \u201cIt sort of depends on what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI hate to say it, but you can go 20 years between inspirations.\u201d He stops for a moment, baffled by his own eloquence. \u201cBear with me \u2013 I\u2019m going through the bushes here and I\u2019ll come out with something.\u201d He says he is always on the lookout \u201cto find something that you really connect to, you really want to do\u201d. De Niro nods along furiously. Pacino is in the groove. \u201cSometimes I feel I know nothing about acting. Until you start. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting for me. A new character. I often say: \u2018Desire is more motivating than talent.\u2019 I\u2019ve seen people with great desire take it through. The truth is, it\u2019s the same thing that is always was: you are feeling this new character, this new person, this new story.\u201d As he grinds to a halt, Pacino looks pleased: he has come out with something all right. It is a great manifesto for a living legend. The actors spoke to Andrew Pulver while promoting The Irishman, directed by Martin Scorsese. Sport James Vince put in a man-of-the-match performance with 59 from 38 balls to steer England to a seven-wicket win over New Zealand in the first T20 international in Christchurch. Eddie Jones has urged his England players to play with no fear and inspire the nation by seizing World Cup glory when they meet South Africa in Saturday\u2019s final. Jones\u2019s squad have defied rugby stereotypes after pushing boundaries on and off the field, while the Springboks coach, Rassie Erasmus, says victory for his team would help heal divisions in their country. Warren Gatland and Steve Hansen, the Wales and New Zealand coaches, are both taking their final bows in Friday\u2019s bronze medal match and are expected to play with the safety valve off. Max Verstappen has hit back at Lewis Hamilton, calling the British world champion disrespectful for comments he made after winning the Mexican Grand Prix. Arsenal produced a superb exhibition of attacking football to beat Slavia Prague 8-0 and move into the Champions League quarter-finals 13-2 on aggregate. And a thrilling climax may have made up for the dreary start, but this year\u2019s World Series offered no refuge from the broader problems facing baseball at the dawn of a new decade. Business Asian shares have reversed early losses after an unexpected bounce in Chinese manufacturing activity. Earlier, losses had mirrored falls in global stock markets after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.52%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.30% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.14%.

It came relatively easy, as those things go.\u201d</p> <p>When it is his turn to talk, De Niro is all business. The Irishman, it would appear, is as much his show as Scorsese\u2019s. He explains how he nagged Pesci on to the film, despite him having all but retired: \u201cI said: \u2018Come on, we\u2019re not going to do this ever again.\u2019\u201d Sentiment is not his thing. \u201cIt was tough enough to get it done, to get the money to do it and everything.

But, bizarrely enough, Pacino and Scorsese had never worked together before. For two such high-profile princes of the Italian-American sensibility, that feels like a mistake. \u201cI know,\u201d rumbles Pacino, leaning in and turning worldly-wise. \u201cLike everything in this business, if you\u2019ve been in it for a while, you realise that things get started, but then they go in different places and they don\u2019t always culminate in a film.

It is a great manifesto for a living legend.</p> <p>As the encounter starts to wind down, one big question \u2013 arguably the biggest \u2013 remains unasked. If it is about anything, The Irishman is about the gangsterisation of US politics, how the Cosa Nostra exploited opportunities to corrupt the electoral process and organised labour. Two big killings \u2013 those of John F Kennedy and Hoffa \u2013 are characterised as the outcome of mafia intervention in the political sphere. Some might say the US is still living with the legacy; as De Niro\u2019s version of Sheeran likes to say: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d De Niro has a record on this: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/08/robert-de-niro-id-like-to-punch-donald-trump-in-the-face-video\" title=\"\">we know he hates Trump and has called him out time after time</a>. But the way he suddenly takes over the room is amazing to behold: eyes like gun-sights, he gives Trump both barrels. \u201cWe have a real, immediate problem in that we have a gangster president who thinks he can do anything he wants.\u201d De Niro is livid; Pacino knows to keep quiet. \u201cIf he actually gets away with it, then we all have a problem. The gall of the people around him who actually defend him, these Republicans, is appalling.\u201d He does not call Trump a \u201cmook\u201d, but he may as well have.</p> <p>Instead, he has a message for the press: \u201cIt\u2019s a resentment of people like you guys, writing about what you see is obvious gangsterism. They don\u2019t like that, so they say: \u2018Fuck you, we\u2019re going to teach you people.\u2019 And they have to know they\u2019re going to be taught.\u201d This is De Niro unfiltered, and it is thrilling to experience it at close quarters. Does he think Trump will go to jail? \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see him in jail. I don\u2019t want him to die. I want him to go to jail.\u201d</p> <p>And with that the Al and Bob show closes. De Niro abruptly resumes his affable persona and says goodbye; he and Pacino are swiftly escorted out. Trump \u2013 we can but hope \u2013 is quaking in his boots. But The Irishman roadshow rolls on. It is what it is.</p> <p><em>The Irishman is released in UK cinemas on 8 November and is on Netflix from 27 November</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018Hi guys and girls,\u201d says Al Pacino brightly, making his entrance. He is sporting a veteran-boho look: what seems like about six black cardigans on top of each other, lots of chunky finger jewellery and messy bird\u2019s-nest hair. There may even be one of those two-inch ponytails that were popular in the late 80s in there somewhere \u2013 it is hard to see in the general tonsorial disorder. Next to stroll in is Robert De Niro, who \u2013 in dramatic contrast \u2013 looks like he has come in from a round of golf: shirt and sports jacket, grey-white hair slicked back. Welcome, then, to the Al and Bob show. Observing them here, in an intimate room full of selected journalists, you see how their personalities contrast as much as their dress sense. Pacino speaks in a barely audible bass rumble and is not short of waffle; De Niro, while not exactly monosyllabic, spends as much time nodding with his distinctive pursed-mouth underbite and says as little as he can get away with. That is, until we got on to the matter of a certain US president, of which more later. The pair \u2013 the film industry\u2019s equivalent of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards \u2013 are bona fide living legends, the greatest US actors of their generation, able to wipe the floor with modern lightweights such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Daniel Day-Lewis. Or that is what we would like to believe, anyway. Today, they have rolled into London as the main attraction on the press roadshow for The Irishman, Martin Scorsese\u2019s monumental new gangster picture \u2013 and there is a lot to get through. \u201cWow,\u201d says Pacino at one point, casting his mind back across the pair\u2019s career-long relationship. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a really long time.\u201d For years, The Irishman was little more than a rumour; plagued by delays, distractions and drop-outs, it looked odds-on never to make it out of the starting gate. But, like a wiseguy fitted with a cement overcoat, it has landed thunderously in the middle of the autumn season, blowing away the rest of the awards-bait dross. The Irishman is the fourth in Scorsese\u2019s series of epic mafia pictures, following Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino; it is the latest variant of Scorsese\u2019s reinvention of mob life as an agonised stations of the cross. It is also the wintriest of character studies, contemplating (like Scorsese\u2019s last film, Silence) the approach of death with equanimity. The CGI that Scorsese added to \u201cde-age\u201d his actors, and the deal that the director made with Netflix to fund it, has unexpectedly put his film in the same camp as cutting-edge industry disrupters. Scorsese himself has acquired new cultural currency in recent months: the naked homage/appropriation by the makers of Joker has driven attention to his string of 70s masterworks, while his dismissive comments about superhero movies (\u201cnot cinema\u201d) \u2013 the first shots in the publicity campaign for The Irishman, as it happens \u2013 ignited a social media firestorm that is yet to die down. Yet, more fundamental than any of this is the sense that The Irishman is a landmark reunion of the old neighbourhood: a last gathering of the clans, a final get-together before age and time overtakes them. Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci play ageing mob bosses, Pacino is a notorious union boss, Jimmy Hoffa, and De Niro is the Irishman, ice-cold real-life hitman Frank Sheeran. The Irishman turns on the relationship between Hoffa, whose disappearance and presumed murder in 1975 remains unsolved, and Sheeran, a hitherto little-known mob figure who confessed to killing Hoffa, his longtime friend, to the lawyer Charles Brandt, who included it in his 2004 biography of Sheeran, I Heard You Paint Houses. Hoffa and Sheeran provide suitably substantial figures for Pacino and De Niro to renew their on-screen confrontation, most vividly portrayed in the 1995 Michael Mann thriller Heat (the 2008 cop comedy Righteous Kill was slightly less memorable). Pacino says they met in 1968; at the time, Pacino was a firebrand stage actor yet to feature in films, while De Niro was doing wacky avant-garde movies such as Brian De Palma\u2019s Greetings. \u201cEarly on in our careers, we connected from time to time and we found we had similar things happening to us,\u201d says Pacino. \u201cOur lives took on a whole different kind of thing.\u201d It was camaraderie, he says, that \u201cgot us together\u201d. Looking back, their acting careers did seem to blossom with a mysterious symbiosis. Both acquired a reputation in their teens as a troublemaker: De Niro spent much of his youth in Little Italy, Manhattan; Pacino, three years older, grew up in the Bronx. Both scored major breakthroughs in the early 70s courtesy of the Italian-American presence in the Hollywood new wave: Pacino as the flint-hearted capo-in-waiting in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s gangster epic The Godfather in 1972, De Niro as a knockaround guy in Scorsese\u2019s Mean Streets a year later. The two appeared in the same film for the first time, although not together, in Coppola\u2019s Godfather sequel in 1974: De Niro played the young version of Pacino\u2019s father. Pacino gets a little dewy eyed; he looks a bit like a panda with a secret sorrow. \u201cWe\u2019re really close.

If it is about anything, The Irishman is about the gangsterisation of US politics, how the Cosa Nostra exploited opportunities to corrupt the electoral process and organised labour. Two big killings \u2013 those of John F Kennedy and Hoffa \u2013 are characterised as the outcome of mafia intervention in the political sphere. Some might say the US is still living with the legacy; as De Niro\u2019s version of Sheeran likes to say: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d De Niro has a record on this: we know he hates Trump and has called him out time after time. But the way he suddenly takes over the room is amazing to behold: eyes like gun-sights, he gives Trump both barrels. \u201cWe have a real, immediate problem in that we have a gangster president who thinks he can do anything he wants.\u201d De Niro is livid; Pacino knows to keep quiet. \u201cIf he actually gets away with it, then we all have a problem. The gall of the people around him who actually defend him, these Republicans, is appalling.\u201d He does not call Trump a \u201cmook\u201d, but he may as well have. Instead, he has a message for the press: \u201cIt\u2019s a resentment of people like you guys, writing about what you see is obvious gangsterism. They don\u2019t like that, so they say: \u2018Fuck you, we\u2019re going to teach you people.\u2019 And they have to know they\u2019re going to be taught.\u201d This is De Niro unfiltered, and it is thrilling to experience it at close quarters. Does he think Trump will go to jail? \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see him in jail. I don\u2019t want him to die. I want him to go to jail.\u201d And with that the Al and Bob show closes. De Niro abruptly resumes his affable persona and says goodbye; he and Pacino are swiftly escorted out. Trump \u2013 we can but hope \u2013 is quaking in his boots. But The Irishman roadshow rolls on. It is what it is. The Irishman is released in UK cinemas on 8 November and is on Netflix from 27 November",

The three find themselves hanging out \u00e0 trois, with Lucy suspecting, with icy displeasure, that Teiji is attracted to the vacuous Lily. The tension starts to ratchet up towards violence. There are some interesting and startling moments, particularly a shocking accident concerning a flight of stairs. Vikander is very believable as Lucy, a contained and enclosed personality and someone who finds Japanese culture congenial to her need to retreat from a painful past. Keough and Kobayashi are also good, though their roles perhaps under-imagined. I was less taken with the wait-is-this-really-happening moments that tend to undermine the emotional currency in which the drama is presented to us. Some real tremors, though. \u2022 Earthquake Bird is in UK and US cinemas on 1 November.",

Most poorer people seek to send their dead to the one closest to their home, in the interests of both convenience of visits and keeping down costs \u2013 but if your closest public cemetery is full you must incur the extra costs yourself of travelling further afield. Even ambulances charge a fee. Meanwhile, Saiman says, private cemeteries are popping up for those who can afford them, including \u201cluxury parks\u201d such as San Diego Hills in Karawang, West Java, where a burial \u2013 including coffin, embalming, certification and licence \u2013 can cost more than 26m rupiah. At Karet Bivak, Saiman says, it costs between 10,000 and 25,000 rupiah to license a plot for three years, but for extra care there are hundreds of informal caretakers \u2013 often below the poverty line themselves \u2013 who make their living providing grave maintenance as \u201cfreelancers\u201d, and in many cases live in the cemetery itself. In east Jakarta, the predominantly Chinese Kebon Nanas cemetery is home to as many as 200 people. With its active service economy, signposted subdivisions and food carts and stalls at each gate, the cemetery is like a central neighbourhood. For many residents it is also their most accessible open green space. Jakarta has less than 5% green space, forcing people in search of respite from the pace and pollution of the city into cemeteries; last year a party in an east Jakarta graveyard, complete with sound system and marquees, prompted a rebuke from the city administration. Building more cemeteries could be a huge opportunity for the city, says Dr Mohamad Reza Mohamed Afla, a senior lecturer at Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang who specialises in burial land management. Cities across south-east Asia are facing the same issue of overcrowding \u2013 in Singapore, stacking has been mandated for many years, while Kuala Lumpur is considering it \u2013 but he says Jakarta is at an advantage in that many of its public cemeteries are centrally located and residents and authorities already recognise their value as public space. \u201cIn Jakarta, the local people live close to them, so they really have a social value,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople just hang out there \u2013 in Kuala Lumpur, we don\u2019t do that.\u201d He argues that cemeteries also create jobs and help reduce the impact of heat, adding that a truly liveable city is one that ensures its residents\u2019 wellbeing into the afterlife.

While America is slowly warming up to Middle Eastern art and culture (a new not-for-profit in Washington dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/arts-and-culture-center\">Middle Eastern art</a> opened in September, while an exhibition of <a href=\"https://iranhumanrights.org/2019/10/iranian-women-artists-showcased-in-upcoming-exhibit-curated-by-shirin-neshat/\">female Iranian artists</a> is opening next week at the High Line Nine in New York), the 1991 Gulf war\u2019s devastating impact has yet to be fully explored within art \u2013 at least that which has been shared with a wider western audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1820f902d710e8c030801779124eba35c4a46280\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1820f902d710e8c030801779124eba35c4a46280/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Hirschhorn \u2013 CNN, from 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Hirschhorn \u2013 CNN, from 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nadja Sayej</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The exhibition moves chronologically throughout three floors, beginning with paintings by Khalifa Qattan, the first ever Kuwaiti artist to have a solo exhibition.

      "bodyText": "As you walk into Moma PS1 in Queens, New York, visitors are greeted with an unlikely wall sculpture \u2013 the CNN logo at the end of an oversized gold chain. It\u2019s great for a selfie op, but there\u2019s a deeper meaning to the artwork, created in 2002 by Thomas Hirschhorn. CNN played a pivotal role in accelerating the 24-hour news coverage of the Gulf war, setting the pace for war news. This artwork is being shown as part of Theater of Operations: the Gulf Wars, 1991\u20132011, featuring over 250 artworks by 75 artists. It details the tragic, gruesome effects of war, as told by western and Middle Eastern artists. \u201cWe realized there hasn\u2019t been a major survey of Iraqi art in the US,\u201d said Peter Eleey, who co-curated the exhibition with Ruba Katrib. \u201cEveryone wants to talk about the current conflict, but this conflict has been going on for 30 years. We\u2019re looking at what an artist on one side of an issue makes, versus another, sometimes on the same event.\u201d With the recent killing of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and with US troops leaving northern Syria and being deployed in eastern Syria, America\u2019s military presence is as topical as ever. But for the artists who lived in Kuwait and Iraq in the 1990s, what was it like to live through such horror? \u201cIt\u2019s timely but also belated, because this has not been addressed culturally,\u201d said Katrib. \u201cIraqi art has not been addressed; Iraqi cultural production hasn\u2019t been addressed either. But the US has been entangled in Iraq for three decades, so why has there been such a lack of representation, interest, or time and space given to Iraqi cultural production?\u201d Good question. While America is slowly warming up to Middle Eastern art and culture (a new not-for-profit in Washington dedicated to Middle Eastern art opened in September, while an exhibition of female Iranian artists is opening next week at the High Line Nine in New York), the 1991 Gulf war\u2019s devastating impact has yet to be fully explored within art \u2013 at least that which has been shared with a wider western audience. The exhibition moves chronologically throughout three floors, beginning with paintings by Khalifa Qattan, the first ever Kuwaiti artist to have a solo exhibition. On view are paintings from his Prophecy series, made between the 1960s and 1980s, which were premonitions of war. One self-portrait from 1984 shows the artist behind bars, a metaphor for the occupation of Kuwait. \u201cOnce Iraq invaded Kuwait, he redefined his older work and claimed they were prophecies of the coming invasion,\u201d said Katrib. Some artists in the exhibition were exiled, while some created their work from studios in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s about the proximity artists have to conflict,\u201d said Eleey. \u201cNot all the artists are making art from inside of Iraq during the war.

It was distributed ahead of the American intervention, but after activists were arrested \u2013 and two were executed \u2013 Al-Baqsami stopped making the poster.

      "body": "<p>Apple gatecrashes the fast-growing global streaming business on Friday with the launch of Apple TV+, offering a free service on all new Apple devices for the first year. </p> <p>The Silicon Valley giant has pulled out all the stops to promote the service, which launches in 100 countries on Friday, with the stars of its flagship new series The Morning Show, Jennifer Aniston and Reece Witherspoon, spearheading the publicity push on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Apple has earmarked about $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) to produce original programming over the the next few years \u2013 compared to the BBC\u2019s annual TV budget of \u00a31.7bn \u2013 but its library will be just a fraction the size of Netflix and Amazon which spend a combined $20bn annually.</p> <p>The phone and computer giant, however, is aiming to be a prestige brand, akin to the strategy employed successfully for decades by Game of Thrones to Chernobyl-maker HBO.</p> <p>Apple has paid $240m for two series of the Morning Show comedy drama - Aniston\u2019s first TV series since leaving Friends - and hopes to attract fans by releasing fewer, high quality original shows than the Netflix juggernaut.</p> <p>The new service hasn\u2019t exactly got off to a flying start with the first four shows released to critics \u2013 including the $15m-per-episode sci-fi See with Jason Momoa and Dickinson, a comedy drama about a young Emily Dickinson \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/29/dickinson-review-emily-dickinson-reborn-as-a-lizzo-loving-feminist\">receiving pretty average reviews</a>.</p> <p>To counter the lack of content firepower, Apple has a two-pronged strategy. It will offer the cheapest service \u2013 at \u00a34.99 it is significantly cheaper than Netflix\u2019s most popular UK tariff of \u00a38.99 \u2013 and it will give it away for free for a year to customers who buy a new Apple device, which includes more than 100m new iPhones every year in the US and Europe alone.</p> <p>But the potential total market is huge: there are about 900m iPhones in use around the world and 500m other Apple devices.</p> <p>\u201cThey have come to the video market very late and Netflix really has stolen a march,\u201d says Neil Campling, head of global technology, media and telecoms at Mirabaud Securities. \u201cThey are pricing it very cutely as they are aware that their offering is probably substandard in a very crowded market. Giving it away for free will to a degree mask whether it is seen as a success or failure in the first couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>Netflix, which earlier this year raised its prices in major markets including the US and UK, is already beginning to feel the heat. Campling believes 2019 could mark the first time in the company\u2019s 22 history that it adds fewer new subscribers than the previous year.</p> <p>Nevertheless, with a $15bn annual budget Netflix has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/20/netflix-spend-500m-british-made-tv-shows-films\">plenty of content firepower to unleash</a> as new rivals emerge. This month will see the return of The Crown, a flagship series for the service and its fans, as well as Martin Scorsese\u2019s potential Oscar contender The Irishman, which stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.</p> <p>In less than two weeks\u2019 time Disney will make its move into streaming with Disney+ due to debut in the US and Netherlands on 12 November. The world\u2019s biggest entertainment company is flexing its content muscles on day one with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/23/the-mandalorian-disney-unveils-trailer-for-star-wars-tv-series\">debut of the $100m Star Wars live action TV series, The Mandalorian</a>.</p> <p>No launch date has yet been set for the UK because Disney still has TV and movie licensing deals in place for its content to air on Sky.</p> <p>Disney\u2019s vast content library \u2013 from the Marvel universe, Pixar films, family fare from Toy Story to Frozen and TV hits such as The Simpsons \u2013 make it arguably the biggest threat among the new wave of streaming launches. It\u2019s also priced to pull in viewers: in the US it will be $6.99 a month, almost half the cost of Netflix\u2019s most popular US package of $12.99 and not much more than Apple.</p> <p>Other new streaming services are coming soon.

      "bodyText": "Apple gatecrashes the fast-growing global streaming business on Friday with the launch of Apple TV+, offering a free service on all new Apple devices for the first year. The Silicon Valley giant has pulled out all the stops to promote the service, which launches in 100 countries on Friday, with the stars of its flagship new series The Morning Show, Jennifer Aniston and Reece Witherspoon, spearheading the publicity push on both sides of the Atlantic. Apple has earmarked about $6bn (\u00a34.6bn) to produce original programming over the the next few years \u2013 compared to the BBC\u2019s annual TV budget of \u00a31.7bn \u2013 but its library will be just a fraction the size of Netflix and Amazon which spend a combined $20bn annually. The phone and computer giant, however, is aiming to be a prestige brand, akin to the strategy employed successfully for decades by Game of Thrones to Chernobyl-maker HBO. Apple has paid $240m for two series of the Morning Show comedy drama - Aniston\u2019s first TV series since leaving Friends - and hopes to attract fans by releasing fewer, high quality original shows than the Netflix juggernaut. The new service hasn\u2019t exactly got off to a flying start with the first four shows released to critics \u2013 including the $15m-per-episode sci-fi See with Jason Momoa and Dickinson, a comedy drama about a young Emily Dickinson \u2013 receiving pretty average reviews. To counter the lack of content firepower, Apple has a two-pronged strategy. It will offer the cheapest service \u2013 at \u00a34.99 it is significantly cheaper than Netflix\u2019s most popular UK tariff of \u00a38.99 \u2013 and it will give it away for free for a year to customers who buy a new Apple device, which includes more than 100m new iPhones every year in the US and Europe alone. But the potential total market is huge: there are about 900m iPhones in use around the world and 500m other Apple devices. \u201cThey have come to the video market very late and Netflix really has stolen a march,\u201d says Neil Campling, head of global technology, media and telecoms at Mirabaud Securities. \u201cThey are pricing it very cutely as they are aware that their offering is probably substandard in a very crowded market. Giving it away for free will to a degree mask whether it is seen as a success or failure in the first couple of years.\u201d Netflix, which earlier this year raised its prices in major markets including the US and UK, is already beginning to feel the heat. Campling believes 2019 could mark the first time in the company\u2019s 22 history that it adds fewer new subscribers than the previous year. Nevertheless, with a $15bn annual budget Netflix has plenty of content firepower to unleash as new rivals emerge. This month will see the return of The Crown, a flagship series for the service and its fans, as well as Martin Scorsese\u2019s potential Oscar contender The Irishman, which stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In less than two weeks\u2019 time Disney will make its move into streaming with Disney+ due to debut in the US and Netherlands on 12 November. The world\u2019s biggest entertainment company is flexing its content muscles on day one with the debut of the $100m Star Wars live action TV series, The Mandalorian. No launch date has yet been set for the UK because Disney still has TV and movie licensing deals in place for its content to air on Sky. Disney\u2019s vast content library \u2013 from the Marvel universe, Pixar films, family fare from Toy Story to Frozen and TV hits such as The Simpsons \u2013 make it arguably the biggest threat among the new wave of streaming launches. It\u2019s also priced to pull in viewers: in the US it will be $6.99 a month, almost half the cost of Netflix\u2019s most popular US package of $12.99 and not much more than Apple. Other new streaming services are coming soon. By the end of the year ITV and the BBC will introduce Britbox, a \u00a35.99-a-month offer that promises a best-of-British experience from Victoria to Love Island. Next year there will be two more: HBO Max (which won\u2019t be launching in the UK) and NBC Universal\u2019s Peacock, leading to a growing belief that consumers are heading towards subscription streaming burnout. Analysts believe that overall, including traditional pay-TV, the number of services viewers will be willing to pay for will settle at three to five. \u201cPeople can only watch so much and I believe that we\u2019re on the edge of multiple subscription fatigue,\u201d says Henry Daglish, chief executive of media agency Bountiful Cow. \u201cI think they will find it much harder than they think it might be.\u201d Apple\u2019s cheaper price point is a way of building an audience quickly, according to Tom Harrington, a senior research analyst at Enders Analysis. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to get to scale very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically giving it away for free. Apple wants to make the app a destination and once you\u2019re there you sign up for third-party subscription and then Apple takes a cut. It\u2019s a gateway to entertainment.\u201d Netflix\u2019s recent missed subscriber targets are not a positive sign for Apple, according to Harrington, who says for UK users, Apple TV+ will be an additional bonus or secondary streaming service \u2013 not something that replaces Netflix. \u201cThey\u2019ve got scale, they\u2019re making more than anyone else, they understand what shows work in streaming \u2013 more than anyone else does,\u201d he says of Netflix. \u201cBut in developed markets like the US and the UK, growth is difficult and if growth is slowing for Netflix, and you\u2019re coming in and being supplementary to them, it\u2019s going to be hard for you.\u201d Cost of major streaming services Netflix standard tier: \u00a38.99 a month, \u00a3108 annually Content Stranger Things, The Crown Amazon Prime (based on cheaper annual tariff) \u00a36.58, \u00a379 Content Good Omens, Man in the High Castle, The Grand Tour New launches: Britbox \u00a35.99, \u00a372 Content Love Island, Gavin &amp; Stacey, Victoria Disney+ \u00a35.99, \u00a372 Content Star Wars, Avengers, The Simpson, Avatar AppleTV+ \u00a34.99, \u00a360 Content The Morning Show, See, Dickinson plus shows from Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg HBO Max $15, $180 Content Friends (US only, for now), Big Little Lies, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, the DC universe including Batman and Superman NBC Universal \u00a37, \u00a384 (estimated) Content US version of The Office, films such as Jurassic Park and Fast and the Furious",

      "bodyText": "New York is set to build more than 250 new bike lanes and add 1m sq ft (92,903 sq meters) of pedestrian space in a landmark move designed to \u201cbreak the car culture\u201d of the city. The city council passed legislation this week that will see $1.7bn invested in road infrastructure over 10 years in a move that it is hoped will transform city streets and dramatically improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. The New York city council speaker, Corey Johnson, who introduced the \u201cstreets master plan\u201d bill and is anticipated to run for mayor in 2021, said after the vote: \u201cThe way we plan our streets now makes no sense and New Yorkers pay the price every day, stuck on slow buses or risking their own safety cycling without protected bike lanes \u2026 I want to completely revolutionise how we share our street space, and that\u2019s what this bill does. \u201cThis is a roadmap to breaking the car culture in a thoughtful, comprehensive way, and I am so proud to pass this bill today.\u201d While cycling is on the rise in New York \u2013 the number who ride several times a month grew by 26% between 2012 and 2017, according to the city\u2019s most recent cycling trends report \u2013 more cyclists are dying. So far this year there have been 25 cyclist deaths, the highest number in 20 years, and pedestrian and cyclist fatalities have risen by 24%. The new law requires the city to release and carry out a \u201cmaster plan\u201d every five years that prioritises street safety, public transport use, cutting vehicle emissions and access for people with disabilities. The first plan, due in December 2021, will include 150 miles of bus lanes protected either physically or by camera and 250 miles of protected bike lanes \u2013 meaning they are physically separated from traffic \u2013 over five years, improved bus stops and passenger information and changes to traffic lights to speed up buses. Within the first two years, the plan pledges to create more than 1m sq ft of pedestrian space. The second, due in 2026, will commit to a full, connected cycle lane network, protected bus lanes on all viable routes and accessible pedestrian signals at 2,500 intersections in five years. While New York has some way to go before it can compete with cycle-friendly leaders such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, the new law marks a significant moment for the city, which has prioritised cars since the 1920s. Marco te Br\u00f6mmelstroet, professor in urban mobility futures at the University of Amsterdam and academic director of Urban Cycling Institute, said the change in approach represents a \u201cradical shift in the logic that underlies choices in the design of street infrastructure\u201d. He added: \u201cWhere there is a century-long tradition in the US, and in much of the world that followed examples from the US, that puts the speed and efficient flow of vehicles central, and that made travel times the undisputed central goal of infrastructure planning, this new law seems to make this secondary to choices that put justice central.\u201d He said New York has the potential to set an \u201cinspiring example\u201d to other US cities if it can show that the law not only functions but also has a positive impact on other aspects of society. Nearly 800,000 New Yorkers cycle regularly, according to city statistics. It is estimated that more than 490,000 bicycle trips are made every day in the city \u2013 three times more than the number made 15 years ago. As of last year, there were a total of 1,240 miles of bike lanes in the city \u2013 480 of which were protected. Meanwhile, use of Citi Bike, New York\u2019s on-street cycle hire scheme, is on the rise. Close to 2.5m trips were made in September, with an average of 80,475 a day. In comparison, September 2018 saw nearly 1.9m trips and an average of 62,616 trips a day. But safety remains an issue for many riders and potential cyclists amid increased congestion on roads \u2013 in part because of services such as Uber and Lyft \u2013 and a crisis on the subway. Jon Orcutt, a spokesman for Bike New York, said the new measures, especially protected bike lanes, will save lives and encourage more people to cycle. \u201cThe traffic in the rest of the street is so heavy that if you want to really build cycling into an option for people, other than the small number of courageous souls who are willing to throw elbows with taxis and trucks, you have to give people separation from the vehicles.\u201d During the evening commute on the Williamsburg stretch of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, a popular cycle lane, both cyclists and drivers said they were in favour of more protected cycle lanes. Alex Price, 24, who works in emergency construction and lives in Brooklyn, said: \u201cIt\u2019s always this game of should I get on the pavement or should I stay on the street?

Waiting to collect a passenger nearby, taxi driver Andre Locke, 20, from Queens, said he supports protected cycle lanes. \u201cI say make it so that if someone wants to ride their bike in the street that they stay in the bike lane \u2026 If they do that, there\u2019ll be less people getting hit.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In recent years, a zeitgeist shift surrounding the way we talk about postpartum bodies has stormed through culture. The preoccupation with \u201cbouncing back\u201d after the birth of a baby, while not completely erased, has begun to fade. In its place, a dialogue borne mainly through social media encourages grace, acceptance, and self-love for women whose bodies have changed in the wake of growing a human. <em>You made a person. Of course things are different. Wear these changes with pride</em>, the messages say.</p> <p>It\u2019s a well-intended and much-needed societal shift \u2013 women needn\u2019t expect themselves to return to their pre-partum body overnight, if ever. But unfortunately there are countless women who may not feel included by these mantras about loving your postpartum body, as they imply one crucial element: a live birth.</p> <p>One in four pregnancies result in miscarriage and one in 100 in stillbirth. So there are millions of women who also experience bodily changes during pregnancy \u2013 those who were pregnant, and looked pregnant, but were left with empty arms. With no tangible evidence of what their pregnancy created, messages of pride and bodily acceptance may not resonate.</p> <p>What happens to our inner dialogue about our bodies when we don\u2019t have the proof of a \u201csuccessful\u201d pregnancy to offer the world \u2013 and ourselves? What does it feel like to live in a once-pregnant body after loss, when there is no baby to show for it? These bodies are still changed, and they continue changing, but they are now also imprinted with a life lost. There probably isn\u2019t room for the ideas of grace, gratitude and being kind to yourself in the moment when breast milk comes in with no baby to feed, or when the feeling of fetal movement is replaced by an empty uterus, and when the weight gain that began with so much promise reverses (or doesn\u2019t). Their bodies have changed exponentially, but with no baby to prove why. It can all feel so futile.</p> <p>The strident trifecta of silence, stigma and shame that shroud the topic of pregnancy loss prevent open dialogue and emotional support about these physical changes. This can complicate often already fraught relationships with our bodies, as women burrow their reactions, which can mutate into guilt, embarrassment and self-blame.</p> <p>This is made worse by the fact that pregnancy and childbirth are typically narrativized as inherently natural \u2013 a pedestrian experience all women can undertake. It\u2019s a promise that simply isn\u2019t true, as many women find out first-hand. \u201cThe purpose of my body is to have a baby and it could not,\u201d says Christina, 33, who has had two miscarriages in the first trimester. \u201cI keep telling my wife: <em>I have a body that is not useful. I am supposed to be able to have babies and I can\u2019t stay pregnant. What is the point of this body</em>?\u201d In a culture that does not openly talk about miscarriage \u2013 which, too, is natural and common \u2013 thoughts like Christina\u2019s can affect self-image. There is no blueprint for how to exist in one\u2019s skin post-loss. Lowri, 33, who has had three miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy, explains: \u201cI have way more negative feelings about my body since my losses, because of what I feel my body should have been able to do. Every time I have a loss, I feel a little more disconnected from my physical self. I find myself sometimes wishing I didn\u2019t <em>have</em> a body, because I am so betrayed and hurt by it.\u201d</p> <p>These feelings of betrayal can morph into an intolerance for one\u2019s body and even an inability to look at it. The reflection becomes, in part, a projection of our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. \u201cI was disgusted with my body after losing my babies,\u201d says Kristen, 34, whose twins were born still. \u201cSeeing myself in the mirror was embarrassing. I felt ashamed. I felt like a failure.\u201d These emotions are not uncommon following pregnancy loss. Still, the trap of self-blame grabs many who experience it. \u201cWhen I look at my belly, I see my loss,\u201d says Dana, 33, who had a first-trimester miscarriage. \u201cI blame myself. I am angry with my body,\u201d she says. Rhylee, 26, who had a stillbirth and a miscarriage, can relate. \u201cFor months, I couldn\u2019t bear to look into my own eyes because I was too afraid of what I would see. They say the eyes are the window to your soul, and I didn\u2019t feel like I had a soul. I\u2019m <em>still</em> angry with my body, and with myself, too.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, there is no clear medical explanation for why a loss happens, and since human nature craves answers, women may accuse their bodies of betrayal. \u201cI learned that unexplained miscarriages can be caused by something underlying with the mother, so I began to blame myself,\u201d says Alyssa, 32, who had a second-trimester miscarriage. \u201cI have struggled ever since with guilt and shame that my body failed me. And my body held on tight to the pregnancy after it ended, which I really resented. It now feels impossible to look at myself and not nitpick at every single thing. When I look in the mirror, I don\u2019t recognize who I am.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the changes of pregnancy reverse can be just as difficult as seeing reminders of it. The disappearing signs can be seen as an erasure of the experience. \u201cIt was devastating to bounce back after my first loss. To have my body return to what it was before. It was almost cruel how fast it happened,\u201d says Beth, 35, who lost a pregnancy to placental abruption and terminated another for medical reasons in an emergency c-section. Jenn, 46, fought her body\u2019s attempts to return to her pre-pregnancy state after her full-term stillbirth. \u201cI held onto the weight for as long as I could. It was my emotional blanket. It was proof that my daughter really existed,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While pregnancy can be physically unpleasant for some, when it is lost, even the hard parts are missed. \u201cAfter the losses, I had a desire to still feel pregnancy symptoms, even the ones that had been difficult while living through them,\u201d says Cristella, 32, who has had two first-trimester miscarriages. \u201cI wanted to be pregnant still, and now I wasn\u2019t. My body was mine again, but at what cost?\u201d And as pregnancy symptoms go from nausea and exhaustion to fetal kicks and wiggles, these emotions evolve. \u201cNo longer feeling the movement in my womb after the twins died may have been the worst part,\u201d says Kristen.</p> <p>With later losses, the body is essentially unaware that the baby didn\u2019t survive, and behaves as a postpartum body does. \u201cWhen my milk came in, after my stillbirth, I thought I could be a hero to someone else\u2019s baby by pumping and donating it,\u201d says Rhylee. \u201cBut after leaving the hospital, I just couldn\u2019t. I was so bitter, so angry. I couldn\u2019t allow someone else to have this milk. This milk was for <em>my </em>baby.\u201d Plus, the physical evidence of birth becomes an intense private trauma when there isn\u2019t a live baby. For Beth, the scar from the emergency c-section during her loss haunted her. \u201cThe scar stared at me. I cried every time I took a shower. I had so much self-hate around this tiny incision. Others didn\u2019t see it, but I couldn\u2019t hide it from myself. I looked normal, so people thought I <em>was</em> normal. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>When one has been visibly pregnant, and then no longer is, the comments that come in can be inadvertently gutting. \u201cI shared the news that I was no longer pregnant, but people still thought I was,\u201d says Brittany, 33, who terminated for medical reasons. She became obsessed with trying to lose weight in order to avoid having to explain her situation. \u201cI was going through body dysmorphia. I had an empty body because of the loss of my son, and all I wanted was to look as non-pregnant as possible.\u201d Well-meaning comments are often the most unwelcome. Rhylee recalls a family member saying: \u201c<em>Wow, you look so good, you don\u2019t even look like you just had a baby!</em> I was depressed and hardly eating. Don\u2019t you think I wish I was still big? Don\u2019t you think I wish I was still pregnant?\u201d</p> <p>Some women go on to conceive a healthy pregnancy, which can aid in the restoration of their self-image. Beth recently had a baby who was born through the same c-section incision as the son she lost. \u201cThis has helped change my relationship with my scar,\u201d she says. \u201cI no longer look at it with disdain or guilt.

      "bodyText": "In recent years, a zeitgeist shift surrounding the way we talk about postpartum bodies has stormed through culture. The preoccupation with \u201cbouncing back\u201d after the birth of a baby, while not completely erased, has begun to fade. In its place, a dialogue borne mainly through social media encourages grace, acceptance, and self-love for women whose bodies have changed in the wake of growing a human. You made a person. Of course things are different. Wear these changes with pride, the messages say. It\u2019s a well-intended and much-needed societal shift \u2013 women needn\u2019t expect themselves to return to their pre-partum body overnight, if ever. But unfortunately there are countless women who may not feel included by these mantras about loving your postpartum body, as they imply one crucial element: a live birth. One in four pregnancies result in miscarriage and one in 100 in stillbirth. So there are millions of women who also experience bodily changes during pregnancy \u2013 those who were pregnant, and looked pregnant, but were left with empty arms. With no tangible evidence of what their pregnancy created, messages of pride and bodily acceptance may not resonate. What happens to our inner dialogue about our bodies when we don\u2019t have the proof of a \u201csuccessful\u201d pregnancy to offer the world \u2013 and ourselves? What does it feel like to live in a once-pregnant body after loss, when there is no baby to show for it? These bodies are still changed, and they continue changing, but they are now also imprinted with a life lost. There probably isn\u2019t room for the ideas of grace, gratitude and being kind to yourself in the moment when breast milk comes in with no baby to feed, or when the feeling of fetal movement is replaced by an empty uterus, and when the weight gain that began with so much promise reverses (or doesn\u2019t). Their bodies have changed exponentially, but with no baby to prove why. It can all feel so futile. The strident trifecta of silence, stigma and shame that shroud the topic of pregnancy loss prevent open dialogue and emotional support about these physical changes. This can complicate often already fraught relationships with our bodies, as women burrow their reactions, which can mutate into guilt, embarrassment and self-blame. This is made worse by the fact that pregnancy and childbirth are typically narrativized as inherently natural \u2013 a pedestrian experience all women can undertake. It\u2019s a promise that simply isn\u2019t true, as many women find out first-hand. \u201cThe purpose of my body is to have a baby and it could not,\u201d says Christina, 33, who has had two miscarriages in the first trimester. \u201cI keep telling my wife: I have a body that is not useful. I am supposed to be able to have babies and I can\u2019t stay pregnant. What is the point of this body?\u201d In a culture that does not openly talk about miscarriage \u2013 which, too, is natural and common \u2013 thoughts like Christina\u2019s can affect self-image. There is no blueprint for how to exist in one\u2019s skin post-loss. Lowri, 33, who has had three miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy, explains: \u201cI have way more negative feelings about my body since my losses, because of what I feel my body should have been able to do. Every time I have a loss, I feel a little more disconnected from my physical self. I find myself sometimes wishing I didn\u2019t have a body, because I am so betrayed and hurt by it.\u201d These feelings of betrayal can morph into an intolerance for one\u2019s body and even an inability to look at it. The reflection becomes, in part, a projection of our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. \u201cI was disgusted with my body after losing my babies,\u201d says Kristen, 34, whose twins were born still. \u201cSeeing myself in the mirror was embarrassing. I felt ashamed. I felt like a failure.\u201d These emotions are not uncommon following pregnancy loss. Still, the trap of self-blame grabs many who experience it. \u201cWhen I look at my belly, I see my loss,\u201d says Dana, 33, who had a first-trimester miscarriage. \u201cI blame myself. I am angry with my body,\u201d she says. Rhylee, 26, who had a stillbirth and a miscarriage, can relate. \u201cFor months, I couldn\u2019t bear to look into my own eyes because I was too afraid of what I would see. They say the eyes are the window to your soul, and I didn\u2019t feel like I had a soul. I\u2019m still angry with my body, and with myself, too.\u201d Sometimes, there is no clear medical explanation for why a loss happens, and since human nature craves answers, women may accuse their bodies of betrayal. \u201cI learned that unexplained miscarriages can be caused by something underlying with the mother, so I began to blame myself,\u201d says Alyssa, 32, who had a second-trimester miscarriage. \u201cI have struggled ever since with guilt and shame that my body failed me. And my body held on tight to the pregnancy after it ended, which I really resented. It now feels impossible to look at myself and not nitpick at every single thing. When I look in the mirror, I don\u2019t recognize who I am.\u201d Watching the changes of pregnancy reverse can be just as difficult as seeing reminders of it. The disappearing signs can be seen as an erasure of the experience. \u201cIt was devastating to bounce back after my first loss. To have my body return to what it was before. It was almost cruel how fast it happened,\u201d says Beth, 35, who lost a pregnancy to placental abruption and terminated another for medical reasons in an emergency c-section. Jenn, 46, fought her body\u2019s attempts to return to her pre-pregnancy state after her full-term stillbirth. \u201cI held onto the weight for as long as I could. It was my emotional blanket. It was proof that my daughter really existed,\u201d she says. While pregnancy can be physically unpleasant for some, when it is lost, even the hard parts are missed. \u201cAfter the losses, I had a desire to still feel pregnancy symptoms, even the ones that had been difficult while living through them,\u201d says Cristella, 32, who has had two first-trimester miscarriages. \u201cI wanted to be pregnant still, and now I wasn\u2019t. My body was mine again, but at what cost?\u201d And as pregnancy symptoms go from nausea and exhaustion to fetal kicks and wiggles, these emotions evolve. \u201cNo longer feeling the movement in my womb after the twins died may have been the worst part,\u201d says Kristen. With later losses, the body is essentially unaware that the baby didn\u2019t survive, and behaves as a postpartum body does. \u201cWhen my milk came in, after my stillbirth, I thought I could be a hero to someone else\u2019s baby by pumping and donating it,\u201d says Rhylee. \u201cBut after leaving the hospital, I just couldn\u2019t. I was so bitter, so angry. I couldn\u2019t allow someone else to have this milk. This milk was for my baby.\u201d Plus, the physical evidence of birth becomes an intense private trauma when there isn\u2019t a live baby. For Beth, the scar from the emergency c-section during her loss haunted her. \u201cThe scar stared at me. I cried every time I took a shower. I had so much self-hate around this tiny incision. Others didn\u2019t see it, but I couldn\u2019t hide it from myself. I looked normal, so people thought I was normal. I wasn\u2019t.\u201d When one has been visibly pregnant, and then no longer is, the comments that come in can be inadvertently gutting. \u201cI shared the news that I was no longer pregnant, but people still thought I was,\u201d says Brittany, 33, who terminated for medical reasons. She became obsessed with trying to lose weight in order to avoid having to explain her situation. \u201cI was going through body dysmorphia. I had an empty body because of the loss of my son, and all I wanted was to look as non-pregnant as possible.\u201d Well-meaning comments are often the most unwelcome. Rhylee recalls a family member saying: \u201cWow, you look so good, you don\u2019t even look like you just had a baby! I was depressed and hardly eating. Don\u2019t you think I wish I was still big? Don\u2019t you think I wish I was still pregnant?\u201d Some women go on to conceive a healthy pregnancy, which can aid in the restoration of their self-image. Beth recently had a baby who was born through the same c-section incision as the son she lost. \u201cThis has helped change my relationship with my scar,\u201d she says. \u201cI no longer look at it with disdain or guilt. I look at it now as the way this beautiful miracle was brought into my life.\u201d Kristen had a son after her twin loss, and is currently in her second trimester. \u201cBeing pregnant after my loss was terrifying, but I felt like I had no other choice than to trust my body, which actually felt empowering. I could do this, physically and mentally. I could get pregnant again. I could carry a baby to term. Now, I feel like I have no other choice than to trust my body.\u201d Jessica Zucker is a Los Angeles-based psychologist specializing in women\u2019s reproductive and maternal mental health and the author of a forthcoming book about pregnancy loss.

      "bodyText": "On a crystalline fall day, Kamala Harris arrived at a split-level home in a leafy northern Virginia suburb for a canvassing event to support local Democrats ahead of the state\u2019s legislative elections next week. The front yard was full of volunteers, some wearing pink and green pins from the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority that Harris joined as an undergraduate at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington. A woman dressed in a sari wished Happy Diwali to Harris, whose mother was an immigrant from India and whose first name means \u201clotus flower\u201d in Sanskrit. As the Democratic presidential hopeful made her way toward the porch to address the crowd, a high school student clasped her hand and thanked her for supporting LGBTQ equality. A little girl bashfully approached her with a picture of an American flag that she had drawn. Harris\u2019s face softened as she knelt down to accept the gift. With a hand clasped to her heart in appreciation, the candidate smiled: \u201cThis is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d But the glow from that afternoon didn\u2019t last long. On Wednesday, Harris was forced to take dramatic action to salvage her beleaguered presidential campaign, slashing staff at her Baltimore headquarters and pivoting to an \u201call-in on Iowa\u201d strategy with less than 100 days before the official start of the Democratic primary contest. It\u2019s a stunning reversal of fortunes for a presidential campaign that began with dazzling promise. Early supporters believed Harris, the 55-year-old junior senator from California, was a candidate whose time had come. Who better to challenge a president accused by his detractors of lawlessness, racism and misogyny than a barrier-breaking prosecutor who would make history as the first black female president? \u201cKamala represents the now and the future of our party,\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina Democratic strategist who is unaligned with a campaign. \u201cBut we\u2019re not living in normal times.\u201d In 2016, Democrats watched in horror as Donald Trump vanquished 16 Republicans rivals and their party\u2019s first female nominee, Hillary Clinton. This year, Seawright said, Democrats aren\u2019t trying to make history. They just want the president out of office. Harris\u2019s fate now hinges on her ability to convince voters that she is best suited to the task.And with three months left before Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses, the window for Harris to successfully turn around her campaign is closing. \u201cI\u2019m fucking moving to Iowa,\u201d Harris was recently overheard saying to a Senate colleague, as her poll numbers slipped and her fundraising stagnated. A USA Today/Suffolk poll released on Wednesday showed Harris at 3%, virtually tied with Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who she dismissed two months ago as a lower-tier candidate. Squeezed between the party\u2019s ideological poles in a historically diverse and crowded presidential field, Harris has struggled to turn breakout moments into sustainable momentum. Supporters and critics alike point to early stumbles and missed opportunities that muddled her message and left Harris vulnerable to criticism from moderates and progressives. She has waffled on policy, most notable on healthcare. After embracing Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All healthcare plan, she distanced herself from it then released her own version of it. Elizabeth Warren beat her to the punch calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment and she only recently unveiled a criminal justice reform plan that might have blunted progressive attacks on her prosecutorial record \u2013 as San Francisco attorney general and California attorney general \u2013 had she released it sooner. \u201cHer campaign began with a great deal of promise,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, who advised Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cBut the campaign has lacked definition and a coherent thesis for why she is running. Is she a moderate? Is she a liberal? Is she a tough-on-crime prosecutor or is she a social justice warrior?\u201d There are also challenges out of her control. Democrats\u2019 deep-seated fear of losing to Trump has perhaps pushed some to perceive people of color and female candidates as less formidable opponents against the president. Harris has started to address concern about her electability \u2013 what she calls the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2013 on the campaign trail. \u201cThere is a lack of ability or a difficulty in imagining that someone who we have never seen can do a job that has been done, you know, 45 times by someone who is not that person,\u201d she told Axios in an interview last week. In Virginia on Sunday, Nelfred Tilly Blanding, the host of the canvassing event, said the prospect of Harris\u2019s historic candidacy fills her with pride \u2013 but also apprehension. \u201cShe speaks truth to power,\u201d said Blanding. \u201cI love the way she presents herself.\u201d But Blanding, who intends to vote for Harris, fears the country isn\u2019t ready for a black woman to be president. \u201cIs he going to be happy if we nominate a woman?\u201d she said, referring to Trump. \u201cThat worries me.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Harris entered the 2020 race in spectacular fashion with a rally in Oakland this January, against a backdrop of blue and red \u201cFor the People\u201d signs, a homage to Shirley Chisholm, an African American congresswoman from New York who was the first woman to seek the Democratic party\u2019s nomination. The event drew more than 20,000 people \u2013 the largest of any campaign launch \u2013 and was followed by a rush of donations that helped her emerge as a top fundraiser that cycle. But she faded from view as Sanders and Joe Biden joined and the field bulged with candidates who, like Harris, had been anointed rising stars in a party that is increasingly young, diverse and liberal, including Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Buttigieg. A premeditated attack on Biden over his record on race and federally mandated school bussing during the first presidential debate this summer was the jolt her campaign needed. In the days that followed, her poll numbers soared and donations rolled in. But soon she tumbled from the top tier. Biden rebounded on the strength of his enduring support among black voters. Warren continued to climb, surpassing Sanders and edging past Biden in several early state and national polls. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, eclipsed Harris as a darling of the donor class. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over time is that Democratic voters are generally pretty happy with their top choices,\u201d said Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive analytics firm Data for Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the Democratic establishment is looking to find a fallback.\u201d He said the unexpectedly weak resistance to Warren\u2019s candidacy by the party establishment has complicated Harris\u2019s quest to emerge as an alternative to Biden. It\u2019s a frustrating position for a candidate like Harris, whose political career had been building toward this moment almost from the start. For years, she was viewed within the party as a presumptive heir to the multiracial coalition that twice lifted the first black president to the White House. As early as 2009, she had drawn comparisons to the 44th president, earning the woefully unimaginative nickname the \u201cfemale Barack Obama\u201d. From the Senate, Harris thrilled Democrats as she lashed into Trump appointees, viral face-offs that offered a preview of what a general election showdown with the president might have in store. In 2018, colleagues and candidates welcomed her support on the trail. And the Democratic National Committee said that fundraising emails sent with her name were particularly successful with party donors. Now as her campaign languishes, Harris has started to draw comparisons to Marco Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida who sought to make history as the nation\u2019s first Latino presidential nominee in 2016. He was tipped as the fresh face of his party, an eloquent speaker with a stirring personal story and a prodigious fundraiser well liked by the party establishment in equal measure. He left the race after Florida Republicans chose a snowbird over its native son. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In a memo on Wednesday to staff and supporters, Harris\u2019s campaign outlined its strategy to avoid a similar fate. \u201cKamala &amp; this team launched with 1 goal in mind: win the nomination &amp; take on Trump,\u201d Harris\u2019s communication director, Lily Adams wrote on twitter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to just participate. We\u2019re going to make the hard choices necessary to put us in a place to achieve that goal.\u201d Her campaign is laying off dozens of staff members and pouring its resources into Iowa, where Harris hopes a strong finish will pave the way into more diverse states such as South Carolina, where she has struggled to match Biden\u2019s appeal with black voters and in her home state of California, where she is trailing far behind the field\u2019s frontrunners. In the last month she tallied 15 days and 30 events in Iowa in what the campaign has optimistically dubbed the \u201cOctober hustle\u201d. She will continue to spend much of her time there in November, including the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cPlenty of winning primary campaigns, like John Kerry\u2019s in 2004 and John McCain\u2019s in 2008, have had to make tough choices on their way to the nomination,\u201d Juan Rodriguez, Harris\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in a memo to staff and supporters, \u201cand this is no different.\u201d Another wild card looms on the horizon: impeachment.

But it may also present an opportunity for Harris, who has repeatedly pledged to \u201cprosecute the case against Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cDude gotta go,\u201d Harris said, after unloading on the president during the debate last month. \u201cShe is never better than when she is on that committee grilling these rightwing Trump appointees,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a progressive advocacy group that works to elect women of color. \u201cThis could be her moment.\u201d Allison, who has not endorsed a candidate, said there is still a desire to see Harris succeed, especially among black women who are the party\u2019s most loyal constituency. In a recent Essence survey of black women, more respondents chose \u201cother/prefer not to answer\u201d than any 2020 candidate \u2013 evidence, Allison said, that the race is still fluid. Harris has faced daunting odds before, said Andrea Dew Steele, the co-founder of Emerge America, which trains women to run for office, and a longtime friend. In the first race of Harris\u2019s political life for district attorney of San Francisco she ran against a two-term incumbent \u2013 and her one-time boss.

A representative from the Chinese partner of BrainCo, also surnamed Zhang, told Beijing News the students wore the devices twice a week for 30 minutes at a time and used them for concentration training courses. With many children across China using smartwatches, mobile phones and other devices that track location and personal information, parents are becoming increasingly concerned about how that data is used, and who can access it. A regulation on protecting children\u2019s online information issued by China\u2019s Cyberspace Administration went into effect on 1 October and calls for information to be encrypted, parental consent for collecting, transferring or using that information, and establishing user agreements. After-hours calls to BrainCo on Friday were not answered and company representatives did not immediately respond to other requests to comment.

Guardian Australia has revealed that thousands of jobseekers have their welfare payments incorrectly suspended each year under the Jobactive program. The Department of Human Services, which administers Centrelink as well as the child support system, was the subject of 11,652 complaints in the 2018-19 financial year. \u201cThis is a 7.5% decrease in complaints received, compared to 2017\u201318,\u201d the report said. But it added: \u201cComplaints about Centrelink continue to make up a substantial proportion of complaints made to the office, representing 55% of the total number of complaints made about Commonwealth government agencies. \u201cApproximately 31% of issues raised in Centrelink complaints are about Disability Support Pension (DSP) and Newstart Allowance (NSA).\u201d The ombudsman also highlighted a case where it was asked to investigate after Centrelink denied compensation to an aged pensioner who had been underpaid. \u201cIn 2017, the person\u2019s financial advisers identified that they were incorrectly receiving a reduced rate of Age Pension because Centrelink believed they were a homeowner,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe complainant sought compensation from Centrelink under the Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (CDDA) scheme on the basis that their claim had been incorrectly assessed and they had been underpaid for four years. \u201cCentrelink assessed the CDDA claim and decided that compensation was not payable. They made a complaint to our office. \u201cFollowing our investigation, Centrelink offered compensation in the form of an amount in excess of $25,000, equal to the additional Age Pension that they should have been paid over the four year period.\u201d There was a 12% increase in NDIS complaints in 2018-19, though the ombudsman noted that the number of participants had risen 62% in that time. Most of the complaints were related to how the National Disability Insurance Agency had handled reviews of participants\u2019 plans. One complaint investigated by the ombudsman saw a NDIS participant unable to leave hospital for more than five months as they waited for the NDIA to \u201capprove funds so they could obtain customised mobility equipment, and have modifications made to their home\u201d.",

In a speech to the Queensland Resources Council on Friday, the prime minister said a threat to the future of mining was coming from a \u201cnew breed of radical activism\u201d and signalled the government would seek to apply penalties to those targeting businesses who provide services to the resources industry. Civil society groups, including the Human Rights Law Centre and Australian Conservation Foundation, and the Greens immediately attacked the proposal as undemocratic and a bid to stifle a social movement fighting for Australia to take action on climate change. Morrison told Australian corporations to listen to the \u201cquiet shareholders\u201d and not environmental protesters, who he suggested could shift targets from coal companies to all carbon-intensive industries including power generation, gas projects, abattoirs and airlines. In a speech proposing limits on free speech advocating boycotts against polluting companies, Morrison said progressives wanted to tell Australians \u201cwhat you can say, what you can think and tax you more for the privilege of all of those instructions\u201d. He claimed that \u201cprogressivism\u201d \u2013 which he labelled a \u201cnew-speak type term\u201d, invoking George Orwell \u2013 intends \u201cto get in under the radar, but at its heart would deny the liberties of Australians\u201d. \u201cApocalyptic in tone, it brooks no compromise,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing.

The Greens were quick to reverse the charge of intolerance and level it at Morrison, with acting leader Adam Bandt labelling him \u201ca direct threat to Australian democracy and freedom of speech\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s commitment to outlaw the peaceful, legal protest of Australian individuals and community groups reads like a move straight from the totalitarian\u2019s playbook,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of getting tough on the climate crisis, Scott Morrison is dismantling democracy.\u201d The executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, Hugh de Kretser, said the plan to crack down on boycotts was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. \u201cProtest is an essential part of our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo protect our democracy and help ensure a better future for all Australians, governments should be strengthening our rights to come together and protest, not weakening them.\u201d The Competition and Consumer Act already contains civil penalties for secondary boycotts, which target one business in order to prevent provision of goods or services to another, including if they cause \u201csubstantial loss or damage\u201d or substantially lessen competition.

Facebook has said it disabled 2.2bn fake accounts in the first three months of 2019, but the European Commission this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/europe-accuses-facebook-of-being-slow-to-remove-fake-accounts\">said there was a \u201cdisconnect\u201d</a> between such claims.</p> <p>The undercover reporter, Katarzyna Pruszkiewicz, spent six months this year working at Cat@Net, which describes itself as an \u201cePR agency comprising specialists who build a positive image of companies, private individuals and public institutions \u2013 mostly in social media.\u201d.</p> <p>A member of the <a href=\"https://fundacjareporterow.org/en/\">Reporters\u2019 Foundation</a>, a consortium of Polish investigative journalists, Pruszkiewicz\u2019s first task when she joined the company was to set up a social media avatar for sharing \u201csocial and political content\u201d with the aim of attracting 500 followers.</p> <p>After a trial period, she was given access to the company\u2019s internal communications channels, through which the company\u2019s employees, each of whom ran a dozen or so social media accounts, would receive guidance and instructions from their managers \u2013 what issues to engage with, who to promote, and who to denigrate.</p> <p>The accounts produced both leftwing and rightwing content, attracting attention, credibility and support from other social media users, who could then be rallied in support of the company\u2019s clients.</p> <p>\u201cThe aim is to build credibility with people from both sides of the political divide. Once you have won someone\u2019s trust by reflecting their own views back at them, you are in a position to influence them,\u201d said Wojciech Cie\u015bla, who oversaw the investigation in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.investigate-europe.eu/\">Investigate Europe</a>, a consortium of European investigative reporters.</p> <p>\u201cReading these communications, you can see how the leftwing and rightwing accounts would receive their daily instructions, how they would be marshalled and directed like two flanks of the same army on a battlefield.\u201d</p> <p>A majority of Cat@Net\u2019s employees are understood to be disabled, allowing the company to derive substantial public subsidies from Poland\u2019s National Disabled Rehabilitation Fund. According to the Reporters Foundation, the company has received about 1.5 million zloty (\u00a3300,000) from the fund since November 2015.</p> <p>\u201cMany of them are really good people \u2013 they are compassionate, they do charity work and engage in social activism in their spare time, but their disabilities mean that their employment opportunities are limited,\u201d Pruszkiewicz told the Guardian. \u201cFor them it was just work and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>One of Pruszkiewicz\u2019s responsibilities was to operate anonymous accounts with instructions to promote content produced by TVP, Poland\u2019s state broadcaster, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/11/cruder-than-the-communists-polish-tv-goes-all-out-for-rightwing-vote\">widely reviled by critics</a> for its extreme partisanship and hate speech directed against minority groups.</p> <p>\u2018It would be great if you posted positive comments about the government\u2019s subsidy for TVP and the television licence fee,\u2019 read an email from her manager.</p> <p>An internal report seen by the Guardian details how the fake accounts were used to denigrate legitimate criticism of the broadcaster. According to an analysis by ISD Global, a London-based thinktank that studies global trends in extremism and polarisation, Cat@Net accounts created up to 10,000 posts in defence of TVP, with a potential reach of 15 million views.</p> <p>Another beneficiary of Cat@Net\u2019s influence operations was a recently elected member of the Polish parliament for the leftwing Democratic Left Alliance party. Cat@Net\u2019s leftwing accounts promoted the politician\u2019s candidacy to the European Parliament in elections held in May this year, with at least 90 different accounts circulating and responding to his social media posts.

      "bodyText": "It is as common an occurrence on Polish Twitter as you are likely to get: a pair of conservative activists pouring scorn on the country\u2019s divided liberal opposition. \u201cI burst out laughing!\u201d writes Girl from \u017boliborz, a self-described \u201ctraditionalist\u201d commenting on a newspaper story about a former campaign adviser to Barack Obama and Emmanuel Macron coming to Warsaw to address a group of liberal activists. \u201cThe opposition has nothing to offer. That\u2019s why they use nonsense to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes,\u201d replies Magda Rostocka, whose profile tells her almost 4,400 followers she is \u201cleft-handed with her heart on the right\u201d. In reality, neither woman existed. Both accounts were run by the paid employees of a small marketing company based in the city of Wroc\u0142aw in southwest Poland. But what the employee pretending to be Magda Rostocka did not know is that the colleague pretending to be Girl from \u017boliborz was an undercover reporter who had infiltrated the company, giving rare insight into the means by which fake social media accounts are being used by private firms to influence unsuspecting voters and consumers. Social media companies are coming under increasing pressure over fake accounts. Facebook has said it disabled 2.2bn fake accounts in the first three months of 2019, but the European Commission this week said there was a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between such claims. The undercover reporter, Katarzyna Pruszkiewicz, spent six months this year working at Cat@Net, which describes itself as an \u201cePR agency comprising specialists who build a positive image of companies, private individuals and public institutions \u2013 mostly in social media.\u201d. A member of the Reporters\u2019 Foundation, a consortium of Polish investigative journalists, Pruszkiewicz\u2019s first task when she joined the company was to set up a social media avatar for sharing \u201csocial and political content\u201d with the aim of attracting 500 followers. After a trial period, she was given access to the company\u2019s internal communications channels, through which the company\u2019s employees, each of whom ran a dozen or so social media accounts, would receive guidance and instructions from their managers \u2013 what issues to engage with, who to promote, and who to denigrate. The accounts produced both leftwing and rightwing content, attracting attention, credibility and support from other social media users, who could then be rallied in support of the company\u2019s clients. \u201cThe aim is to build credibility with people from both sides of the political divide. Once you have won someone\u2019s trust by reflecting their own views back at them, you are in a position to influence them,\u201d said Wojciech Cie\u015bla, who oversaw the investigation in collaboration with Investigate Europe, a consortium of European investigative reporters. \u201cReading these communications, you can see how the leftwing and rightwing accounts would receive their daily instructions, how they would be marshalled and directed like two flanks of the same army on a battlefield.\u201d A majority of Cat@Net\u2019s employees are understood to be disabled, allowing the company to derive substantial public subsidies from Poland\u2019s National Disabled Rehabilitation Fund. According to the Reporters Foundation, the company has received about 1.5 million zloty (\u00a3300,000) from the fund since November 2015. \u201cMany of them are really good people \u2013 they are compassionate, they do charity work and engage in social activism in their spare time, but their disabilities mean that their employment opportunities are limited,\u201d Pruszkiewicz told the Guardian. \u201cFor them it was just work and that\u2019s it.\u201d One of Pruszkiewicz\u2019s responsibilities was to operate anonymous accounts with instructions to promote content produced by TVP, Poland\u2019s state broadcaster, which is widely reviled by critics for its extreme partisanship and hate speech directed against minority groups. \u2018It would be great if you posted positive comments about the government\u2019s subsidy for TVP and the television licence fee,\u2019 read an email from her manager. An internal report seen by the Guardian details how the fake accounts were used to denigrate legitimate criticism of the broadcaster. According to an analysis by ISD Global, a London-based thinktank that studies global trends in extremism and polarisation, Cat@Net accounts created up to 10,000 posts in defence of TVP, with a potential reach of 15 million views. Another beneficiary of Cat@Net\u2019s influence operations was a recently elected member of the Polish parliament for the leftwing Democratic Left Alliance party. Cat@Net\u2019s leftwing accounts promoted the politician\u2019s candidacy to the European Parliament in elections held in May this year, with at least 90 different accounts circulating and responding to his social media posts. The company\u2019s rightwing accounts would then oppose the leftwing accounts, generating conflict and traffic, thereby drawing attention to the candidate. \u201cIf [he] is followed only by our accounts, this is really suspicious,\u201d wrote one employee during an internal discussion of the campaign. Accounts were created that would concentrate on the aviation and defence industries, and target key decision-makers involved in the awarding of major government defence contracts. The accounts were used to undermine public support for the Polish government\u2019s decision to place a major order with the American contractor Lockheed Martin for the F-35 fighter jet, promoting instead the Eurofighter Typhoon produced by a consortium that includes Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo \u2013 which has a Polish subsidiary, PZL \u015awidnik. Cat@Net employees were reminded by their managers that \u201cthe F-35 is our enemy number one\u201d but \u201cdon\u2019t be too pushy with the Eurofighter, otherwise they will know they are being trolled\u201d. It is unclear whether the organisations and individuals on whose behalf the fake accounts were lobbying were aware of Cat@Net\u2019s practices. Internal documents suggest the company received most if not all of its commissions from an external PR company, which may have been outsourcing the influence operations without its clients\u2019 knowledge. PZL \u015awidnik said it \u201cconducts its business activities in an ethical manner in all respects\u201d and any supplier of services to it is required to comply with its code of ethics. It denied engaging in any wrongdoing regarding communications practices relating to disinformation, hate speech, or attempts to influence political decisions. \u201cThe big question is how regulators everywhere are going to respond to the challenge posed by this kind of activity,\u201d said Peter Pomerantsev, a London-based expert on disinformation and author of This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality. \u201cThey might argue that none of the content that was shared was illegal \u2013 it wasn\u2019t hate speech, it wasn\u2019t inciting violence, it wasn\u2019t war propaganda.

Then she praised Jamil: \u201cWe have amazing women out there like Jameela Jamil saying, \u2018I\u2019m not trying to spread body positivity. I\u2019m trying to spread body neutrality where I can sit here and not think about what my body is looking like.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: how are you supposed to keep up? We\u2019ve had body negativity for centuries, then body positivity suddenly came along, and now this? Cast your worries aside \u2013 here\u2019s all you need to know.</p> <h2>What is body neutrality?</h2> <p>So whatever body neutrality is, it is <em>not </em>body positivity. Body positivity is old news.</p> <p>Body positivity was the move to encourage women to celebrate their bodies. People interpreted this message in mixed ways. Some thought it meant celebrating your body by not wearing many clothes, in an \u201cif you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it\u201d kind of way. But many people pointed out this was <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/01/the-body-positivity-movement-is-not-for-slim-bodies-already-accepted-by-society-10081795/\">not very inclusive</a> to people who do not have conventionally beautiful bodies.</p> <p>Others interpreted it to mean women should be encouraged to celebrate their bodies no matter what they look like. But then people got annoyed that this message was <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/body-positivity-fat-skinny-shaming\">excluding conventionally good-looking people</a>, who are, like, never included in anything. Then people started to think body positivity was just a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/5/17236212/body-positivity-scam-dove-campaign-ads\">marketing sham being used to sell women more stuff</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/02/jameela-jamil-is-well-meaning-but-slim-pretty-women-cant-smash-the-diet-culture-alone\">Jameela Jamil is well-meaning, but slim, pretty women can't smash the diet culture alone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Body neutrality is, of course, much more nuanced than all of this. It is the idea that women\u2019s bodies should just not be commented on at all. So don\u2019t say: \u201cI love how I look, no matter what you think.\u201d But do say: \u201cI love what I think, and who cares what I look like?\u201d</p> <h2>And Jameela Jamil came up with it?</h2> <p>Well, not exactly.

Like having great friends. Or, er, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/983465776005857280\">having a net worth of $280m</a>.

      "bodyText": "You may not know it yet, but body neutrality is the new body positivity. What is body neutrality, I hear you say? It\u2019s apparently something that Jameela Jamil came up with, and Taylor Swift is ever so thankful to her for it. Talking to the DJ Zane Lowe in a recent interview, Swift spoke about the times she was slut-shamed as an aspiring artist, and how her talent was overlooked because she is a woman. Then she praised Jamil: \u201cWe have amazing women out there like Jameela Jamil saying, \u2018I\u2019m not trying to spread body positivity. I\u2019m trying to spread body neutrality where I can sit here and not think about what my body is looking like.\u2019\u201d I know what you\u2019re thinking: how are you supposed to keep up? We\u2019ve had body negativity for centuries, then body positivity suddenly came along, and now this? Cast your worries aside \u2013 here\u2019s all you need to know. What is body neutrality? So whatever body neutrality is, it is not body positivity. Body positivity is old news. Body positivity was the move to encourage women to celebrate their bodies. People interpreted this message in mixed ways. Some thought it meant celebrating your body by not wearing many clothes, in an \u201cif you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it\u201d kind of way. But many people pointed out this was not very inclusive to people who do not have conventionally beautiful bodies. Others interpreted it to mean women should be encouraged to celebrate their bodies no matter what they look like. But then people got annoyed that this message was excluding conventionally good-looking people, who are, like, never included in anything. Then people started to think body positivity was just a marketing sham being used to sell women more stuff. Body neutrality is, of course, much more nuanced than all of this. It is the idea that women\u2019s bodies should just not be commented on at all. So don\u2019t say: \u201cI love how I look, no matter what you think.\u201d But do say: \u201cI love what I think, and who cares what I look like?\u201d And Jameela Jamil came up with it? Well, not exactly. The phrase has been used since around 2015 and was popularized when the fitness coach Anne Poirier started running programs about body positivity in Vermont in 2017. Then, in 2018, Jamil made an Instagram account called I Weigh, dedicated, among other things, to women posting selfies and writing things they value about themselves that aren\u2019t skin deep. Like having great friends. Or, er, having a net worth of $280m. Here\u2019s an example from Jamil\u2019s Instagram page: Jamil also spoke about body neutrality, and why she doesn\u2019t identify with the body positivity movement, during an interview on The Daily Show in September: Not objectifying women \u2013 haven\u2019t I heard of that before? There have been some feminists who have already spoken about wanting women to be freed from the shackles of expectation. Jamil isn\u2019t exactly the first. For example, Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts wrote in 1997 about how women internalize the objectification of men and begin to view themselves as objects. But they crucially missed one thing \u2013 they don\u2019t have viral Instagram accounts. So they\u2019re still waiting for that Taylor Swift shoutout. OK, so now there\u2019s body positivity and body neutrality \u2026 how am I supposed to feel good about my physical self? I\u2019m going to level with you: I\u2019m not sure. I think you\u2019re just supposed to do what feels right to you. While, obviously, using all the right phrases and posting a photo of yourself.",

The practise of directly addressing inequality underpins countless social justice movements, from civil rights to Standing Rock.</p> \n<p>The contemporary idea of a \u201ccall-out\u201d, however, generally refers to interpersonal confrontations occurring between individuals on social media. In theory, call-outs should be very simple \u2013 someone does something wrong, people tell them, and they avoid doing it again in the future. Yet you only need to spend a short amount of time on the internet to know that call-out culture is in fact extremely divisive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb0c9dcf-5934-4efd-9824-f91ffd5ae940\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qaHLd8de6nM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Former president Obama pointed out this week at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago that call-outs can give the illusion that you\u2019re effecting change, even if that is not true. \u201cIf I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or used the wrong word or verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself, because, \u2018Man, you see how woke I was. I called you out.\u2019 That\u2019s not activism,\u201d Obama said.</p> \n<p>A reason call-outs can be polarizing is they often challenge the status quo. They can spark discomfort and offense, as when Canadian activist Nora Loreto went on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoLore/status/983159952264003584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E983159952264003584&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fradio%2Foutintheopen%2Fcall-out-culture-fighting-oppression-or-furthering-divides-1.5075138\">Twitter</a> to suggest that the C$15.2m raised to support the Humboldt Broncos junior ice hockey team after a deadly bus crash last year was donated so generously in part because victims of the accident were young, male and white.

      "bodyText": "Even if you\u2019re not that active on social media, you\u2019ve probably experienced it: the sudden wave of dread that overwhelms you when you realize you\u2019ve said something you shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 and someone has noticed. You\u2019ve been called out: your mistake suddenly feels grave and irreparable; you may even worry that this one episode could affect your whole life. A version of call-out culture has been functioning for centuries as a tool for the marginalized and their allies to reveal injustice and the need for reform. The practise of directly addressing inequality underpins countless social justice movements, from civil rights to Standing Rock. The contemporary idea of a \u201ccall-out\u201d, however, generally refers to interpersonal confrontations occurring between individuals on social media. In theory, call-outs should be very simple \u2013 someone does something wrong, people tell them, and they avoid doing it again in the future. Yet you only need to spend a short amount of time on the internet to know that call-out culture is in fact extremely divisive. Former president Obama pointed out this week at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago that call-outs can give the illusion that you\u2019re effecting change, even if that is not true. \u201cIf I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or used the wrong word or verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself, because, \u2018Man, you see how woke I was. I called you out.\u2019 That\u2019s not activism,\u201d Obama said. A reason call-outs can be polarizing is they often challenge the status quo. They can spark discomfort and offense, as when Canadian activist Nora Loreto went on Twitter to suggest that the C$15.2m raised to support the Humboldt Broncos junior ice hockey team after a deadly bus crash last year was donated so generously in part because victims of the accident were young, male and white. Or earlier this month when, in response to Ellen DeGeneres tweeting about her friendship with George W Bush and kumbaya policy of being nice to everyone, critics pointed out that niceness is not an unalloyed good. Some people feel that call-outs are an excuse for petty drama \u2013 a way to stir up gossip more than to promote social justice. Think of when Coleen Rooney launched a real-life soap opera by accusing fellow British football wife Rebekah Vardy of subterfuge last month, or the heady influencer drama that escalated between YouTubers Tati Westbrook and James Charles this summer. Yet the most potent critiques of call-out culture come from those who feel it is an excuse for crude vigilante justice \u2013 \u201czealotry \u2026 fueled by people working out their psychological wounds\u201d, as the New York Times columnist David Brooks called it earlier this year. A \u201ctrial by fire\u201d method of responding to any alleged violation of propriety, writes the Atlantic\u2019s Conor Friedersdorf. A frequently cited problem with call-outs is that it\u2019s all too easy to get carried away and overpunish people, turning alleged perpetrators of upsetting acts into victims themselves. \u201cWhat can often start out as well-intentioned and necessary criticism far too quickly devolves into brutish displays of virtual tar-and-feathering,\u201d writes the activist and writer Ruby Hamad. This leaves one question: how can we benefit from the social good call-out culture can help achieve, without succumbing to the toxicity and futility that has come to be associated with it? Some advocate a softer approach to call-outs. By ganging up on an individual, \u201cyou\u2019re taking this moral high ground, with a lot of righteous indignation, and inviting others to participate in a public shaming exercise\u201d, which is rarely productive, says Anna Richards, a therapist specializing in conflict mediation.

While there is no one absolute right way to call someone out, Richards believes that learning to analyze our own motivations when offering criticism, and considering the context and possible consequences of the situation we\u2019re contributing to helps call-out culture work productively. Of course, it\u2019s also up to the individual whose behavior has been called into question to be open, humble and willing to see such incidents as opportunities to learn, rather than a one-way ticket into a cartoon dust ball fight. After all, one tried and true way to begin resolving interpersonal conflict is to sincerely apologize when you have, intentionally or not, caused harm.

      "bodyText": "The Birds I was about four years old, being babysat by my cousin who was more interested in snogging her boyfriend and didn\u2019t realize I was watching it. Freaked me out to such an extent that I would scream my head off whenever we went to the beach and a seagull came within a few feet of me, and even now I can\u2019t stand the evil buggers. Thanks cousin Catherine! steena My sister and I nagged and nagged our parents to let us watch what may have been the first UK TV showing of Hitchcock\u2019s The Birds. They relented with a \u201cdon\u2019t blame us if you have have nightmares\u201d. We were fine up until the moment Rod\u2019s mum finds that guy laid out in his trashed kitchen. The genius of that scene is that there is no big jump shock with a blast of discordant music, just a slow pan to where he lays with both eyes pecked out and a horrified gasp from the poor lady. We had nightmares. ID9879446 This movie literally traumatised me for life. Saw this as a kid and there are scenes engraved on my memory that terrify me still. It\u2019s not really a very scary movie, but I think I was just too young to have seen this and the angst of the unknown threat of these crazy birds haunts me still. I think Hitchcock would be rather thrilled actually. Parmenidas A Night to Remember The Titanic story 1958. No great effects just unrelenting tension and lots of stiff upper lips. I don\u2019t remember much about it, I already knew the ending, but it terrified me and to this day I won\u2019t watch anything about the Titanic. I\u2019m 70. thepree Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory I guess I was about five years old when one evening I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on TV. My mum had gone out shopping and unbeknownst to me my dad had gone upstairs for a nap. The scene where they drink the fizzy drink and float up towards the spinning blade freaked me out and I screamed in horror only to realise I was alone in an \u201cempty\u201d house. (My dad did not wake up). So I ran outside still screaming, leaving our front door wide open. Opposite our house there were builders who were kind enough to take me in and I waited for what seemed like hours for my mum to come home. tpmv75 An American Werewolf in London A truly great film, for many reasons, but the real terror for me didn\u2019t come from ground breaking special effects of lupine metamorphosis. The loneliness of a late night tube station, the sheer horror of the masked Nazis slaughtering an all-American family, the strange and creepy emptiness of a London hospital ward at night, and most of all, Brian Glover telling a racist joke over a pint in the Slaughtered Lamb, with an unexplained pentangle on the wall next to the dart board. dylan37 I didn\u2019t see the film, but walked past the local cinema and saw a number of posters promoting it. I was terrified by nightmares for weeks afterwards. jonnyjonny I saw An American Werewolf in London at a local youth club in Hastings when I was 14, well I say saw, I managed half an hour of it and had to leave the room, I was bricking it! For a couple of years after, walking back from my friends\u2019 homes involved going around a dark corner garden plot with old trees and mature bushes, very poorly lit, I would literally run as if I was in a 100m race around that corner until I got home! Even today, werewolves still scare the bejesus out of me. The one in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was particularly traumatic!! TruthSayer666 My dad let me watch the first half hour when I was about 10, it was another decade before I could bear to watch the rest. steventudor I still feel nervous outside when the moon is full \u2026 My family find it hilarious. Joanne Ogarro Superman III The part in Superman 3 where the computer turns the woman into a kind of human robot hybrid terrified me. BradGoodman One Saturday afternoon you\u2019re watching a lighthearted Superman adventure about super computers, the next you\u2019re watching some poor woman sucked into said machine, screaming for her life as the machine starts welding bits to her horrified, agonised face. I was seven or eight when I first saw it, it leapfrogged Robocop &amp; Terminator as the most terrifying thing I\u2019d ever seen. David Perkins Superman III \u2013 you know which bit. dothestrand Psycho I saw Psycho as a teenager and in the 55 years since then, when alone, I have NEVER had a shower without checking that all doors and windows are locked. pineapplesage Mars Attacks! I was less than 10 and had already watched a bunch of slasher/horror movies with no effect on my psyche, but Mars Attacks \u2013 with those creepy little aliens and their seemingly all-powerful technology \u2013 straight up traumatized me! I got barely any sleep for months, nightmares galore when I did fall asleep, and all sorts of anxiety, to the point that parents sent me to therapy. The therapy didn\u2019t help at all and I never even came close to understanding why Mars Attacks freaked me out so bad. I love horror and sci-fi cinema, but it\u2019s been over 20 years and I still haven\u2019t watched Mars Attacks a second time. It did become a running joke for my whole family and about 10 years ago my dad gave a DVD copy to me as a gag birthday gift \u2013 which I gave to a neighbor as soon as he left!

According to the Insider, the emails suggest that an aide to the former footballer Franz Beckenbauer promised to deliver his vote in exchange for \u201cgenerous compensation for his consulting services\u201d, later specified as at least \u20ac3m.</p> <p>A Cypriot Fifa executive\u2019s vote could be bought for \u20ac1.5m, and the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner would vote for \u201cwhoever offers him the most\u201d, the Insider report says.</p> <p>The dossier also reportedly contains extensive background information about the council members, and even includes psychological profiles. It reportedly said the British football executive Geoff Thompson could be swayed through \u201cdiplomatic channels [and] expensive gifts to his wife, who has a strong influence on him\u201d.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that the Russian officials acted on the dossier, nor of any wrongdoing by those named. Thompson, who was at the time the head of England\u2019s rival World Cup bid, has denied his wife was offered any gifts.</p> <p>Warner has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/29/jack-warner-banned-football-life-fifa-ethics-committee\">banned for life</a> by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/29/sepp-blatter-abandoned-fifa\">Sepp Blatter</a> and the former France captain Michel Platini, who are both profiled in the dossier, each received an eight-year ban from football in 2011.</p> <p>The emails purportedly come from the account of Sergei Kapkov, a Russian politician and former head of the country\u2019s national football academy, and are in the possession of an anonymously run Telegram channel called BlackMirror.</p> <p>In an email exchange, BlackMirror told the Guardian that it released the \u201csamples\u201d in order to stimulate interest from potential \u201cacquirers\u201d.</p> <p> The email containing the dossier was allegedly sent in March 2010 by Alexander Djordjadze, the head of the Russia 2018 organising committee, nine months before Fifa\u2019s executive council delivered the 2018 tournament to Russia in a secret ballot. According to the Insider, it was sent to Igor Shuvalov, then a deputy prime minister under Vladimir Putin, Arkady Dvorkovich, an aide to the then-president Dmitry Medvedev, and Kapkov, who later became the head of Moscow\u2019s culture department.</p> <p>Fifa opened an investigation in 2014, but ultimately decided there was not enough evidence of bribery to re-run the vote. Fifa\u2019s head judge in the inquest noted that it had limited access to potential evidence and that the computers used by the Russian bid team had been destroyed after the vote.</p> <p>The emails were purportedly stolen from Kapkov, who left the government in 2015. Screenshots of the emails were released on the BlackMirror Telegram channel.</p> <p>Reached by the Guardian, the person or people behind the account avoided saying directly that they were selling the emails for money, writing instead that they would discuss \u201cconditions\u201d to \u201ctransfer\u201d the archive with \u201cpotential acquirers.\u201d BlackMirror said it didn\u2019t have any personal reaction to the information revealed in the emails.</p> <p>BlackMirror did not immediately say what price it wanted for the emails, but prices for similar archives can cost tens of thousands of pounds. In 2016, the hacking group Anonymous International reportedly requested 100 bitcoin, then about \u00a343,000, for emails purportedly from Kapkov\u2019s account. It is unclear whether the two sets of emails are connected, although BlackMirror said it has emails dated up to 2019, indicating more recent access to Kapkov\u2019s account.</p> <p>Asked how it had come into possession of the emails, BlackMirror said: \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss technical questions.\u201d</p> <p>BlackMirror said it was already considering another \u201crelease\u201d of files, likely not related to Russia\u2019s World Cup bid.</p> <p>The Insider said it had received originals from BlackMirror of the files allegedly shared between Kapkov and powerful Russian officials.</p> <p>Besides the dossier, they include strategy documents for a wide-reaching influence campaign among the 2018 World Cup organising committee and even large sponsors of the sporting organisation.</p> <p>Alexei Sorokin, the head of Russia\u2019s 2018 bid team, told the RBC news outlet that the documents were fake and that there was never any dossier of Fifa executive committee members.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he said, adding that Kapkov took no part in the bid process. \u201cIt seems to me that the whole thing was fabricated from beginning to end.\u201d</p> <p>He also noted that Russia had answered questions during an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d into the vote and said that \u201call of our \u2018influence\u2019 came during open contacts\u201d.</p>",

A Cypriot Fifa executive\u2019s vote could be bought for \u20ac1.5m, and the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner would vote for \u201cwhoever offers him the most\u201d, the Insider report says. The dossier also reportedly contains extensive background information about the council members, and even includes psychological profiles. It reportedly said the British football executive Geoff Thompson could be swayed through \u201cdiplomatic channels [and] expensive gifts to his wife, who has a strong influence on him\u201d. There is no suggestion that the Russian officials acted on the dossier, nor of any wrongdoing by those named. Thompson, who was at the time the head of England\u2019s rival World Cup bid, has denied his wife was offered any gifts. Warner has been banned for life by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee, and Sepp Blatter and the former France captain Michel Platini, who are both profiled in the dossier, each received an eight-year ban from football in 2011. The emails purportedly come from the account of Sergei Kapkov, a Russian politician and former head of the country\u2019s national football academy, and are in the possession of an anonymously run Telegram channel called BlackMirror. In an email exchange, BlackMirror told the Guardian that it released the \u201csamples\u201d in order to stimulate interest from potential \u201cacquirers\u201d. The email containing the dossier was allegedly sent in March 2010 by Alexander Djordjadze, the head of the Russia 2018 organising committee, nine months before Fifa\u2019s executive council delivered the 2018 tournament to Russia in a secret ballot. According to the Insider, it was sent to Igor Shuvalov, then a deputy prime minister under Vladimir Putin, Arkady Dvorkovich, an aide to the then-president Dmitry Medvedev, and Kapkov, who later became the head of Moscow\u2019s culture department. Fifa opened an investigation in 2014, but ultimately decided there was not enough evidence of bribery to re-run the vote. Fifa\u2019s head judge in the inquest noted that it had limited access to potential evidence and that the computers used by the Russian bid team had been destroyed after the vote. The emails were purportedly stolen from Kapkov, who left the government in 2015. Screenshots of the emails were released on the BlackMirror Telegram channel. Reached by the Guardian, the person or people behind the account avoided saying directly that they were selling the emails for money, writing instead that they would discuss \u201cconditions\u201d to \u201ctransfer\u201d the archive with \u201cpotential acquirers.\u201d BlackMirror said it didn\u2019t have any personal reaction to the information revealed in the emails. BlackMirror did not immediately say what price it wanted for the emails, but prices for similar archives can cost tens of thousands of pounds. In 2016, the hacking group Anonymous International reportedly requested 100 bitcoin, then about \u00a343,000, for emails purportedly from Kapkov\u2019s account. It is unclear whether the two sets of emails are connected, although BlackMirror said it has emails dated up to 2019, indicating more recent access to Kapkov\u2019s account. Asked how it had come into possession of the emails, BlackMirror said: \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss technical questions.\u201d BlackMirror said it was already considering another \u201crelease\u201d of files, likely not related to Russia\u2019s World Cup bid. The Insider said it had received originals from BlackMirror of the files allegedly shared between Kapkov and powerful Russian officials. Besides the dossier, they include strategy documents for a wide-reaching influence campaign among the 2018 World Cup organising committee and even large sponsors of the sporting organisation. Alexei Sorokin, the head of Russia\u2019s 2018 bid team, told the RBC news outlet that the documents were fake and that there was never any dossier of Fifa executive committee members. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he said, adding that Kapkov took no part in the bid process. \u201cIt seems to me that the whole thing was fabricated from beginning to end.\u201d He also noted that Russia had answered questions during an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d into the vote and said that \u201call of our \u2018influence\u2019 came during open contacts\u201d.",

In Daniel Day Lewis\u2019s apparently final acting role, he finds charismatic rigour in Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker of London\u2019s 1950s couture world. On the surface, it\u2019s the story of a capricious perfectionist, finding his muse in Alma, a young, shy waitress, with whom he begins a love affair. But when the tables turn, underneath lies a domestic power struggle that develops into something disturbing \u2013 and wickedly funny. Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood composes a classical-style score that\u2019s lush, swoony and increasingly eerie, adding enigmatic layers to the film\u2019s perverse undertones.</p> <h2><strong>Blockers</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By Kay Cannon (US, 2018) \u2013 11 November</strong></em></p> <p>The three girls at the centre of the raunchy Blockers make a pact through emoji-coded texts to lose their virginity on prom night. Upon discovery of this thread, their overprotective parents (a hilarious Lesley Mann, Ike Barinholtz and John Cena) band together to put a stop to their daughters\u2019 plans. It\u2019s silly, riotous fun, with ridiculous obstacles standing in the way between parents and kids. Director Kay Cannon instils what could be an outdated concept with surprising maturity, entrusting her trio of teens with a self-aware confidence around their sexuality. Here, the unhinged adults have more to learn from the intelligent adolescents. It\u2019s this level of depth that makes this overlooked comedy stick out from the crowd \u2013 proving the experiences of a coming-of-age story aren\u2019t just limited to youngsters, it can be for grownups too.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Bojack Horseman season 6, part one (TV, out now), Dolemite is My Name (film, out now), Outlander season 4 (TV, 5 November), The King (film, 1 November), Seven (film, 15 November), The Irishman (film, 27 November), Atlantics (film, 29 November)</p> <h2><em><strong>Amazon</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Modern Love</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By John Carney (US, 2019)</strong> <strong>\u2013 out now</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8040dcf28a986ca3b90f92581f3109bff7c9ca7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8040dcf28a986ca3b90f92581f3109bff7c9ca7/0_232_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Keener and Dev Patel in Modern Love\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Keener and Dev Patel in Modern Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giovanni Rufino/Amazon Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nothing quite beats the feeling of turning on a comforting rom-com and embracing all of its gooey predictability. In John Carney\u2019s (Once, Sing Street) anthology series, each episode brings to life stories inspired by the popular New York Times column on \u201crelationships, feelings, betrayals, and revelations\u201d. While it may prove frustratingly mawkish for some, there are a few gems tucked in between all the cheese. The episode titled When Cupid Is a Prying Journalist, with Dev Patel as an app founder and Catherine Keener as the journalist interviewing him for a story, particularly shines. With a stacked cast including Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Andrew Scott, the show\u2019s lightness and warmth should be enough to tickle the fancy of those who want to snuggle up in bed with a cup of tea and lose themselves in some breezy escapism.</p> <h2><strong>One Child Nation</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang (US, 2019)</strong></em> \u2013<em><strong> 8 November</strong></em></p> <p>This Grand Jury prize-winning documentary from Sundance takes a deep dive into the harrowing consequences of China\u2019s 35-year one-child policy. Told through the perspective of co-director Nanfu Wang, the film paints a shocking picture of the ways this social experiment \u2013 scrapped at the end of 2015 \u2013 affected more than 1 billion people, and continues to have a devastating impact on its citizens\u2019 lives to this day. The film\u2019s eye-opening revelations are simultaneously up close and personal: mothers forced into abortions, foetuses discarded in garbage dumps, abandoned babies on the streets. Among the interviewees are Wang\u2019s own family members, village chiefs and former family planning officials \u2013 and the spectrum of emotions on display, which range from grief, guilt to remorse, is heart-wrenching. A vital, enthralling watch.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Brittany Runs a Marathon (film, 15 November), The Report (film, 29 November)</p> <h2><em><strong>ABC iView</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Dark Place</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>(Australia, 2019)</strong></em> \u2013 <em><strong>out now</strong></em></p> <p>This horror anthology, which made the rounds of the Australian film festivals earlier this year, consists of bite-sized stories from five emerging Indigenous Australian filmmakers. Full of blood and guts (at times literally), each narrative varies in style and tone, all the while leaning into and shaking up familiar horror conventions. Featuring mythical creatures from other worlds such as bush ghouls and fanged water creatures, to the murky, more realistic horrors of sex slavery, these films are united by their confrontation of Australia\u2019s ugly colonial past and how this manifests in the present. Collectively, a telemovie that goes beyond mere spooky popcorn entertainment.</p> <h2><strong>Total Control</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By Rachel Perkins (Australia, 2019) \u2013 new episodes every Sunday</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a70bb2bd1e8cca5f7fb3f0d1567551936733176e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a70bb2bd1e8cca5f7fb3f0d1567551936733176e/0_0_2150_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deborah Mailman as Alex and Rachel Griffiths as prime minister Rachel Anderson in Total Control\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deborah Mailman as Alex and Rachel Griffiths as prime minister Rachel Anderson in Total Control.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Platt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Deborah Mailman is Alex Irving: a gutsy Indigenous activist appointed as a senator in federal parliament by prime minister Rachel Anderson (Rachel Griffiths) after a video of her role in a horrific domestic violence incident in her hometown of Winton goes viral. Directed by Rachel Perkins, Total Control features all the walking and talking, back-stabbing and moral conflict you\u2019d expect of a political drama \u2013 but it\u2019s made especially timely by its refreshing manoeuvring of the obvious gender and racial imbalance in Canberra, and its protagonist\u2019s ambition to create change through the system. With puncturing, snappy dialogue, the show shines a damning spotlight on the drastically high rates of young Indigenous deaths in custody, entrenched racism, and the shortfalls in the recognition of Indigenous land rights. Mailman\u2019s performance is magnetic, commanding, and at times gleefully unpredictable.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions</strong>: Frayed (TV, new episodes every Wednesday), The Strange Chores (TV, every day from 31 October), Julia Zemiro\u2019s Home Delivery (TV, 13 November), Carpark Clubbing (web series, out now)</p> <h2><em><strong>SBS On Demand</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Years and Years</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By Russell T Davies (UK, 2019)</strong> \u2013 <strong>6 November</strong></em></p> <p>Set in the not so distant future, this brilliant six-part BBC One series from Russell T Davies (Doctor Who, A Very English Scandal) envisions a post-2019 world that has only become \u201chotter and faster and madder\u201d. It\u2019s terrifyingly realistic, though miraculously still maintains moments of light-hearted optimism. The show is grounded in the day-to-day life of three generations of the Lyons family based in Manchester, leaping through time between 2019 and 2034. It imagines a planet where Donald Trump is elected for a second term, the north pole has melted, and China and US trade wars have escalated to the point of nuclear explosive. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom though: energetic family dynamics and giddy technological forecasts (think Snapchat dog filters as actual masks) infuse the show with playful wit. The show is ultimately a blaring alarm bell: a glimpse of what could so easily lie ahead. It\u2019ll be hard completely suspending your disbelief for this one.</p> <h2><strong>Black Narcissus</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (UK, 1947) \u2013 6 November</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff976a2bab04fcec01d7b99fdcacca08d7e29bc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff976a2bab04fcec01d7b99fdcacca08d7e29bc2/0_136_2208_1325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1947 film, Black Narcissus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feast for the eyes: the 1947 Powell and Pressburger film Black Narcissus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eye-popping technicolour and staggering extreme close-ups come to mind when one thinks of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\u2019s psychological melodrama. Often heralded as one of the first true erotic dramas, Black Narcissus is a feast for the eyes. Amid the remarkable, lofty landscape of the Himalayas (it won the Oscar at the time for best cinematography and art direction), a group of nuns struggle to set up a convent in the high altitude of the mountains. Howling winds and geographic isolation stir up repressed memories and carnal passions, festering and eventually exploding with a hyperbolic sensuousness. In particular, the film is brought to delicious, electric heights by Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth, driven to the brink of madness by lustful jealousy. A special collection of films by the writing, directing and producing duo Powell and Pressburger will be playing on SBS World Movies this month, later dropping into SBS On Demand.</p> <p><strong>Honourable Mentions: </strong>Sink or Swim (film, 2 November), Broadchurch box set (TV, 14 November), Blue Murder (TV, 20 November), On Becoming God in Central Florida<em><strong> </strong></em>(TV, 21 November), Wellington Paranormal Season 2 (TV, 28 November)</p> <h2><em><strong>Stan</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>School of Rock</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>By Richard Linklater (US, 2003) \u2013 out now</strong></em></p> <p>The premise of a rock music enthusiast posing as a substitute teacher at a private elementary school is made irresistibly fun by the genius pairing of celebrated indie director Richard Linklater and actor Jack Black, whose sprightly comedic performance here bursts with infectious energy. A class of young gifted musicians are handed down lessons in rock\u2018n\u2019roll and life, defying parental and teacher expectations with rebellious joy and humour, to compete in the Battle of the Bands. The film has since been turned into a stage musical (showing at Sydney\u2019s Capitol Theatre from November), but it still holds up magnificently as the feel-good, rocking delight it was upon its cinematic release.</p> <p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong>: Hairspray, Dreamgirls (films, out now), Wayne\u2019s World (film, 2 November), Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints (film, 6 November), Tom Cruise collection (films, 15 November), Grease, Saturday Night Fever (films, 16 November),</p> <h2><em><strong>Foxtel</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>His Dark Materials</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>UK, 2019 \u2013 5 November</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cab99933b10be26320f820f19b32ed794dfc6f4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cab99933b10be26320f820f19b32ed794dfc6f4c/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keen) and Mrs Coulter (Ruth Wilson) in His Dark Materials.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lyra Belacqua (Dafne Keen) and Mrs Coulter (Ruth Wilson) in His Dark Materials.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screen Grab/BBC/Bad Wolf/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philip Pullman\u2019s esteemed fantasy novel trilogy is finally given the proper treatment it deserves with this new adventure-packed TV series from HBO and the BBC. Erasing the ill-judged 2007 film The Golden Compass from memory,<em> </em>this adaptation stars newcomer Dafne Keen as Lyra: a young orphan living in an alternative world, where the human soul takes the form of a physical animal companion, and the north pole is the only place to escape the oppressive rule of the Magisterium. Featuring Ruth Wilson as the alluring Mrs Coulter and James McAvoy as Lyra\u2019s adventurer uncle, the show follows Lyra in her search for her kidnapped best friend, taking her on an epic quest from Oxford up to the north pole, to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. The world-building is rich and technically impressive, capturing the complexities of the universe \u2013 peculiar and wondrous \u2013 through a child\u2019s eyes.</p> <p><strong>Honourable Mentions:</strong> Watchmen (TV, out now), Catherine the Great (TV, 3 November), The Favourite, The Hate U Give (films, 1 November), Love Simon (film, 29 November)</p> <h2><strong>Apple TV+</strong></h2> <p><strong>From 2 November</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a huge month for streaming, with Apple adding their own platform into the increasingly crowded arena.

Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood composes a classical-style score that\u2019s lush, swoony and increasingly eerie, adding enigmatic layers to the film\u2019s perverse undertones. Blockers By Kay Cannon (US, 2018) \u2013 11 November The three girls at the centre of the raunchy Blockers make a pact through emoji-coded texts to lose their virginity on prom night. Upon discovery of this thread, their overprotective parents (a hilarious Lesley Mann, Ike Barinholtz and John Cena) band together to put a stop to their daughters\u2019 plans. It\u2019s silly, riotous fun, with ridiculous obstacles standing in the way between parents and kids. Director Kay Cannon instils what could be an outdated concept with surprising maturity, entrusting her trio of teens with a self-aware confidence around their sexuality. Here, the unhinged adults have more to learn from the intelligent adolescents. It\u2019s this level of depth that makes this overlooked comedy stick out from the crowd \u2013 proving the experiences of a coming-of-age story aren\u2019t just limited to youngsters, it can be for grownups too. Honourable mentions: Bojack Horseman season 6, part one (TV, out now), Dolemite is My Name (film, out now), Outlander season 4 (TV, 5 November), The King (film, 1 November), Seven (film, 15 November), The Irishman (film, 27 November), Atlantics (film, 29 November) Amazon Modern Love By John Carney (US, 2019) \u2013 out now Nothing quite beats the feeling of turning on a comforting rom-com and embracing all of its gooey predictability. In John Carney\u2019s (Once, Sing Street) anthology series, each episode brings to life stories inspired by the popular New York Times column on \u201crelationships, feelings, betrayals, and revelations\u201d. While it may prove frustratingly mawkish for some, there are a few gems tucked in between all the cheese. The episode titled When Cupid Is a Prying Journalist, with Dev Patel as an app founder and Catherine Keener as the journalist interviewing him for a story, particularly shines. With a stacked cast including Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Andrew Scott, the show\u2019s lightness and warmth should be enough to tickle the fancy of those who want to snuggle up in bed with a cup of tea and lose themselves in some breezy escapism. One Child Nation By Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang (US, 2019) \u2013 8 November This Grand Jury prize-winning documentary from Sundance takes a deep dive into the harrowing consequences of China\u2019s 35-year one-child policy. Told through the perspective of co-director Nanfu Wang, the film paints a shocking picture of the ways this social experiment \u2013 scrapped at the end of 2015 \u2013 affected more than 1 billion people, and continues to have a devastating impact on its citizens\u2019 lives to this day. The film\u2019s eye-opening revelations are simultaneously up close and personal: mothers forced into abortions, foetuses discarded in garbage dumps, abandoned babies on the streets. Among the interviewees are Wang\u2019s own family members, village chiefs and former family planning officials \u2013 and the spectrum of emotions on display, which range from grief, guilt to remorse, is heart-wrenching. A vital, enthralling watch. Honourable mentions: Brittany Runs a Marathon (film, 15 November), The Report (film, 29 November) ABC iView Dark Place (Australia, 2019) \u2013 out now This horror anthology, which made the rounds of the Australian film festivals earlier this year, consists of bite-sized stories from five emerging Indigenous Australian filmmakers. Full of blood and guts (at times literally), each narrative varies in style and tone, all the while leaning into and shaking up familiar horror conventions. Featuring mythical creatures from other worlds such as bush ghouls and fanged water creatures, to the murky, more realistic horrors of sex slavery, these films are united by their confrontation of Australia\u2019s ugly colonial past and how this manifests in the present. Collectively, a telemovie that goes beyond mere spooky popcorn entertainment. Total Control By Rachel Perkins (Australia, 2019) \u2013 new episodes every Sunday Deborah Mailman is Alex Irving: a gutsy Indigenous activist appointed as a senator in federal parliament by prime minister Rachel Anderson (Rachel Griffiths) after a video of her role in a horrific domestic violence incident in her hometown of Winton goes viral. Directed by Rachel Perkins, Total Control features all the walking and talking, back-stabbing and moral conflict you\u2019d expect of a political drama \u2013 but it\u2019s made especially timely by its refreshing manoeuvring of the obvious gender and racial imbalance in Canberra, and its protagonist\u2019s ambition to create change through the system. With puncturing, snappy dialogue, the show shines a damning spotlight on the drastically high rates of young Indigenous deaths in custody, entrenched racism, and the shortfalls in the recognition of Indigenous land rights. Mailman\u2019s performance is magnetic, commanding, and at times gleefully unpredictable. Honourable mentions: Frayed (TV, new episodes every Wednesday), The Strange Chores (TV, every day from 31 October), Julia Zemiro\u2019s Home Delivery (TV, 13 November), Carpark Clubbing (web series, out now) SBS On Demand Years and Years By Russell T Davies (UK, 2019) \u2013 6 November Set in the not so distant future, this brilliant six-part BBC One series from Russell T Davies (Doctor Who, A Very English Scandal) envisions a post-2019 world that has only become \u201chotter and faster and madder\u201d. It\u2019s terrifyingly realistic, though miraculously still maintains moments of light-hearted optimism. The show is grounded in the day-to-day life of three generations of the Lyons family based in Manchester, leaping through time between 2019 and 2034. It imagines a planet where Donald Trump is elected for a second term, the north pole has melted, and China and US trade wars have escalated to the point of nuclear explosive. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom though: energetic family dynamics and giddy technological forecasts (think Snapchat dog filters as actual masks) infuse the show with playful wit. The show is ultimately a blaring alarm bell: a glimpse of what could so easily lie ahead. It\u2019ll be hard completely suspending your disbelief for this one. Black Narcissus By Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (UK, 1947) \u2013 6 November Eye-popping technicolour and staggering extreme close-ups come to mind when one thinks of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\u2019s psychological melodrama. Often heralded as one of the first true erotic dramas, Black Narcissus is a feast for the eyes. Amid the remarkable, lofty landscape of the Himalayas (it won the Oscar at the time for best cinematography and art direction), a group of nuns struggle to set up a convent in the high altitude of the mountains. Howling winds and geographic isolation stir up repressed memories and carnal passions, festering and eventually exploding with a hyperbolic sensuousness. In particular, the film is brought to delicious, electric heights by Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth, driven to the brink of madness by lustful jealousy. A special collection of films by the writing, directing and producing duo Powell and Pressburger will be playing on SBS World Movies this month, later dropping into SBS On Demand. Honourable Mentions: Sink or Swim (film, 2 November), Broadchurch box set (TV, 14 November), Blue Murder (TV, 20 November), On Becoming God in Central Florida (TV, 21 November), Wellington Paranormal Season 2 (TV, 28 November) Stan School of Rock By Richard Linklater (US, 2003) \u2013 out now The premise of a rock music enthusiast posing as a substitute teacher at a private elementary school is made irresistibly fun by the genius pairing of celebrated indie director Richard Linklater and actor Jack Black, whose sprightly comedic performance here bursts with infectious energy. A class of young gifted musicians are handed down lessons in rock\u2018n\u2019roll and life, defying parental and teacher expectations with rebellious joy and humour, to compete in the Battle of the Bands. The film has since been turned into a stage musical (showing at Sydney\u2019s Capitol Theatre from November), but it still holds up magnificently as the feel-good, rocking delight it was upon its cinematic release. Honourable Mentions: Hairspray, Dreamgirls (films, out now), Wayne\u2019s World (film, 2 November), Ain\u2019t Them Bodies Saints (film, 6 November), Tom Cruise collection (films, 15 November), Grease, Saturday Night Fever (films, 16 November), Foxtel His Dark Materials UK, 2019 \u2013 5 November Philip Pullman\u2019s esteemed fantasy novel trilogy is finally given the proper treatment it deserves with this new adventure-packed TV series from HBO and the BBC. Erasing the ill-judged 2007 film The Golden Compass from memory, this adaptation stars newcomer Dafne Keen as Lyra: a young orphan living in an alternative world, where the human soul takes the form of a physical animal companion, and the north pole is the only place to escape the oppressive rule of the Magisterium. Featuring Ruth Wilson as the alluring Mrs Coulter and James McAvoy as Lyra\u2019s adventurer uncle, the show follows Lyra in her search for her kidnapped best friend, taking her on an epic quest from Oxford up to the north pole, to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. The world-building is rich and technically impressive, capturing the complexities of the universe \u2013 peculiar and wondrous \u2013 through a child\u2019s eyes. Honourable Mentions: Watchmen (TV, out now), Catherine the Great (TV, 3 November), The Favourite, The Hate U Give (films, 1 November), Love Simon (film, 29 November) Apple TV+ From 2 November It\u2019s a huge month for streaming, with Apple adding their own platform into the increasingly crowded arena. At the top of their line-up is Morning Wars, the high-stakes TV drama budgeted at a gobsmacking $15m per episode (that\u2019s as much as Game of Thrones). The A-list cast is led by Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell, and the show pulls back the curtain on the razing ambitions and tussles for power behind an early morning newscast. Other highlights include Dickinson, a modern comedic twist on the coming-of-age story of rebellious young poet Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld); See, a dystopian future where humans have been either wiped out or blinded (with Jason Momoa as a father of twin girls gifted with vision); and The Elephant Queen, a character-driven wildlife documentary centred on a species on the verge of extinction. While there\u2019ll be only a small selection of originals available upon launch, the catalogue will expand in the months ahead, to include M Night Shyamalan\u2019s thriller Servant, Oprah (an in-conversation between Winfrey and authors around the world), and Sundance award-winning film Hala, starring Australian Geraldine Viswanathan. Disney+ From 19 November Disney\u2019s new dedicated streaming service will house their own library of original TV shows and films, and the plentiful entertainment that falls under their subsidiaries Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, National Geographic and 20th Century Fox. Offering access to its back catalogue of nostalgia trips (Australia\u2019s suite is yet to be announced, though this US tweet thread might clue us in on a few, including all 30 seasons of The Simpsons), it will also exclusively hold Disney\u2019s 2019 cinema releases and beyond, including Captain Marvel, Avengers: Endgame and The Lion King. Most notably, the much-anticipated live-action Star Wars TV series spin-off The Mandalorian headlines Disney+\u2019s launch. Created by Jon Favreau, this original series is set after the fall of the Empire and before the emergence of the First Order, following a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the Star Wars galaxy. Other Disney+ originals to keep an eye out in their continual roll-out include The World According to Jeff Goldblum, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, the holiday comedy Noelle (all available on launch), as well as Diary of a Female President (available January 2020) and a new Lizzie McGuire series with its original cast members.",

Took advantage of a two-paced wicket and were chasing 20 below par. Vince played outstandingly well. Have had a great time in New Zealand so far in the lead up. Very happy with the depth, as shown by having three debuts today. We need 15 or 17 guys who can start in a playing XI to win a World Cup. All our planning is geared towards the World Cup next year.

There were times when the required rate was edging towards nine an over, but the home side needed early wickets for that to matter in this day and age of T20 chasing. Vince\u2019s innings was defining, striking the ball beautifully from the get-go, his 59 in 38 balls made when the game was there to be won, stroking seven fours and two sixes along the way. Eoin Morgan (34* from 21 balls) did the rest, with Sam Billings (14* off 11) finishing it with him.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbbaf2d8f08c428d893480c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T04:08:27.477Z\">4.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ENGLAND WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>18.3 overs: England 154-3 (Morgan 34, Billings 14) Target 154 </strong>The captain seals it with a six over midwicket off his opposing number.

Forget about the skipper for now though, Billings has backed himself to play a full-blooded reverse sweep and has nailed it, helping ease any squeeze.

This time around, he\u2019s charged at Southee before flat-batting him over his head for SIX. That sounds brutal, and it was, but he managed to make it look well pretty. Earlier, Morgan showed his own class with a steer not too dissimilar to the shot his number three played in the previous over, beating everyone with immaculate placement. 33 off 30 needed.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dbbaa2c8f08c428d89347e2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-01T03:49:46.335Z\">3.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Vince to 50!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>14th over: England 108-2 (Vince 52, Morgan 9) Target 154 </strong>Right, Southee has turned back to his speedster Lockie Ferguson.

Gorgeous batting. It takes him to 50 in 33 balls - the defining innings of this game. It\u2019s Morgan\u2019s turn to now get into the act, happily uppercutting over the cordon to narrow the gap yet further.

Later in the over, the seamer tried to go upstairs at the Hampshire captain but didn\u2019t get it anywhere near high enough, gifting him another four.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Ali Martin\u2019s report from Hagley Oval: And that\u2019s that. The five-game series continues in two days time at Wellington. Thanks for your company for the first leg of this T20I OBO double header. I\u2019ll be back in three hours for Australia v Sri Lanka at the MCG. And I can tell you, it\u2019s looking a treat. Until then! Tim Southee speaks. \u201cAll three elements of the game not at our best. Score wasn\u2019t a bad one and felt competitive at halfway but were off with the ball and in the field.\u201d Eoin Morgan\u2019s turn. \u201cGame was won in the first innings; bowlers did an absolutely outstanding job, especially men on debut Sam Curran and Pat Brown. Took advantage of a two-paced wicket and were chasing 20 below par. Vince played outstandingly well. Have had a great time in New Zealand so far in the lead up. Very happy with the depth, as shown by having three debuts today. We need 15 or 17 guys who can start in a playing XI to win a World Cup. All our planning is geared towards the World Cup next year. A couple of places up for grabs in that 15-man squad and now new guys get to stake their claim. Isn\u2019t happy with how he hit them, though.\u201d James Vince is player of the match. He speaks. \u201cNice from a personal point of view to make a contribution and get the tour off to a winning start. Would like to have the ball again where he got out but happy with how he played. Morgs did a good job to see it home.\u201d Never in doubt. Not really. There were times when the required rate was edging towards nine an over, but the home side needed early wickets for that to matter in this day and age of T20 chasing. Vince\u2019s innings was defining, striking the ball beautifully from the get-go, his 59 in 38 balls made when the game was there to be won, stroking seven fours and two sixes along the way. Eoin Morgan (34* from 21 balls) did the rest, with Sam Billings (14* off 11) finishing it with him. 18.3 overs: England 154-3 (Morgan 34, Billings 14) Target 154 The captain seals it with a six over midwicket off his opposing number. They\u2019ve done it with nine balls in hand. Nicely chased. 18th over: England 144-3 (Morgan 24, Billings 14) Target 154 Top shot, Morgan down to Ferguson, lifting him over mid-off for four. Nothing wrong with the ball - it\u2019s resourceful, experienced batting. His bad luck continues later in the set, winning Billings\u2019 inside edge, running away for another four. Ten runs left, two overs to get them. 17th over: England 133-3 (Morgan 18, Billings 9) Target 154 Sodhi is a wicket taker. If he can get rid of Morgan, New Zealand have a sniff. If they don\u2019t, they can\u2019t win. Simple. Forget about the skipper for now though, Billings has backed himself to play a full-blooded reverse sweep and has nailed it, helping ease any squeeze. Two more to midwicket and another in that direction, then Morgan finishes with one to cover. Ten off it and the captain is back on strike. All over. 16th over: England 123-3 (Morgan 16, Billings 1) Target 154 Billings soaks up one, two, three Santner dots before retaining the strike with a single to finish the over and the spinner\u2019s spell - he took 3/23. 31 from four overs the job left for England captain and his new deputy. Good grief, you talk a bloke up! Look, it was still a fantastic innings, probably a matchwinning one, but he\u2019s popped a legitimate half-tracker straight into the hands of Martin Guptill at midwicket. He really should seen this chase through to the end. Oh well. 15th over: England 121-2 (Vince 59, Morgan 15) Target 154 When you see James Vince bat like this, it is hard to understand how he hasn\u2019t bossed international cricket at all levels. This time around, he\u2019s charged at Southee before flat-batting him over his head for SIX. That sounds brutal, and it was, but he managed to make it look well pretty. Earlier, Morgan showed his own class with a steer not too dissimilar to the shot his number three played in the previous over, beating everyone with immaculate placement. 33 off 30 needed. 14th over: England 108-2 (Vince 52, Morgan 9) Target 154 Right, Southee has turned back to his speedster Lockie Ferguson. This might be just about last roll of the dice stuff. It doesn\u2019t bother Vince though, who leans back and carves another lovely boundary, splitting the gap and beating the sweeper. Gorgeous batting. It takes him to 50 in 33 balls - the defining innings of this game. It\u2019s Morgan\u2019s turn to now get into the act, happily uppercutting over the cordon to narrow the gap yet further. Ten off, making 34 from the last three. 13th over: England 98-2 (Vince 47, Morgan 4) Target 154 Vince has owned this chase from the moment he walked out at the fall of the first wicket. In the previous over, he took the initiative at an important time. This time around, he\u2019s backed himself to smash Kuggeleijn over the long-on rope and has delivered with ease. Big. Later in the over, the seamer tried to go upstairs at the Hampshire captain but didn\u2019t get it anywhere near high enough, gifting him another four. It makes 13 off the over, the task now 56 from 42. 12th over: England 85-2 (Vince 35, Morgan 3) Target 154 Just a Sodhi is edging towards another frustrating over for England, James Vince plays a couple of lovely strokes on the trot. He\u2019s down the track to the leggie, driving him through the air into the gap at cover for four - shot. Next ball he waits, goes back and forces another four with perfect timing. 11 off it, leaving England 69 in eight overs. 11th over: England 74-2 (Vince 25, Morgan 2) Target 154 Southee returns to Kuggeleijn, who is far more effective this time around, going for just four singles as Morgan opens his account. Clever from Santner! The spinner spotted Bairstow making room and pushed it through a touch quicker. The opener went through with his premeditated shot anyway, picking out the hosts\u2019 best fielder at deep midwicket. Not quite level pegging yet but not far off it. 10th over: England 70-2 (Vince 23, Morgan 1) Target 154 9th over: England 63-1 (Bairstow 32, Vince 19) Target 154 Yep, those kind of overs. Vince smashes Sodhi straight down the ground and Bairstow sweeps him with ease. Ten off it. Your move, Tim Southee. 8th over: England 53-1 (Bairstow 27, Vince 14) Target 154 Santner is bang up for this, vocal throughout his set, which goes for just the four singles and ends with three accurate dots. England are still only a couple of hefty overs away from breaking the back of this, but the Kiwis will be well in it themselves if they can get Bairstow asap. \u201cThere are teams and leagues here,\u201d adds Julian Menz of cricket in Sweden. \u201cMet an Aussie who had played for the national team. I used to turn out for the local team a few years back, but the oppostion consisted mainly of Indian ex-pats, and I am useless facing twirlies. I met my Swedish wife in London, and she scored points (runs?) early by pretending to be interested in cricket when I interupted a Hampstead Heath-to-Camden walk with a long stop at the Bull and Gate in Kentish Town to watch the cricket (2001, forget which series). Her parents still get confused between cricket and croquet.\u201d That\u2019s a great pub for a Sunday roast/session. 7th over: England 49-1 (Bairstow 26, Vince 11) Target 154 Some players can look the part the moment they walk into any game, and Vince is one of those. His second boundary is just as attractive as his first, this time timing Sodhi through cover off the back foot. Three further singles makes seven from it. But New Zealand need wickets. 6th over: England 42-1 (Bairstow 25, Vince 5) Target 154 Vince plays a beautiful shot off the back foot to immediately open his account All told, ten runs and a wicket from Santner\u2019s first over. England have gone at seven an over through the power play and now require exactly eight an over from here to win. I like those even numbers. Spin does the trick, Malan dancing but slicing to backward point. 5th over: England 32-0 (Bairstow 20, Malan 11) Target 154 So close to another of those ridiculous Guptill diving catches, unable to drag down a one-handed effort at backward square. Malan gets four for it. Otherwise, it\u2019s another very good set from the veteran seamer. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Adam.\u201d begins Gavin Twedily. I like that opening. Please go on. \u201cThere is something special about an overnight OBO. Admittedly, it\u2019s only 11 pm here in a very wet Montreal, but I\u2019ll be seeing this game out before turning in. I mention it\u2019s raining in Montreal because it was deemed by the city of Montreal to be too wet for the traditional trick or treat. Yes, they cancelled Halloween! It will now take place tomorrow night when hopefully the costumed weans won\u2019t melt. And unlike Julian in Sweden, I\u2019m drinking cheap red Aussie wine and can say cheers! to you and all of the cricket loving night owls.\u201d Cheers to you. I realised something last night. Given my girlfriend is having an actual baby in February, my dedicated opposition to all things Halloween is going to have to end in about four years, isn\u2019t it? 4th over: England 26-0 (Bairstow 19, Malan 6) Target 154 Malan\u2019s turn, lifting Ferguson over mid-on for a boundary of his own to start the new over. Oh, and I did Bairstow a disservice in the previous set: one of his boundaries, the second, actually went for six not four. Bairstow isn\u2019t far away from adding another boundary, driving hard out of the slot but straight to mid-off. Good fightback from Ferguson. 3rd over: England 21-0 (Bairstow 19, Malan 1) Target 154 Kuggeleijn is more appealing to Bairstow, the opener breaking the shackles with a controlled drive down the ground for four before clipping over square leg for another. He makes it three for the over when pulling a slower ball into the gap at midwicket - easy peasy; stand and deliver. Oh, make it four - crunching a square drive past point. 18 off it. 2nd over: England 3-0 (Bairstow 1, Malan 1) Target 154 Lockie Ferguson, everyone\u2019s favourite player from the World Cup (now that Shakib has been sullied), is sharing the new ball. Malan gives the strike back to Bairstow, who finally gets a run from his eighth delivery, cutting a single to the sweeper at point. He\u2019s too quick for Malan with a full ball; they appeal for lbw but it has pitched outside leg. He\u2019s immediately up at 90mph, two singles the lot for England\u2019s openers. The start the hosts needed defending this middling total. 1st over: England 1-0 (Bairstow 0, Malan 0) Target 154 As Southee begins, the camera pans to Ben Stokes, who is watching the game from the hospitality tent with his family. Fair enough, too. Good start, getting to movement away then finding Bairstow\u2019s inside edge with consecutive deliveries. Five dots now, followed by a legside wide, denying him a maiden. But the skipper closes it out with another delivery demanding defence from Bairstow. Fine work. The players are back on the field. Jonny Bairstow is opening with Dawid Malan. The captain Southee has the ball in his hand. PLAY! That shouldn\u2019t be enough. Granted, the track did hold up a bit, which didn\u2019t help the Blackcap bats, but England did plenty right with the ball from the very start. We\u2019ll find out in 15 minutes. \u201cGreetings from Sweden,\u201d writes Julian Menz, \u201cwhere I am currently up late trying to translate an academic paper from Swenglish to English. After the joys of summer, I had completely forgotten about the NZ jaunt. Sweden is not the greatest place for live cricket coverage, Summer consisted of TMS and the wife\u2019s family wondering why I was screaming \u201dSTOKES!! YES!!\u201d when I was supposed to be grilling and not throwing my beer in the air infront of our impressionable 4-year old daughter. Was following the baseball last night (under-rated sport in my opinion) but glad to have the cricket back. Adam, thanks for being there for us cricket-loving night owls. If I had a beer I\u2019d say Sk\u00e5l. It doesn\u2019t work with lemon mineral water, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d Great to have you with us, Julian. There is definitely something special about an overnight OBO. Plenty to come in November. 20th over: New Zealand 153-5 (Mitchell 30, Santner 1) Pat Brown would have won a lot of new fans for that performance, getting out of the 20th over on debut giving six runs away and no boundaries. Really well done. England need to go at 7.7 an over in their chase. Brown earns his first international wicket, Bairstow taking the very same catch that Vince put down in the previous over. Added style points too, completing the take with an athletic dive. 19th over: New Zealand 147-4 (Taylor 43, Mitchell 26) Vince drops Taylor at deep midwicket. It was hit hard and low but the Hampshire stylist usually has a dependable pair of hands. \u201cPaul Collingwood will not be amused,\u201d says Nasser Hussain of the fielding coach on tour. Taylor responds to the let off the only way he knows how: hammering Jordan over midwicket for six to being up the 50 partnership between this pair. Jordan responds well though, a dot and a single to cover. 2/28 from his four with Brown to bowl over 20. 18th over: New Zealand 138-4 (Taylor 35, Mitchell 25) Tom Curran\u2019s stock delivery at this stage of an innings is that back-of-the-hand number, which he lands so consistently. With pace off, well wide of the off-stump, neither man can beat deep point early on. But when he goes full and straight, Mitchell responds with a conventional, and blistering, straight drive for four. He\u2019s really looked the part since coming to the middle. Curran goes back to Plan A with his final two balls and gets out of the over giving up nine runs - he\u2019d take that. These two have put on 45 in 29. Jordan and Brown to finish it off. 17th over: New Zealand 129-4 (Taylor 32, Mitchell 19) Jordan does as you would expect, landing his full balls in a shoe box, so Taylor gets resourceful in the crease before delivery to make some room, slapping firmly past the bowler for four. It\u2019s the sort of stop Jordan often makes off his own bowling but his hand doesn\u2019t get down in time. A very bad delivery follows, a full toss on the pads of Mitchell, clipped with ease for six. 170 is still in range if these two see it out. NOT OUT! After about 25 replays, the TV ump is satisfied Taylor hit the ground rather than the ball. Dot ball; play on. IS TAYLOR CAUGHT BEHIND? Jordan thinks he found and edge with a quick, wide yorker. It was given not out so they have sent it upstairs. It looked like the clock expired but they\u2019re taking a look. 16th over: New Zealand 116-4 (Taylor 26, Mitchell 12) This is what Brown is mostly here for: his mad skillz at the death. It works a treat, neither batsmen able to really free their arms in response to deliveries that are typically dying as they reach the crease. But Mitchell gets out of the over with a bang, lofting a checked-drive over long-off for six. \u201cThat\u2019s perfection,\u201d says Nasser on telly, noting that he was able to back his timing, hitting with the wind. 11 off it. 15th over: New Zealand 105-4 (Taylor 23, Mitchell 4) Taylor brings up the New Zealand 100 with a very fine leg glance, beating the man on the 45. There is no doubt that the 35-year-old will be required in next year\u2019s World T20, one of the early IPL superstars. Determined running from Mitchell keeps the board ticking in the right direction for the locals, with a couple to midwicket. Can be finish the Tom Curran over with a bang? Nup. Instead, Taylor is nearly run out with an athletic dive-and-throw from the bowler. He\u2019s been very good. \u201cNot 19-7?\u201d asks Simon Clark. \u201cI thought England only won 19-7? Oh, wrong sport.\u201d Being a Melburnian, I\u2019m not qualified to comment on the sport you are referring to. Indeed, it\u2019s against the law. 14th over: New Zealand 96-4 (Taylor 17, Mitchell 1) Daryl Mitchell is the new man and has to find a way to go hard from the get-go. That\u2019s not easy against a bowler of Jordan\u2019s skill though, England\u2019s most experienced operator allowing just three singles after the wicket. He\u2019s unlucky there, right? Seifert miscues Jordan\u2019s full toss to Bairstow at midwicket and immediately signals to the umpire that they should check it and they do. The TV ump takes a couple of views of the replay and sticks with the original call. Felt high to me. 13th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Seifert 32, Taylor 15) Taylor\u2019s experience is on show when capitalising on a Rashid delivery that\u2019s only slightly off the mark, sweeping expertly for four. With that boundary banked early in the over, they\u2019re happy picking out the sweepers for the rest, adding ten risk-free runs from it. 160? 170? 12th over: New Zealand 83-3 (Seifert 30, Taylor 7) Slammin\u2019 Sammy Curran is back for his final over, and gets through it giving up just seven runs in ones and twos, operating exclusively in slower balls. 11th over: New Zealand 76-3 (Seifert 29, Taylor 2) The veteran Taylor in at No5, off the mark to long-on after missing Rashid\u2019s wrong\u2019un first up. Just four runs from the successful over. Just when de Grandhomme looked well placed to shift gears, he\u2019s miscued Rashid down the throat of Vince at deep midwicket. 10th over: New Zealand 72-2 (Seifert 27, de Grandhomme 19) Brown again, who is taking the pace off each ball until he slams a bouncer in at full tilt. A lot to like. But de Grandhomme\u2019s patience has run out, electing to climb into the next shorter slower ball, waiting so long for it to reach him that he only had one hand on the handle when contact was made, still strong enough to clear the square leg rope. 9th over: New Zealand 61-2 (Seifert 26, de Grandhomme 9) Better from Adil Rashid, the wrong\u2019uns biting harder than in his first over. Granted, it all comes after Seifert lifts him around the corner for four to start the set, but it looked better. And we all know that wrist spin is all about how it appears. Why else would you do it? 8th over: New Zealand 53-2 (Seifert 20, de Grandhomme 7) Pat Brown is let down from his first ball in international cricket, Gregory turning one into three with a misfield. He\u2019s straight back on it though, beating de Grandhomme with a clever little legcutter. We see a knuckle ball later in the over, very nearly pushed to Morgan at extra cover by Seifert. Nasser is a huge fan. Five from it. Nice start. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Steve Richards. \u201cLovely to see NZ cricket again on live TV - they have nice \u201cstadia\u201d - better than the half-empty \u201cenormo-domes\u201d when Aus are/will monster Sri Lanka.\u201d Couldn\u2019t agree more. They will do decent numbers here tonight because of the massive Sri Lankan community in Melbourne, but as a rule, I wonder whether some of the smaller venues should be looked at for T20Is at this time of year? Food for thought. 7th over: New Zealand 48-2 (Seifert 16, de Grandhomme 6) Adil Rashid is back for his first bowl for England since the World Cup Final. He gives de Grandhomme a chance to free his arms early in the over with a short wrong\u2019un, put away with easy to square leg for four. Five singles around the sweepers makes nine from it. Just when Munro looked to have got it together, he\u2019s given Morgan an easy catch at midwicket, clipping a low full toss to the England skipper. The perfect way to end the power play for the visitors. 6th over: New Zealand 39-2 (Seifert 13) 5th over: New Zealand 36-1 (Munro 20, Seifert 11) Shot! Tim Seifert has a big opportunity here at No3 with Williamson resting and he\u2019s into his work here, slamming Sam Curran\u2019s short ball, off the front foot, well into the stand. It inspires Munro, who dances at a slower ball later in the over, clobbering it over long-on for a second six in the over. Make it three, the best of them, Munro getting down on one knee to lift Curran over the fine leg boundary. 21 off it. [Superintendent Hastings] Now we\u2019re cooking with gas. [/Superintendant Hastings] The TV wideshots of Hagley Oval are a real treat. One of my favourite grounds on the circuit, that\u2019s for sure. Of course, Lancaster Park was the international venue in Christchurch before the 2011 earthquake. 4th over: New Zealand 15-1 (Munro 7, Seifert 3) Sam Billings is on the TV mic, England\u2019s wicketkeeper and vice-captain in this tour. Thrilled to see him back in business after a tough 2019 where he missed most of the season with a bad shoulder injury. He makes a handy diving stop down the legside, Tom Curran missing his mark for the first time so far today. Munro tucks into the next offering, finally middling a swipe, nailing the off-cutter over square leg for New Zealand\u2019s first boundary of the match. Curran bounces back with expert Ian Harvey back-of-the-hand slower ball. Short-form cricket might be about big bats most of the time, but the skills these fast bowlers now bring to the crease really is something to behold. 3rd over: New Zealand 7-1 (Munro 3, Seifert 1) The new man Seifert is off the mark first ball with a well-timed push to point. Munro is battling hard out there, his three runs coming from ten balls. Chopped on! The result of pressure built up by the Currans at both ends. A wonderful start from the visitors. 2nd over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 1, Munro 2) Tom Curran is opening the bowling with his brother - isn\u2019t that nice? He\u2019s right on it too, Munro unable to get anything away. The southpaw is driving and flicking and charging but none of it works, an excellent maiden the result. Top pace and variety from the older Curran. From our man at the ground, Ali Martin, he confirms the new ICC regs mean that there will be no boundary countback in the event of a tie into the future. We\u2019ll Super Over and Super Over until we have ourselves a winner. RIP boundary countback - we hardly knew you. 1st over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 1, Munro 2) Tidy start, Guptill beaten by a Curran delivery that shaped away nicely with his second ball. He\u2019s off strike via his thigh pad, Munro getting the first run from the bat to backward square, Guptill off the mark in the same direction. Munro has a big dip at the final ball but doesn\u2019t get much of it, hacking away to midwicket to keep the strike. Well bowled. Anthems for a T20I? Unorthodox. But if it means getting five renditions of God Defend New Zealand over the next week, I\u2019m all for it. I doubt we\u2019ll get them at the MCG tonight, mind you. I\u2019m actually reporting from the MCG at the moment. Yes, since OBOing the 2nd Australia v Sri Lanka T20 on Wednesday, I\u2019ve flown here. Bottle of wine, couple of rom coms, cry - I\u2019m good to go. THE PLAYERS ARE WALKING ONTO THE FIELD TO ZOMBIE NATION! Wonderful areas from the Cricket Ground DJ. Sam Curran has the ball in his hand, bowling the first over in T20I debut. PLAY! National anthems shortly. But first, a moment of silence to remember the 51 people murdered in Christchurch eight months ago in the mosque attacks. Today\u2019s ticket sales are being donated to a fund encouraging the participation of minorities in sport. \u201cWe are all beautifully the same and wonderfully different.\u201d Nicely done. \u201cGuptill is the one in this XI who will be hurting the most,\u201d suggests Abhijato Sensarma in an email to me. You can write me too. Or tweet. \u201cThose few missed inches in the last moments of the World Cup final must be playing on his mind. These things can become distractions (as Maxwell rightly said in an interview recently), but with enough clarity of thought they can motivate better than anything else too. Time to start regaining form and show the world his worth again? No better place to begin than here, and I don\u2019t see why he won\u2019t be up to the task!\u201d Having watched Marty G make bulk runs against Australia last year in this format, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to worry about. Hard to believe this is Sam Curran\u2019s debut. I\u2019m sure you all know plenty about him. Pat Brown, perhaps less so unless you\u2019ve been watching him dominate for Worcs in the Blast. He\u2019s earned this chance. Lewis Gregory too, probably in at number six, the finisher role Morgan has said he\u2019s looking for ahead of the T20 World Cup. \u201cHe looks about 11 years of age,\u201d David Lloyd, on TV, says of Brown. \u201cBut he has all the slower balls and can also bowl at 90mph too.\u201d Both captains agree the track is a belter. Different format, of course, but this is where Brendon McCullum slapped a 54-ball Test ton to finish his amazing international journey in 2016. Eoin Morgan said at the toss there is a short boundary one side. This should be fun. Debuts everywhere for England. Three of them to be precise: Lewis Gregory, Sam Curran and Pat Brown. This should be fun. New Zealand: Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, Tim Seifert (w), Ross Taylor, Colin de Grandhomme, Daryl Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, Scott Kuggeleijn, Tim Southee (c), Ish Sodhi, Lockie Ferguson England: Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan, James Vince, Eoin Morgan (c), Sam Billings (w), Sam Curran, Lewis Gregory, Tom Curran, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Pat Brown They are having a bowl. Teams in a tick. Take a look Ali Martin\u2019s preview from Christchurch, which went more in the direction of rugby than cricket. Understandbly! The clocks have changed, the weather is grim, the summer is gone. On the bright side: it means international cricket - and the OBO - coming to you at all hours through the course of the next month with England\u2019s men in New Zealand for five T20s and two Tests. The series opener is at Hagley Oval in Christchurch, one of the most beautiful grounds on the planet. Being a lovely little place in the middle of the parklands, there are no floodlights - thus the Friday afternoon timing; unusual in the shortest form of the game. Of course, the last time these teams met was the greatest finish in the history of the sport. This won\u2019t be that. It is, however, where the starters\u2019 pistol is being fired on the sides T20 World Cup campaigns, that major tournament to be held this time last year in Australia. Eoin Morgan won\u2019t have Ben Stokes or Jos Buttler at his disposal here, his two World Cup heroes having a breather, but there are young players everywhere looking to make their bow. More on those after the toss. The locals are also without their superstar, Kane Williamson, the armband instead with veteran quick Tim Southee.",

Tancredi\u2019s operatives were so pleased with the Thomas story they sent it to media outlets, including the BBC, according to emails seen by Beast. Unaoil, through the Australian lawyer Rebekah Giles from Kennedys, bombarded Fairfax with legal threats.

      "bodyText": "When the Age\u2019s Nick McKenzie and Richard Baker published a major investigation in 2016 that exposed corruption in the oil industry and a bribery scandal involving the Monaco-based Ahsani clan and its consultancy Unaoil, the Australian newspaper gathered its troops and attacked the scoop. The national chief correspondent Hedley Thomas, media columnist Mark Day and then media editor Darren Davidson all contributed to the pile-on, which amounted to no fewer than seven articles undermining The Bribe Factory. In his first story, \u201cExtortionist calls shots for Fairfax\u201d, Thomas praised the scoop but mused that the story exposed the \u201cpotential moral hazard for journalists and media outlets\u201d in using leaked emails from sources who may be extortionists themselves. Thomas\u2019s report was based on information from a London-based public relations firm, Tancredi, hired by Unaoil. Tancredi\u2019s operatives were so pleased with the Thomas story they sent it to media outlets, including the BBC, according to emails seen by Beast. Unaoil, through the Australian lawyer Rebekah Giles from Kennedys, bombarded Fairfax with legal threats. Giles claimed the Fairfax story was based on a source who may have been involved in a criminal enterprise to extort millions from the Ahsani family. In the media section, Davidson reported Fairfax was going to be sued for injurious falsehood and damages that could reach \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d. Day found another line of attack, writing that the story was boring and no one would read it. \u201cI doubt that more than 1 per cent of Fairfax\u2019s readers cared more than a tinker\u2019s cuss about the story,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt that the oil bribery story put on a single extra sale for the SMH or Age print editions.\u201d While Baker and McKenzie held the line, the attacks from the Oz planted seeds of doubt in the Fairfax executive about the safety of the story. It may have taken three years, but McKenzie and Baker were vindicated this week when the Ahsanis pleaded guilty to bribery charges involving multi-million-dollar corruption across nine countries over 17 years. Thomas told Beast his stories were not attacks on the scoop but a fresh angle on a complex story. \u201cAs far as I could discern back then, the Age had a riveting series about a family business which appeared rife with corruption,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI had an interesting and untold side story about a strange extortionist who may well have been playing both sides of the fence. I wish I\u2019d had the Age\u2019s original story \u2013 and now they\u2019ve been completely vindicated. Great result.\u201d But McKenzie and Baker see the Oz coverage a little differently. They told Beast it was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d that some Australian journalists had attacked their story. Bevan\u2019s beef The ABC\u2019s Matt Bevan was also unhappy with the Australian this week, after it published a letter which he said alleged he sympathised with terrorists. The letter, referring to Bevan\u2019s reporting on RN\u2019s Breakfast program about the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, said \u201cthe national broadcaster sides with those who seek to harm our Christian way of life\u201d. Bevan told Beast he would not be pursuing the matter further. Tragic tale A story that dominated parts of Melbourne\u2019s media for several weeks came to a tragic end on Monday, when 23-year-old court clerk Ashleigh Petrie died after being hit by a car in the early hours of the morning. Petrie found herself in the spotlight after the Herald Sun published an exclusive story about her engagement to a 68-year-old magistrate, Rodney Higgins. The Herald Sun reported on 9 October that an email had been sent out warning staff about inappropriate relationships with judicial officers, and that complaints had been made on the Sale and Bairnsdale court circuit about Petrie regularly entering Higgins\u2019s chambers and trying to use his reserved car space. The story also used extensive quotes and numerous pictures from Petrie\u2019s social media accounts illustrating the couple\u2019s romance. The Daily Mail, Channel Seven Melbourne and the Age all followed up the story over several days. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a second story on 10 October the Herald Sun reported that unnamed senior lawyers had expressed concern about the relationship. The Herald Sun editor, Damon Johnston, wrote to staff in a herogram about reporter Shannon Deery\u2019s work on 11 October, after the paper had run two front-page stories, two page-five leads, a page-three lead and multiple online reports. \u201cChief court reporter Shannon Deery reminded us all this week about the importance of owning a round,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe online reports attracted 93,000 subscriber page views and 30 [subscriptions]. To put that into perspective, a story is considered a digital success if it gets 2,500 page views or 1 sub.\u201d The paper kept up its coverage, reporting that the opposition had written to the Judicial Commission of Victoria, asking it to investigate Higgins\u2019s suitability. Columnists jumped in to criticise the age gap. \u201cI can\u2019t help thinking Petrie is trading off having an older partner with physical or social limitations in exchange for a certain lifestyle,\u201d Susie O\u2019Brien wrote. The day before Petrie\u2019s death, the Age repeated some of the more salacious details reported by its rival. Johnston told Beast the Herald Sun was saddened by Petrie\u2019s death and \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d were with her family and friends. \u201cRegarding your inquiries, early last month, several senior legal figures and sources within Victoria\u2019s magistrates\u2019 court system raised concerns with the Herald Sun about the relationship between magistrate Rodney Higgins and clerk Ms Petrie,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThe paper was told that there were concerns among lawyers and court staff [which] had been raised with chief magistrate Peter Lauritsen, citing a perceived power imbalance between the pair.\u201d All quiet at the rock When we heard the Australian Financial Review editor, Michael Stutchbury, had taken time off work to fly to the Northern Territory to climb Uluru, we can\u2019t say we were surprised. But we did call to ask the 62-year-old about it. Stutchbury told Beast he did plan to climb the rock a few weeks ago with one of his sons but when they arrived at the base it was closed. \u201cI am one of the quiet Australians,\u201d he said. Killing season It\u2019s that time of year when shows get axed and stars get dropped and this week was no exception. Macquarie Media announced its sports radio stations in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane would be \u201cpaused and reviewed\u201d \u2013 a bizarre term which reminded us of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin\u2019s 2014 announcement that they would \u201cconsciously uncouple\u201d. SBS and NITV announced the Marngrook Footy Show had been axed, prompting Marngrook founder and producer Grant Hansen to say it was a \u201creally crazy decision\u201d. But it was the departure of Fox Sports reporter Neroli Meadows that shocked fans and the media industry alike. Meadows was a popular presenter on Fox Footy, where she hosted On The Mark and AFL Tonight. After 10 years with Fox Sports, Meadows was blindsided to be told her contract would not be renewed. Foxtel\u2019s chief executive, Patrick Delaney, told MediaWeek that Foxtel had a good record on promoting and hiring women, but would not be drawn on the details. Meadows was a rare beast on Fox Sports because not only was she a woman but she was a journalist who conducted masterful interviews with sports stars. \u201cWe have plenty of women on the network and from time to time people go,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have jobs for life.\u201d But it\u2019s not all bad news for some media personalities. As we tipped in September, the Australian\u2019s NSW political editor, Andrew Clennell, is joining Sky News as political editor, following the departure of David Speers for the ABC. Kieran Gilbert has been promoted to chief news anchor. Goodbye to Sky Another victim of the killing season is Sky News\u2019s executive producer of talk, Greg Byrnes, the man who was responsible for putting the far-right extremist Blair Cottrell on air last year. Byrnes was pulled into a meeting with human resources manager Lynette Jones and Sky News boss Mark Calvert.

      "bodyText": "Less than a third of sexual violence reports in New Zealand lead to a court case, and only 11% to a conviction, the most comprehensive analysis ever undertaken in the country has found. The Ministry of Justice report, which looked at tens of thousands of cases over four years, \u201cdoes not make for happy reading\u201d and highlighted just how many people face barriers to justice, said Jan Logie, under-secretary to the minister of justice. The report, called Attrition and Progression: Reported Sexual Violence Victimisations in the Criminal Justice System, looked at 23,739 claims of sexual violence reported to police between July 2014 and June 2018. For every 100 cases, 31 reached court and only six resulted in a jail term. Of all cases, nearly two-thirds involved a child. The analysis also noted that only about 10% of sexual violence is reported to police. For those cases that result in court action, 13% took two years or more to reach that point. \u201cEveryone deserves to live free from violence and to get the support and resolution they need when they\u2019ve been harmed,\u201d said Logie. \u201cNo single agency or department can fix this on their own. We have to work together, work differently and work across the whole justice system so every person harmed can get the resolution they need.\u201d Logie said statistics available in the past year, after the ministry\u2019s latest report, suggested the number of sexual assault investigations \u201cresulting in court action\u201d had since risen by a third, and that the proportion of allegations classed as a crime had risen. The ministry said legislation would be introduced this year to improve the statistics, including tightening rules on disclosure of a victim\u2019s sexual history, allowing them to give evidence via videolink, and helping judges to intervene in unfair questioning and dispel myths about sexual violence. Sexual violence prevention network Toah Nnest welcomed the comprehensive report but said: \u201cThe whole system requires change as the problems are not isolated to one area of the justice process.\u201d It praised the analysis as a much-needed baseline and said improvements had been made since the Bazley police inquiry that began in 2005. Spokesman Russell Smith said: \u201cWe are pleased to see this level of attention being paid to this longstanding problem. The hope is this will lead to engaging in a more empathic way where wh\u0101nau M\u0101ori [family] are effectively heard and appropriately responded to.\u201d A recent survey by the network found the justice system can further traumatise survivors, make them feel \u201cincidental to the trial process\u201d and did not prioritise the safety and needs of children.

However, speaking in London on Thursday night, the chief executive of Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminium division, Alf Barrios, issued a blunt warning that current prices from coal-fired power were too high. He said this was despite \u201cfantastic work\u201d done by the team at the Australian smelter division, Pacific, to improve the performance of the plants. \u201cHowever power accounts for about a third of the global cost of the smelters and the smelters at Pacific do lack internationally competitive energy prices, which undermines the viability of these assets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working very closely with the power suppliers and the governments to find a solution to this challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on the outcome but clearly the current situation is not sustainable.\u201d The warning comes after Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastian Jacques warned in August that Australian smelters were \u201con thin ice\u201d and follows the company flagging last week that it might close its New Zealand smelter. Barrios was speaking to reporters ahead of a quarterly update to investors that listed \u201clow-carbon technology\u201d as a priority for its aluminium business. The company\u2019s head of economics, Vivek Tulpule, said the profitability of aluminium was \u201cchallenged by the quick and cheap expansion of supply to meet growth in demand\u201d. \u201cThis underlines the value of our position in Canada with operating costs in the bottom decile of the cost curve supported by hydro power which will become increasingly important in a carbon-constrained world,\u201d he said.

This brave little bird has found refuge in the sandstone from epochal climatic shifts, ice ages, changed fire regimes and introduced predators, while all its ancestors that must have existed in other parts of our continent have vanished. As I watch it scamper around under my house on the Hawkesbury River I\u2019m in awe. Its slaty grey and ochre matches the sandstone so perfectly, and it seems so friendly. I wonder whether the Eora people, who shared the sandstone shelters with it, had a special and protective relationship with this talkative and cheerful bird.

And Morrison suggests that the possibility of a quid pro quo involving military aid with Ukraine was diminished by his perception that Ukraine did not know military aid had been suspended until late August.</p> \n  <p>Morrison\u2019s perception in this regard does not seem accurate. The New York Times has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/ukraine-aid-freeze-impeachment.html\">reported</a> that the Ukrainians were aware of the suspension of aid in early August. In any case, Sondland was explicitly dangling aid to try to extract investigations in early September, in a bilateral meeting in Warsaw, according to Morrison\u2019s own testimony.</p> \n  <p>Then Morrison floats quite a contention to exculpate the president \u2013 that maybe this was all Sondland\u2019s idea? The official said: \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the Administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sondland has said through a lawyer that he never mentioned \u201cBiden\u201d in conversations with Ukrainian officials, but instead spoke of Burisma, the gas company that formerly employed <strong>Hunter Biden</strong>. He has not responded to the notion that the quid pro quo strategy was \u201cexclusively his own.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Morrison also testified that public summaries of a 25 July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, which Morrison listened in on, were accurate.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Friday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s a recap of today: Congress voted to set rules for the public phase of the impeachment inquiry and formalize procedures. NSC official Tim Morrison testified before congress, affirming that Trump sought a quid pro quo, while insisting that there was nothing illegal about it. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers said they were vindicated by his testimony. A majority of Americans \u2014 61% \u2014 say Trump violates democratic institutions and forms. Representative Katie Hill condemned the \u201cdouble standard\u201d that had forced her to resign while men who have been accused of sexual misconduct (including Trump) remain in power. Trump changed his primary residence to Florida Donald Trump has registered as a resident of Florida, the New York Times reports. In late September, Mr. Trump changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Fla., according to documents filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court. Melania Trump, the first lady, also changed her residence to Palm Beach in an identical document. Each of the Trumps filed a \u201cdeclaration of domicile\u201d saying that the Mar-a-Lago Club, Mr. Trump\u2019s resort in Palm Beach, will be their permanent residence. \u201cIf I maintain another place or places of abode in some other state or states, I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the State of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such,\u201d reads the document that Mr. Trump filed. It\u2019s unclear why the Trumps made this change. It could be for tax purposes, or because the president\u2019s relationship with his hometown of New York has been deeply strained. 2020 Candidates divided on key issue: Candy corn The 2020 Democratic presidential challengers agree on quite a lot. Broadly, they all want to improve Americans\u2019 access to healthcare, develop policies to combat climate change and strengthen gun control laws. But are they pro- or anti-candy corn, the most controversial of Halloween treats? According to a New York Times poll, the candidates \u2013 much like the Guardian\u2019s West Coast bureau \u2013 are deeply divided. Amongst the candy corn haters are Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet. (Also, me). I\u2019m also counting Beto O\u2019Rourke, who said the worse Halloween candy is \u201canything without chocolate\u201d. Everyone knows that candy corn is made of sugar and existential dread. Amongst the candy corn lovers \u2014 John Delaney. Republican candidates Joe Walsh and Tom Steyer are also reportedly candy corn lovers. Front runners Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden stayed out of the fray, with Biden\u2019s campaign refusing to even name a worst candy. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t respond to the Times. Democrats conducting the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump are emphasizing that NSC official Tim Morrison\u2019s testimony today confirmed that Trump sought a quid pro quo from the Ukranian president. Republican defenders of Trump are focusing instead on Morrison\u2019s view that there was nothing illegal about the quid pro quo. As The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy reported: Morrison, a former senior congressional aide, seemed to seek to exculpate Trump by suggesting the quid pro quo was all Sondland\u2019s idea. \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security,\u201d Morrison said. A lawyer for Sondland did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Sondland have said that he never mentioned the Bidens to the Ukrainians and suggested he was unaware of the Burisma-Biden tie. Trump is rewarding senators who\u2019re showing him support as he faces impeachment \u2014 with fundraising money. The president\u2019s reelection campaign sent an appeal urging donors to contribute to three senators who support an anti-impeachment resolution. According to a Politico report: Trump is tapping his vast fundraising network for a handful of loyal senators facing tough reelection bids in 2020. Each of them has signed onto a Republican-backed resolution condemning the inquiry as \u201cunprecedented and undemocratic.\u201d Conspicuously absent from the group is Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a politically vulnerable Republican who\u2019s refused to support the resolution and avoided taking a stance on impeachment. With his new push, Trump is exerting leverage over a group he badly needs in his corner with an impeachment trial likely coming soon to the Senate \u2014 but that also needs him. Republican senators on the ballot next year are lagging in fundraising, stoking uncertainty about the GOP\u2019s hold on the chamber, and could use the fundraising might of the president. Trump\u2019s political operation has raked in over $300 million this year. On Wednesday, the Trump reelection campaign sent a fundraising appeal to its massive email list urging donors to provide a contribution that would be divided between the president and Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Each of the senators are supporting the anti-impeachment resolution despite being endangered in 2020. Trump nominated Stephen Beigun, the US special envoy to North Korea, to the second-in-command position at the State Department. Beigun would take over from John Sullivan at the State Department, who has been nominated to serve as the next ambassador to Russia. The nomination comes amidst speculation over the future of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and turmoil at the State Department, which is entangled in the impeachment case against Trump. The Trump administration is considering adding more countries to the travel ban list, according to CNN, which cites unnamed officials. An inter-agency discussion about imposing travel restrictions on countries that are not compliant with electronic documents and information sharing -- a key focus of the administration -- is underway, according to a senior administration official. Fewer than five countries are under consideration, the official said. The goal, the official said, is to \u201cbring governments into compliance by using the power of access to the United States.\u201d The travel restrictions would be tailored to the countries, if they\u2019re added, and not impose a ban on them altogether, the official noted. The Guardian has not independently verified this reporting. An AP-NORC poll found that 61% of Americans think Donald Trump doesn\u2019t respect democratic institutions and norms. This includes 26% of Republicans. But the majority of Republicans \u2014 85% \u2014 approve of Trump\u2019s performance as president. Only 7% of Democrats agree. His approval overall stands at about 42%, according to the poll of 1,075 adults conducted Oct. 24-28. A district court judge will hear oral arguments on December 10 on whether or not Charles Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser who defied a congressional subpoena and did not turn up at this scheduled deposition this week, will be forced to testify. Kupperman, who served as deputy national security adviser until last month, was listening in the infamous July phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president. The White House blocked him from testifying in the impeachment inquiry, claiming executive privilege. Another judge is ruling on whether former White House counsel Don McGahn must appear before Congress. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House passed its impeachment resolution, clearing the way for public hearings and the release of transcripts from closed-door depositions. However, senior House Democrats did not provide a concrete timeline on when they would take those steps. House Republicans pointed to the nearly party-line vote on the resolution \u2014 all but two Democrats supported it, while every Republican opposed it \u2014 as evidence that the investigation is allegedly too partisan. Tim Morrison, Trump\u2019s top official on Russia, testified in the impeachment inquiry. The national security council official, who intends to soon leave the administration, affirmed Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo while claiming that he saw nothing illegal about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. A federal judge appeared skeptical of the White House\u2019s argument that executive privilege exempted former administration officials from having to comply with congressional subpoenas in a case that could have major implications for the impeachment inquiry. Representative Katie Hill delivered her final floor speech, in which she apologized to her supporters and condemned the \u201cdouble standard\u201d that had forced her to resign while men who have been accused of sexual misconduct (including Trump) remain in positions of power. (Hill announced her resignation Sunday following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she had a relationship with one of her staffers.) Maanvi will have plenty more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. House Republicans appeared pleased with what Tim Morrison told impeachment investigators in his closed-door deposition, saying they look forward to the transcript of the interview being made public. According to Morrison\u2019s opening statement, the national security council official affirmed Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo but said he did not think there was anything illegal about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. The president\u2019s allies celebrated Morrison\u2019s testimony as a victory for Trump, an assessment that the Democratic chairman of the House foreign affairs committee called \u201cabsurd.\u201d Tim Morrison has concluded his testimony in the impeachment inquiry after spending about eight hours talking to House investigators. According to his opening statement, the national security council official affirmed Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo while insisting he did not see anything illegal about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president. Morrison, who is soon leaving his NSC post, claimed he flagged the call for White House lawyers simply because he was worried about a \u201cpolarized\u201d political reaction to Trump\u2019s comments. A federal judge in Washington appeared skeptical today of arguments from the White House that executive privilege exempts former Trump administration officials from having to comply with congressional subpoenas. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a world where your status as a former executive branch official somehow shields you or prevents you from giving information,\u201d judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said. The specific case Jackson is ruling on concerns whether Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, Don McGahn, must appear before House members for an interview. But the case could have sweeping implications on the impeachment inquiry, given that the White House has used similar arguments to block administration officials from speaking to House investigators. Earlier today we flagged reporting indicating that Tim Morrison, the national security council official testifying currently before the impeachment committees, would back up ambassador Bill Taylor\u2019s account of ambassador Gordon Sondland trying to strike a deal with Ukraine exchanging military aid for an announcement of investigations into Joe Biden and 2016 election tampering. Morrison did explicitly corroborate Taylor\u2019s account, according to Morrison\u2019s opening statement, posted online by CBS News: \u201cI can confirm that the substance of his statement, as it relates to conversations he and I had, is accurate,\u201d Morrison testified. But Morrison does not emerge as a particularly threatening witness for Trump; instead, his testimony threads multiple needles that seem designed to defend Trump in the Ukrainian affair. Morrison suggests that military aid to Ukraine was withheld owing in part to Trump\u2019s concern about corruption in Ukraine and about Europe not contributing enough. And Morrison suggests that the possibility of a quid pro quo involving military aid with Ukraine was diminished by his perception that Ukraine did not know military aid had been suspended until late August. Morrison\u2019s perception in this regard does not seem accurate. The New York Times has reported that the Ukrainians were aware of the suspension of aid in early August. In any case, Sondland was explicitly dangling aid to try to extract investigations in early September, in a bilateral meeting in Warsaw, according to Morrison\u2019s own testimony. Then Morrison floats quite a contention to exculpate the president \u2013 that maybe this was all Sondland\u2019s idea? The official said: \u201cI hoped that Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the Administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security.\u201d Sondland has said through a lawyer that he never mentioned \u201cBiden\u201d in conversations with Ukrainian officials, but instead spoke of Burisma, the gas company that formerly employed Hunter Biden. He has not responded to the notion that the quid pro quo strategy was \u201cexclusively his own.\u201d Morrison also testified that public summaries of a 25 July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, which Morrison listened in on, were accurate. He says he went to NSC lawyers after the call, but he says he was not concerned that what Trump said was illegal: instead, Morrison says, he was worried about a \u201cpolarized\u201d political reaction, possible confusion in Congress and \u201chow it would affect the Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship\u201d. (Morrison was worried that reporting about a call that Ukrainians were on would affect their perceptions of the US-Ukraine relationship? Weren\u2019t those perceptions rather shaped by... being on the call?) Anyway, Morrison concludes, \u201cI want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.\u201d A publicity stunt by the National Republican Congressional Committee went terribly wrong when Capitol Police mistook boxes from the group as suspicious packages. House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm sent \u201cmoving boxes\u201d to vulnerable Democrats who voted for the impeachment resolution, creating some very understandable confusion and brief alarm on Capitol Hill. Luckily, the situation appears to have been quickly cleared up. While speaking to conservative British commentator Nigel Farage earlier today, Trump offered some disparaging comments about three of the frontrunners in the Democratic presidential primary. Trump dismissed the notion that he would pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden \u2014 even though the evidence is mounting that he did \u2014 because he claimed he does not view the former vice president as a threat. Trump said: \u201cAlso, would I use Ukraine to beat sleepy Joe Biden? Sleepy Joe, I call him one percent Joe too. One percent, the guy never came out of these things with one percent and he\u2019s heading down rapidly now. I mean, I don\u2019t view him as a very difficult, difficult guy to beat.\u201d Asked for his prediction on who would win the Democratic nomination, Trump said: \u201cIt would look like Elizabeth Warren is picking up steam. She\u2019s picking up a little steam. I thought she was gonzo. ... So, it could be her, it could be Bernie Sanders, I guess. Maybe, I dunno. Bernie looks like he\u2019s shot, but it could be one of them.\u201d Federal prosecutors in New York are reportedly hesitant about the possibility of charging Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, for violating foreign lobbying laws. CNN reports: New York federal prosecutors examining Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukranian business dealings are mindful of both the approaching 2020 presidential election and of the difficulty of prosecuting foreign lobbying violations as they move forward in their investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. These people say charges against President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer aren\u2019t certain or imminent, but that Giuliani has come into prosecutors\u2019 crosshairs as a central focus during the months-long inquiry. In recent days, Giuliani has been in advanced discussions to hire Daniel L. Stein, a white-collar criminal defense attorney who is a veteran of the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s office, to represent him in the investigation, sources say. Giuliani is also on the cover of this week\u2019s Time magazine. Speaking to reporters about his relationship with Trump, the former New York mayor expressed confidence that the president would stand by him. Giuliani said: \u201cHe\u2019s 100% in my corner and loyal to me as I am to him.\u201d Joe Biden has issued a statement on the House\u2019s passage of the impeachment resolution, expressing support for lawmakers performing their \u201cconstitutional duty.\u201d The statement accuses Trump of having \u201cweaponized the institutions of our government for political purposes, subverting our national security for his own political gain.\u201d Biden\u2019s statement continues: \u201cDonald Trump is testing the institutions of our democracy every day. But they are holding. Today, the House did its constitutional duty to proceed with a solemn investigation of unprecedented wrongdoing. \u201cMembers of Congress take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution when they are sworn in, not an oath to their party or to the president. Congress must do its duty to ensure that Donald Trump\u2019s assault on the Constitution does not seep beyond his presidency, with a lasting and devastating impact on our democracy.\u201d Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security council official who told impeachment investigators about his concerns after hearing Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, is reportedly willing to testify publicly. ABC News reports: Vindman, the first current White House official to cooperate with House impeachment investigators and appear on Capitol Hill for a closed-door deposition, is willing to testify publicly in the next phase of the inquiry, according to a source familiar with his thinking. ... Vindman, the first witness to appear on Capitol Hill with firsthand knowledge of the call, has not yet been formally contacted by House impeachment investigators about testifying in public, the source said. Bill Taylor has reportedly also expressed openness to testifying publicly. With today\u2019s passage of the impeachment resolution clearing the way toward public hearings, Americans may soon get to hear directly from Trump administration officials about the alleged quid pro quo the president has repeatedly denied. Speaking to conservative British commentator Nigel Farage, Trump slammed the vote approving the impeachment resolution as a \u201cdesperate\u201d move by House Democrats. In her final floor speech as a congresswoman, Katie Hill accused Trump of abusing his power \u2014 including his power over women. The freshman representative, who is resigning following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she had a relationship with one of her staffers, vowed that women would not be scared into silence. Hill said: \u201cWe will not stand down. We will not be broken. We will not be silenced. We will rise, and we will make tomorrow better than today.\u201d In her final floor speech as a congresswoman, Katie Hill said that the publication of nude photos of her had made her go to \u201cthe darkest places that a mind can go.\u201d The California Democrat lambasted the \u201cdirtiest gutter politics that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d which had forced her to step down. Hill has acknowledged she had a relationship with a campaign staffer, but she condemned the \u201cdouble standard\u201d that had pressured her to leave Congress even as \u201cwe have men who have been credibly accused of intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the Supreme Court, in this very body, and worst of all, in the Oval Office.\u201d The freshman representative detailed the dozens of sexual assault allegations against Trump and expressed pride that her final vote as a congresswoman was in support of the impeachment inquiry. Hill concluded: \u201cThank you, and I will yield the balance of my time \u2014 for now but not forever.\u201d Representative Katie Hill is now delivering her final floor speech as a congresswoman. The California Democrat announced her resignation on Sunday following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she engaged in a relationship with one of her staffers. The freshman congresswoman said she was still grappling with her decision to leave sooner than expected. \u201cI thought I could make a difference here,\u201d Hill said. The California Democrat repeatedly apologized to her supporters, her volunteers and her colleagues. \u201cI am so, so sorry,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd to every little girl who looked up to me, I hope that one day you can forgive me.\u201d Trump has just wrapped up an interview with Nigel Farage, a conservative radio host and vocal supporter of Brexit. In it, the US president warned that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cso bad\u201d for the UK and said the country has \u201ctremendous potential.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments come just two days after MPs voted to hold a general election on Dec. 12, allowing the British public to once again weigh in on the UK\u2019s separation from the EU. The blog is going to briefly interrupt impeachment coverage to share the story of how Rudy Giuliani locked himself out of his iPhone shortly after being named Trump\u2019s cybersecurity adviser. NBC News reports: Less than a month after he was named President Donald Trump\u2019s cybersecurity adviser in 2017, Rudy Giuliani walked into an Apple store in downtown San Francisco. He wasn\u2019t looking for a new gadget. Giuliani was looking for help. He was locked out of his iPhone because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times, according to two people familiar with the matter and a photo of an internal Apple store memo obtained by NBC News. \u2018Very sloppy,\u2019 said one of the people, a former Apple store employee who was there on the day that Giuliani stopped by in February 2017. \u2018Trump had just named him as an informal adviser on cybersecurity and here, he couldn\u2019t even master the fundamentals of securing your own device.\u2019 This report follows another from NBC News last week that Giuliani repeatedly butt-dialed a reporter in recent weeks and was overheard trashing Joe Biden and discussing his need for cash. In their press conference after the passage of the impeachment resolution, senior House Democrats provided little clarity on when they might release transcripts from their closed-door depositions or move to public hearings in the investigation. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House passed its impeachment resolution outlining next steps in the inquiry as Democratic leaders advance toward public hearings. The nearly party-line vote on the resolution \u2014 all but two House Democrats voted for it, while every House Republican opposed it \u2014 sparked complaints from the White House and Trump\u2019s allies that the investigation was allegedly too partisan. Tim Morrison, the national security council official who is stepping down from his post, is testifying to impeachment investigators and reportedly verified much of Bill Taylor\u2019s account of a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. Representative Lee Zeldin, one of Trump\u2019s congressional allies, is calling on the House intelligence committee to release the transcripts from closed-door depositions in the impeachment inquiry so that lawmakers can debate the \u201csubstance\u201d of the allegations against the president. However, Republicans have so far been fairly hesitant to discuss the substance of the accusations as more witnesses come forward with damning testimony pointing to a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. House Republicans and Democrats are holding separate press conferences now in the wake of the impeachment resolution\u2019s passage. Republican leadership unsurprisingly pointed to the nearly party-line vote as evidence that the investigtion is allegedly highly partisan and unfair to Trump. However, it\u2019s worth noting that seemingly none of the Republican messaging against impeachment actually touches on the serious allegations facing the president. As the inquiry moves to public hearings, Republicans may be increasingly asked to weigh in on the accusations, and they\u2019ll need to come up with an answer. The nearly party-line vote on the impeachment resolution marks a departure from how Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment was handled in the House, per an NBC News correspondent. House Republicans will likely cite the final vote count as evidence that the inquiry is highly partisan and unfair to Trump. However, the vote still marks a momentous development in Trump\u2019s presidency and US history, as a PBS NewsHour reporter pointed out. One of the two House Democrats who voted against the impeachment resolution, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, said in a statement that he feared the nearly party-line decision would \u201cfurther divide the country.\u201d However, the freshman congressman left open the possibility of eventually backing Trump\u2019s impeachment depending on where the evidence led investigators. Democratic presidential candidates voiced support for House Democrats after they passed a resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, weighed in on the impeachment vote by quoting Thomas Jefferson\u2019s dour reflections on Washington. Nancy Pelosi made the rather unusual decision to cast a vote on the impeachment resolution, marking a departure from House speakers\u2019 general tendency to refrain from weighing in. Four House members\u2060 \u2014 three Republicans and one Democrat \u2060\u2014 were unable to vote on the impeachment resolution due to absences. Trump\u2019s press secretary has now issued a statement slamming Democrats\u2019 \u201cunhinged obsession with this illegitimate impeachment proceeding\u201d in the wake of the resolution\u2019s passage. Stephanie Grisham said in the statement: \u201cThe President has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats\u2019 unhinged obsession with this illegitimate impeachment proceeding does not hurt President Trump; it hurts the American people. ... \u201cWith today\u2019s vote, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have done nothing more than enshrine unacceptable violations of due process into House rules. ... The Democrats want to render a verdict without giving the Administration a chance to mount a defense. That is unfair, unconstitutional, and fundamentally un-American.\u201d Speaking at her press briefing this morning, Pelosi said that the rules outlined in the resolution were \u201cfairer than anything that have gone before in terms of an impeachment proceeding.\u201d A bit of chaos has broken out on the House floor following the passage of the impeachment resolution, with Republicans shouting \u201cobjection\u201d and Democrats calling for order. The vote has concluded on the impeachment resolution, and it has officially passed the House with a vote of 232-196. Two Democrats, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, voted against the resolution, while every House Republican opposed the measure. One independent lawmaker, former Republican Justin Amash, joined the vast majority of Democrats in supporting the resolution. The impeachment resolution has reached a majority level of support, receiving at least least 228 \u201cyea\u201d votes, and it will clear the way for public hearings. Collin Peterson, a Democratic congressman from an overwhelmingly Trump district in Minnesota, voted with Republicans on the procedural vote for the impeachment resolution. There were widespread suspicions that Peterson would not join his Democratic colleagues in backing the resolution, given the political breakdown of his district. Representative Jeff Van Drew also voted against the procedural motion, but the Democratic congressman had previously signaled his opposition. Justin Amash, the Michigan congressman who left the Republican Party over opposition to Trump, has confirmed that he intends to vote for the impeachment resolution. In a morning tweet, Amash encouraged his Republican colleagues to \u201cstep outside your media and social bubble\u201d and consider the historic ramifications of their decision to stand by Trump. House members are currently taking a procedural vote on the impeachment resolution. The vote on the resolution itself will likely begin in about 15 minutes and conclude around 11.30am ET. The House has concluded debate on the impeachment resolution and is moving on to the vote series that will determine whether members approve it. House Republicans are now denouncing the impeachment resolution on the floor, with minority leader Kevin McCarthy accusing Democrats of ignoring other legislative priorities to focus on impeachment. House minority whip Steve Scalise used a poster to repeat his claim that Democrats are pursuing \u201cSoviet-style\u201d tactics with their investigation. However, a New Yorker writer and former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post contradicted that assessment of the inquiry. During her press conference, Nancy Pelosi also touched on the subject of Katie Hill, the Democratic congresswoman who announced her resignation Sunday following the release of nude photos of her and allegations of a relationship with one of her staffers. Pelosi praised her fellow California Democrat as an \u201cabsolutely outstanding young public servant\u201d who was \u201crespected by her colleagues.\u201d The House speaker noted that Hill made her own determination about whether and when to resign. \u201cShe made her decision and her timing, and I respect that,\u201d Pelosi said. The speaker also noted that she has warned her grandchildren that \u201cappearances\u201d on social media can be taken out of context and \u201ccome back to haunt you.\u201d Hill is expected to deliver her final floor speech this afternoon, after the vote on the impeachment resolution. \u201cThis resolution sets the stage for the next phase of our investigation, one in which the American people have the opportunity to hear from the witnesses first-hand,\u201d House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff said in a floor speech ahead of the vote. \u201cWe will continue to conduct this inquiry with the seriousness of purpose that our task deserves because it is our duty and because no one is above the law.\u201d Nancy Pelosi opened her remarks on the House floor by reading the \u201cmost beautiful lines in our country\u2019s history\u201d \u2013 the introduction to the US constitution. The House speaker urged support for the resolution by citing a quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who, when asked if the Founders had created a republic or a monarchy, is believed to have responded: \u201cA republic if you can keep it.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is now talking to reporters in her weekly press conference, saying that it is a \u201csad day\u201d when lawmakers have to vote on an impeachment measure. The House speaker added that no decision had yet been made on whether members of her caucus would eventually support Trump\u2019s impeachent. However, it seems highly likely that the Democratic-controlled House will soon vote to impeach the president. Nancy Pelosi framed the impeachment resolution, and the inquiry more broadly, as a measure to defend the principles of the US constitution. The House speaker said: \u201cWhat is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy.\u201d Nancy Pelosi is now speaking on the House floor about the impeachment resolution, arguing the measure will enable lawmakers to find the truth about the allegations against Trump. Standing beside an American flag poster, the House speaker said: \u201cThis is a solemn occasion. ... I doubt anybody in this place or anybody that you know ... comes to Congress to impeach the president of the United States unless his actions are jeopardizing honoring our oath of office.\u201d House Democrats have scheduled four depositions on Monday as they look to wrap up the closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry and advance to public hearings. It remains unknown whether the officials will comply with the interview requests, given that the White House still refuses to cooperate with the investigation. However, if the depositions were to occur, John Eisenberg\u2019s testimony could prove particularly damaging for Trump. The White House lawyer was reportedly the person who proposed the unusual move of placing the transcript of the Ukraine call in a secure server. The Washington Post reported yesterday: Moments after President Trump ended his phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president on July 25, an unsettled national security aide rushed to the office of White House lawyer John Eisenberg. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine adviser at the White House, had been listening to the call and was disturbed by the pressure Trump had applied to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rivals, according to people familiar with Vindman\u2019s testimony to lawmakers this week. Vindman told Eisenberg, the White House\u2019s legal adviser on national security issues, that what the president did was wrong, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. Scribbling notes on a yellow legal pad, Eisenberg proposed a step that other officials have said is at odds with long-standing White House protocol: moving a transcript of the call to a highly classified server and restricting access to it, according to two people familiar with Vindman\u2019s account. House Democrats appear largely unified in support of the resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Only two members of the House Democratic caucus \u2013 Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2013 were expected to vote against the resolution. However, House Republicans were also expected to be unified in opposition to the resolution, so they will likely cite the vote\u2019s outcome to bolster their argument that the investigation is highly partisan. Nancy Pelosi rather unusually presided over the House herself this morning as members began to debate the impeachment resolution. The resolution, which outlines the procedures the House will follow as the inquiry advances to public hearings, will likely get a vote between 10.30am and 11.30am ET. Pelosi is also expected to speak to reporters about the resolution at the House speaker\u2019s press briefing in about 30 minutes. Tim Morrison, the national security council official currently testifying behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry, reportedly intends to confirm Bill Taylor\u2019s account that the White House held up Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to push for public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The Washington Post reports: Morrison is expected to tell impeachment investigators on Thursday that the account offered by Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., is accurate, particularly that Morrison alerted him to the president\u2019s and his deputies\u2019 push to withhold security aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president until Ukraine announced an investigation of the Bidens and 2016 election interference, the person said on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions. Morrison will also say that he did not necessarily view the president\u2019s demands as improper or illegal, but rather problematic for U.S. policy in supporting an ally in the region, the person said. House Democrats are hoping that Tim Morrison can provide the key link between Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who has denied any quid pro quo in the delaying of military assistance to Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, who outlined such a scheme in his testimony to impeachment investigators. However, despite Morrison\u2019s imminent departure from the national security council, the official may not be looking to reveal everything he knows to the House committees this morning. The Washington Post\u2019s Josh Rogin writes: Democrats might not want to pin their impeachment hopes on his testimony Thursday, because there are three things Morrison is not: a whistleblower, a Never Trumper or a potential member of the Resistance. ... [Morrison] likely won\u2019t give the Democrats the thing they want most, a full-throated endorsement of their characterization of the Ukraine scheme as a quid pro quo. Morrison will likely try to stick to the facts, be honest and not burn his bosses or the president in the process. That won\u2019t be easy. Good morning, live blog readers! Today\u2019s impeachment proceedings are underway, with Tim Morrison having already arrived for his closed-door testimony with the committees leading the inquiry. Morrison\u2019s appearance was already highly anticipated, given Bill Taylor\u2019s reported testimony last week that the national security council official told him about Gordon Sondland allegedly informing Ukrainian officials their US military aid was contingent on public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. However, Morrison\u2019s testimony is even more dramatic following last night\u2019s reports that the official is stepping down from his post at the White House. It\u2019s still unclear whether Morrison resigned voluntarily or was asked to leave, but the development puts even more weight on what he may tell impeachment investigators today. Here\u2019s what else the bog is keeping an eye on: Trump has no events on his public schedule today, so some impeachment-themed tweets seem likely. The House vote on the impeachment resolution will likely happen between 10.30am and 11.30am ET. Nancy Pelosi will brief reporters at 10.15am ET. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned.",

Thanks for sticking with me for another day of wildfire news. With any luck, winds should ease up overnight and into the weekend, allowing firefighters to get a handle on the <strong>more than a dozen fires that burned today. </strong></p> <p>Before I sign off, let\u2019s take a look back at the day and see where firefighters stand on some of the biggests wildfires:</p> <ul> <li>Firefighters have continued to chip away at the <strong>Kincade fire</strong> in Sonoma county, heretofore the state\u2019s biggest fire of the season, and it was 60% contained as of 3pm today. The fire has charred roughly 77,000 acres, but firefighters appear to have made a strong stand.</li> <li>Evacuation orders have been mostly lifted by those forced out of their homes by the <strong>Getty fire</strong> that broke out earlier this week in west Los Angeles, threatening some of the city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. Firefighters worked overnight to cool any hot spots and contain any flare-ups within the current fire perimeter, <a href=\"https://www.lafd.org/news/getty-fire\">reports the Los Angeles Fire department</a>. An \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/programs/communications/red-flag-warnings-fire-weather-watches/\"><strong>Extreme Red Flag Warning</strong>\u201d remains in effect through 6:00pm,</a> as the historic Santa Ana winds that played a hand in fuleing the day\u2019s fires continue to gust across southern California.</li> <li>The LAist published a good round-up of <strong><a href=\"https://laist.com/2019/10/30/all_fires_burning_southern_california_right_now.php\">all the fires burning in southern California</a></strong>. As of this afternoon, more than a dozen active fires burned.</li> <li><strong>The Easy fire </strong>near the bedroom community of Simi Valley north of Los Angeles continues to burn, but firefighters are reported to have been able to hold a line and keep it from consuming additional homes and the 125,000 square foot Reagan Library perched on a nearby hillside. (<strong><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/us/california-easy-fire-reagan-presidential-library-simi-valley/index.html\">Goats have also played a role in protecting the library,</a></strong> and they\u2019re finally getting their due). As of this morning, the fire had consumed about 1,500 acres and was only contained at 5%, though responders are believed to have made progress since. </li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eca9f4270a0dd01f0329c9763ca19db20b2d6213\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eca9f4270a0dd01f0329c9763ca19db20b2d6213/0_185_5585_3353/1000.jpg\" alt=\"same\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firefighters battled new wildfires on in California including a fierce blaze in the city of San Bernardino that forced some residents to flee their homes overnight.

But what does that mean? It means, roughly, that firefighters have a handle on the inferno. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the fire has been extinguished. In fact, fires can burn long after firefighters have contained them. </p> <p>Los Angeles Time <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/what-is-fire-containment\">has a good explainer on this point</a> this afternoon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the firefighting world, containment means a certain level of control \u2014 specifically, how much of the fire\u2019s edge, or perimeter, firefighters believe they can stop from expanding. A natural barrier such as a river or creek can help. So can human interventions such as using a bulldozer to scrape the vegetation off a swath of land to deprive the fire of fuel it could use to grow.</p> <p>That\u2019s why even when a fire is 100% contained, it can still be burning and firefighters stay to make sure it does not get out of control.</p> </blockquote> <p>The percentage is simply firefighters telling the public how much of the fire perimeter they believe will not go beyond their defenses, LAT reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Firefighters often set up layers of defense called contingency lines some distance from the containment line. They will scrape the earth clean down to the dirt on ridge tops up to a mile away from a fire\u2019s edge to set up a position to make a future defensive stand. Meanwhile, they work their way closer to the fire, building layer after layer of additional defense by laying lines of fire retardant and using bulldozers, shovels, axes and chain saws to clear out vegetation...</p> </blockquote> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean the battle is over:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a fire reaches 100% containment \u2014 which can take months, depending on the weather conditions, the fire\u2019s size and the area\u2019s topography \u2014 crews work toward declaring the fire \u201ccontrolled,\u201d McLean said.</p> <p>When a fire is controlled, it\u2019s essentially out. Authorities will no longer assign crews to the blaze and will instead send a patrol out daily to ensure no scorched areas rekindle and start another fire.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T23:43:28.988Z\">at 11.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dbb69c28f08cb84c60a27f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-31T23:20:30.209Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Most of southern Calfornia remains under a red-flag warning through 6pm today, an alert triggered by crackling-dry conditions and Santa Ana winds moving across the region at historic speeds. </p> <p>Meterologists warned that conditions yesterday and today could make for a dangerous wildfire recipe, and it looks like they didn\u2019t miss the mark.

Before I sign off, let\u2019s take a look back at the day and see where firefighters stand on some of the biggests wildfires: Firefighters have continued to chip away at the Kincade fire in Sonoma county, heretofore the state\u2019s biggest fire of the season, and it was 60% contained as of 3pm today. The fire has charred roughly 77,000 acres, but firefighters appear to have made a strong stand. Evacuation orders have been mostly lifted by those forced out of their homes by the Getty fire that broke out earlier this week in west Los Angeles, threatening some of the city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. Firefighters worked overnight to cool any hot spots and contain any flare-ups within the current fire perimeter, reports the Los Angeles Fire department. An \u201cExtreme Red Flag Warning\u201d remains in effect through 6:00pm, as the historic Santa Ana winds that played a hand in fuleing the day\u2019s fires continue to gust across southern California. The LAist published a good round-up of all the fires burning in southern California. As of this afternoon, more than a dozen active fires burned. The Easy fire near the bedroom community of Simi Valley north of Los Angeles continues to burn, but firefighters are reported to have been able to hold a line and keep it from consuming additional homes and the 125,000 square foot Reagan Library perched on a nearby hillside. (Goats have also played a role in protecting the library, and they\u2019re finally getting their due). As of this morning, the fire had consumed about 1,500 acres and was only contained at 5%, though responders are believed to have made progress since. What it means to \u2018contain\u2019 a fire As we tune into wildfire coverage, we often hear the word \u201ccontain,\u201d as in the percentage at which a fire is contained. But what does that mean? It means, roughly, that firefighters have a handle on the inferno. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the fire has been extinguished. In fact, fires can burn long after firefighters have contained them. Los Angeles Time has a good explainer on this point this afternoon: In the firefighting world, containment means a certain level of control \u2014 specifically, how much of the fire\u2019s edge, or perimeter, firefighters believe they can stop from expanding. A natural barrier such as a river or creek can help. So can human interventions such as using a bulldozer to scrape the vegetation off a swath of land to deprive the fire of fuel it could use to grow. That\u2019s why even when a fire is 100% contained, it can still be burning and firefighters stay to make sure it does not get out of control. The percentage is simply firefighters telling the public how much of the fire perimeter they believe will not go beyond their defenses, LAT reports: Firefighters often set up layers of defense called contingency lines some distance from the containment line. They will scrape the earth clean down to the dirt on ridge tops up to a mile away from a fire\u2019s edge to set up a position to make a future defensive stand. Meanwhile, they work their way closer to the fire, building layer after layer of additional defense by laying lines of fire retardant and using bulldozers, shovels, axes and chain saws to clear out vegetation... But that doesn\u2019t mean the battle is over: After a fire reaches 100% containment \u2014 which can take months, depending on the weather conditions, the fire\u2019s size and the area\u2019s topography \u2014 crews work toward declaring the fire \u201ccontrolled,\u201d McLean said. When a fire is controlled, it\u2019s essentially out. Authorities will no longer assign crews to the blaze and will instead send a patrol out daily to ensure no scorched areas rekindle and start another fire. Most of southern Calfornia remains under a red-flag warning through 6pm today, an alert triggered by crackling-dry conditions and Santa Ana winds moving across the region at historic speeds. Meterologists warned that conditions yesterday and today could make for a dangerous wildfire recipe, and it looks like they didn\u2019t miss the mark. As of this afternoon, more than a dozen active fires burned across the California, most of them in the southern half of the state. But, there\u2019s a chance, weather folks say while knocking on wood, that conditions could ease soon. Winds are expected to slow into the weekend, and the San Francisco Chronicle reports that next week a strong jet stream coming in from Russia could undercut the high-pressure ridge sitting off Californai\u2019s coast and bring much-needed moisture to the West Coast. It would be a very welcome kind of Russian interference. Firefighters continue to battle the Hillside fire in San Bernardino county, where mandatory evacuations affected about 3,600 residents on Thursday. The blaze that started just after 1am had grown to 200 acres by noon, and was threatening 1,200 homes. Here are some stunning images from the Hillside fire. With the historic Santa Ana winds ripping across southern Calfornia and kicking up new blazes faster than firefighters can put them down, it can be tough to keep track of them all. Luckily, our Los Angeles pals at the LAist have done the heavy lifting and cobbled together the active fires in a handy post. For reference, Cal Fire has an incident map that tends to generally have the most reliable and up-to-date infomation on the status of fires \u2013 when they started, how many acres or buildings have burned, what percentage of the fire that has been contained. That type of thing. Here are some of the fires burning across SoCal right now: Hillside fire The Hillside fire ignited about 1.30am Thursday in San Bernardino and quickly consumed 200 acres and spurred evacuations affecting more than 1,300 people. The fire initially was headed downhill toward the city of San Bernardino, LAist reports. A spokesperson for San Bernardino county fire said 500 homes are in mandatory evacuation zones. About 500 firefighters were at the scene Thursday. As of 1pm the fire was contained at about 50%. 46 fire The 46 fire began in Riverside county\u2019s Jurupa Valley early Thursday morning, and by 8.45am the blaze had burned about 300 acres and was 5% contained. Easy fire The Easy fire was reported just before 6.10am Wednesday, south of the 118 Freeway near Madera and Easy streets in the city of Simi Valley. As of 6.45am Thursday about 1,700 acres had burned. LAist writes: After the Easy Fire began, the fire spread rapidly west toward the 23 Freeway and south toward Thousand Oaks. Some outbuildings had been destroyed and one residential structure may have burned. The flames were also creeping dangerously close to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Authorities reported three firefighters had sustained injuries in the fight to bring the Easy Fire under control. By Thursday morning the fire was 10% contained and all evacuation orders in the area had been lifted. Other fires include the Getty fire in west Los Angeles, the Hill fire, also in Riverside county, Orange county\u2019s Castlewood fire, Dexter fire in Riverside, Soledad fire in Santa Clarita, the Brea fire, in Los Angeles county\u2019s Diamond Bar, the Mureau fire, north of Malibu, the Saddle Ridge fire in the LA county\u2019s San Fernando Valley, Tick fire, Palisades fire and Old Water fire, currently burning in San Bernardino. That makes MORE THAN A DOZEN active fires. That\u2019s a lot of fires. Camp fire. Easy fire. Hillside and Hill fire. The names can range from ominous to ironic to redundant. But just who names them, and how do they land on a name?? Los Angeles Times has a good explainer on the topic that should add some clarity: Fires are named almost the instant they are reported, said Scott McClean, a spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. The decision is usually made by the dispatcher who takes the call. Less frequently, fires are named by the first responder to reach the scene. After receiving a report of fire, dispatchers quickly plug its coordinates into a map and look for a nearby feature to use as a moniker. A geologic landmark like a valley, river or canyon will work. So will the name of a road. \u201cThe name helps direct us to the location,\u201d McClean said. \u201cWe respond to about 170 fires a week throughout the state. We don\u2019t have time to second-guess ourselves. We get a location and a name, and then we get to work.\u201d Firefighters have reportedly stopped a blaze that erupted Wednesday night south of the US-Mexican border before it reached San Diego and communities further north. The blaze broke out around 6pm in Tijuana before heading north into San Diego County. By noon the so-called Copper fire had burned 50 acres and was contained at 15%. That fire ignited in an undeveloped riverbed area known for its homeless encampments, according to a local fire department battalion chief, reports Los Angeles Times. Let\u2019s hear it for the goats. The 125,000 sq ft Reagan library \u2013 \u201cthe repository of presidential records for President Reagan\u2019s administration\u201d that holds over 60m pages of documents, over 1.6m photographs, a half million feet of motion picture film and tens of thousands of audio and video tapes according to its website \u2013 has been preemptively protected by goats. In May, about 500 hungry goats were enlisted to help eat away at and clear the grasses and vegetation that could catch fire on the hillside surrounding the Reagan library and museum. The goats were hired from a local company \u2013 805 Goats \u2013 to clear around 13 acres of land, reports the BBC. Scott Morris, who started the company last November, charges around $1,000 per acre of land. With ongoing threat of wildfires, Morris predicts he\u2019ll need to double his herd to meet demand. Mandatory evacuation orders were lifted on Thursday for the those forced out of their homes by the Easy fire \u2013 what had been a fast-moving blaze in Simi Valley, a bedroom community north of Los Angeles. The fire at one point threatened 6,500 homes and the 125,000 square foot Reagan presidential library, before firefighters were able to defend a line. The fire is still burning, but firefighters are believed to have contained the blaze. Cal Fire reports that the blaze consumed nearly 1,500 acres since it started burning yesterday. Mario Koran here, taking over the fire-watch from my colleague Joanna Walters in New New York. As firefighters in San Bernardino work to beat back the latest blaze, a number of people on Twitter, across the political aisle have fretted over the possibility of losing a piece of history. Here\u2019s a piece from the library\u2019s webpage about what it actually contains. Perched on a mountaintop with sweeping views of the surrounding mountains, valleys and the Pacific Ocean, the Ronald Reagan presidential library is one of California\u2019s most beautiful and unique destinations. The Library\u2019s 300 acre site, about 45 miles from Los Angeles international airport (LAX), represents the \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d often referenced by President Reagan and appropriately serves as the final resting place of the nation\u2019s 40th President. As a Presidential library administered by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Reagan Library, under the authority of the Presidential Records Act, is the repository of presidential records for President Reagan\u2019s administration. Our holdings include over 60 million pages of documents, over 1.6 million photographs, a half million feet of motion picture film and tens of thousands of audio and video tapes. Additionally, the Library houses personal papers collections including documents from Ronald Reagan\u2019s eight years as governor of California. Information on accessing all of these records, including how to file a Freedom of Information Act request, can be found under the \u201cI am a Researcher\u201d tab above. In other words, whether or not you agree with the Gipper\u2019s politics, losing a piece of history compounds the loss of property. So far, the Reagan library has stood unscathed, but flames have so far crept up to its doorstep. Reagan, as president, made no attempts to hide his disdain for government agencies. Oh, the irony. Washington Post ponts out: \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are \u2018I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s what Ronald Reagan used to say, a summation of his belief that government was not just incompetent but malevolent, a ravenous beast that would steal your money and ruin your life. Or as he put it in his first inaugural address, \u2018Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d Firefighting helicopters have been dumping water on the fires around Los Angeles, but some heaven-sent precipitation would be nice right about now. Not much chance of that in these tinderbox conditions. Here\u2019s climate scientist Daniel Swain on the prospect of easing winds but precious few raindrops. World Series, world of flames What could possibly connect the two? Billy Baldwin (actor bro of Alec). Officials say the wildfire burning in northern California\u2019s wine country, which forced the evacuation of more than 180,000 people, is now 60% contained and has not increased in size since yesterday. California department of forestry and fire protection officials said a few minutes ago that firefighting crews working through the night increased their control of the fire from the previous estimate of 45% containment late Wednesday, the AP reports. The fire started last week near the town of Geyserville in Sonoma county, north of San Francisco, and has scorched about 120 square miles, destroying 141 homes and threatening 90,000 structures. Most of those evacuated after the fire started last week have been now allowed to return home. Here\u2019s California Senator and 2020 Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. The wind-driven wildfire fire in San Bernardino, southern California, meanwhile, which broke out just hours ago, has destroyed or damaged six homes so far. San Bernardino county fire chief Don Trapp says about 500 homes have been evacuated since the fire started in foothills before dawn. The strong, dry seasonal easterly winds drove it down into the city. In the nearby city of Jurupa Valley, an early morning blaze has grown to 150 acres. Fires are burning or smoldering to the west, northwest and east of the Los Angeles metropolis with the risk of new blazes sparking remaining extremely high this hour. It\u2019s the climate crisis Feels pertinent to re-up this tweet from 2020 Democratic candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro. Two fires east of Los Angeles, others still burning or smoldering The Hillside fire in San Bernardino has so far forced the evacuation of 490 homes and approximately 1,300 people, with the fire at 200 acres and growing. In neighboring Riverside county, evacuation orders were issued for homes around a 75-acre fire in the city of Jurupa Valley, the AP reports. Three residences and two outbuildings were confirmed destroyed by the county\u2019s fire department. That fire came after another fire Wednesday in Jurupa Valley forced the evacuation of two mobile home parks and a psychiatric nursing care facility, before the spread was stopped. \u201cThere was one moment when I could see nothing but dark smoke and I was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to die,\u2019\u201d said Qiana McCracken, the assistant director of nursing for the Riverside Heights Healthcare Center. After the Easy fire broke out early Wednesday near Simi Valley, northwest of LA, 30,000 people had to evacuate, although some were allowed home last night. Crews remained at the scene, near the undamaged Reagan presidential library, which is now like an island in a soot-black sea, spokeswoman Melissa Giller said. Nearby residents had little time to heed evacuation orders yesterday. Resident Elena Mishkanian was able to gather only some basics. Her son, Troy, 13, netted six pet fish from a tank and put them in pots. Frightened horses screamed in a nearby barn as Beth Rivera used a garden hose to water down the edges of her home, and friends helped evacuate 11 horses. The utility Southern California Edison filed a report with state regulators to say the Easy fire began near its power lines. Electrical equipment has sparked some of California\u2019s worst wildfires. SoCal Edison has so far not cut power in the area. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, cut power to millions in northern California in the last week, but damaged power lines may still have started the Kincade fire in Sonoma county. The latest report this morning is that the Kincade fire is now 45% contained. While the new Hillside fire is burning in a northern part of San Bernardino, there is also a fire now burning less than 20 miles away in Jurupa Valley, in Riverside county. There was a fire in Jurupa Valley yesterday but now another one has broken out, the Associated Press indicates. This is all happening 50 to 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, in southern California. You can check out all the Guardian\u2019s coverage, with news reports, live blogs and comment pieces from the last few days and beyond, by clicking on our California page and taking your pick of stories from our ace reporters on the spot out west as well as top opinion-formers and experts such as Rebecca Solnit and Bill McKibben, discussing issues such as the habitability of the state and the unavoidable role of the climate crisis in the worsening wildfire events. We have both a local and a zoomed out approach, depending on the piece, for our readers in the area, elsewhere in the US and across the globe. The Santa Ana winds have been peaking in this 48-hour period and hopefully will tail off tonight. \u201cThis is the last event in our near future. We are not expecting any Santa Anas next week,\u201d weather service meteorologist Kristen Stewart told the Associated Press. But she noted the forecast only extends out seven days. \u201cOnce we get past that, all bets are off.\u201d San Bernardino fire spreading fast The National Weather Service warns that southern California is still at an extreme risk of fires starting and spreading all day today and into the evening. The fire that broke out in a northern section of San Bernardino overnight is said to be spreading rapidly. Here is some citizen footage from the early hours. Hero horse This should melt the hardest heart. There appears to be some indecision on social media about whether this is a male or female horse galloping and neighing anxiously as it goes back towards danger to, apparently, guide its family to safety from the Easy fire near Simi Valley, California, yesterday. No matter, it\u2019s an incredible clip. This is a big ranching area, so many horses have been affected by the fire. The latest news from the Hillside fire in San Bernardino, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, is that it is burning fiercely, sparked by fast and powerful Santa Ana winds whipping up early this morning. The local media outlet, the San Bernardino Sun, reports: Mandatory evacuations are in place near Highway 18, according to the Sun, which also has a local map if you click through to the full article. And here\u2019s a very recent report from the local California Highway Patrol. Good Morning, wildfire watchers. It\u2019s a hellish Halloween for more than 20 million Californians affected by blazes that, at varying levels, continue to burn out of control. We\u2019ll be watching events throughout the day as the tinderbox situation unfolds, with the strongest Santa Ana winds in a decade likely still around peak strength until the evening in southern California. Here\u2019s where things stand. There have been no direct fire fatalities so far: Another new brushfire sparked overnight. This one in San Bernardino, a city of just over 200,000 people located around 60 miles east of Los Angeles. It\u2019s been dubbed the Hillside fire. It broke out near Waterman Canyon at the northern end of town in the early hours. The San Bernardino Police Department has announced the opening of a temporary shelter at the Pacific High School, asking on Twitter for people evacuating from the path of the fire to report to the gymnasium. The Easy fire that began burning early Wednesday near Simi Valley, north-west of LA, came within about 50 feet of the Ronald Reagan presidential library, but the building has so far emerged unscathed. LA area is being gradually ringed by fires, what with the new Hillside fire, the Easy fire, the Getty fire that began on Monday to the west of the metropolis, near the Getty art museum, and last week the Santa Clarita Valley to the north was burning with the Tick fire. In northern California wine country, firefighters have made headway against the largest fire that has been burning in the state - the Kincade fire in Sonoma county. It was reported 30% contained late Wednesday and is now burning into its seventh day. It was only 5% contained a couple days ago. The fire has destroyed 189 houses and 76,000 acres.",

It delved into the vexed politics and the people involved in our entry into the common market to illuminate the even more vexed and vexing current debate around our exit from the EU. In Huddersfield, young Hodgson and his mother (Liza Tarbuck) enjoy a close relationship, with her greeting his new songs (to help him remember every county town), school prizes and eventual coming-out announcement with equal delight. Then the revelation that she voted leave to his remain (\u201cFunny how we can be so close and yet have such a different stance on a key political issue!\u201d says Mrs Hodgson cheerily. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t expect it will affect our relationship, will it!\u201d) casts a shadow. \u201cYou piece of shit, Mum!\u201d he screams. \u201cYou racist, chardonnay-sozzled old witch!\u201d It gave me a laugh, but then I live with a leaver so I need one. It was a neat comment on the polarising effect the greatest socio-political event since the war has had on us all in the abstract. Realising that simplistic labels do none of us any good (\u201cLook at me \u2013 I have a husband, but I hate gay people!\u201d), Hodgson headed to the library to research the whole sorry mess. He was aided by a lascivious librarian, played by Harry Enfield, and we headed at pace through miniskirts and Macmillan (\u201cI like having a good time. I once shot a heron. I wish it was still the war\u201d), the Beatles (\u201cWe\u2019ve just come back from playing three years in Hamburg for some reason! The Germans are doing really well in the common market \u2013 we should join! Even a Norwegian would!\u201d) and the rejection by the French of our first attempt to become part of the gang. A tour of Hodgson\u2019s Barbara Castle, Tony Benn and Edward Heath impressions, and a celebration of fellow Huddersfield native Harold Wilson\u2019s willingness to compromise (\u201cAre you going to be silly sandwiches, or \u2026?\u201d) and we were in. Hodgson\u2019s erudition meant he was half a step ahead of us all the time, pulling parallels out of history like rabbits out of a hat, but he never left us floundering. Every now and then he gave us a scene of divided political parties punching each others\u2019 lights out, or David Dimbleby leaning madly far back in his chair, and a chance to catch our breath. Amid the laughs, however, How Europe Stole My Mum provided such a rare non-partisan and long-range perspective that it induced quite an odd emotional response. As best as I can tell \u2013 and it took me a long time to unpack it \u2013 this was a compound of gratitude for the detachment and intelligence that had gone into it, despair at the lateness of the day and the paucity of such material, and comfort in the knowledge that we have lived through these times before and survived. Or that might come under despair. But to have watched a programme that clarified facts and complicated my feelings about Brexit is one that I can absolutely stan, as I believe the young people who may or may not have been robbed of a future by it say. More of this sort of thing (and of Tarbuck), please.",

At six o\u2019clock this Saturday evening local time, 9am in the UK, the whistle will blow at the International Stadium Yokohama, where England play South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final. Two hours or so later it will go again, and for one team, everything will change, nothing will be the same.</p> <p>In between there will be moments the people watching will remember for ever, moments the people playing will see flash in front of their eyes for the rest of their lives. That half gap that opened on the tryline, that ball that bounced just within reach, that tackle that was just beyond the fingertips, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/5liveSport/status/963021278314745857\" title=\"\">that drop</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/5liveSport/status/963021278314745857\" title=\"\">\u2011kick, flying high towards the goal</a>. Each one an opportunity.</p> <p>An opportunity for glory and fulfilment, yes, an opportunity for fame and money too. The last and only other England team to do this still live with, and off, it now. Their victory, in 2003, earned them knighthoods, CBEs and OBEs, set them up in second careers as coaches, pundits and TV presenters, and led, if they wished, to a lifetime\u2019s worth of sponsorship deals and speaking engagements. And beyond that there is an opportunity, too, to win something bigger, the chance to make history, to change the game, the way people see it, the way people play it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/30/england-vision-coach-dr-sherylle-calder-eddie-jones-rugby-mastermind-world-cup-interview\">England\u2019s vision coach Dr Sherylle Calder: \u2018Jones is a rugby mastermind\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It will not come easy. Nothing in rugby does. The average tackle generates 22Gs of force, but they will often run up well beyond that, to 30, 35, 40Gs, which, they say, is something like being involved in a head-on car crash at 40mph. That is only an inexact comparison and if you want to be specific there are some key differences. Like this: when you crash, no one expects you to get up and do it again in the very next minute, and the one after that, 10, 15, 20 times a game, and still have the wits to take that pass, spot that gap, make that break.</p> <p>This is why the final will not necessarily be won by the strongest, or fittest, or fastest team. Rugby is strange that way, it runs on primal emotions.</p> <p>There is science to it and both teams have a battery of analysts.

There\u2019s so little difference between the teams, you have to try to understand what gives your team energy, what gives them strength.\u201d</p> <p>Because when you are out there, flat on the ground, face down, lungs aching, legs shaking, body breaking, far into the furthest reaches of what you have to give, what is it that makes you get back on your feet? This is where the game becomes about qualities much bigger, trickier and harder to measure than skill, or strength or speed; where it\u2019s about desire, motivation and determination, where it becomes a test of what you will do, and what you will go through, a question of who you are, and what you\u2019re playing for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e0c6fabfd7bfe7d574a67a4e58dfc0a887b0a9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e0c6fabfd7bfe7d574a67a4e58dfc0a887b0a9a/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Jones watches England warm up before the semi-final against the All Blacks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddie Jones burned with anger and pride as a player, which is reflected in the England team he has built.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And the answer to that last point cannot be \u201cyourself\u201d, and it cannot be the promise of wealth, or the allure of glory, because those are soft and comforting things and they are not here for you now, when you need them most.

If you love rugby, you will know someone who does not. You have a father-in-law who thinks it\u2019s too slow, a friend who reckons it\u2019s too complicated, one colleague who says it\u2019s too exclusive, another insisting it\u2019s too privileged. Maybe you are that person yourself, maybe the World Cup final will be the first match you have seen in four years, the first in 12 even, since the last time England made it this far.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are a multi-cultural, mixed-class team playing a game that its still seen by many as a white, middle-class pastime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So take that idea that rugby is only for the privileged. Jack Nowell\u2019s and Luke Cowan-Dickie\u2019s fathers both work as trawlermen in Newlyn. Kyle Sinckler grew up on a council estate in Tooting, the son of a single mother and a father he never met. \u201cA lot of people, when I was growing up, said I couldn\u2019t do a lot of things, that I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything.

      "bodyText": "Life turns on moments like these. At six o\u2019clock this Saturday evening local time, 9am in the UK, the whistle will blow at the International Stadium Yokohama, where England play South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final. Two hours or so later it will go again, and for one team, everything will change, nothing will be the same. In between there will be moments the people watching will remember for ever, moments the people playing will see flash in front of their eyes for the rest of their lives. That half gap that opened on the tryline, that ball that bounced just within reach, that tackle that was just beyond the fingertips, that drop\u2011kick, flying high towards the goal. Each one an opportunity. An opportunity for glory and fulfilment, yes, an opportunity for fame and money too. The last and only other England team to do this still live with, and off, it now. Their victory, in 2003, earned them knighthoods, CBEs and OBEs, set them up in second careers as coaches, pundits and TV presenters, and led, if they wished, to a lifetime\u2019s worth of sponsorship deals and speaking engagements. And beyond that there is an opportunity, too, to win something bigger, the chance to make history, to change the game, the way people see it, the way people play it. It will not come easy. Nothing in rugby does. The average tackle generates 22Gs of force, but they will often run up well beyond that, to 30, 35, 40Gs, which, they say, is something like being involved in a head-on car crash at 40mph. That is only an inexact comparison and if you want to be specific there are some key differences. Like this: when you crash, no one expects you to get up and do it again in the very next minute, and the one after that, 10, 15, 20 times a game, and still have the wits to take that pass, spot that gap, make that break. This is why the final will not necessarily be won by the strongest, or fittest, or fastest team. Rugby is strange that way, it runs on primal emotions. There is science to it and both teams have a battery of analysts. But as Eddie Jones said after the victory against the All Blacks: \u201cThe psychological approach to the game is becoming increasingly important. There\u2019s so little difference between the teams, you have to try to understand what gives your team energy, what gives them strength.\u201d Because when you are out there, flat on the ground, face down, lungs aching, legs shaking, body breaking, far into the furthest reaches of what you have to give, what is it that makes you get back on your feet? This is where the game becomes about qualities much bigger, trickier and harder to measure than skill, or strength or speed; where it\u2019s about desire, motivation and determination, where it becomes a test of what you will do, and what you will go through, a question of who you are, and what you\u2019re playing for. And the answer to that last point cannot be \u201cyourself\u201d, and it cannot be the promise of wealth, or the allure of glory, because those are soft and comforting things and they are not here for you now, when you need them most. So what is it? Who is this England and what have they been playing for these last seven weeks? \u201cI look at these guys,\u201d Jonny Wilkinson said on Monday, \u201cand in every position they\u2019re challenging stereotypes.\u201d The man who won that World Cup for England in 2003 was talking about their play but it\u2019s true in other ways, too. If you love rugby, you will know someone who does not. You have a father-in-law who thinks it\u2019s too slow, a friend who reckons it\u2019s too complicated, one colleague who says it\u2019s too exclusive, another insisting it\u2019s too privileged. Maybe you are that person yourself, maybe the World Cup final will be the first match you have seen in four years, the first in 12 even, since the last time England made it this far. So take that idea that rugby is only for the privileged. Jack Nowell\u2019s and Luke Cowan-Dickie\u2019s fathers both work as trawlermen in Newlyn. Kyle Sinckler grew up on a council estate in Tooting, the son of a single mother and a father he never met. \u201cA lot of people, when I was growing up, said I couldn\u2019t do a lot of things, that I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything. I need to show what is possible.\u201d Ellis Genge\u2019s uncle is in prison for murder and the prop was arrested himself when he was young \u2013 but never charged \u2013 \u201cfor fights and scuffles and things that never should\u2019ve happened\u201d. Take the idea that rugby is exclusive. Tell it to Manu Tuilagi, who came to England from Samoa and stayed, for six years, as an illegal immigrant on an expired tourist visa. Tell it to Mako and Billy Vunipola, one born in Wellington, the other in Sydney, who moved to a tiny terraced house in Pontypool so their father could play club rugby. Tell it to Courtney Lawes, whose father emigrated from Jamaica, Anthony Watson, whose mother came from Nigeria, or Jonathan Joseph, whose father moved from the island of Carriacou, part of Grenada, or Lewis Ludlam, whose grandmother on one side came from Guyana during Windrush and grandmother on the other is a Palestinian from Gaza. And tell it all to Jones, the working-class son of an Australian father, with a Japanese-American mother who was locked up in a US internment camp. Jones was a good player himself once. He burned with anger and pride, was fired by a desire to prove everyone wrong. And he has built this team in his image. Over the past year, Jones has cut a bunch of old hands, Chris Robshaw, James Haskell, Danny Care, Mike Brown. Good men and good players. But this squad, his squad, are lean, young and hungry, and they have a streak of that same stubbornness, spite, anger and pride running right down the middle. They have their well-to-do kids, too, of course: Jamie George, \u201ca posh guy from Hertford\u201d, and Elliot Daly, who is still nicknamed \u201cbriefcase\u201d because he turned up at his first day of professional training with the one he carried at Whitgift school. But 14 of this squad went to comprehensive schools or academies, seven more started in them and then moved into private education, which, like many of the remaining 11 players, they could do only because they won scholarships. Billy Vunipola ended up at Harrow, where his expat friends would come visit, \u201ca load of young Tongan blokes in hoodies strolling around the Harrow campus looking like they owned the place. Let\u2019s just say they didn\u2019t exactly fit in.\u201d They know all about the stereotypes. And they know all about the privilege, prejudice, injustice and inequality. Maro Itoje\u2019s parents emigrated from Nigeria. He was another Harrow scholar, who went on to study at Soas University of London \u2013 formerly the School of Oriental and African Studies \u2013 to get a different perspective on his \u201cAnglocentric\u201d education. He will tell you all about the racial divisions. Ask Genge, who struggled terribly at school because he had dyspraxia, and he will tell you all about the class barriers. They are a multicultural, mixed-class team playing a game that is still seen by many as a white, middle-class pastime, a sport that \u2013 at Twickenham at least \u2013 is still run, watched, and reported on by white middle-class men. The Springboks know all this too. They have their own stories, their own motivations, and are attempting their own, more radical transformation under their first black Test captain, Siya Kolisi. So who are this England team they\u2019re playing? They are multitudes. They have different backgrounds, different politics, different points of view. They are diverse, messy, complicated and contradictory. But they are together, and on Saturday they all have the same opportunity in front of them. It\u2019s the one they have been working for all their lives, the chance to redefine the game they play. They just have to reach out and take it.",

The Bundesliga club signed Jovic on a two-year loan from Benfica with an obligatory \u20ac5m buyout clause before selling him to Real Madrid for \u20ac60m last summer. Napoli have also made contact with Haaland\u2019s representatives, before and after his Champions League hat-trick against Genk, but were told that nothing will happen before the end of the season when Salzburg will put a value on him and see whether anyone is prepared to match it orwhether there is an auction to sign him.",

The UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain is aiming to remove 1bn pieces of plastic by the end of next year from its own-label products. The move comes after Tesco admitted that 13% of packaging on its own-brand products was hard to recycle, such as the black plastic used for microwave meal trays, which it said it would remove by the end of this year. The grocer has also pledged to ban brands with too much non-recyclable packaging from next year. Tesco says it will remove all plastic secondary lids on products such as cream, yoghurt and cereal. It is also ditching plastic sporks from snack pots and 200m pieces of plastic used to pack clothing and greeting cards.

Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, said: \u201cBy focusing on solutions that we can apply across all our UK stores and supply chain, we can make a significant difference and achieve real scale in our efforts to tackle plastic.\u201d Lewis last year called on the government to develop a national recycling infrastructure to replace the current system, which is led by local councils. Supermarkets have been taking action amid a growing public backlash against plastic packaging in the wake of the BBC\u2019s Blue Planet II documentary, which highlighted the problem of marine litter. Major grocers, which a Guardian investigation last year found create more than 800,000 tonnes of plastic packaging waste every year, have faced particular criticism for their role. Potential changes in government tactics on waste are also driving action. New rules under consultation could force retailers and brands to pay as much as \u00a31bn a year more towards the UK\u2019s recycling infrastructure \u2013 up from about \u00a370m now. The government is also currently considering a mandatory deposit return scheme for plastic bottles after the success of a single-use plastic bag levy in cutting waste. Tesco is not the only supermarket to take steps to reduce packaging. Morrisons and Waitrose have both tested refill stations to allow customers to buy packaging-free goods, including pasta and wine. Iceland last year pledged to eliminate all plastics in its own-brand products within five years. Sainsbury\u2019s has said could sell milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles as part of a drive to halve the amount of plastic packaging it uses over the next six years. Louise Edge, the head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s ocean plastics campaign, said Tesco was \u201cabsolutely doing the right thing\u201d but pointed out that last year Tesco produced more than 18bn pieces of plastic. \u201cSo they\u2019ve still got plenty of work to do, but this is a good start and we hope to see further reductions when it introduces its reusable packaging scheme for online orders in the new year,\u201d she added.

      "bodyText": "Financial companies should be required by law to refund victims of bank transfer scams, and should consider reimbursing the many thousands defrauded since 2016, according to a report from MPs. They also said retailers and other companies that suffer data breaches that lead to fraud should be forced to pick up the bill for the costs of reimbursing customers and issuing new bank cards. Another recommendation aimed at stemming the rising tide of financial crime is a mandatory 24-hour delay on all first-time payments between bank accounts to try to outwit fraudsters. The report from the Commons Treasury committee came after official data showed that scammers stole \u00a3616m from UK bank customers during the first six months of 2019. Of this total, \u00a3207.5m was lost after people were duped into authorising a payment to an account controlled by a criminal. This was up 40% on the figure for the same period in 2018. This type of scam is officially known as authorised push payment (APP) fraud and includes cases where email accounts \u2013 either those of individuals or the companies or tradespeople they have employed \u2013 are hacked in order to trick consumers into sending large sums to criminal accounts. A voluntary code of conduct requiring banks to improve the way they treat victims of this type of fraud, and reimburse those who meet the criteria, came into effect on 28 May 2019. The committee said this should now be made compulsory via legislation. However, the MPs noted this would not help previous victims of such frauds, and they said banks \u201cshould consider retrospectively reimbursing customers back to 2016\u201d. The report said: \u201cFinancial firms have been warned since 2016 that they have been failing in their duty to protect customers by not linking information on account names to payments. Firms should strongly consider whether refusing to retrospectively reimburse customers who relied on the payee name is fair and just.\u201d From the end of March next year, name checks will be carried out when UK bank customers send money to other people \u2013 though this system has been delayed and was originally set to start last summer. The MPs said: \u201cIt\u2019s a serious failure that banks weren\u2019t already doing this. The regulators should consider sanctioning any firm that misses the March 2020 deadline.\u201d Last year there were a string of high-profile data breaches at major companies, including Dixons Carphone, British Airways and Ticketmaster. In many cases people had their personal data, including payment details, stolen by hackers. Banks have long been angry about having to pick up the bill for the resulting problems, and the MPs said that when third-party companies were responsible for data breaches that led to associated fraud, \u201cthey should be responsible for the associated costs\u201d.

I think it\u2019s time some women got a chance. This week, the latest Countess Report was released, looking at gender representation in Australian visual arts. While 72% of art school graduates are women, women are just 25% of artists exhibited at the National Gallery of Australia, and 13% of the directors of state galleries. The NGA has announced they have a new aim of achieving gender balance from 2020. In response, Sydney Morning Herald art critic John McDonald said, \u201cA 50/50 demand is an ideological imperative that doesn\u2019t deal with the fundamental issue of quality \u2026 It\u2019s the role of the institution to make informed choices, not to tot up two columns.\u201d \u201cWomen make good and bad art, just like men,\u201d he said. Well. Yes, John. Men and women have both made a lot of bad art. But women haven\u2019t been able to make bad art in the same proportions or at the same scale as men. I don\u2019t inherently think more female artists would miraculously lift the quality of art. I just think it would be nice. And at the very least, I think it would be interesting. We deserve bad art by women, too. In 1985, The Guerrilla Girls asked: \u201cDo Women Have To Be Naked To Get Into the Met. Museum?\u201d They\u2019re still asking. In 2012, less than 4% of artists in the Met\u2019s modern art galleries were women; but 76% of the nudes were women. This is an increase in male nudes \u2013 but also an increase in male artists. This isn\u2019t an issue unique to the visual arts. This week, in a tribute to honorary Oscar winner Lina Wertm\u00fcller (the first woman nominated for best director, in 1977), Jane Campion (the second woman nominated, in 1994) noted five women have been nominated for best director at the Oscars. But she also made explicit the corollary to this: 350 best director nominations have gone to men. Even if we were to assume there were objective criteria for what makes \u201cgood art\u201d, do we really think women have made only one good film for every 70 by men? Of course, women make fewer films than men, and if they do make one feature, they are less likely to make another. Men are offered bigger budgets \u2013 even when films by women make higher returns. When researching a piece on the growth of gender equality in Australian theatre, I was shocked to learn the Sydney Theatre Company went from 2005 to 2018 without a female director debuting a work on their biggest stage. Do we think there wasn\u2019t a single dud in those 13 years? Research has shown us quotas don\u2019t let in mediocre women \u2013 they keep out mediocre men. And artists aren\u2019t judged purely on \u201cmerit\u201d: men decidedly support men at the exclusion of women. Men can take risks. They can make mistakes. They can make bad art. Women aren\u2019t afforded the opportunity in the first place.

      "body": "<h2><strong>1) Revitalised Rashford can become much-needed talisman</strong></h2> \n<p>Manchester United\u2019s recent form has put a new twist on an old clich\u00e9. The international break came at a good time for United, but not just for the usual reasons. Marcus Rashford\u2019s performances before he went away with England were abysmal; he looked unhappy, demotivated and in desperate need of a rest. It turned out all he needed was a change. Rashford always seems happy playing for England, and his storming goal to open the scoring in Bulgaria has apparently given him a huge injection of confidence and zeal. He has sparked United\u2019s mini-revival with a number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/30/chelsea-manchester-united-carabao-cup-report-marcus-rashford\">moments of coruscating brilliance</a>. A tactical change and the return of his on-field kindred spirit Anthony Martial have also helped, with Rashford now playing wide left or as a split striker rather than an isolated No 9. Rashford is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/nov/01/premier-league-team-news-injury-updates-manchester-united-liverpool-chelsea-live\">an injury doubt for the trip to Bournemouth</a>, and will surely be missed if unavailable. He is still a long way from the finished article, like most 22-year-olds, but he is the most likely of the current squad to become what all emerging teams need: a talisman. <strong>RS</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Bournemouth v Manchester United, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2019/oct/31/football-weekly-extra-carabao-cup-liverpool-arsenal-manchester-united-uefa\">Is Carabao Cup the world's best tournament? \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Villa unrecognisable from 2016 rout by Reds</h2> \n<p>Liverpool\u2019s last league visit to Villa Park, three and half a years ago, ended in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/14/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">6-0 spanking for the hosts</a>. Afterwards a delighted J\u00fcrgen Klopp said his team\u2019s performance was \u201cgood for the soul\u201d, which was an apt turn of phrase not least because Villa, back then, were a club whose soul seemed to have been hollowed out. Now, though, they have it back. Dean Smith has a vibrant team who are growing stronger by the week. Do not be fooled by last week\u2019s 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, where Villa were better than the scoreline suggests. Liverpool face a serious test, especially if Jack Grealish recovers from a calf injury in time to play, and Jo\u00ebl Matip\u2019s knee trouble rules him out again. <strong>PD</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c51e084d-4ee7-4c98-aff6-88452ffc7329\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OS1X7naCk7U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Aston Villa v Liverpool, Saturday 3pm</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>3) \u00d6zil\u2019s class can still help Emery out of a hole</strong></h2> \n<p>If Mesut \u00d6zil doesn\u2019t return to Arsenal\u2019s Premier League team against Wolves on Saturday, he probably never will. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/30/liverpool-arsenal-carabao-cup-match-report\">performance at Anfield</a> on Wednesday was a timely reminder that, for all the frustrations, few players in the world have his ability to strip a defence naked with such insouciant \u00e9lan. His improvised backflick to create Ainsley Maitland-Niles\u2019s goal at Anfield was the latest in a rich portfolio of unique creative genius. The fact he has played only 71 minutes of Premier League football this season is almost an act of cultural vandalism. At his best, there is no one in the world with \u00d6zil\u2019s cold-blooded serenity, technique and imagination in the final third. And while he has generally been nowhere near his best under Unai Emery, his performance against Liverpool could serve as an olive branch. Who knows: in one final twist, a returning Ozil could even save Emery\u2019s job. <strong>RS</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Arsenal v Wolves, Saturday 3pm</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/31/sorry-granit-xhaka-arsenal-fans\">There are many who should be saying sorry \u2013 but Xhaka is not one of them | Eni Aluko</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>4) Everton and Spurs sense chances to lift the gloom</h2> \n<p>Excluding lower-league opposition in the Carabao Cup, so far this season Everton have beaten Watford, Wolves, West Ham and Watford again. The bad news is that they are not going to play another side beginning with W until mid-January, but Marco Silva hopes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/29/everton-watford-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report\">victory over the Hornets in the Carabao Cup</a> on Tuesday will mean \u201cthe mood and confidence will be different\u201d when Tottenham visit on Sunday. The performance in that match, and particularly in a dreadful first half, was, however, not so overwhelming that Spurs won\u2019t be looking at this game as an opportunity to improve their own mood and confidence. News just in from the mildly curious historical anomaly department: though overall Everton have won 31% of their games against Tottenham, drawing 31% and losing 38%, in the month of November they have lost 44%, drawn 44% and won just 12% (two out of 16, and only once in 11 games since 1961). <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Everton v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61c16d816cec9de484a175ab6ddb4c215bef5f3a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61c16d816cec9de484a175ab6ddb4c215bef5f3a/125_244_1902_1140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Silva\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pressure continues to weigh heavy on Marco Silva at Everton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) Don\u2019t expect fireworks from toothless Watford</h2> \n<p>Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has wrought a complete tactical transformation at Watford: from four at the back to five; from a team that could hardly defend to one that have conceded only one \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/19/tottenham-watford-premier-league-match-report\">handball-assisted</a> \u2013 goal in their last three league games; from one that might occasionally score to one that hardly even tries. Troy Deeney\u2019s injury hasn\u2019t helped; Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s arrival in January \u2013 the 18-year-old Brazilian received a work permit this week \u2013 might eventually. In the meantime Roberto Pereyra and Gerard Deulofeu are much happier outside the penalty area and tend to stay there, leaving Watford blunted. It\u2019s just as well Watford Borough Council\u2019s big festive display has been put back half an hour to allow fans to make it after the game, because unless Flores has been working on another transformation they\u2019re unlikely to have any fireworks to enjoy at Vicarage Road. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 Watford v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pm</p> \n<h2><strong>6) Saints to settle for a respectable thrashing at City?</strong></h2> \n<p>There are times when the fixture list is downright sadistic. Just ask Southampton, who have had to follow their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/southampton-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">9-0 defeat at home to Leicester</a> with <em>two </em>trips to the Etihad Stadium. They got off pretty lightly with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/29/manchester-city-southampton-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report\">3-1 defeat in the Carabao Cup</a>, when City rested key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and David Silva. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl may endure a long night of the soul as he considers what a full-strength team could do to his side. City, after all, have already scored 49 goals this season.

If he continued to start as frequently as he has across his career so far, he would catch up with Mark Noble\u2019s current number of career starts sometime in October 2036. Football of course has its immutable law of the ex, which states that a player will always over-perform against his former teams, but Carroll appears to be an exception here as well: having played six times for West Ham against Newcastle without scoring (and another three barren games against them for Liverpool), it would be somewhat galling if he were to score against the Hammers at his first attempt. <strong>SB</strong></p> \n<p>\u2022 West Ham v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/31/var-premier-league-changes-needed-introducing-travesties\">Premier League needs to stop VAR operating like a nitpickers\u2019 charter | Paul Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>9)</strong> Pukki and Maupay key to Amex outcome</h2> \n<p>The two most prolific scorers in last season\u2019s Championship will have a big say in who wins Saturday\u2019s important Premier League encounter at the Amex.

Meanwhile Neal Maupay has thrived at Brighton even if his goal tally (four) is lower than Pukki\u2019s. The Frenchman, a \u00a320m summer signing from Brentford, is much more than a goal-getter and his intelligent movement and passing have been integral to the attacking style introduced at Brighton by Graham Potter. Maupay is as likely to score net this weekend as he is to create a goal for his striker partner, Aaron Connolly, who is far more Pukki-like in his play.

      "bodyText": "1) Revitalised Rashford can become much-needed talisman Manchester United\u2019s recent form has put a new twist on an old clich\u00e9. The international break came at a good time for United, but not just for the usual reasons. Marcus Rashford\u2019s performances before he went away with England were abysmal; he looked unhappy, demotivated and in desperate need of a rest. It turned out all he needed was a change. Rashford always seems happy playing for England, and his storming goal to open the scoring in Bulgaria has apparently given him a huge injection of confidence and zeal. He has sparked United\u2019s mini-revival with a number of moments of coruscating brilliance. A tactical change and the return of his on-field kindred spirit Anthony Martial have also helped, with Rashford now playing wide left or as a split striker rather than an isolated No 9. Rashford is an injury doubt for the trip to Bournemouth, and will surely be missed if unavailable. He is still a long way from the finished article, like most 22-year-olds, but he is the most likely of the current squad to become what all emerging teams need: a talisman. RS \u2022 Bournemouth v Manchester United, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT) 2) Villa unrecognisable from 2016 rout by Reds Liverpool\u2019s last league visit to Villa Park, three and half a years ago, ended in a 6-0 spanking for the hosts. Afterwards a delighted J\u00fcrgen Klopp said his team\u2019s performance was \u201cgood for the soul\u201d, which was an apt turn of phrase not least because Villa, back then, were a club whose soul seemed to have been hollowed out. Now, though, they have it back. Dean Smith has a vibrant team who are growing stronger by the week. Do not be fooled by last week\u2019s 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, where Villa were better than the scoreline suggests. Liverpool face a serious test, especially if Jack Grealish recovers from a calf injury in time to play, and Jo\u00ebl Matip\u2019s knee trouble rules him out again. PD Aston Villa v Liverpool, Saturday 3pm 3) \u00d6zil\u2019s class can still help Emery out of a hole If Mesut \u00d6zil doesn\u2019t return to Arsenal\u2019s Premier League team against Wolves on Saturday, he probably never will. His performance at Anfield on Wednesday was a timely reminder that, for all the frustrations, few players in the world have his ability to strip a defence naked with such insouciant \u00e9lan. His improvised backflick to create Ainsley Maitland-Niles\u2019s goal at Anfield was the latest in a rich portfolio of unique creative genius. The fact he has played only 71 minutes of Premier League football this season is almost an act of cultural vandalism. At his best, there is no one in the world with \u00d6zil\u2019s cold-blooded serenity, technique and imagination in the final third. And while he has generally been nowhere near his best under Unai Emery, his performance against Liverpool could serve as an olive branch. Who knows: in one final twist, a returning Ozil could even save Emery\u2019s job. RS \u2022 Arsenal v Wolves, Saturday 3pm 4) Everton and Spurs sense chances to lift the gloom Excluding lower-league opposition in the Carabao Cup, so far this season Everton have beaten Watford, Wolves, West Ham and Watford again. The bad news is that they are not going to play another side beginning with W until mid-January, but Marco Silva hopes victory over the Hornets in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday will mean \u201cthe mood and confidence will be different\u201d when Tottenham visit on Sunday. The performance in that match, and particularly in a dreadful first half, was, however, not so overwhelming that Spurs won\u2019t be looking at this game as an opportunity to improve their own mood and confidence. News just in from the mildly curious historical anomaly department: though overall Everton have won 31% of their games against Tottenham, drawing 31% and losing 38%, in the month of November they have lost 44%, drawn 44% and won just 12% (two out of 16, and only once in 11 games since 1961). SB \u2022 Everton v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm 5) Don\u2019t expect fireworks from toothless Watford Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores has wrought a complete tactical transformation at Watford: from four at the back to five; from a team that could hardly defend to one that have conceded only one \u2013 handball-assisted \u2013 goal in their last three league games; from one that might occasionally score to one that hardly even tries. Troy Deeney\u2019s injury hasn\u2019t helped; Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s arrival in January \u2013 the 18-year-old Brazilian received a work permit this week \u2013 might eventually. In the meantime Roberto Pereyra and Gerard Deulofeu are much happier outside the penalty area and tend to stay there, leaving Watford blunted. It\u2019s just as well Watford Borough Council\u2019s big festive display has been put back half an hour to allow fans to make it after the game, because unless Flores has been working on another transformation they\u2019re unlikely to have any fireworks to enjoy at Vicarage Road. SB \u2022 Watford v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pm 6) Saints to settle for a respectable thrashing at City? There are times when the fixture list is downright sadistic. Just ask Southampton, who have had to follow their 9-0 defeat at home to Leicester with two trips to the Etihad Stadium. They got off pretty lightly with a 3-1 defeat in the Carabao Cup, when City rested key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and David Silva. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl may endure a long night of the soul as he considers what a full-strength team could do to his side. City, after all, have already scored 49 goals this season. There have been thousands of football matches involving teams who would both secretly settle for a draw beforehand. This might be the first, certainly in Premier League history, in which both sides would accept a 4-0 home win.
