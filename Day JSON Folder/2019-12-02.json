A 19-page report published on Monday by the consultancy Graphika said that while it could not conclusively prove a Russian origin to the leak, the early distribution of the cache of files via Reddit, three German-language websites and an anonymous Twitter account reflected a method of operation seen repeatedly over recent years. There is no suggestion either that the NHS documents, produced by Jeremy Corbyn at a dramatic press conference last week, were fake, but the Graphika investigation highlights an intriguing series of efforts to get the leak picked up more widely at the end of October and beginning of November.

From his base in Los Angeles, Choudhury made a fortune from a trademarked yoga routine, only to have his empire in tatters following multiple civil suits and allegations of rape and sexual assault.</p> <p>And in common with the stories of the girls in the Jeffrey Epstein case, there is also the depressing state of the Californian legal system that is not fleet-footed or motivated enough to bring sexual predators to justice.</p> <p>The rise and fall (and maybe rise again?) of Choudhury is rich material, and the Australian film-maker Eva Orner (Taxi to the Dark Side, Chasing Asylum) uses it well in Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator. She makes excellent use of the copious amounts of footage of Choudhury from his early days in India to now, aged in his mid-70s. Complementing this trove, Orner was able to access and interview people from Choudhury\u2019s inner circle and several of his accusers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/20/bikram-choudhury-yoga-founder-abuse-netflix-documentary\">'He got away with it': how the founder of Bikram yoga built an empire on abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Choudhury was sued by former students alleging sexual assault and discrimination against racial and sexual minorities. In 2017 a court awarded $6.8m to his former lawyer, Minakshi Jafa-Boden, but she was unable to recover damages as he had fled the country. Bikram has denied the allegations.</p> <p>But the documentary is at its most intriguing when it looks at what the allegations against Choudhury did to the community. Some of those supporting accusers were ostracised, others struggled to break their loyalty to him and the yoga that was now a core part of their identity.</p> <p>In the early 2000s I met Choudhury. I was a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald and he was opening his first studio in Australia. As part of the story, I went to one of the early classes and was shocked. What the hell was this practice? The yoga took place in a room heated to around 41C. It was packed and it stunk. There were mirrors everywhere and the room was carpeted, which absorbed the stench and the sweat.</p> <p>This won\u2019t take off, I thought.</p> <p>Later that day I had an audience with him. He was staying in an apartment with panoramic views of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. An entourage sat around him, literally at his feet. The vibe was fawning. When I spoke to some members of his entourage, they discussed him with a degree of reverence usually reserved for a religious figure or guru, not the founder of an LA-based yoga school. Then there was Choudhury himself. I didn\u2019t mind that he was a braggart \u2013 name-dropping Hollywood celebrities who had done his yoga, boasting about his wealth.

      "bodyText": "Like many communities, yoga is grappling with its own #MeToo reckoning. There\u2019s the issue of consent and hands-on adjustments in class as well as more straightforward examples of abuses of power and violence. But has there been a bigger fall from grace than that of Bikram Choudhury? From his base in Los Angeles, Choudhury made a fortune from a trademarked yoga routine, only to have his empire in tatters following multiple civil suits and allegations of rape and sexual assault. And in common with the stories of the girls in the Jeffrey Epstein case, there is also the depressing state of the Californian legal system that is not fleet-footed or motivated enough to bring sexual predators to justice. The rise and fall (and maybe rise again?) of Choudhury is rich material, and the Australian film-maker Eva Orner (Taxi to the Dark Side, Chasing Asylum) uses it well in Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator. She makes excellent use of the copious amounts of footage of Choudhury from his early days in India to now, aged in his mid-70s. Complementing this trove, Orner was able to access and interview people from Choudhury\u2019s inner circle and several of his accusers. Choudhury was sued by former students alleging sexual assault and discrimination against racial and sexual minorities. In 2017 a court awarded $6.8m to his former lawyer, Minakshi Jafa-Boden, but she was unable to recover damages as he had fled the country. Bikram has denied the allegations. But the documentary is at its most intriguing when it looks at what the allegations against Choudhury did to the community. Some of those supporting accusers were ostracised, others struggled to break their loyalty to him and the yoga that was now a core part of their identity. In the early 2000s I met Choudhury. I was a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald and he was opening his first studio in Australia. As part of the story, I went to one of the early classes and was shocked. What the hell was this practice? The yoga took place in a room heated to around 41C. It was packed and it stunk. There were mirrors everywhere and the room was carpeted, which absorbed the stench and the sweat. This won\u2019t take off, I thought. Later that day I had an audience with him. He was staying in an apartment with panoramic views of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. An entourage sat around him, literally at his feet. The vibe was fawning. When I spoke to some members of his entourage, they discussed him with a degree of reverence usually reserved for a religious figure or guru, not the founder of an LA-based yoga school. Then there was Choudhury himself. I didn\u2019t mind that he was a braggart \u2013 name-dropping Hollywood celebrities who had done his yoga, boasting about his wealth. After all, he had a product to promote and that is what he was doing. I did object however when, without warning, he looked me up and down and declared that I was overweight and needed to do his yoga. What an unpleasant man, I thought as I returned to the office. Despite the bragging and the insults, his yoga was a great success. At the height of his powers there were around 650 Bikram studios around the world. Bikram yoga came along at just the right time, when wellness became a multitrillion-dollar industry. Yoga was a key plank in the industry, promising not just to make you look good, but also feel as if you\u2019d tapped into an ancient eastern tradition. It was more than just an exercise \u2013 it promised community and a way of life. It turns out, the odd dynamic that I experienced that day in Sydney was Choudhury\u2019s usual MO and in many ways was the key to both his success and his downfall. In the documentary he is seen abusing people, calling one woman a \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cchicken shit\u201d. He mocked another student for being overweight. But there was also a docility about his students \u2013 answering to his beck and call and unwilling to challenge him. This is in part connected to the money side of things. People\u2019s livelihoods depended on his yoga: they ran Bikram studios; they were franchisees; they spent thousands of dollars on their studios and training. Much of the documentary\u2019s early, pivotal moments are set during Choudhury\u2019s nine-week teacher training course \u2013 an intense yoga gulag where specifically chosen yogis (giving the training a cult-like vibe) are taught the Bikram method.

They were also sentenced to 16 years and four months for the attempted murder of Gustavo Castro, a Mexican environmentalist who was shot in the same attack but survived by playing dead. Sergio Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, the communities and environment manager for Desa, and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a former Desa security chief and ex-US trained army lieutenant, were given 30 years and six months for their participation in the murder. Mariano D\u00edaz Ch\u00e1vez, a US-trained special forces major who served with Bustillo, was found guilty by omission and given 30 years. In last year\u2019s five-week trial, wiretap conversations suggested that D\u00edaz participated in reconnaissance missions with Bustillo, and in February 2015 provided logistical support and a gun for a plot to kill C\u00e1ceres. That attempt was aborted at the last minute because she was at home with her daughters. At the time, D\u00edaz \u2013 an army major on active service and in line for promotion to lieutenant colonel \u2013 was under investigation for drug trafficking and kidnapping. Monday\u2019s sentences were welcomed by C\u00e1ceres\u2019s family and supporters as an important step, but outside court they reiterated demands that justice be delivered against the masterminds and financiers of the plot. \u201cFrom the outset, the path to justice has been painful, as our rights as victims have not been respected. These sentences are a start in breaking the impunity, but we\u2019re going to make every effort to ensure that all those responsible \u2013 the company executives and state officials identified in the trial \u2013 are prosecuted,\u201d said Bertita Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, C\u00e1ceres\u2019 second-eldest daughter. C\u00e1ceres, the coordinator of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (Copinh), was best known for defending indigenous territory and natural resources, but she was also a respected political analyst, women\u2019s rights defender and anti-capitalist campaigner. David Roberto Castillo, a US-trained former military intelligence officer and Desa\u2019s president, has been indicted as an \u201cintellectual author\u201d of her murder. Castillo was arrested on the second anniversary of the murder and is alleged to have coordinated with, and provided funds to, the killers. This year, C\u00e1ceres\u2019 children applied to a US federal court to subpoena bank records linked to a $1.4m luxury house in Texas purchased by Castillo eight months after the killing, arguing the documents could help identify yet unknown individuals involved in the crime. Castillo has also been indicted on multiple corruption charges linked to the Agua Zarca dam concession, which was awarded without proper consultation or environmental assessment. He denies any wrongdoing and insists that he and C\u00e1ceres were friends. Construction of the 21-megawatt dam stopped after the murder, but the licence has not been revoked. The Agua Zarca dam was among scores of environmentally destructive mega-projects sanctioned after the 2009 coup, which ushered in a pro-business government that unleashed a wave of repression against communities who opposed the plans. C\u00e1ceres\u2019s murder triggered widespread condemnation but failed to stop the bloodshed: at least 24 environmental and land defenders have been murdered since March 2015, and Honduras remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world outside an official warzone. Meanwhile, the National party remains in power despite mounting allegations of election fraud, illegal campaign financing and links to drug trafficking.",

No goals, no assists and six starts for Reign FC, partly owing to the NWSL season being played during the World Cup. However, it is hard to think of many others \u2013 any others \u2013 who could have shouldered the weight of on-field and off-field responsibilities in such empathic style.</p> <p>Critics point to the three penalties that contributed to Rapinoe\u2019s six World Cup goals as a sign of the winger benefiting from a heavy dose of good fortune. But where she stepped up, many others faltered. At 1-0 down in their last-16 tie against Sweden, Canada\u2019s record goalscorer, Christine Sinclair, who was then two goals shy of the international goal-scoring record, passed the penalty-taking buck on to Manchester City\u2019s Janine Beckie, whose effort was saved.</p> <p>Nikita Parris\u2019s two penalty misses against Argentina and Norway led to her being relieved of that particular duty, leaving Steph Houghton to step up and attempt to level their semi-final with USA from the spot. Her tame effort was saved by Alyssa Naeher. In other words, taking penalties is not easy and taking penalties in a World Cup is even harder.</p> <p>The calm efficiency with which Rapinoe dispatched one after another is worthy of praise, not criticism. That she did while surrounded by a media frenzy that would provoke many others to buckle is all the more impressive.</p> <p>When the video emerged of Rapinoe saying: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/26/donald-trump-megan-rapinoe-womens-world-cup-soccer-white-house-visit\" title=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House\u201d</a> in response to being asked whether the USA team would visit Donald Trump should they win the World Cup and receive an invitation, she could have distanced herself and chosen to adopt the often repeated \u201cI\u2019m focused on the football\u201d mantra.

A World Cup, Golden Ball, Golden Boot, Fifa best player of the year is joined by perhaps the most coveted individual prize. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the one winning it in this field,\u201d said Rapinoe, in a video because she was unable to attend the awards ceremony in Paris. With Uefa\u2019s European player of the year, Lucy Bronze, finishing behind her, her USA teammate Alex Morgan third and a shortlist that included the NWSL and W-League top scorer, Sam Kerr and Arsenal\u2019s WSL golden boot winner, and the Netherlands all-time top scorer, Vivianne Miedema, Rapinoe is right to be as humbled as she seemed. Yes, her domestic season was modest. No goals, no assists and six starts for Reign FC, partly owing to the NWSL season being played during the World Cup. However, it is hard to think of many others \u2013 any others \u2013 who could have shouldered the weight of on-field and off-field responsibilities in such empathic style. Critics point to the three penalties that contributed to Rapinoe\u2019s six World Cup goals as a sign of the winger benefiting from a heavy dose of good fortune. But where she stepped up, many others faltered. At 1-0 down in their last-16 tie against Sweden, Canada\u2019s record goalscorer, Christine Sinclair, who was then two goals shy of the international goal-scoring record, passed the penalty-taking buck on to Manchester City\u2019s Janine Beckie, whose effort was saved. Nikita Parris\u2019s two penalty misses against Argentina and Norway led to her being relieved of that particular duty, leaving Steph Houghton to step up and attempt to level their semi-final with USA from the spot. Her tame effort was saved by Alyssa Naeher. In other words, taking penalties is not easy and taking penalties in a World Cup is even harder. The calm efficiency with which Rapinoe dispatched one after another is worthy of praise, not criticism. That she did while surrounded by a media frenzy that would provoke many others to buckle is all the more impressive. When the video emerged of Rapinoe saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House\u201d in response to being asked whether the USA team would visit Donald Trump should they win the World Cup and receive an invitation, she could have distanced herself and chosen to adopt the often repeated \u201cI\u2019m focused on the football\u201d mantra. Instead she embraced the platform she had been given. \u201cMegan should win first before she talks,\u201d Trump tweeted in response. \u201cMegan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her &amp; the team.\u201d With her own words threatening to come back and bite her, Rapinoe scored twice. Not in a walkable game but in a quarter-final against the hosts, France, at Parc des Princes, a game many had hoped would be the final. Via video in Paris on Monday, the 34-year-old\u2019s message was unusually standard, a series of thank yous \u201cto my teammates, coaches and the US Soccer Federation for allowing me to be the person I am on the pitch but also the one I am off it.\u201d It is possible Rapinoe felt she had said her piece at September\u2019s Fifa Best awards. There she used a brutally honest and radical speech to condemn racism and homophobia, launching an impassioned plea to the footballing elite and beyond to \u201clend your platform to other people. Lift other people up. Share your success. We have a unique opportunity in football, different to any other sport in the world, to use this beautiful game to actually change the world for better. That\u2019s my charge to everyone. I hope you take that to heart and just do something. Do anything.\u201d Her nod to Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly\u2019s stances on racism, Iran\u2019s \u201cBlue Girl\u201d Sahar Khodayari, the gay footballer Collin Martin, female LGBTQ footballers and the battle for equal pay was coupled with a call to arms, a challenge for their voices not to be the lone voice. In 2019, Rapinoe has discovered how best to use her voice to amplify those of others. That the chant of \u201cequal pay\u201d echoed from the Stade de Lyon to the field of Burlington high school reflects how far her and the influence of the US team extends. But let\u2019s not forget that none of that would be possible without a series of extraordinary individual performances in extraordinary circumstances.",

We must improve,\u201d Guardiola said but denied they were missing Kompany, now at Anderlecht, who, as captain, was a strong influence on the pitch and in the dressing room. \u201cThis group is extraordinary, the group is incredible. They take care of themselves perfectly and are an incredible unit. Vincent was an important player and person for this club but he decided to go to Belgium and we have other incredible players to do the job.\u201d Ilkay G\u00fcndogan is suspended for the visit to Turf Moor and City will miss the midfielder against a side Guardiola knows will be competitive. \u201cBurnley are an incredible team going for the second balls and not just one player, two players going to defend the strategy or the way they attack.\u201d",

Brazil exported around $2bn of steel to the U.S. in the first 10 months of 2019, equivalent to around 9% of total exports to the U.S. For Brazil, exports to the USA are 12.47% of total exports (source: WITS (WTO)) and far behind China\u2019s 22% of exports.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Brazil imports around $25bn of goods from the U.S., which could potentially become subject to retaliatory tariffs, around half of these imports are of refined oil products. The next biggest category of imports is integrated circuits, which come from the U.S. chip manufacturers. In 2018, there were $6bn of aircraft exports. The Brazilian-made Embraer regional jet is widely used in U.S. airlines \u2013 part of the reason that Boeing has signed a strategic partnership with Embraer. For investors in Brazil, this is a sideshow unless the tariffs spread to other categories besides aluminium and steel.</p> <p>For many Brazilians, this smells like revenge for their country\u2019s soybean farmers bonanza \u2013 they have benefitted enormously from the U.S.-China trade war by replacing U.S. soybeans sales into China.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5de543768f080f2195043129\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T17:02:57.316Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some context</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Finally, December has begun badly on Wall Street, with losses triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Brazil and Argentina. Today\u2019s drama could be a good buying opportunity for those not invested in Brazil (but will only make a bad situation worse in Argentina). So argues Kim Catechis, the Head of Investment Strategy at asset manager Martin Currie. Here\u2019s the theory: Brazil is in a good place right now, with the economy coming out of the deepest recession in history and interest rates and inflation at their lowest levels. Brazil exported around $2bn of steel to the U.S. in the first 10 months of 2019, equivalent to around 9% of total exports to the U.S. For Brazil, exports to the USA are 12.47% of total exports (source: WITS (WTO)) and far behind China\u2019s 22% of exports. Meanwhile, Brazil imports around $25bn of goods from the U.S., which could potentially become subject to retaliatory tariffs, around half of these imports are of refined oil products. The next biggest category of imports is integrated circuits, which come from the U.S. chip manufacturers. In 2018, there were $6bn of aircraft exports. The Brazilian-made Embraer regional jet is widely used in U.S. airlines \u2013 part of the reason that Boeing has signed a strategic partnership with Embraer. For investors in Brazil, this is a sideshow unless the tariffs spread to other categories besides aluminium and steel. For many Brazilians, this smells like revenge for their country\u2019s soybean farmers bonanza \u2013 they have benefitted enormously from the U.S.-China trade war by replacing U.S. soybeans sales into China.\u201d Some context. Despite today\u2019s falls, the UK\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is still up over 8% this year. And here\u2019s the damage across Europe today. Not a crash, of course, but certainly a poor day. Wall Street is also firmly in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down by 235 points or 0.8%, as the clocks strike noon in New York. Newsflash: European stock markets have posted their biggest fall in two months, after Donald Trump hit Brazil and Argentina with new tariffs. Fears that relations with Beijing could deteriorate also hurt stocks, after Wilbur Ross threatened China with new levies if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed 60 points lower at 7283, down 0.8%, a one-week low. With heavy losses in Germany and France (both down 1.9%), the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index hit a two-week low - in its worst one-day fall since early October. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says Trump\u2019s \u2018economic illiteracy\u2019 is behind the move. European stocks have rolled over into the red, after President Trump decided, as a post-Thanksgiving gift to re-impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina. He also reiterated previous criticisms of the US Federal Reserve that they should continue cutting rates in order to counter the sharp falls being seen in both the Brazilian and Argentinian currencies, as he accused both countries of devaluing their currencies. He seems to have missed the point that the reason the currencies of both Brazil and Argentina are weak is not down to any deliberate or cunning plan on the part of either government, but merely because both their respective economies are in big trouble due to bad governance. Unfortunately, little details like that, don\u2019t appear to register with this particular President, which as an exercise in economic illiteracy, is hard to beat. Here\u2019s my colleague Dominic Rushe on Trump\u2019s threats: The weak manufacturing data from the US (see here) and UK (see here) also worried investors, taking the shine off the rise in Chinese factory growth. Hugh Gimber, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says the slump in US factory growth was a particular blow: \u201cInvestors had been growing increasingly confident over the past few weeks that the worst of the manufacturing slowdown could be behind us, which has helped to drive equity markets to new highs. Yet today\u2019s decline in the US ISM manufacturing print is materially below expectations and stands at odds with the recent improvement in the US PMI data. A weak employment component is of particular concern given the importance of the US labour market to the health of the overall US economy. \u201cLooking ahead to next year, we expect global growth to remain constrained by lingering geopolitical uncertainty, although central bank policy will likely still be working to limit the downside for risk assets.\u201d Donald Trump has spooked the markets once again with his latest flurry of tariffs, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. Oh Donald, Donald, Donald. With the markets having done their best to maintain a positive outlook on the US-China situation, despite Hong Kong becoming a political pawn between the two sides, Trump went and added another couple of enemies to his trade war portfolio. Delivering the news via, where else, Twitter, the President said that \u2018effective immediately\u2019 he would be restoring tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina. This as Trump claimed those countries had been \u2018presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies\u2019 that was \u2018not good\u2019 for American farmers. Never missing a chance to attack Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve, he ended the announcement by haranguing the central bank about lowering rates and loosening monetary policy to weaken the dollar. European markets are also sliding in late trading, as trade jitters hit stocks. The FTSE 100 is down 68 points, or nearly 1%, with heavier losses in other markets.... Uh-oh... Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, has warned that America would impose fresh tariffs on China if a trade deal isn\u2019t agree. He was speaking on Fox News a little while ago. This is a change of tone from the White House -- recently, officials have been talking up the prospects of a Phase One trade deal soon. This has knocked Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.8% so far today. Q: You say will make climate change one of the priorities of the ECB... do you have full support of that plan? How will you persuade counterparts at other central banks who think fighting the climate crisis is a fiscal issue? And what specific measures will you propose? Christine Lagarde says there are several ways of \u201cgreening\u201d the ECB\u2019s work - including adding a climate crisis focus to its analytical work, the risk assessment it carries out, and its own pension fund management. We are active in various forums, she continues. And the new strategic review will consider the ECB\u2019s activity in those forums, such as the G20. Another MEP tackles Christine Lagarde on the ECB\u2019s commitment to the climate crisis. He points out that the ECB\u2019s stimulus scheme has bought more bonds from the automotive industry, and from energy companies, than the market average, while neglecting the renewables industry. Q: will you put pressure on rating agencies, and your own risk measures, to take climate change into account within refinancing operations? Lagarde replies that it is \u201cvery important that all rating agencies take climate change into account\u201d when assessing credit-worthiness. I would hope that the three big, well known rating agencies move in that direction. If they ask me my views, I will tell them. [That\u2019s Moody\u2019s, Fitch and S&amp;P]. Lagarde repeats that \u201cwe need to have a debate\u201d about the ECB\u2019s market neutrality principle, which prevents it from overtly assisting green policies. We need to review the instruments and the tools, to ask ourselves about their appropriateness and the role that climate change should play in our decisions, she adds. All these issues will be considered through a new strategic review which Lagarde is launching. She\u2019s keen not to pre-empt (or be seen to pre-empt) its conclusions. When it comes to strategic review, it needs to be debated by all members of the governing council....I\u2019m not running a single-woman shop. Lagarde then denies that the ECB is making the climate crisis worse via its bond-buying stimulus programme. She argues that by improving financial conditions in the eurozone, the ECB is helping companies to fund new, greener projects. Back in Brussels, Christine Lagarde is being challenged about her commitment to the climate emergency. \u201cClear, precise and rapid actions\u201d are needed, one MEP points out, so what action will the ECB actually take? And isn\u2019t the ECB actually fuelling the climate crisis, by buying the debt of energy firms such as Shell and Total through its bond-buying stimulus scheme? Q: How can we finance investments to get rid of dirty, brown investments on the other side, and get the ECB out of carbon assets? In response, Lagarde agrees that the ECB\u2019s bond portfolio contains \u201cmultiple shades from green to brown\u201d. That\u2019s due to the policy of \u2018market neutrality\u2019, which means the Bank cannot use its stimulus programme to support green policies. Should this policy be revised? How? That will be part of the review that we need to conduct, Lagarde says. Some critics have argued that this market neutrality policy is hampering the fight against the climate crisis, as it means the ECB must buy bonds issued by heavy polluters as part of its QE programme. Lagarde also reiterates that the ECB needs to \u201cembed climate change imperatives\u201d in its work, including its economic forecasting. Newsflash: America\u2019s factory output contracted last month, according to the closely-watched ISM survey. The ISM\u2019s US manufacturing PMI fell to 48.1 from 48.3, showing a sharper fall in output, back towards the 10-year low seen in September. Fighting the climate crisis has to be a central part of the European Central Bank\u2019s policy-making, Christine Lagarde says. The Bank\u2019s new president tells the EU Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that all individuals must do everything they can to tackle climate issues. The primary mandate of the European Central Bank is not about climate change, but price stability, Lagarde points out. But the ECB does have other, secondary, objectives - and this is where it can make a difference. Climate change must be is a key element on how, when, and why the ECB takes certain decisions, she declares, citing two examples. 1) The ECB\u2019s macro-economic modelling which generates its economic forecasts. \u201cThese models need to incorporate the risk of climate change,\u201d says Lagarde. \u201cThat\u2019s the very least, I think, we should expect.\u201d 2) The ECB\u2019s supervisory role within the eurozone financial system. The Bank should also look into whether financial institutions are taking climate change into account when making their decisions, she adds. This would be a change in policy. Lagarde\u2019s predecessor, Mario Draghi, did not prioritise climate issues -- focusing instead on fighting the eurozone debt crisis and trying to stimulate its economy. Christine Lagarde is urged the European Parliament to help tackle the gender imbalance on the ECB\u2019s governing council, during her testimony in Brussels. Currently, Lagarde is the only woman on the 25-strong governing council, as its chair. She points out that 19 of those members are male - the 19 central bank governors for each eurozone country. You could push the authorities to start appointing female central bankers -- I\u2019ve got some names if it would help -- Lagarde tells the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. She adds that she would not like to be alone as the only woman on the Council for too long. Newsflash: Christine Lagarde, the eurozone\u2019s new top central banker, has warned that Europe\u2019s economy remains weak due to \u2018global factors\u2019. She doesn\u2019t spell it out, but one obvious global factor is the trade conflicts triggered by the US in recent years, both with China and Europe, and now Brazil and Argentina too. In testimony to the European Parliament, the ECB\u2019s president says: Euro area growth remains weak, with gross domestic product growing by only 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019. This weakness has been mainly due to global factors. The world economy outlook remains sluggish and uncertain. This lowers demand for euro area goods and services and also affects business sentiment and investment. As the sector most directly exposed to these global developments, the manufacturing industry has been suffering the most. We are also seeing signs of spillovers to other parts of the economy, with recent survey data pointing to some moderation in the services sector. Lagarde adds that the ECB will do what it can to protect the eurozone economy and help it grow, citing the new stimulus measures launched this summer. Lagarde\u2019s session hasn\u2019t started yet, but will be streamed live, here. Shares in US steel makers are up in pre-market trading, as they should benefit from tariffs on foreign rivals. However, rising prices are going to hurt US companies who actually buy steel and aluminium. European stock markets have dropped into the red since Trump\u2019s tweets hit the wires, erasing their earlier gains. The German DAX is leading the selloff, down 0.7%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has lost 0.3% or 24 points. Earlier optimism, following better-than-expected Chinese factory data, has been replaced with trade war anxiety. Shares in Brazilian steel-makers are falling as trading gets underway in S\u00e3o Paulo. S\u00e3o Paulo-based Gerdau are the biggest faller, down 1.5%, followed by Usiminas, which dropped over 1%. Both companies run major steel mills in Brazil, and could suffer once new tariffs are imposed at the US border. Argentina\u2019s government is also planning to negotiate with the US government, a spokesperson says. Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro has responded. Bolsonaro says he could speak directly with President Donald Trump about the decision to restore tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro added that he will discuss Trump\u2019s declaration with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes (whose comments about Brazil\u2019s currency being free to float may have contributed to Trump\u2019s decision....). This decision is also a blow to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s right-wing president. He won power last year with a campaign based on popularism, conservative policies and divisive attacks on minority groups, pushed heavily through social media. Trump and Bolsonaro had appeared to be close allies, but this hasn\u2019t provided protection from today\u2019s tariffs. Donald Trump has clearly been riled by the slump in the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso. The real hit a record low last week, at more than 4.25 to the dollar. Interest rate cuts, and weak economic data, had pulled the real down in recent months. But its latest tumble came after Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the exchange rate. Guedes told reporters: \u201cWe have a floating currency, so it floats.\u201d . Or sinks, perhaps.... The Argentinian peso hit its own record lows earlier this year, slumping 30% after the left-wing opposition surprisingly won a presidential primary, ahead of their return to power five weeks ago. It would be a mistake, though, to assume either country is jubilant about a weak currency. Both Argentina and Brazil\u2019s central banks have intervened in the markets, selling US dollars to prop up their ailing currencies. Donald Trump has also defended his trade war in a further tweet, which calls for a double fact-check! 1) Stocks are indeed higher, but that\u2019s not due to the trade war. The S&amp;P 500 index has gained 18% since March 2018, with the Dow up 14% and the Nasdaq gaining 21%. But America\u2019s various ongoing trade disputes have, if anything, dampened investor optimism. Instead, US interest rate cuts, Trump\u2019s tax reforms, and share buybacks have all played a more important role. 2) Tariffs are paid by US companies when they import goods. They either pass them onto consumers (higher prices), absorb the cost (lower profits), or try to make their supplier pick up the tab (by insisting on paying less). In practice, all three things happen - but only the last one helps the US economy. Brazil is the third-largest exporter of steel to America, points out Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough, so these tariffs could have an impact. President Trump\u2019s decision is a blow to both Argentina and Brazil, who had previously persuaded the White House not to impose metal tariffs. Back in May 2018, both countries secured \u201cpermanent exemptions\u201d from the levies, which are 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. Those tariffs were meant to protect American steel and aluminium factories from overseas competition, especially from countries which Trump accused of weakening their currencies to get an unfair advantage. Newsflash: President Donald Trump has just announced new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina. Trump is unhappy that Brazil and Argentina\u2019s currencies have depreciated, making their exports to the US more competitive - so he\u2019s hitting back. He is also urging America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates to weaken the dollar. The Fed has already cut interest rates three times this year, to 1.5%-1.75%, but Trump wants to see them much lower. Back in the markets, the pound is dipping today as general election jitters set in. Sterling has lost a third of a cent to $1.2895, after several opinion polls showed the Conservative Party\u2019s lead over Labour has narrowed. As usual, each polling company has a different picture, but the broad trend is clear. The Daily Mirror has the details: Opinium said the gap had narrowed from 19 points to 15, with the Tories on 46% while Labour racked up 31%. YouGov said its gap was down from 11 to 9 points, with the Tories receiving 43% of the vote compared to 34% for Labour. And the Tory lead more than halved according to BMG, which claimed a 13-point gap had been cut to just six points in a week. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says destocking following the latest Brexit extension is hurting factories: The weakness in Britain\u2019s factories in November suggests that growth may be modest in the current quarter, having barely grown in the last six months. The CBI, which represents UK businesses, has warned that any recovery must be based on continuing to trade as freely as possible with Europe. My colleague Phillip Imman explains: Britain\u2019s stuttering economy is likely to pick up momentum over the next two years, but only if the government maintains tariff-free trade with the EU, the CBI said in its outlook for 2020. According to the business lobby group\u2019s latest economic forecast, GDP growth for over the next two years is set to remain at 1.2% in 2020 before picking up to 1.8% in 2021. The modest rebound depends on the next government negotiating an \u201cambitious trade deal\u201d with the EU that preserves much of the current arrangements and eliminates Brexit uncertainty, it said. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said the forecast was based on the UK quitting the EU in two months on 31 January. The CBI\u2019s outlook also assumed the government would provide \u201ca clear line of sight to an ambitious trade deal,\u201d by next summer. The UK PMI report also shows that factories making expensive, heavy-duty goods suffered particularly badly in November. Consumer goods makers did better, though -- perhaps benefitting from Christmas demand? Markit says: Investment goods producers remained severe, with production, new orders, new export business and employment all contracting at steeper rates than the other sub-industries. Output, new business and staffing levels at intermediate goods producers also fell. There were brighter signs from the consumer goods sector, which saw growth of both output and new orders. A triple-whammy of problems have hurt Britain\u2019s factory sector, says Andrew Symms, partner at legal firm DWF: \u201cThe UK manufacturing PMI figures illustrate the impact of global trade tensions, Brexit uncertainty and an impending General Election that has resulted in the PMI to 48.9 in November from 49.6.\u201d \u201cThe underlying data does not paint a rosy picture. Manufacturing production fell and new order inflows deteriorated from both domestic and overseas sources. Employment also fell for the eighth straight month in November. A lack of transparency caused by Brexit ambiguity is holding back investment. Manufacturers need to take positive steps to understand their supply chains, mitigate risks and ensure, to the best of their ability, that financing is available in case conditions deteriorate further.\u201d Britain\u2019s factories are also suffering from some Brexit-unwinding, as companies run down stocks built up ahead of the October 31 deadline. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says this caused a drop in orders, leading to job losses last month: \u201cA heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending General Election. These combined to stifle any chance of manufacturing crawling out of the contraction zone, where the sector was stuck for a seventh month in a row. \u201cSupply chain managers cited weakened domestic demand and one of the biggest falls in export orders for seven years as companies unravelled their pre-Brexit stocks and resulting in one of steepest reductions in purchasing since 2013. Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012. Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties. \u201cWith this backdrop of pressures, the sector\u2019s performance is unlikely to change any time soon, which means a bleak beginning for the industry in 2020.\u201d Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says next week\u2019s general election is hurting Britain\u2019s factories. With orders dropping, and exports down too, firms are being forced to cut jobs to protect their finances, he warns. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s survey of UK purchasing managers: \u201cNovember saw UK manufacturers squeezed between a rock and hard place, as the uncertainty created by a further delay to Brexit was accompanied by growing paralysis ahead of the forthcoming general election. Downturns in output and new orders continued amid a renewed contraction in exports. The pace of job losses also hit a seven-year high as firms sought to reduce overheads in the face of falling sales. Destocking at manufacturers and their clients following the latest Brexit delay was a major contributor to the weakness experienced by the sector. Inflationary pressures meanwhile showed signs of moderating further, with input costs falling slightly for the first time since March 2016. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factories are slashing jobs at the fastest rate in over seven years, as the sector continues to shrink. That\u2019s according to the UK manufacturing report for November, just released, which shows that political and economic uncertainty are hurting the economy. It found that manufacturing employment in the UK shrank for the eighth straight month, with the pace of job losses the steepest since September 2012. Data firm Markit reports that: The UK manufacturing downturn continued in November, as businesses responded to the delay to Brexit and a fresh injection of uncertainty from the forthcoming general election. Output, new orders and employment all fell, while destocking activity resumed as firms depleted buffers built-up in advance of the postponed exit date. Companies linked further job cuts to cost reduction efforts, efficiencies, Brexit uncertainty, redundancies, natural wastage and staff restructuring. This has dragged the UK manufacturing PMI down to 48.9 in November, down from 49.6 in October. That shows a sharper contraction. Reaction to follow! Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reports that investors are cheered by today\u2019s Chinese factory upturn, although other PMI data has been less upbeat. The first Monday of the month sees a feast of manufacturing PMI data around the world and this morning the overall impression, with some exceptions, is slightly upbeat. An Japan\u2019s came in at 48.9, up from 48.4, India\u2019s at 5.1 vs 50.6, and China\u2019s Caixin PMI came in at 51.8 vs 51.7. Russia was the most striking disappointment at 45.6 vs 47./2, but we saw a soft number for Sweden at 45.4 vs 46 last, too. Markets haven\u2019t looked beyond the Chinese data too much... Some reaction to the eurozone PMIs, from trading platform BP Prime: Just in: Eurozone factories shrank again in November, for the 10th month in a row. The IHS Markit Eurozone Manufacturing PMI has risen to 46.9 in November, a little better than expected, from October\u2019s 45.9. That\u2019s below the 50-point mark showing stagnation, continuing a contraction that began back in February. Factory bosses reported that output, and new orders, both continued to fall last month -- although at a slower rate than in October. Only Greece and France posted a rise in manufacturing activity, Markit says: Germany remained bottom of the table, despite recording its best PMI reading in five months. Austria and Spain were the next worst performing, but similarly recorded weaker rates of contraction, whilst Italy registered its lowest PMI print for eight months. This means Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector remains in recession, says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit: \u201cA further steep drop in manufacturing output in November means the goods-producing sector is likely to have acted as a major drag on the eurozone economy again in the closing quarter of 2019. The survey data for the fourth quarter so far are indicating a quarterly rate of contraction in excess of 1% for manufacturing. But... the rise in the PMI is still a positive sign, Williamson adds. \u201cAlthough still signalling a steep rate of decline, the manufacturing PMI nonetheless brings some encouraging signals which will fuel speculation that the worst is over for euro area producers, barring any new set-backs (notably in relation to Brexit and trade wars). In particular, November saw the rate of loss of export sales easing further from July\u2019s recent record, helping pull other indicators such as output, employment, order books and purchasing off their recent lows. Back to the PMIs. Earlier, Markit reported that Australia\u2019s factories suffered a sharp tumble in new orders last month: Manufacturers in Thailand and Indonesia also found November tough: But South Korea, whose tech sector is particularly exposed to the US-China trade war, picked up last month - with its PMI rising to a seven-month high. Also in the City, shares in fashion chain Ted Baker have slumped to a 10-year low after it warned it has overstated the value of its inventory on its balance sheet. In a statement to shareholders, it says: Based on preliminary analysis, the Board estimates an impact on value of \u00a320m to \u00a325m. The Board believes that any adjustment to inventory value will have no cash impact and will relate to prior years. An independent review is underway. This has knocked 10% off its share price, to 357p, the lowest since 2009. It\u2019s the latest in a series of blows to the company, whose founder Ray Kelvin resigned earlier this year after allegations of improper conduct. Shares in mining companies are rallying, on hopes that Chinese factories will be buying more iron ore, copper and coal. Rio Tinto (+2.5%), Glencore and BHP Billiton (both 1.8%) have jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard in London. That\u2019s lifted the Footsie by 44 points, or 0.6%, in early trading. China\u2019s improved PMI surveys have \u201cgiven the world a boost\u201d, says Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank. Ireland\u2019s manufacturers are suffering from Brexit uncertainty, says Oliver Mangan, AIB Chief Economist. He says: \u201cThe primary source of the slowdown in manufacturing is weakening foreign demand. While total orders again rose marginally in November, new export orders fell for a fifth consecutive month and at a solid pace. Firms report that Brexit related weakness in the UK as well as softer US demand are weighing on export orders. \u201cThe Irish November PMI reading of 49.7 remains well above the average for the Eurozone, which is put at 46.6, and the level of 48.3 in the UK as the stronger domestic economy helps support activity here. A further positive note is that confidence among Irish manufacturers regarding future output rose to a five-month high in November. Nonetheless, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on confidence levels, which remain low on a historical basis.\u201d It\u2019s easy to blame Brexit, of course. But repeated delays to the exit date, and uncertainty over border arrangements and the future UK-EU trading relationship must be making it hard for firms to plan ahead. Plus, a hard border between the Republic and the UK, wherever it is sited, would seriously impact firms who export through Britain\u2019s road network to the rest of Europe. We\u2019ll get a lot of PMI data today, but Ireland\u2019s stands out as particularly worrying. Irish manufacturing activity shrank last month, for the fifth time in six months, according to the latest healthcheck from AlB and Markit. The survey found that output fell again, forcing bosses to cut workforce numbers for the first time since September 2016. Although total new business increased for the second month running, export sales shrank at a faster pace - due to weaker demand from US and UK customers. The survey says: Export sales decreased further during November, with the rate of contraction accelerating from October. Panellists stated that they had observed an overall weakening of foreign demand conditions, singling out weaker US and UK markets. Business confidence improved to a five-month high, but remained historically weak as Brexit uncertainty weighed on sentiment. This all dragged Ireland\u2019s factory PMI down to 49.7 in November from 50.7 in October - showing a small contraction. Asia-Pacific stock markets have been lifted by the rise in Chinese factory growth. The main indices are mainly higher today, with Shanghai\u2019s CSI 300 up 0.2%. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says China\u2019s factory slump may have bottomed out. But while today\u2019s PMI report shows some recovery, the trade war between Washington and Beijing is still hurting. \u201cChina\u2019s manufacturing sector continued to recover in November, with both domestic and overseas demand rising and the employment subindex returning to expansionary territory for the second time this year. \u201cHowever, business confidence remained subdued, as concerns about policies and market conditions persisted, and their willingness to replenish stocks remained limited. This is a major constraint on economic recovery, which requires continuous policy support. Currently, manufacturing investment may be lingering near a recent bottom. A low inventory level has lasted for a long time. If trade negotiations between China and the U.S. can progress in the next phase and business confidence can be repaired effectively, manufacturing production and investment is likely to see a solid improvement.\u201d But...Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics is cautious, telling clients: \u201cThe improvement last month was driven by different factors across the two manufacturing indices, making it hard to pinpoint the reason for the apparent uptick industrial activity,\u201d \u201cWe doubt this marks the start of a decisive rebound in activity. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A new month means a new healthcheck on the world\u2019s manufacturing sector.... and welcome signs of improvement from China. But Europe, and the UK, may continue to struggle. Growth at Chinese factories has hit a three-year high in November, according to the latest healthcheck from Caixin/Markit. Companies reported a \u201csolid increase\u201d in both output and new business last month, including a pick-up in orders from overseas. This suggests that the shock of the US-China trade war may be fading. The survey says: New business rose strongly, which underpinned a further solid increase in production. Notably, new export orders saw the first back-to-back monthly rise for over a year-and-a-half. Bosses also reported that they have stopped slashing staffing levels: Staffing levels were broadly stable following a seven-month sequence of decline, but capacity pressures persisted, with backlogs of work expanding again. This pushed the Caixin China manufacturing PMI up to 51.8, up from 51.7, which is its highest level in three years. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Here are the key points: Solid increases in output and new business Employment broadly stable Inflationary pressures remain weak Confusingly, there\u2019s also a separate official Chinese factory PMI, released last weekend. It also showed a rise in output (up to 50.2, from 49.3), bolstering hopes that manufacturers are resisting trade tensions. Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today New PMI data from the eurozone, and the UK, will show whether their factories are still struggling. Last month\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 PMI readings showed that Britain\u2019s manufacturing was contracting in November, so today\u2019s data could be a disappointment. The European Central Bank\u2019s new president, Christine Lagarde, is testifying to the European Parliament.

That\u2019s what these three-men Ballon D\u2019Or podiums have often resembled in recent years, with the greatest of respect for the likes of Neymar, Antoine Griezmann and Franck Ribery having to applaud one of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as they go to collect their latest gong. Less so this time, with Virgil van Dijk having such a stellar 2019. However, the last defenders to win this award was Matthias Sammer way back in 1996, in the dwindling days of the sweeper and Fabio Cannavaro in 2006. Lionel Messi is overriding favourite, with Cristiano Ronaldo not quite at the level of 2017, the last time he won the award. The great men are locked at five each after Luka Modric stole away with it last year and there is even the possibility that Big Ron won\u2019t even make the podium. There is Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah to consider, too. <br><br>For the women\u2019s award, Megan Rapoinoe is favourite, with England\u2019s Lucy Bronze in the mix. Last year\u2019s winner, Ada Hegerberg, may lose out after choosing not to go to last summer\u2019s World Cup. <br><br>The venue is Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, as this award is France Football\u2019s babychild. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T19:59:57.489Z\">at 7.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a snap report on the grand occasion. And you can relive Sid Lowe\u2019s take on Messi\u2019s exploits at the weekend \u2026 Here\u2019s a bit of what Messi had to say on stage. He spoke for quite a while. \u201cI know it isn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Didier Drogba by words of encouragement but the little man ought to be used to all this by now. To the journalists and my colleagues with whom I win and lose, I remember my first Ballon D\u2019Or in Paris, when I arrived with my brothers, now I pick up the sixth, and this was absolutely unthinkable. I never stopped dreaming and enjoying football like when I was a child. I hope I have more years to enjoy, although I am aware of how old I am, everything happens very quickly and I know that the moment of withdrawal (retirement) is approaching. It\u2019s a funny old game. Van Dijk doesn\u2019t look too disappointed and he explains why: \u201cI had a great season, but sometimes you come up against players like him [Messi], who are a bit unnatural. Six Ballon d\u2019Ors, you gotta respect greatness. I was close, but I lost out to someone better.\u201d Here\u2019s the top four. And Messi at the summit. Sid Lowe paid glowing tribute to the continuing brilliance of Messi in this week\u2019s blog from La Liga. Cristiano, at this point, has probably switched over to Coronation Street. The count-back was: Sadio Man\u00e9 in fourth, Cristiano Ronaldo in third (!) and Virgil van Dijk second. This might be the last time he wins this award, but perhaps the crowning achievement since there may not be any way back for Ronaldo. \u201cThank you to my colleagues from my club,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing. Thank you so much.\u201d Messi enjoyed that show, which included a message from his wife and three kids. And out comes Luka Modric to pass over the gong itself. Here is the moment of truth as it happened. Didier Drogba sits Messi down in a director\u2019s chair and they go through the year\u2019s highlights and a video package that includes Messi at home in one of those subterranean homes with no lights the top stars they all appear to live in. A double hat-trick of wins for him and he overtakes Ronaldo, back on five and coming up on 35. Here we go for the final four...Didier Drogba has the envelope in his hand. Great achievement for Lucy Bronze. Phil Neville thinks she\u2019s the best and he was almost proved right. While we wait for the big reveal, how about The Guardian\u2019s own awards season? That leaves Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Man\u00e9, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the final four. There\u2019s no sign of Ronaldo, and it\u2019s not like him to not show up and support his fellow pros. Big chance there will be no Ron and two Liverpool players in the top three. Lucy Bronze came second with Alex Morgan of the USA third in the women\u2019s award. Some words from Megan Rapinoe. It\u2019s a bummer [not to be there]. I congratulate all the nominees, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the one winning it. I want to thank my teammates, my coaches, my federation, to allow to be the person who I am on the field and off the field. Thank you to my beautiful girlfriend Sue. I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t be there, I know it\u2019s going to be insane but I\u2019ll do my best to get back there next year. The men\u2019s countdown continues with Mbapp\u00e9 in sixth. She can\u2019t be there, but delivers a video message, as does her mum and twin sister, in a video package that tells the story of someone who became a global figure in 2019. Donald Trump\u2019s congratulations are in the post, no doubt. Now for the women. Here\u2019s the top ten. Miedema Lavelle White Kerr Renard Marozsan Rapinoe Morgan Bronze Hegerberg The men\u2019s countdown continues: Alisson 7th \u201cIt\u2019s a great honour,\u201d he says. \u201cI am blessed and grateful.\u201d Mrs Becker looks very happy, too. Here\u2019s the podium. Robert Lewandowski is on stage to present the Yachine award for the goalkeepers. He and Drogba enjoy some striker banter on stage before the big reveal. Alisson (Liverpool and Brazil) Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany) Ederson (Manchester City and Brazil) Andre Onana (Ajax and Cameroon) Wojciech Szczesny (Juventus and Poland) Jan Oblak (Atletico Madrid and Slovenia) Kepa (Chelsea and Spain) Samir Handanovic (Inter Milan and Slovenia) Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur and France) Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona and Germany) We are counting down the men\u2019s winners\u2019 top ten from 10-8 - they are the Manchester City pair of Riyad Mahrez and Bernardo Silva in 10th and 9th and in 8th is Bayern Munich goal machine Robert Lewandowski. He thanks his old club Ajax and his family and girlfriend and says of Messi and Ronaldo that we must enjoy them when we can. Mbapp\u00e9 is the current holder of the Kopa Trophy, the award that is now to be presented. These are the nominees: Samuel Chukwueze (Villarreal) Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix (Atletico Madrid) Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior (Real Madrid) Lee Kang-in (Valencia) Andriy Lunin (Real Valladolid) Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund) Matt\u00e9o Guendouzi (Arsenal) Moise Kean (Everton) Matthijs de Ligt (Juventus) Kylian Mbappe (PSG) Last year\u2019s winners are on stage, and that\u2019s Ada Hegerberg, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Luka Modric. The Croatian says: \u201cIt was something amazing and it will stay for the rest of my life.\u201d That\u2019s Luka done for the night. He didn\u2019t even make the top 30 this year. Didier Drogba has gone off-piste, and is talking about that Barcelona win at Chelsea in 2009. Turns out that Mbapp\u00e9 was a young man waiting for his autograph that night and DD stormed home in a huff. Now he is making up for it by having a selfie taken. Here\u2019s the nominees for the Yachin award for goalkeepers. Alisson (Liverpool and Brazil) Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany) Ederson (Manchester City and Brazil) Andre Onana (Ajax and Cameroon) Wojciech Szczesny (Juventus and Poland) Jan Oblak (Atletico Madrid and Slovenia) Kepa (Chelsea and Spain) Samir Handanovic (Inter Milan and Slovenia) Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur and France) Marc-Andre ter Stegen (Barcelona and Germany) There have been props to former winners like Pavel Nedved, Hristo Stoichkov and last year\u2019s winner, Luka Modric, before the top ten for the male category are announced. Ok, here we are in the Theatre, and it\u2019s Didier Drogba who is the master of ceremonies alongside Sandy Heribert, a Eurosport presenter and who also heads up something called the Ultimate Beastmaster. Oxford, Cambridge, Hull; Milligan, Cleese, Sessions. That\u2019s what these three-men Ballon D\u2019Or podiums have often resembled in recent years, with the greatest of respect for the likes of Neymar, Antoine Griezmann and Franck Ribery having to applaud one of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as they go to collect their latest gong. Less so this time, with Virgil van Dijk having such a stellar 2019. However, the last defenders to win this award was Matthias Sammer way back in 1996, in the dwindling days of the sweeper and Fabio Cannavaro in 2006. Lionel Messi is overriding favourite, with Cristiano Ronaldo not quite at the level of 2017, the last time he won the award. The great men are locked at five each after Luka Modric stole away with it last year and there is even the possibility that Big Ron won\u2019t even make the podium. There is Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah to consider, too. For the women\u2019s award, Megan Rapoinoe is favourite, with England\u2019s Lucy Bronze in the mix. Last year\u2019s winner, Ada Hegerberg, may lose out after choosing not to go to last summer\u2019s World Cup. The venue is Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris, as this award is France Football\u2019s babychild.",

      "bodyText": "The former prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, who hosted Pacific leaders including Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern at the Pacific Islands Forum in August has told a special Pacific edition of Q&amp;A he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by Scott Morrison\u2019s behaviour in the diplomatic meetings. \u201cUnfortunately prime minister Scott Morrison of Australia [was] expressing views that completely denies there is climate change happening already in the Pacific. As chairman I was taken a little bit aback,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some strong resistance on the call from Pacific Island leaders for more concrete works to reduce greenhouse gases, but to particularly cut down and stop new coalmines in Australia,\u201d said Sopoaga. Throughout the forum Scott Morrison repeatedly spoke of the evident impact of climate change on Tuvalu, but said Australia was a good international partner on climate change and was on track to reduce its emissions in line with Paris targets. The ABC filmed the episode at the University of South Pacific in Fiji\u2019s capital of Suva earlier on Monday, the first time Q&amp;A has been filmed in the Pacific, and one of the few times the program has been filmed outside Australia. The episode was dominated by the climate emergency, as Pacific leaders spoke of the impact on their nations and challenged Australia on its response. In response to a question about the impact of the climate crisis on low-lying islands like his own nation of Tuvalu, Sopoaga said: \u201cIf the world doesn\u2019t reduce emissions as called for by the IPCC special report \u2026 we will face the situation where island countries like Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and others will be submerged into the sea by 2060, this is a scary scenario and it is very, very serious. \u201cI certainly hope that not only the Pacific, but those that have polluted the atmosphere and caused global warming will come to react and do the right thing in response to the special report.\u201d Virisila Buadromo, an advocate for women\u2019s and human rights in Fiji, urged Australia to take more action. \u201cI think Australia, as the largest country in the region, the richest country in the region, as well as, you also happen to be the largest emitter of carbon in the region, I think that it\u2019s important that if you are part of our family, you need to stand with our family \u2026 to fight against climate change.\u201d Alex Hawke, the minister for international development and the Pacific, defended Australia\u2019s record in this area. \u201cAustralia does do a lot on climate change internationally and here in the Pacific as well and we take it very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet our targets in Paris, we\u2019ve met our targets in Kyoto, we\u2019re going to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030 on our 2005 levels, this year we\u2019ll have about 20% of our power generated by renewables and we hope that to be a third by 2020.\u201d While the Fijian attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, was more diplomatic towards Australia, saying that Fiji recognised countries had their own political and economic imperatives, he added: \u201cWe need first of all everyone to recognise that actually coalmining is detrimental to the environment, creates climate events and then we need to have a game plan, the game plan is to have a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.\u201d The conversation also touched on illegal fishing; the increased rates of hard drug use and addiction in the Pacific, which is used as a transit point for drugs trafficked to Australia; the influence of China in the region; and the outbreak of measles, which has particularly devastated Samoa, killing 53 people. On China, Alex Hawke said Australia was happy to work with any international partners in the region who had the Pacific\u2019s best interest at heart, and that Australia wasn\u2019t threatened by China\u2019s presence as long as China was focusing on things like health and education and the region\u2019s economic prosperity. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at the region through a geo-strategic lens,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Pacific\u2019s time, there\u2019s certainly a lot of interest in the Pacific and we do have to take account, as a united people in this region, of how to use this time to do better for people in the Pacific, but that doesn\u2019t mean compromising values and sovereignty and I think that\u2019s sometimes where there\u2019s a difference in behaviour. I think people in the Pacific are very savvy people about working out who is coming into the region with their agenda in mind, their priorities in mind versus what\u2019s good for the Pacific countries.\u201d The panel was also asked by an audience member about violence against women. The Pacific has the highest rates of violence against women in the world. Tony Jones threw the question to Buadromo, who quipped: \u201cBecause I\u2019m the feminist and I work in women\u2019s rights the assumption is I\u2019m the one who should be combatting violence against women?\u201d She later took Fiji\u2019s attorney general to task, interrupting him as he outlined his government\u2019s record on domestic violence, saying while legislation now existed to punish perpetrators, that did not stop violence before it happened. \u201cThere is a psyche that is perpetuated by your government, your prime minister has perpetuated this psyche where violence is OK, because as we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks, in the last year there have been repeated incidents of people being beaten up by security forces,\u201d she said. Jones ended the program with a joke at Hawke\u2019s expense, as the minister thanked the ABC for hosting the program in Fiji and said he hoped to see much more of the ABC in the region, with Jones saying: \u201cGive us the funds and we\u2019ll be back.\u201d",

Speaking to the Press Association this evening, Austin has said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have made it absolutely clear that Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to lead the Labour party, never mind the country. I have written a letter to that effect.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He would not be drawn on how many voters had received the letter, or how the Tories had come to fund it being posted out. Austin told recipients that \u201cno-one\u201d believes Corbyn will deliver Brexit and that Labour\u2019s plans for government would \u201cput businesses, investment and jobs at risk\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know how hard it is for Labour voters to back the Tories, but at the end of this election, either Boris Johnson will be prime minister \u2013 or Jeremy Corbyn. That\u2019s the choice. And I am worried that if Boris Johnson does not get a majority, the SNP will back Corbyn.</p> \n   <p>It is too big a risk.

Johnson also claimed that it was clear from the outset that the attacker, Usman Khan, was not suitable for rehabilitation \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/01/london-bridge-attacker-poster-boy-rehab-scheme-targeted/\">some reports</a> have said he was seen as a model example of what could be achieved through rehabilitation programmes. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/02/jack-merritt-london-bridge-attack-dave-merritt\">an article for the Guardian published this afternoon</a>, <strong>Dave Merritt</strong>, whose son Jack was one of the two young prisoner rehabilitation specialists killed in the attack, said Jack would have been furious to see his death being used to justify making penal policy more draconian. Merritt wrote:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[Jack] would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that. What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens.</p> \n   <p>That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that. Through us all, Jack marches on.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Speaking to reporters shortly before Merritt\u2019s article was published, Johnson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt\u2019s family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia [Jones], who perished at London Bridge.</p> \n   <p>But, be in no doubt, I\u2019ve campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years. It was in my manifesto in 2012 when I was mayor of London. I said it in August and it\u2019s in the Queen\u2019s speech. In fact, there\u2019s a bill we\u2019ve got ready to go in the Queen\u2019s speech to stop automatic early release for serious and violent offenders.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Johnson was not being wholly candid. The sentencing bill in the Queen\u2019s speech proposed changing the automatic release point from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds of the way through a sentence for people serving sentences of four years or more for a serious violent or sexual offence. The Conservative manifesto, published just five days before the London Bridge attack, effectively just replicated this, proposing \u201ctougher sentencing for the worst offenders\u201d and an end to automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes. But on Saturday, a day after Khan\u2019s attack, Johnson escalated his demands by calling for two measures that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/02/general-election-swinson-condemns-johnson-over-trump-friendship-ahead-of-london-visit-live?page=with:block-5de4d0ca8f087410d98768bb#block-5de4d0ca8f087410d98768bb\">went beyond anything previously proposed by his party:</a> mandatory minimum 14-year sentences for serious terrorist offences, and no early release at all for all terrorism and extremism offences.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/02/general-election-swinson-condemns-johnson-over-trump-friendship-ahead-of-london-visit-live?page=with:block-5de502588f086d7f86dab9a4#block-5de502588f086d7f86dab9a4\">Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has claimed that that if the UK were to join the proposed European defence union after Brexit, Nato would collapse. </a></strong>He made the argument in a speech at a rally in north Wales in which he also claimed that EU politicians \u201cwant Nato out of Europe\u201d. Even by the accuracy standards of this general election campaign, Farage\u2019s arguments were particularly improbable. But if this is where Donald Trump is getting his advance briefing before Wednesday\u2019s Nato summit at a hotel near Watford (which is not impossible), that should make for an interesting conversation. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage has also suggested that Trump might use the summit to insist that America is not interested in buying up the NHS.</strong> This would ostensibly help Johnson, who says that the NHS will not be covered by any UK-EU trade deal, and undermine Jeremy Corbyn, who insists that it will be, but given Trump\u2019s standing with the British public, and his reputation for honesty, it is hard to see any declaration like this making much difference either way.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/02/general-election-swinson-condemns-johnson-over-trump-friendship-ahead-of-london-visit-live?page=with:block-5de5461f8f0829bc521b51cb#block-5de5461f8f0829bc521b51cb\"> Trump has already started his flight to the UK</a>.

Here are the main points he has been making.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has rejected claims that he has been opportunistically exploiting the London Bridge attack for political purposes.</strong> Dave Merritt, whose son Jack was one of the two young prisoner rehabilitation specialists killed in the attack, has urged politicians not to use the attack as a pretext to introduce more draconian penal policies. Without referring directly to Merritt\u2019s comments, Johnson responded by stressing that his commitment to longer sentences for serious offenders was longstanding. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt\u2019s family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia [Jones], who perished at London Bridge.</p> \n   <p>But, be in no doubt, I\u2019ve campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years. It was in my manifesto in 2012 when I was mayor of London. I said it in August and it\u2019s in the Queen\u2019s speech. In fact, there\u2019s a bill we\u2019ve got ready to go in the Queen\u2019s speech to stop automatic early release for serious and violent offenders.</p> \n   <p>And I do think, unfortunately, that is the problem that we face. We have too many people who are released automatically on to our streets and we need to address that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed it was \u201cpretty obvious\u201d that the killer, Usman Khan, was not suitable for early release.</strong> Asked whether someone like Khan could ever be de-radicalised, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That is a very profound question and there is an issue there that we need to talk about frankly as a society and when we look at some of the problems that we come across in trying to de-radicalise people, we have to face the grim reality that in some cases it is really very difficult.</p> \n   <p>I think this was one of those cases and, alas, I think it also was pretty obvious from the kinds of things he was saying and continued to say that he was not really a suitable candidate for automatic early release.</p> \n   <p>Yet under the law as it stood when he was sentenced, that was the 2008 legal system, there was no parole board, no probation system, there was no means of reviewing his release - he was just sprung automatically.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also claimed that it was clear from the outset that Khan was not suitable for rehabilitation.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are unquestionably some cases which are just too tough to crack and alas [Khan] appears to have been one of them, and I\u2019m afraid it was probably clear from the outset that that would be so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson criticised the appeal court\u2019s decision to reduce Khan\u2019s sentence.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think any impartial assessment of the situation would concede that [Khan] was sentenced to a period in prison \u2013 16 years plus five years on licence \u2013 and then was subject to automatic early release having served eight years altogether.</p> \n   <p>And I don\u2019t think that was long enough in view of the gravity of his offence \u2013 which was to conspire to blow up the stock exchange and to cause other types of mayhem \u2013 and in view of the view that was taken of him by the initial sentencing judge, Judge Wilkie, and looking at what the judge had to say about him it\u2019s clear he was viewed as a very serious threat.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e499a87a480bd3cddc1bbfef717a3ba7c4525edc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e499a87a480bd3cddc1bbfef717a3ba7c4525edc/0_120_5464_3279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn at the vigil for the victims of the London Bridge attack this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn at the vigil for the victims of the London Bridge attack this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T18:15:52.839Z\">at 6.15pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de529e58f0831141cc4375b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T15:41:08.078Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welfare cuts were needed to avoid mass unemployment during austerity period, says Scottish Tory leader</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Welfare cuts were necessary to avoid mass unemployment during the austerity era, <strong>Jackson Carlaw,</strong> the interim Scottish Conservative leader, has said. On a BBC Radio Scotland phone-in, asked to explain why food bank use had gone up so much while the Conservatives had been in power, Carlaw replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>During the course of the recession, when the priority was to try to ensure we kept as many people in work, we froze the level at which earnings were able to rise, some benefits were frozen during that period as well.</p> \n   <p>We managed to avoid the crisis in poverty and pain that would have come from mass unemployment.</p> \n   <p>We are putting in place the actions to allow the cap and the freeze on benefits to be removed and to give people more money.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Carlaw argued the country was \u201cnow at the end of that period of austerity\u201d and he said the Conservatives were now planning changes to the welfare system. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need to be less draconian, frankly, in some of the assessment criteria that there have been for people during this period and the manifesto commits to reducing all of that.</p> \n   <p>It also commits to reducing the penalty that will be imposed for any kind of abuse of benefits because I think [they] also \u2013 through the sometimes-inadvertent actions of people \u2013 have been deeply unfair.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Tory manifesto does commit the party to reducing the number of reassessments a disabled person must go through when claiming benefits, if a change in their condition is unlikely.</p> \n  <p>But the manifesto does not say anything specific about reducing the sanctions imposed on people who abuse the benefits system.

However, political parties are scarce on describing how they will meet this claim. What is the strategy for green energy research, application and electric car infrastructure implementation? Jordan Bizzell, 24, architectural assistant, London</em></p> \n  <p>On the subject of renewable energy, the party does have some ambitious plans to shift to more sustainable sources, as well as energy-saving measures such as home insulation. It\u2019s arguably not as ambitious as the Labour \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d plan, let alone that of the Greens (who came up with the green new deal concept), and credibility for such programmes can be debated. One issue is that it is sometimes hard to tell how well new energy mixes will work before they\u2019re in place. For example, there was huge scepticism in the past about the cost and reliability of wind power \u2026 until wind power ended up being cheaper and more reliable than many said.</p> \n  <p>The party says all new cars should be electric by 2030, but also wants to invest more in public transport and active travel (walking and cycling, that is). E-car infrastructure is a tricky business in general, not least for people who don\u2019t have driveways and need on-street charging. Entirely off the subject of the Lib Dems and on to my own interests, it\u2019s worth noting that while e-cars are, of course, much better than, say, diesel ones, they don\u2019t solve lots of other issues such as congestion, road danger, health issues from inactive lifestyles and so on. They don\u2019t even solve all pollution problems, given new research into the problems caused by particulates from tyre and brake wear. But I digress.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What is the thinking behind \u2018help to rent\u2019? Wouldn\u2019t it just make renters such as myself poorer and more burdened with debt? Wouldn\u2019t it be cheaper to limit the size of deposits? Nathaniel McKenzie, 26, publisher, London</em></p> \n  <p>On the assumption you mean the \u201crent to own\u201d idea, this seems to be an idea to help people be able to buy a home \u2013 but only if they want to. This would be for social housing, letting people who cannot afford to raise a deposit to buy a property instead buy their social home over 30 years, by letting their rent payments gradually pay off the cost of the home. This is, of course, in part a long-term help-to-buy scheme, which would deplete the stock of social housing, But the party says it would build at least 100,000 new social rent homes every year.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T14:17:30.822Z\">at 2.17pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de511618f0831141cc4361c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T13:39:55.158Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/len-mccluskey-issue-brexit-corbyn-dont-know-voters-leaveelection_uk_5de3a3c4e4b0913e6f8042e6?utm_hp_ref=uk-politics\">an interview with Paul Waugh for HuffPost UK</a>,<strong> Len McCluskey,</strong> the Unite general secretary, said that leave-voting seats in the north of England and the Midlands were Labour\u2019s \u201cachilles heel\u201d at this election. Many people in these areas were not yet sure how to vote, he said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our achilles heel is in our communities, in what\u2019s known as our heartlands, that voted leave and are not quite sure yet whether they will give their vote to Labour.</p> \n   <p>If we can engage people listening to what\u2019s on offer, what type of Britain and country we want as we go into the future, then we are on a winner.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s very much a question of how we do that, whilst at the same time tackling the very real issues we\u2019ve got over Brexit and with Jeremy in some places.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McCluskey said that, if Labour were to form a government and negotiate a new version of Brexit, Unite could hold a special conference to decide whether it would back the deal, instead of backing remain as it did in 2016.</p> \n  <p>A strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, McCluskey also acknowledged that his leadership was an issue for some voters. But he suggested that the media and disloyal Labour MPs were largely responsible for this being a problem. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Since Jeremy was elected four years ago, he has been consistently [attacked] in a way that I\u2019ve never experienced before. I\u2019m a huge fan of Tony Benn\u2019s and Tony used to get some terrible media.</p> \n   <p>But there has been nothing quite like the vicious campaign against Jeremy Corbyn on every subject that the media could try to ascribe some blame to him. He\u2019s been slaughtered personally, in a way that a weaker man would have collapsed by now, but he\u2019s strong enough.</p> \n   <p>He\u2019s been betrayed by many of his own MPs, in a way that has been difficult to understand. The one thing that we know about the public is they don\u2019t like any divisions in any political party.

Send them in to us <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ask_us_a_question_liberal_democrats_manifesto\">here</a>.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why are there so many ads which misrepresent the proportion of votes the Lib Dems received in the previous GE? I have seen multiple examples of Lab/Con marginals where the Lib Dems are trying to make people believe it\u2019s actually a Lib Dem/Con marginal when in fact a Labour voter switching to Lib Dems will make a hard Brexit more likely. It makes me distrust the party. Matthew, Oxford</em></p> \n  <p>The Lib Dems have something of a reputation for sharp-elbowed practices in elections, and a particular notoriety for bar charts with very dubious scales. When I went out campaigning with Luciana Berger in Finchley and Golders Green she was at pains to show off the scale of the chart on her leaflets, saying it had been \u201cmeasured to the nearest millimetre\u201d. One confusion can be that the Lib Dems use various polls or election results. </p> \n  <p>So, in Finchley and Golders Green, while the Lib Dems were a distant third in the 2017 election behind the Tories and Labour, Berger\u2019s chart showed a recent constituency poll which put her in second. It was a legitimate poll, so that seems fair enough. Other tactics are more dubious, for example citing council or European results as evidence the Lib Dems can win in an area. And the party has been criticised for other tricks \u2013 for example <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/lib-dems-lambasted-over-fake-newspapers-campaign-material\">printing fake \u201cnewspapers\u201d</a> that look a lot like the genuine local paper.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Hi, I can find nothing in the Liberal Democrat manifesto about fishing and CFP reform. Do they actually have a policy on this? Thanks. Alastair S. Edwards, 48, music and English teacher, near Jablonec nad Nisou in the Czech Republic</em></p> \n  <p>You\u2019re right - there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in there. The party\u2019s manifesto for the European elections in May also doesn\u2019t mention it. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t add much, as I\u2019ve never heard any senior Lib Dem people discuss the issue. So I\u2019m not much help here.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Introducing a written constitution for a federal United Kingdom sounds very radical, why am I not hearing more about it? How would they achieve that? Jason, 28, edit assistant, London</em></p> \n  <p>The party has long been a champion of constitutional reform, most obviously through its longstanding support for a proportional voting system. The party\u2019s manifesto promises all sorts of changes such as Commons constituencies for overseas voters (MP for the south of France could be popular), giving 16- and 17-year-olds the vote, and making the Lords democratic. Some elements are, however, a bit vague, not least the plan for \u201ca written constitution for a federal United Kingdom\u201d. This would, of course, involve changing centuries of precedent and would keep constitutional experts in work for years. How would they do that?

I\u2019d like someone to explain how they can legally overturn article 50 and the impact it could have on future government decisions. Suzi, manual labour worker in a warehouse, West Yorkshire</em></p> \n  <p>If desired, the UK could revoke article 50 but doing nothing more than writing a letter to the European council. In 2018, the European court of justice <a href=\"https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2018-12/cp180191en.pdf\">confirmed</a> this could be done unilaterally. In legal terms, this is a very specific issue so would seem to have no bearing on future governments. Politically it would be viewed with dismay by some voters. But the Lib Dems argue that since they would only do this in the (extremely unlikely) event of the party winning an absolute majority in parliament, this would be a mandate from the people. And constitutionally they are quite correct. Whether it was tactically a good idea to promise this, as a \u201cmore remain than you\u201d sign to distance the party from Labour, remains to be seen. Some senior Lib Dems are not 100% happy with it.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: How will the Lib Dems fight for UK citizens in Europe, especially retirees. Patrick Markby, nearly 70, retired chef, Montpellier, France</em></p> \n  <p>They would say that the best way to do that would be to stop Brexit altogether, and let the status quo continue for UK nationals living in the rest of the EU. The Lib Dems have not, as yet, got into what policies they would seek to mitigate the impact of Brexit on people like you. For electoral reasons they don\u2019t really want to discuss a preferred sort of departure, as their overwhelming election message is to cancel the whole thing. So I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t really add much.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What are the strongest and the weakest parts of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 message? Laird Taylor, Victoria, Canada</em></p> \n  <p>If you asked ten Lib Dem activists, you might well get 10 \u2013 or at least six or seven \u2013 different answers. They have bet the house on tempting over large numbers of remain-minded Tory and Labour voters with an overwhelming anti-Brexit focus. The other key element has been a near-presidential spotlight on Jo Swinson (the party\u2019s two battlebuses both carry the slogan, \u201cJo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats\u201d). </p> \n  <p>Both these could be strengths ... but given the way the party has slipped gradually in the polls, they have not been so far. One strength could be the revised central message to urge voters to vote tactically and help Lib Dems defeat Tory candidates in some seats and thus deprive Boris Johnson of a majority. With the Conservatives strongly ahead in the polls, and Johnson a highly divisive character, that could resonate.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T13:17:30.998Z\">at 1.17pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de502588f086d7f86dab9a4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T13:07:58.853Z\">1.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Farage claims Nato will collapse if UK joins EU defence union after Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the main point from <strong>Nigel Farag</strong><strong>e</strong>\u2019s speech at the Brexit party rally in Buckley in North Wales.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage claimed that if the UK were to join the proposed European defence union after Brexit, Nato would collapse.</strong> He claimed that the UK faced a binary choice, between Nato and the European defence union, and he claimed that Boris Johnson was refusing to say which he preferred. He claimed that the Europeans wanted Nato out of Europe. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They [the Europeans] are not just talking about building their European defence union; they are talking about flexing their muscles around the world. I find that very alarming talk. What is clear, what is absolutely clear, is they want Nato out of Europe. That\u2019s what the politicians in Brussels want.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Farage went on to say that Johnson had to make a choice. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No man effectively can serve both; Nato and a European defence union cannot co-exist equally.</p> \n   <p>And I would say that in a world where there are some major serious threats, we need that military relationship with America today as much as we have ever needed it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And Farage said that, if the UK were to choose the European option, Nato would collapse.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If we leave the European defence union, it becomes valueless. Because without [the UK], it doesn\u2019t have the muscle that it needs. But if we stay, don\u2019t be surprised if Nato falls to pieces and we leave the security and protection that America had for us, thank god, twice in the last century.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a relatively new argument from Farage - although it is founded on several questionable assumptions.</p> \n  <p>First, the European defence union does not actually exist yet. It is an aspiration, and EU countries are moving closer to the idea, but it does not exist yet in the form that Farage implies. This <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/CBP-8216.pdf\">Commons briefing paper (pdf)</a> contains more detail.</p> \n  <p>Second, it is just not true to say that Europeans \u201cwant Nato out of Europe\u201d. Some EU leaders have reservations about Nato, but there are many countries were it is still seen as an essential protection.</p> \n  <p>Third, where European do have reservations about Nato, it is not so much because they have lost faith in the concept of collective security; it is more to do with the fact that, with Farage\u2019s ally Donald Trump in the White House, there are real concerns that the US is a less reliable ally than it once was.</p> \n  <p>And, fourth, it is not inevitable that Nato could not co-exist with a European defence union. The Americans want the Europeans to invest more in defence, and so arguably, if the EU were to have its own defence capability, Nato would be more secure, not less.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6ab9553f63771ed8fb9e06354e9eb5656f4877e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6ab9553f63771ed8fb9e06354e9eb5656f4877e/0_91_4860_2916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage speaking at a Brexit party campaign event in Buckley, North Wales.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage speaking at a Brexit party campaign event in Buckley, North Wales.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de506ca8f080f2195042e13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterwalker\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T12:45:51.309Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some of your questions so far have been about the Gender Recognition Act and the legalisation of cannabis:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Does the Lib Dem manifesto have anything to say about the Gender Recognition Act? Does it want people who self-identify as the opposite sex to be able to obtain a gender recognition certificate and therefore a new birth certificate? Jane, London</em></p> \n  <p>The manifesto says this on the issue, in its section on equality: \u201cComplete reform of the Gender Recognition Act to remove the requirement for medical reports, scrap the fee and recognise non-binary gender identities.\u201d In truth, I\u2019ve not covered this area of the manifesto, or talked to any Lib Dems about this, so I don\u2019t know a whole lot more than this. In my defence, the manifesto is 96 pages long.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are the Lib Dems 100% banning fracking? I want to know this as Jo Swinson has voted in favour of fracking in the past, which I believe is despicable. Jules, Cornwall</em></p> \n  <p>Their manifesto is unequivocal on this. On its sections about a green economy four, \u201cpriorities for a first parliament\u201d. One says: \u201cInvesting in renewable power so that at least 80% of UK electricity is generated from renewables by 2030 \u2013 and banning fracking for good.\u201d More generally, Swinson has been keen to try and distance herself from decisions taken under the 2010-15 coalition, when she held a series of junior ministerial roles. It\u2019s up to voters to decide on this.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What are the implications of the legalising cannabis proposal? How popular is it and what do medical professionals say?

The costings document for the current manifesto shows the party would expect revenues of almost \u00a31.5bn a year in duties on cannabis and savings on law enforcement. More widely, you can \u2013 and people do \u2013 argue endlessly about drug decriminalisation, but there are plenty of experts, and doctors, who argue in favour of it, in various forms, as well as treating the wider issue of drug use as a public health rather than a criminal matter.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T13:00:06.744Z\">at 1.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de5020b8f0831141cc43566\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterwalker\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T12:30:11.396Z\">12.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and will be answering your questions on the Liberal Democrat manifesto today.

This is not an issue that has attracted much attention in the campaign so far, but it deserves some focus because councils provide vital services \u2013 and the gap between what\u2019s on offer from the Tories and Labour is vast.</p> \n  <p>Although the Conservatives claim to be a low-tax party, under their plans it is more likely that council tax would have to rise, the IFS suggests.</p> \n  <p>Here is an excerpt from the briefing, which covers plans for local government funding in England.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The money allocated by the Conservatives would not be sufficient to meet rising costs and demands over the next parliament even if council tax were increased by 4% a year, necessitating a further retrenchment in services or unfunded top-ups to the plans set out.</p> \n   <p>The Labour party has allocated more than enough money to meet rising costs and demands, allowing increases in service provision and quality, although not enough to restore them to 2010 levels. That is true even if council tax were frozen \u2013 although Labour has no plans for such a freeze.</p> \n   <p>The Liberal Democrats have allocated enough money to meet rising costs and demands if council tax is increased by 2% a year \u2013 although only if some the funding earmarked for bus services, youth services or homelessness is used to meet these pressures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Of course, there would be less need for council tax rises under Labour because local authorities would be getting more funding as a result tax increases imposed by Labour elsewhere in the system.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T11:01:57.160Z\">at 11.01am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de4e28f8f08cd6fe586f974\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T10:24:17.975Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon says SNP would want to be included in Brexit talks with EU under Labour</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In her BBC phone-in <strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong>said she would like to see the SNP represented in the talks with the EU that would take place if Labour formed a government and negotiated a new Brexit deal.

Asked if the SNP would want to have someone negotiating alongside Labour on this, Sturgeon replied: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to make sure, in any of these discussions, the interests of the fishing industry were absolutely paramount, and that\u2019s a commitment I would make on behalf of the SNP.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if this meant she wanted \u201csomeone at the table\u201d, she replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think Scotland should be at the table in any of these discussions, all of the time, rather than being shut out by Westminster. And fishing is an example of the particular interests we have that mean that we should be much more represented.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fishing is an awkward topic for the SNP because the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy is hugely unpopular with the Scottish fishing industry, and the Conservatives are fond of arguing that the SNP plan to stay in or rejoin the EU amounts to staying in or rejoining the CFP. </p> \n  <p>Sturgeon said that she wanted to see the CFP \u201cfundamentally changed and reformed\u201d.

Lee, a Tory justice minister from 2016 until he resigned over Brexit in 2018, said Johnson was not being realistic because there weren\u2019t enough prison places for this sort of policy. Lee is now the Lib Dem justice spokesman and the party\u2019s candidate in Wokingham, where he is hoping to unseat the Tory Brexiter John Redwood. </p> \n  <p>Lee told Sky News:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a statement of the obvious, particularly in retrospect, to say that these sorts of people you want to lock up for longer. Of course, and the same applies to child sex offenders. [Boris Johnson] is just pressing buttons. We know this is the Trump playbook. The practical reality is it\u2019s extremely difficult to do that if you haven\u2019t got the prison places. And we never really had enough prison places in all the time I was a justice minister.</p> \n   <p>You can address this by investing in it, investing in the courts, particularly investing in probation, because it\u2019s a cycle \u2013 from police, courts, probation. They\u2019ve all got to be working well if you want to reduce crime, reduce pressure on prison, and be able to lock up the people like Usman Khan for much longer, indeed for ever.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is what Johnson said on Saturday about sentencing after the London Bridge attack.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you are convicted of a serious terrorist offence, there should be a mandatory minimum sentence of 14 years \u2013 and some should never be released.</p> \n   <p>Further, for all terrorism and extremist offences the sentence announced by the judge must be the time actually served \u2013 these criminals must serve every day of their sentence, with no exceptions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>These two polices both go further than what Johnson was proposing in the Conservative published less than a week earlier. In the manifesto, on sentencing, the Tories were just calling for \u201ctougher sentencing for the worst offenders\u201d and an end to automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d4f5e1f6b98a21f012d6a0c0f0488d5b0b02842\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d4f5e1f6b98a21f012d6a0c0f0488d5b0b02842/0_11_3558_2135/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Lee, a former Conservative justice minister and now a Lib Dem candidate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Lee, a former Conservative justice minister and now a Lib Dem candidate.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T09:25:50.039Z\">at 9.25am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de4c9b08f08cd6fe586f8f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T08:38:09.338Z\">8.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The justice secretary, <strong>Robert Buckland</strong>, has reasserted the prime minister\u2019s pledge to implement tougher sentences for prisoners convicted of terrorist or extremism offences. </p> \n  <p>His comments came after the family of one of the victim\u2019s of Friday\u2019s attack near London Bridge asked for their son\u2019s death not to be used for kneejerk political reaction. </p> \n  <p>Speaking to BBC Radio Four\u2019s Today<em> </em>programme, Buckland said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to be very clear-eyed with this type of offender.</p> \n   <p>Public protection and the need to make sure we are safe has to be the number one priority.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us for this evening. My colleague, Andrew Sparrow, has put together a detailed summary of the day\u2019s events: And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, Heather Stewart has this evening\u2019s main politics story: Last week, the former Labour MP Ian Austin called on the party\u2019s traditional voters to back the Conservatives in order to prevent Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. This week, the Tories are seeking to maximise the damage to their rivals by paying for letters from Austin, in which he argues the same, to be sent out to thousands of voters in Labour marginals. Voters from Ipswich, Stroud, Ashfield, Bedford and Cardiff North \u2013 all seats held by Corbyn\u2019s party by fewer than 1,000 votes last time \u2013 have been posting copies of their letters from the ex-junior minister on social media. Speaking to the Press Association this evening, Austin has said: I have made it absolutely clear that Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to lead the Labour party, never mind the country. I have written a letter to that effect. He would not be drawn on how many voters had received the letter, or how the Tories had come to fund it being posted out. Austin told recipients that \u201cno-one\u201d believes Corbyn will deliver Brexit and that Labour\u2019s plans for government would \u201cput businesses, investment and jobs at risk\u201d. I know how hard it is for Labour voters to back the Tories, but at the end of this election, either Boris Johnson will be prime minister \u2013 or Jeremy Corbyn. That\u2019s the choice. And I am worried that if Boris Johnson does not get a majority, the SNP will back Corbyn. It is too big a risk. That is why I think we should lend the Tories our votes and stop Jeremy Corbyn getting anywhere near Downing Street. The strapline at the bottom of the letter states: \u201cPromoted by Alan Mabbutt on behalf of the Conservative and Unionist Party.\u201d Here\u2019s the article we ran last week on Austin\u2019s original comments: Earlier, we reported that the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, had claimed his decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held constituencies was motivated by a desire not to help produce a hung parliament that might allow \u201cthat Swinson girl\u201d near Downing Street; \u201cperfectly pleasant though she is\u201d. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has responded this evening, saying: Nigel Farage is going to discover that I am not always perfectly pleasant. Farage has stood for parliament seven times and every single time the voters have rejected his toxic brand of chauvinistic, far-right nationalism. He knows he is not going to get anywhere nearer to power this election and is so scared that he hasn\u2019t even bothered standing. He is lashing out at the real threat to his Tory-Brexit party electoral pact: the girly swot leading the UK\u2019s strongest remain party. The Liberal Democrats want to stop Brexit and build a brighter future, where everybody\u2019s rights are respected and society is fair and diverse. Boris Johnson has sought to counter claims that he has been opportunistically exploiting the London Bridge terror attack by insisting that he has been calling for longer sentences for serious offenders for years. On what might have been one of the quietest days for campaigning since the election began, Johnson gave interviews this afternoon responding to the charge that has dogged him for the last 48 hours, since he responded to the London Bridge killings by calling for tougher sentences for terrorists. Johnson also claimed that it was clear from the outset that the attacker, Usman Khan, was not suitable for rehabilitation \u2013 even though some reports have said he was seen as a model example of what could be achieved through rehabilitation programmes. In an article for the Guardian published this afternoon, Dave Merritt, whose son Jack was one of the two young prisoner rehabilitation specialists killed in the attack, said Jack would have been furious to see his death being used to justify making penal policy more draconian. Merritt wrote: [Jack] would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that. What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens. That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that. Through us all, Jack marches on. Speaking to reporters shortly before Merritt\u2019s article was published, Johnson said: Of course, I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt\u2019s family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia [Jones], who perished at London Bridge. But, be in no doubt, I\u2019ve campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years. It was in my manifesto in 2012 when I was mayor of London. I said it in August and it\u2019s in the Queen\u2019s speech. In fact, there\u2019s a bill we\u2019ve got ready to go in the Queen\u2019s speech to stop automatic early release for serious and violent offenders. But Johnson was not being wholly candid. The sentencing bill in the Queen\u2019s speech proposed changing the automatic release point from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds of the way through a sentence for people serving sentences of four years or more for a serious violent or sexual offence. The Conservative manifesto, published just five days before the London Bridge attack, effectively just replicated this, proposing \u201ctougher sentencing for the worst offenders\u201d and an end to automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes. But on Saturday, a day after Khan\u2019s attack, Johnson escalated his demands by calling for two measures that went beyond anything previously proposed by his party: mandatory minimum 14-year sentences for serious terrorist offences, and no early release at all for all terrorism and extremism offences. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has claimed that that if the UK were to join the proposed European defence union after Brexit, Nato would collapse. He made the argument in a speech at a rally in north Wales in which he also claimed that EU politicians \u201cwant Nato out of Europe\u201d. Even by the accuracy standards of this general election campaign, Farage\u2019s arguments were particularly improbable. But if this is where Donald Trump is getting his advance briefing before Wednesday\u2019s Nato summit at a hotel near Watford (which is not impossible), that should make for an interesting conversation. Farage has also suggested that Trump might use the summit to insist that America is not interested in buying up the NHS. This would ostensibly help Johnson, who says that the NHS will not be covered by any UK-EU trade deal, and undermine Jeremy Corbyn, who insists that it will be, but given Trump\u2019s standing with the British public, and his reputation for honesty, it is hard to see any declaration like this making much difference either way. Trump has already started his flight to the UK. Before the visit, Corbyn has urged Johnson to break off trade talks with Trump until any reference to pharmaceuticals is struck out of Washington\u2019s negotiating objectives. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a briefing suggesting that council tax in England is more likely to go up under the Conservatives than under Labour. That\u2019s because Labour plans a generous settlement for local government, \u201cmore than enough money to meet rising costs and demands\u201d, even with no rise in council tax bills, while the Tory settlement would not meet rising costs and demands, \u201ceven if council tax were increased by 4% a year\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said the SNP would want to be included in talks with the EU if Labour took power and embarked on its its Brexit renegotiation. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. From the Telegraph\u2019s US editor, Ben Riley-Smith: Boris Johnson has rejected claims that he has been opportunistically exploiting the London Bridge attack. In interviews this afternoon he said that he had been calling for some time for longer sentences for serious offenders, and that the Queen\u2019s speech in October even included a bill on this topic. (See 4.55pm) But the sentencing bill in the Queen\u2019s speech just proposed changing the automatic release point from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds of the way through a sentence for people serving sentences of four years or more for a serious violent or sexual offence. And the Conservative manifesto, published just five days before the London Bridge attack, effectively just replicated this, proposing \u201ctougher sentencing for the worst offenders\u201d and an end to automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes. But now Johnson is proposing new measures: mandatory minimum 14-year sentences for serious terrorist offences, and no early release at all for all terrorism and extremism offences. (See 9.13am.) From LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood In a powerful article for the Guardian Dave Merritt, whose son Jack was killed on Friday in the London Bridge terror attack, has said that Jack would have been furious to see his death being used to justify making penal policy more draconian. Here is an extract: If Jack could comment on his death \u2013 and the tragic incident on Friday 29 November \u2013 he would be livid. We would see him ticking it over in his mind before a word was uttered between us. Jack would understand the political timing with visceral clarity. He would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that. What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens. That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that. Through us all, Jack marches on. And here is the article in full: Boris Johnson has been saying more about the London Bridge attacks this afternoon in interviews with reporters. Here are the main points he has been making. Johnson has rejected claims that he has been opportunistically exploiting the London Bridge attack for political purposes. Dave Merritt, whose son Jack was one of the two young prisoner rehabilitation specialists killed in the attack, has urged politicians not to use the attack as a pretext to introduce more draconian penal policies. Without referring directly to Merritt\u2019s comments, Johnson responded by stressing that his commitment to longer sentences for serious offenders was longstanding. He said: Of course, I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt\u2019s family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia [Jones], who perished at London Bridge. But, be in no doubt, I\u2019ve campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years. It was in my manifesto in 2012 when I was mayor of London. I said it in August and it\u2019s in the Queen\u2019s speech. In fact, there\u2019s a bill we\u2019ve got ready to go in the Queen\u2019s speech to stop automatic early release for serious and violent offenders. And I do think, unfortunately, that is the problem that we face. We have too many people who are released automatically on to our streets and we need to address that. Johnson claimed it was \u201cpretty obvious\u201d that the killer, Usman Khan, was not suitable for early release. Asked whether someone like Khan could ever be de-radicalised, he said: That is a very profound question and there is an issue there that we need to talk about frankly as a society and when we look at some of the problems that we come across in trying to de-radicalise people, we have to face the grim reality that in some cases it is really very difficult. I think this was one of those cases and, alas, I think it also was pretty obvious from the kinds of things he was saying and continued to say that he was not really a suitable candidate for automatic early release. Yet under the law as it stood when he was sentenced, that was the 2008 legal system, there was no parole board, no probation system, there was no means of reviewing his release - he was just sprung automatically. He also claimed that it was clear from the outset that Khan was not suitable for rehabilitation. There are unquestionably some cases which are just too tough to crack and alas [Khan] appears to have been one of them, and I\u2019m afraid it was probably clear from the outset that that would be so. Johnson criticised the appeal court\u2019s decision to reduce Khan\u2019s sentence. He said: I think any impartial assessment of the situation would concede that [Khan] was sentenced to a period in prison \u2013 16 years plus five years on licence \u2013 and then was subject to automatic early release having served eight years altogether. And I don\u2019t think that was long enough in view of the gravity of his offence \u2013 which was to conspire to blow up the stock exchange and to cause other types of mayhem \u2013 and in view of the view that was taken of him by the initial sentencing judge, Judge Wilkie, and looking at what the judge had to say about him it\u2019s clear he was viewed as a very serious threat. Welfare cuts were necessary to avoid mass unemployment during the austerity era, Jackson Carlaw, the interim Scottish Conservative leader, has said. On a BBC Radio Scotland phone-in, asked to explain why food bank use had gone up so much while the Conservatives had been in power, Carlaw replied: During the course of the recession, when the priority was to try to ensure we kept as many people in work, we froze the level at which earnings were able to rise, some benefits were frozen during that period as well. We managed to avoid the crisis in poverty and pain that would have come from mass unemployment. We are putting in place the actions to allow the cap and the freeze on benefits to be removed and to give people more money. Carlaw argued the country was \u201cnow at the end of that period of austerity\u201d and he said the Conservatives were now planning changes to the welfare system. He said: We need to be less draconian, frankly, in some of the assessment criteria that there have been for people during this period and the manifesto commits to reducing all of that. It also commits to reducing the penalty that will be imposed for any kind of abuse of benefits because I think [they] also \u2013 through the sometimes-inadvertent actions of people \u2013 have been deeply unfair. The Tory manifesto does commit the party to reducing the number of reassessments a disabled person must go through when claiming benefits, if a change in their condition is unlikely. But the manifesto does not say anything specific about reducing the sanctions imposed on people who abuse the benefits system. I\u2019ve asked the Scottish Conservatives to clarify what Carlaw was referring to when he raised this point in the phone-in, and I will post the reply when I get one. UPDATE: A Tory source says, when Carlaw spoke about the penalty being reduced for benefits abuse, he was just referring to the manifesto commitment to reduce the number of assessments disabled people need to undergo. Phillip Lee, the former Tory justice minister who is now a Lib Dem candidate and justice spokesman for new party, has intensified his criticism of Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the London Bridge terror attack. Expanding on what he told Sky News this morning (see 9.13am), Lee told PA Media: The desperate, sort of, politicisation of this by Boris Johnson \u2013 not a man who is known for details \u2013 wading into something which is actually quite complex is not appropriate. Particularly so shortly after the terrible loss of life of these two young people. Asked if he believed Johnson had tried to use the aftermath of the attack for political advantage in the election, Lee said: No, I think he knew that he was vulnerable on it, so he got out ahead of it. But the problem is, like he\u2019s been doing on virtually every issue, he has been misleading and lying in the process. Lee said the issues raised by the case of Usman Khan were complex. Everybody, right-minded people, want to see people like Usman Khan locked up and kept away from broader society, but to do that you have got to have the prison places, you have got to have the capacity to make the right decisions. This has long been a problem. We do need sentencing reform. We do need to make prison a place for serious criminals and people with violent intent like Usman Khan. To do so, though, you have got to have the police, the courts and probation services working well, and we are not there yet. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, has claimed there could be a swing of undecided voters toward his party. Speaking to PA Media, he said that polling should be taken \u201cwith a pinch of salt\u201d. He went on: There\u2019s a technical point about polls, they don\u2019t record undecided or \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019, so there\u2019s a potential skewing of results coming from polls which doesn\u2019t reflect where people are. I\u2019m still knocking on doors where people haven\u2019t made their mind up yet. Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, has said that her party\u2019s voice is heard \u201cloud and clear\u201d at Westminster despite the fact that the party does not take its seats in the Commons. Speaking at the Sinn F\u00e9in manifesto launch in Derry, she said: The farce of a notion that you go into the house of chaos at Westminster and even your wits with Jacob Rees-Mogg as he reclines on the green benches and snoozes off is fanciful. It is also a little dishonest - I don\u2019t think we should be misleading people in this election because the stakes are very high. McDonald argued that her party\u2019s \u201crelentless representation\u201d had been heard in Dublin, Brussels and Washington and helped inform the EU\u2019s negotiating stance on Brexit. The voice of the north has been heard loud and clear, never more loudly I would say, not only heard it has been heeded, it has been acted on. McDonald also rejected suggestions that Irish MPs could go to Westminster and stop Brexit. Pointing to the DUP\u2019\u2019s record, she said: That matter has been decided by the English public and will be decided and shaped in the first instance by their elected representatives. On the subject of Nigel Farage and the NHS (see 1.16pm), this is from Labour\u2019s Richard Burgon, who debated with Farage in the seven-party ITV debate last night. The truth has become a \u201cdisposable commodity\u201d in this election, Naomi Long, leader of the Alliance party in Northern Ireland, has claimed. Long, who is a candidate in East Belfast, said this is the first election where she has felt that truth is being treated as opinion. I have fought other elections where there have been smear campaigns, misinformation campaigns, leaflets campaigns, but this is the first election campaign I have fought where I have really felt it is as though truth is a disposable commodity. People will openly say things that are patently untrue. I am not talking about spin, I am talking about not true, and the response to that is, \u2018sure they all do that\u2019, and that worries me because to me that is a much deeper problem in society, not just in politics. If we start to treat truth as if it\u2019s just opinion then we lose any sense of right and wrong, of good and bad, of who you can trust and who you can\u2019t trust \u2013 it\u2019s not all a matter of opinion, some things are still a matter of fact. I think that it started with this whole idea we are all tired of experts ... if I\u2019m unwell I want an expert, if I\u2019m sick and I go to the hospital I don\u2019t want to see my plumber scrubbing up to do my surgery. Thanks for all your questions Next up will be the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks. She will be answering any questions you may have about the SNP at 12.30pm on Wednesday. You can ask your question via our form here. Q: There are quite a few claims that the manifesto talks about all cars becoming electric with 80% renewable energy. However, political parties are scarce on describing how they will meet this claim. What is the strategy for green energy research, application and electric car infrastructure implementation? Jordan Bizzell, 24, architectural assistant, London On the subject of renewable energy, the party does have some ambitious plans to shift to more sustainable sources, as well as energy-saving measures such as home insulation. It\u2019s arguably not as ambitious as the Labour \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d plan, let alone that of the Greens (who came up with the green new deal concept), and credibility for such programmes can be debated. One issue is that it is sometimes hard to tell how well new energy mixes will work before they\u2019re in place. For example, there was huge scepticism in the past about the cost and reliability of wind power \u2026 until wind power ended up being cheaper and more reliable than many said. The party says all new cars should be electric by 2030, but also wants to invest more in public transport and active travel (walking and cycling, that is). E-car infrastructure is a tricky business in general, not least for people who don\u2019t have driveways and need on-street charging. Entirely off the subject of the Lib Dems and on to my own interests, it\u2019s worth noting that while e-cars are, of course, much better than, say, diesel ones, they don\u2019t solve lots of other issues such as congestion, road danger, health issues from inactive lifestyles and so on. They don\u2019t even solve all pollution problems, given new research into the problems caused by particulates from tyre and brake wear. But I digress. Q: What is the thinking behind \u2018help to rent\u2019? Wouldn\u2019t it just make renters such as myself poorer and more burdened with debt? Wouldn\u2019t it be cheaper to limit the size of deposits? Nathaniel McKenzie, 26, publisher, London On the assumption you mean the \u201crent to own\u201d idea, this seems to be an idea to help people be able to buy a home \u2013 but only if they want to. This would be for social housing, letting people who cannot afford to raise a deposit to buy a property instead buy their social home over 30 years, by letting their rent payments gradually pay off the cost of the home. This is, of course, in part a long-term help-to-buy scheme, which would deplete the stock of social housing, But the party says it would build at least 100,000 new social rent homes every year. In an interview with Paul Waugh for HuffPost UK, Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, said that leave-voting seats in the north of England and the Midlands were Labour\u2019s \u201cachilles heel\u201d at this election. Many people in these areas were not yet sure how to vote, he said. Our achilles heel is in our communities, in what\u2019s known as our heartlands, that voted leave and are not quite sure yet whether they will give their vote to Labour. If we can engage people listening to what\u2019s on offer, what type of Britain and country we want as we go into the future, then we are on a winner. It\u2019s very much a question of how we do that, whilst at the same time tackling the very real issues we\u2019ve got over Brexit and with Jeremy in some places. McCluskey said that, if Labour were to form a government and negotiate a new version of Brexit, Unite could hold a special conference to decide whether it would back the deal, instead of backing remain as it did in 2016. A strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn, McCluskey also acknowledged that his leadership was an issue for some voters. But he suggested that the media and disloyal Labour MPs were largely responsible for this being a problem. He explained: Since Jeremy was elected four years ago, he has been consistently [attacked] in a way that I\u2019ve never experienced before. I\u2019m a huge fan of Tony Benn\u2019s and Tony used to get some terrible media. But there has been nothing quite like the vicious campaign against Jeremy Corbyn on every subject that the media could try to ascribe some blame to him. He\u2019s been slaughtered personally, in a way that a weaker man would have collapsed by now, but he\u2019s strong enough. He\u2019s been betrayed by many of his own MPs, in a way that has been difficult to understand. The one thing that we know about the public is they don\u2019t like any divisions in any political party. So of course the whole issue of Jeremy becomes an issue within any election campaign. Just under 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the Lib Dem manifesto. Send them in to us here. Q: Why are there so many ads which misrepresent the proportion of votes the Lib Dems received in the previous GE? I have seen multiple examples of Lab/Con marginals where the Lib Dems are trying to make people believe it\u2019s actually a Lib Dem/Con marginal when in fact a Labour voter switching to Lib Dems will make a hard Brexit more likely. It makes me distrust the party. Matthew, Oxford The Lib Dems have something of a reputation for sharp-elbowed practices in elections, and a particular notoriety for bar charts with very dubious scales. When I went out campaigning with Luciana Berger in Finchley and Golders Green she was at pains to show off the scale of the chart on her leaflets, saying it had been \u201cmeasured to the nearest millimetre\u201d. One confusion can be that the Lib Dems use various polls or election results. So, in Finchley and Golders Green, while the Lib Dems were a distant third in the 2017 election behind the Tories and Labour, Berger\u2019s chart showed a recent constituency poll which put her in second. It was a legitimate poll, so that seems fair enough. Other tactics are more dubious, for example citing council or European results as evidence the Lib Dems can win in an area. And the party has been criticised for other tricks \u2013 for example printing fake \u201cnewspapers\u201d that look a lot like the genuine local paper. Q: Hi, I can find nothing in the Liberal Democrat manifesto about fishing and CFP reform. Do they actually have a policy on this? Thanks. Alastair S. Edwards, 48, music and English teacher, near Jablonec nad Nisou in the Czech Republic You\u2019re right - there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in there. The party\u2019s manifesto for the European elections in May also doesn\u2019t mention it. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t add much, as I\u2019ve never heard any senior Lib Dem people discuss the issue. So I\u2019m not much help here. Q: Introducing a written constitution for a federal United Kingdom sounds very radical, why am I not hearing more about it? How would they achieve that? Jason, 28, edit assistant, London The party has long been a champion of constitutional reform, most obviously through its longstanding support for a proportional voting system. The party\u2019s manifesto promises all sorts of changes such as Commons constituencies for overseas voters (MP for the south of France could be popular), giving 16- and 17-year-olds the vote, and making the Lords democratic. Some elements are, however, a bit vague, not least the plan for \u201ca written constitution for a federal United Kingdom\u201d. This would, of course, involve changing centuries of precedent and would keep constitutional experts in work for years. How would they do that? I\u2019m afraid your guess is as good as mine. At the Brexit party event, Nigel Farage, the party leader, also described the Labour claim that the NHS would be sold off to the Americans under a UK-US trade deal as \u201cthe biggest lie of this election\u201d. He said that he hoped Donald Trump would deny this during his visit to the UK for this week\u2019s Nato conference. He said: I really hope Trump says: \u2018America has no interest in buying up the National Health Service, it will not happen.\u2019 Farage claimed that he had no influence over what Trump would say, but he has a good relationship with the Trump White House and it did sound as if he expected Trump to make an intervention along these lines later this week. You have been sending in your questions about the Lib Dem manifesto which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: How exactly can they revoke article 50? I\u2019d like someone to explain how they can legally overturn article 50 and the impact it could have on future government decisions. Suzi, manual labour worker in a warehouse, West Yorkshire If desired, the UK could revoke article 50 but doing nothing more than writing a letter to the European council. In 2018, the European court of justice confirmed this could be done unilaterally. In legal terms, this is a very specific issue so would seem to have no bearing on future governments. Politically it would be viewed with dismay by some voters. But the Lib Dems argue that since they would only do this in the (extremely unlikely) event of the party winning an absolute majority in parliament, this would be a mandate from the people. And constitutionally they are quite correct. Whether it was tactically a good idea to promise this, as a \u201cmore remain than you\u201d sign to distance the party from Labour, remains to be seen. Some senior Lib Dems are not 100% happy with it. Q: How will the Lib Dems fight for UK citizens in Europe, especially retirees. Patrick Markby, nearly 70, retired chef, Montpellier, France They would say that the best way to do that would be to stop Brexit altogether, and let the status quo continue for UK nationals living in the rest of the EU. The Lib Dems have not, as yet, got into what policies they would seek to mitigate the impact of Brexit on people like you. For electoral reasons they don\u2019t really want to discuss a preferred sort of departure, as their overwhelming election message is to cancel the whole thing. So I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t really add much. Q: What are the strongest and the weakest parts of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 message? Laird Taylor, Victoria, Canada If you asked ten Lib Dem activists, you might well get 10 \u2013 or at least six or seven \u2013 different answers. They have bet the house on tempting over large numbers of remain-minded Tory and Labour voters with an overwhelming anti-Brexit focus. The other key element has been a near-presidential spotlight on Jo Swinson (the party\u2019s two battlebuses both carry the slogan, \u201cJo Swinson\u2019s Liberal Democrats\u201d). Both these could be strengths ... but given the way the party has slipped gradually in the polls, they have not been so far. One strength could be the revised central message to urge voters to vote tactically and help Lib Dems defeat Tory candidates in some seats and thus deprive Boris Johnson of a majority. With the Conservatives strongly ahead in the polls, and Johnson a highly divisive character, that could resonate. Here is the main point from Nigel Farage\u2019s speech at the Brexit party rally in Buckley in North Wales. Farage claimed that if the UK were to join the proposed European defence union after Brexit, Nato would collapse. He claimed that the UK faced a binary choice, between Nato and the European defence union, and he claimed that Boris Johnson was refusing to say which he preferred. He claimed that the Europeans wanted Nato out of Europe. He said: They [the Europeans] are not just talking about building their European defence union; they are talking about flexing their muscles around the world. I find that very alarming talk. What is clear, what is absolutely clear, is they want Nato out of Europe. That\u2019s what the politicians in Brussels want. Farage went on to say that Johnson had to make a choice. No man effectively can serve both; Nato and a European defence union cannot co-exist equally. And I would say that in a world where there are some major serious threats, we need that military relationship with America today as much as we have ever needed it. And Farage said that, if the UK were to choose the European option, Nato would collapse. If we leave the European defence union, it becomes valueless. Because without [the UK], it doesn\u2019t have the muscle that it needs. But if we stay, don\u2019t be surprised if Nato falls to pieces and we leave the security and protection that America had for us, thank god, twice in the last century. This is a relatively new argument from Farage - although it is founded on several questionable assumptions. First, the European defence union does not actually exist yet. It is an aspiration, and EU countries are moving closer to the idea, but it does not exist yet in the form that Farage implies. This Commons briefing paper (pdf) contains more detail. Second, it is just not true to say that Europeans \u201cwant Nato out of Europe\u201d. Some EU leaders have reservations about Nato, but there are many countries were it is still seen as an essential protection. Third, where European do have reservations about Nato, it is not so much because they have lost faith in the concept of collective security; it is more to do with the fact that, with Farage\u2019s ally Donald Trump in the White House, there are real concerns that the US is a less reliable ally than it once was. And, fourth, it is not inevitable that Nato could not co-exist with a European defence union. The Americans want the Europeans to invest more in defence, and so arguably, if the EU were to have its own defence capability, Nato would be more secure, not less. Some of your questions so far have been about the Gender Recognition Act and the legalisation of cannabis: Q: Does the Lib Dem manifesto have anything to say about the Gender Recognition Act? Does it want people who self-identify as the opposite sex to be able to obtain a gender recognition certificate and therefore a new birth certificate? Jane, London The manifesto says this on the issue, in its section on equality: \u201cComplete reform of the Gender Recognition Act to remove the requirement for medical reports, scrap the fee and recognise non-binary gender identities.\u201d In truth, I\u2019ve not covered this area of the manifesto, or talked to any Lib Dems about this, so I don\u2019t know a whole lot more than this. In my defence, the manifesto is 96 pages long. Q: Are the Lib Dems 100% banning fracking? I want to know this as Jo Swinson has voted in favour of fracking in the past, which I believe is despicable. Jules, Cornwall Their manifesto is unequivocal on this. On its sections about a green economy four, \u201cpriorities for a first parliament\u201d. One says: \u201cInvesting in renewable power so that at least 80% of UK electricity is generated from renewables by 2030 \u2013 and banning fracking for good.\u201d More generally, Swinson has been keen to try and distance herself from decisions taken under the 2010-15 coalition, when she held a series of junior ministerial roles. It\u2019s up to voters to decide on this. Q: What are the implications of the legalising cannabis proposal? How popular is it and what do medical professionals say? Michael, 50s, manager in the charity sector, St Albans That\u2019s arguably a bit outside the remit of this chat, but it\u2019s worth noting that the Lib Dems have advocated drug decriminalisation in earlier elections. The costings document for the current manifesto shows the party would expect revenues of almost \u00a31.5bn a year in duties on cannabis and savings on law enforcement. More widely, you can \u2013 and people do \u2013 argue endlessly about drug decriminalisation, but there are plenty of experts, and doctors, who argue in favour of it, in various forms, as well as treating the wider issue of drug use as a public health rather than a criminal matter. I\u2019m Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the Guardian, and will be answering your questions on the Liberal Democrat manifesto today. I have spent much of this election campaign following the party around, including trips on both their battle buses. I have been covering politics since just after the Brexit referendum, and previously wrote about national and international news. Before joining the Guardian I worked for various other organisations, including Agence France-Presse, where I was based in Beijing, Hong Kong and Paris. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Nigel Farage is now taking questions. Asked about his decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Tory-held constituencies, he says he did not want to take the risk of a hung parliament and putting \u201cthat Swinson girl\u201d anywhere near power. Farage says it is wrong for Labour to say President Trump poses a threat to the EU. He says it was Labour that extended privatisation in the NHS, leading to the spread of superbugs in hospitals because cleaning services had been privatised, he says. And that\u2019s it. Farage has finished his speech. Farage says Donald Trump is arriving in the UK today. He says the UK can share its secrets with America and other countries in the \u201cfive eyes\u201d alliance. He says the UK is a very significant part of Nato. He says Emmanuel Macron, the French president, called Nato \u201cbrain dead\u201d. And the EU wants to build a defence union, and flex its muscles around the world. The Europeans want Nato out of Europe, he claims. He says he keeps asking if Boris Johnson wants the UK out of the EU defence union. But the UK cannot serve both the EU defence union and Nato, he says. He says, if the UK leaves the EU defence union, it will become valueless. It won\u2019t have the muscle it needs. But if the UK stays a member, that will undermine Nato, he claims. Nigel Farage is still speaking at the Brexit party event. He says leavers may like Boris Johnson. They might be related to one of his many children, Farage says. He then suggests he should not have said that. But leavers should vote for the Brexit party, he says, to ensure that they get the Brexit they voted for.

Today, Peter Walker, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will answer your questions about the Liberal Democrat manifesto. You can ask your question via our form here. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is now speaking at the Brexit party event in north Wales. There is a live feed here. Farage says he appeared in the seven-party ITV debate last night. He says it was a competition to see who could appear the most virtuous. He says the other people in the debate were a \u201cbunch of robots\u201d. Their answers were pre-prepared, he says. And even their final statements; Farage complains that his rivals had scripted their final statements before the debate was over. He says the London Bridge attack should be a cause for concern. But it should also be a matter of concern that there are 74 convicted terrorists free on the streets, and another 400 people at large who went to fight for Islamic State. Farage says jihadists should be locked up for life. And here is some more from the Institute for Fiscal Studies briefing on the election promises and local government funding. (See 10.51am.) Council funding in England has fallen by 24% per head since 2009-10, the IFS says. It explains: Our first annual report on local government funding, published earlier this month, found that budgeted revenues to cover day-to-day spending in 2019\u201320 will be approximately 18% lower in real-terms than in 2009\u201310. After accounting for population growth, that equates to cuts of 24% per resident. Council funding in the most deprived areas has fallen by even more, the IFS says. It explains: Cuts have varied significantly across the country though \u2013 and have been larger in more deprived areas. As a result, councils\u2019 spending on local services has fallen around 31% in the most deprived areas, on average, compared to 16% in the least deprived areas. However, spending is still around 1.3 times higher in the most deprived areas as in the least deprived areas, down from 1.6 times back in 2009\u201310. The Conservative plan to ensure that people do not have to sell their home to pay for their social care could discriminate against renters and people who have moved to a smaller home, the IFS says. It argues: The fallout in the last election might also explain something the Conservatives did say: that housing would not be counted in means-tests, so that no one has to sell their house in order to pay for the cost of their care, even after they die. Whether this is even a step towards fixing the system is debatable though, as it could mean unfair differences between people who hold more of their wealth in their house and those who hold more of it in financial assets \u2013 such as those who have traded down, or have been renting. It could also cost several billion pounds, which is unaccounted for. All three main parties have unfunded commitments on adult social care spending, the IFS says, \u201csuggesting this will be an important and potentially problematic issue whoever forms the next government\u201d. From my colleague Kate Proctor, who is covering a Brexit party event in north Wales Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Sadiq Khan, the major of London, are paying tribute to the victims of the London Bridge attack at a vigil this morning. This is from Sky\u2019s Jason Farrell. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a briefing on the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for local government funding. This is not an issue that has attracted much attention in the campaign so far, but it deserves some focus because councils provide vital services \u2013 and the gap between what\u2019s on offer from the Tories and Labour is vast. Although the Conservatives claim to be a low-tax party, under their plans it is more likely that council tax would have to rise, the IFS suggests. Here is an excerpt from the briefing, which covers plans for local government funding in England. The money allocated by the Conservatives would not be sufficient to meet rising costs and demands over the next parliament even if council tax were increased by 4% a year, necessitating a further retrenchment in services or unfunded top-ups to the plans set out. The Labour party has allocated more than enough money to meet rising costs and demands, allowing increases in service provision and quality, although not enough to restore them to 2010 levels. That is true even if council tax were frozen \u2013 although Labour has no plans for such a freeze. The Liberal Democrats have allocated enough money to meet rising costs and demands if council tax is increased by 2% a year \u2013 although only if some the funding earmarked for bus services, youth services or homelessness is used to meet these pressures. Of course, there would be less need for council tax rises under Labour because local authorities would be getting more funding as a result tax increases imposed by Labour elsewhere in the system. In her BBC phone-in Nicola Sturgeon said she would like to see the SNP represented in the talks with the EU that would take place if Labour formed a government and negotiated a new Brexit deal. This issue came up in response to a question about fishing. Asked if the SNP would want to have someone negotiating alongside Labour on this, Sturgeon replied: I want to make sure, in any of these discussions, the interests of the fishing industry were absolutely paramount, and that\u2019s a commitment I would make on behalf of the SNP. When asked if this meant she wanted \u201csomeone at the table\u201d, she replied: I think Scotland should be at the table in any of these discussions, all of the time, rather than being shut out by Westminster. And fishing is an example of the particular interests we have that mean that we should be much more represented. Fishing is an awkward topic for the SNP because the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy is hugely unpopular with the Scottish fishing industry, and the Conservatives are fond of arguing that the SNP plan to stay in or rejoin the EU amounts to staying in or rejoining the CFP. Sturgeon said that she wanted to see the CFP \u201cfundamentally changed and reformed\u201d. But she also argued that the Conservatives were misleading fishermen in implying that after Brexit they would get everything they wanted. Access to UK waters for EU fishermen would end up being part of the overall trade negotiation, she suggested. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, has been going a phone-in on Radio 5 Live and BBC News. Asked how she would vote if she live in England in a Labour/Lib Dem marginal, she at first replied that she could not say. She did not like either of them, she said: I\u2019m not a fan of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party. A Labour party right now, given everything the Tories are doing to this county, should be streets ahead ... I\u2019ve got real issues with the Lib Dems\u2019 previous coalition with the Tories. Jo Swinson vote for austerity, welfare cuts, the bedroom tax. So I\u2019d have real difficulty [voting Lib Dem]. But she concluded saying she would urge people to vote tactically to keep the Tories out. What I would say is, if you\u2019re in a constituency where the Tories hold it just now, or the Tories have got any chance of holding it, vote for the party that is best placed to get rid of the Tories, or keep the Tories out. Survation has released a new poll overnight. Confirming an impression given by some of the polls in the Sunday papers, it suggests that the Conservative lead over Labour is narrowing slightly - although the Conservatives are still well ahead. As you all know, these figures are not necessarily a reliable guide to the election result \u2013 although they are not necessarily wrong either. Anthony Wells at UK Polling Report has a good summary of the Sunday newspaper polling here. Here is the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith on the Tory argument that the last Labour government was soft on terrorism. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Amy Walker. Here is the full quote from Phillip Lee earlier (see 8.20am) about Boris Johnson\u2019s call for longer jail sentences for terrorists following the London Bridge attack on Friday. Lee, a Tory justice minister from 2016 until he resigned over Brexit in 2018, said Johnson was not being realistic because there weren\u2019t enough prison places for this sort of policy. Lee is now the Lib Dem justice spokesman and the party\u2019s candidate in Wokingham, where he is hoping to unseat the Tory Brexiter John Redwood. Lee told Sky News: It\u2019s a statement of the obvious, particularly in retrospect, to say that these sorts of people you want to lock up for longer. Of course, and the same applies to child sex offenders. [Boris Johnson] is just pressing buttons. We know this is the Trump playbook. The practical reality is it\u2019s extremely difficult to do that if you haven\u2019t got the prison places. And we never really had enough prison places in all the time I was a justice minister. You can address this by investing in it, investing in the courts, particularly investing in probation, because it\u2019s a cycle \u2013 from police, courts, probation. They\u2019ve all got to be working well if you want to reduce crime, reduce pressure on prison, and be able to lock up the people like Usman Khan for much longer, indeed for ever. This is what Johnson said on Saturday about sentencing after the London Bridge attack. If you are convicted of a serious terrorist offence, there should be a mandatory minimum sentence of 14 years \u2013 and some should never be released. Further, for all terrorism and extremist offences the sentence announced by the judge must be the time actually served \u2013 these criminals must serve every day of their sentence, with no exceptions. These two polices both go further than what Johnson was proposing in the Conservative published less than a week earlier. In the manifesto, on sentencing, the Tories were just calling for \u201ctougher sentencing for the worst offenders\u201d and an end to automatic halfway release from prison for serious crimes. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has reasserted the prime minister\u2019s pledge to implement tougher sentences for prisoners convicted of terrorist or extremism offences. His comments came after the family of one of the victim\u2019s of Friday\u2019s attack near London Bridge asked for their son\u2019s death not to be used for kneejerk political reaction. Speaking to BBC Radio Four\u2019s Today programme, Buckland said: We have to be very clear-eyed with this type of offender. Public protection and the need to make sure we are safe has to be the number one priority. The prime minister was right to say he wants us to look again at the sentencing of terrorism offences and to make sure that they are as effective as possible. More criticism is being directed at the government\u2019s own policies, after Boris Johnson tried to blame Labour for the release of a terrorist who stabbed two people to death on Friday. The Lib Dem justice spokesman, Dr Phillip Lee, who served as a justice minister in Theresa May\u2019s government, accused the prime minister of taking from the \u201cTrump playbook\u201d, adding that Conservative plans to extend prison sentences would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d to put into practice because of a lack of prison spaces. \u201cWe never really had enough prison places in all the time I was a justice minister,\u201d the former Conservative MP told Kay Burley on Sky News\u2019 flagship breakfast show. Lee argued that investment in police, the courts and probation had \u201call got to be working well\u201d in order to bolster the criminal justice system so that we are \u201cable to lock up people like Usman Khan for much longer, indeed forever\u201d. Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has been talking to BBC Radio 5 Live this morning, after the party announced plans to cut rail fares. Asked to justify plans to use funds from vehicle excise duty that had formerly been earmarked for road-building to subsidise cheaper rail fares, McDonald said: \u201cYou cannot road-build your way out of a climate crisis.\u201d He added that concerns over the environmental emergency \u201cis what will be delivering my thinking if I\u2019m going to take over at the Department for Transport\u201d. The proposal would immediately reduce the price of season tickets and other regulated fares by a third, as well as simplifying the ticketing system across the country, according to Labour. Morning, Amy Walker here, I\u2019ll be taking over the politics liveblog for the next hour or so. Nick Hardwick, the former head of the Parole Board, has criticised government changes to the criminal justice system after the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan was released from prison under licence. \u201cThe cuts and reorganisations of the prisons and probation service have made them much less able to do their jobs and keep the rest of us safe,\u201d Hardwick told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe\u2019ve neglected the criminal justice system for too long and now the chickens are coming home to roost.\u201d The comments came after Boris Johnson was criticised on Sunday for his attempt to turn the attack into an election issue, blaming Labour for Khan\u2019s early release. Hardwick described what he called \u201csilly political point-scoring\u201d as \u201cdeeply disrespectful to the family and friends of the people who were killed\u201d. He also argued that \u201cday-to-day engagement\u201d was needed to help rehabilitate prisoners. He added: \u201cSimply addressing policing, simply addressing sentencing won\u2019t work, it\u2019s a pipeline.\u201d Vigil to be held in London for London Bridge victims PA Media reports a vigil will be held to pay tribute to the victims killed in the London Bridge terror attack and to honour the emergency services and members of the public who responded to the incident. Former University of Cambridge students Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25, were fatally stabbed by 28-year-old convicted terrorist Usman Khan in Friday\u2019s attack. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, will be among those due to gather at 11am on Monday at a remembrance service at Guildhall Yard, where Londoners will be able to lay flowers. It comes as West Midlands police said a 34-year-old man arrested in Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts had been recalled to prison due to a suspected breach of his licence conditions. What\u2019s happening today: Labour has announced what it is billing as the biggest ever plan to cut rail fares, promising to immediately reduce the price of season tickets by a third. Jeremy Corbyn will be in London to talk rail policies. Boris Johnson will be in the south of England before he heads to a rally in the east of England. The Lib Dem justice spokesman, Phillip Lee, will be in London to talk about mental health initiatives. Nigel Farage will campaign in North Wales. Nicola Sturgeon will visit Lockerbie, where she will warn that rural Scotland is among the areas most at risk from a bad Brexit deal. Sinn F\u00e9in will launch its manifesto in Derry. Ukip will launch its manifesto in London. And a new political ad from the Conservatives last night. In light of the plea from Jack Merritt\u2019s family that his death not be used for political ends, there are some interesting front pages today. David Merritt, the father of the man killed in the attack, has taken issue with the front pages of the Mail and Express, urging them not to use his son\u2019s death \u201cto promote your vile propaganda\u201d. And, in very different coverage, here\u2019s the front page of today\u2019s Cambridge News, which is the paper from the town that Merritt and the other victim Saskia Jones studied and lived. Good morning and welcome to the first day of the last full week of the election campaign. We\u2019re in the home stretch now, folks. Yesterday was a big day for politicians being controversial on TV. Boris Johnson was accused of using his extended sit-down with Andrew Marr to make the London Bridge attacks political, by laying the blame for the release of the attacker at Labour\u2019s feet, despite pleas from the family of one of the victims not to exploit victims\u2019 deaths. Meanwhile, party leaders attacked the prime minister for his closeness to Donald Trump in a seven-way TV debate on the eve of the US president\u2019s visit to the UK for a Nato summit. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru all expressed concern about Johnson\u2019s relationship with Trump, with Nicola Sturgeon saying he should \u201csup with a very long spoon\u201d when dealing with the president. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, was applauded for a speech condemning Trump for his comments on women and religious minorities, while Richard Burgon, Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary, accused Trump and Johnson of \u201cconspiring\u201d together. Swinson said: It seems like there\u2019s three people in the special relationship. Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. We obviously have a hugely important relationship with the US. But make no mistake, the current occupant of the White House is not somebody who shares our values. This is someone who has boasted about sexually assaulting women, whose policies are discriminatory against people from different religious backgrounds and is separating parents from their children at the border. And we should be very careful with that relationship. The last thing we should have done is roll out the red carpet for a state visit. We\u2019ll be bringing you the political news throughout the day and into the night, thanks for reading along. You can reach me on Twitter here, get in touch with any comments, questions, jokes, before I hand over the blog to my colleague in the next hour or so.",

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s a good question for Larry Fink, the BlackRock billionaire, to address when he dispatches his lofty annual \u201cdear CEO\u201d letter in the new year. Is his firm guilty of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d? In other words, is the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, with an astonishing $7tn of assets under its roof, posing as a pioneer of climate activism while actually dragging its feet?</p> <p>The accusation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/directors-climate-disclosures-tci-hedge-fund\">was made by Sir Christopher Hohn</a>, another fund management billionaire. His hedge fund, TCI, is warning companies to improve their disclosures on carbon emissions and actions to reduce pollution, or face votes against the re-election of directors. But his pointed criticism of BlackRock was almost as significant. Hohn said out loud what others say in private: that Fink\u2019s declared environmental concerns are not matched on the ground by BlackRock\u2019s fund managers.</p> <p>Naturally, BlackRock disputes the characterisation, saying it has \u201cengaged\u201d with 370 companies on \u201cclimate risks\u201d in the past two years and arguing it makes the issue one of its \u201ctop five priorities\u201d. The firm points out that it was a founder member of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and sent letters to more than 100 of the most carbon-intensive companies last year.</p> <p>Yet the accusation is not that BlackRock is doing nothing. It\u2019s a question of how hard the firm is pushing. One can certainly understand why Hohn could view BlackRock\u2019s voting record on climate-related resolutions as \u201cappalling\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dde5e4d4-140f-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385\">as he put it to the FT</a>.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a good question for Larry Fink, the BlackRock billionaire, to address when he dispatches his lofty annual \u201cdear CEO\u201d letter in the new year. Is his firm guilty of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d? In other words, is the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, with an astonishing $7tn of assets under its roof, posing as a pioneer of climate activism while actually dragging its feet? The accusation was made by Sir Christopher Hohn, another fund management billionaire. His hedge fund, TCI, is warning companies to improve their disclosures on carbon emissions and actions to reduce pollution, or face votes against the re-election of directors. But his pointed criticism of BlackRock was almost as significant. Hohn said out loud what others say in private: that Fink\u2019s declared environmental concerns are not matched on the ground by BlackRock\u2019s fund managers. Naturally, BlackRock disputes the characterisation, saying it has \u201cengaged\u201d with 370 companies on \u201cclimate risks\u201d in the past two years and arguing it makes the issue one of its \u201ctop five priorities\u201d. The firm points out that it was a founder member of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and sent letters to more than 100 of the most carbon-intensive companies last year. Yet the accusation is not that BlackRock is doing nothing. It\u2019s a question of how hard the firm is pushing. One can certainly understand why Hohn could view BlackRock\u2019s voting record on climate-related resolutions as \u201cappalling\u201d, as he put it to the FT. InfluenceMap and ShareAction, two research groups, agreed in recent reports that Fink\u2019s firm backs only about 10% of climate-related resolutions tabled by shareholders, whereas big European names such as Legal &amp; General and UBS are in the 80%-90% range. BlackRock would protest that you can\u2019t judge a fund manager solely by its record. But, even on regular day-to-day dealings with companies, fingers are being pointed. This territory is hard to measure since \u201cengagement\u201d means conversations with corporate managements that take place behind closed doors but InfluenceMap looked at what fund managers say themselves. It concluded that, among the world\u2019s top 15 asset managers only Allianz, L&amp;G and UBS \u201cstrongly and consistently\u201d try to change business models in line with Paris Agreement targets. BlackRock, as well as fellow US giants Vanguard and State Street, was deemed to be in the slow camp of managers that call on companies to consider climate risks but \u201cdo not drive behaviour change around climate models or policy lobbying\u201d. Fink may still feel that BlackRock\u2019s reputation as a laggard is unfair. If so, he has the ideal platform to address the accusation of soft-pedalling. His letter to fellow chief executives generates acres of coverage every year and, if he wishes to issue a blistering call for corporations to act faster to tackle the climate emergency, he is free to do so.

Jack Merritt, 25, coordinator for Cambridge University\u2019s Learning Together initiative, which brings together offenders and those in higher education \u201cto study alongside each other\u201d, was stabbed to death by convicted terrorist Usman Khan on Friday, alongside 23-year-old Saskia Jones. In a powerful piece published in the Guardian on Monday, Dave Merritt tackled head on Johnson\u2019s response to the attack that took his son\u2019s life, writing: \u201cHe [Jack] would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against.\u201d Reacting to the article, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cThis morning I had the honour of meeting some of Jack\u2019s friends. They were in total shock about the loss of Jack, who was clearly a compassionate and principled young man. \u201cEverything I hear about him, from his friends and this powerful and humane article from his father David, shows his determination to confront hate and injustice in our society and help bring communities together. \u201cWe must learn from this tragedy and in Jack\u2019s memory, protect people from these terrorist horrors but also build a world of greater peace and understanding.\u201d The article prompted a wave of support on social media, with many hailing Merritt\u2019s bravery in the face of losing his son. And it increased the pressure on Johnson over his response to the attack, after he was widely criticised by experts and on social media for appearing to blame Labour for the killings. In the aftermath of the attack, which also injured three others, Johnson moved to blame sentencing regimes and automatic early release laws for the tragic incident. Johnson used a lengthy interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show to accuse Labour of responsibility for the early release of Khan and to pledge that serious offenders would not be released early in the future. On Monday, before the publication of Dave Merritt\u2019s article, Johnson insisted he felt \u201ca huge amount of sympathy\u201d for the bereaved families. But amid growing criticism of his stance, he added that he had been right to argue that the previous government\u2019s decisions were to blame, saying: \u201cI think any impartial assessment of the situation would concede that he was sentenced to a period in prison \u2013 16 years, plus five years on licence \u2013 and then was subject to automatic early release having served eight years altogether. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that was long enough in view of the gravity of his offence \u2013 which was to conspire to blow up the Stock Exchange and to cause other types of mayhem \u2013 and in view of the view that was taken of him by the initial sentencing judge, Judge Wilkie, and looking at what the judge had to say about him, it\u2019s clear he was viewed as a very serious threat.\u201d Ed Davey, the deputy Liberal Democrat leader, accused Johnson of failing to understand the reasons for the attack. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s distasteful attempt to politicise a national tragedy is compounded by the fact he didn\u2019t bother to properly understand the events that led to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of a pattern of behaviour, not concerning himself with the details and displaying total disregard for the families and victims involved.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 3 December. Top stories Mark Zuckerberg has defended Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing false ads, comparing the alternative to censorship. Challenged on CBS over the policy, Zuckerberg refused to commit to any changes and was unmoved when Gayle King, co-host of CBS This Morning, pointed out that 200 Facebook employees had written a letter asking Zuckerberg to reconsider as \u201cfree speech and paid speech are not the same\u201d. Zuckerberg responded, \u201cAt the end of the day, I just think that in a democracy, people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d Google and YouTube have meanwhile pulled hundreds of ads for Donald Trump over the last few months. A review of the tech companies\u2019 advertising archive found at least 300 Trump ads had been pulled from the platforms. Jeremy Corbyn has urged Boris Johnson to break off trade talks with Donald Trump until any reference to pharmaceuticals is struck from Washington\u2019s negotiating objectives. As the US president prepared to fly in on Monday evening to attend the Nato summit alongside other world leaders, the UK Labour leader wrote to the British prime minister to urge him to give fresh reassurances about NHS privatisation. Offshore detention costs Australian taxpayers as much as $573,000 per person each year, according to a report from advocacy groups released as the independent senator Jacqui Lambie weighed up whether to support the repeal of medevac laws. This figure, from the At What Cost report, is on top of the $9bn spent on offshore processing and onshore mandatory detention between 2016 and 2020, showed in analysis of government figures undertaken for a report by Equity Economics. Australia The former prime minister Tony Abbott has been filmed leaving the Melbourne prison where the convicted paedophile Cardinal George Pell is being held, with the former Coalition leader saying he was there \u201cvisiting a friend\u201d. Abbott was filmed leaving the Melbourne Assessment Prison on Monday morning by a Seven News crew, but refused to confirm exactly who in the jail he was visiting. The American author Naomi Wolf has accused Australia\u2019s embattled energy minister, Angus Taylor, of an \u201cantisemitic dogwhistle\u201d, and of falsely claiming they were at Oxford University together. Labor has raised concerns that a new round of government drought grants could be politically exploited, as parliament\u2019s audit committee agrees to examine the Coalition\u2019s troubled regional jobs and investment scheme. Journalist Tracey Spicer has accused three women of defamation after part one of her three-part documentary series Silent No More, about sexual assault and violence, was aired on the ABC. The world Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre has asked the public to stand by her. Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked as a teenager to have sex with friends of Jeffrey Epstein, including Prince Andrew, has implored the public to \u201cnot accept this as OK\u201d in her first UK television interview. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign will no longer issue press credentials to reporters for Bloomberg News \u2013 the agency owned by Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg. Hot weather increases the risk of early childbirth, which in turn is linked to worse health and developmental outcomes for children, a major new study has found. The report could have fresh implications for the impact of the climate emergency on human health. Recommended reads The father of Jack Merritt, who died on Friday at London Bridge, writes that the attack has been used to reinforce the worldview his son fought against. \u201cIf Jack could comment on his death \u2013 and the tragic incident on Friday 29 November \u2013 he would be livid. We would see him ticking it over in his mind before a word was uttered between us. Jack would understand the political timing with visceral clarity. He would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that. What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens.\u201d \u201cWhen faced with weak economic growth, the government\u2019s response has been to argue about the \u2018the fundamentals\u2019 and use the words of the governor of the RBA in July that they \u2018are strong\u2019,\u201d writes Greg Jericho. \u201cThe prime minister suggested three times in September that the fundamentals are strong. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has watered it down a little of late, telling Ross Greenwood on Melbourne Cup day that \u2018the fundamentals of the economy are sound\u2019 and Steve Price on 20 November that the fundamentals are \u2018in a pretty good place\u2019. All in all you would think things are going along swimmingly. So let\u2019s have a look at some of the fundamentals.\u2019\u201d Listen The Guardian takes you inside one woman\u2019s mission to create an army of Greta Thunbergs. Melanie Harwood is an education entrepreneur and self-styled \u201cdisruptor\u201d, who has partnered with the United Nations to educate teachers and their students about climate change. Richard Sprenger joined her on a trip to Dubai, to witness her unorthodox approach first hand. Cook \u201cDon\u2019t be put off this glorious salad if you\u2019ve never butterflied a prawn: you\u2019ll soon get the hang of it and it\u2019s a neat skill to have up your sleeve. Serve with steamed rice and maybe some stir-fried Asian greens.\u201d Yotam Ottolenghi has 10 recipes perfect for the Australian summer, including giant prawns with grapefruit salad and fenugreek creme fraiche; fennel salad with pistachios and oven-dried grapes; and barbecue lamb tacos with pineapple pickle and chutney. Sport \u201cI\u2019ve finally come from behind to win a major. I know I can do that now,\u201d Tiger Woods tells Ewan Murray. \u201cWoods may not seem one for looking back but he has now revealed he has finally watched a rerun of that Augusta triumph in the company of his caddie, Joe LaCava, with a key recollection being a fear of failure mid-championship.\u201d Lewis Hamilton would be a major asset to Ferrari, according to the team\u2019s young driver Charles Leclerc. His comments came after Hamilton refused to rule out a move to the Scuderia and Ferrari gave a complimentary reaction on his availability to join them in 2021.

Coming up The NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission public hearings into the strip-search of young people at an underage music festival continues in Sydney. Federal parliament continues its last week of sittings for the year. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 The Danish artist Tal R has won an injunction against a pair of Faroese art provocateurs who wanted to cut up one of his paintings and use the canvas to make decorative faces for their line of designer wristwatches. Dann Thorleifsson and Arne Leivsgard, who five years ago founded the watch company Kankse, had purchased Paris Chic, one of Tal R\u2019s brightly coloured Sexshops series, for \u00a370,000 (AU$132,900) at the Victoria Miro Gallery in London in August.

He allows others to escape to adjacent rooms.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe has about a one-minute one-on-one straight combat,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cThis guy, we now know by the name of Khan, he works his way up \u0141ukasz\u2019s pole, slashing with his knife. He [\u0141ukasz] takes five wounds to his left side.\u201d</p> \n<p>Khan hacked into \u0141ukasz\u2019s arm, Williamson said, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s hurt badly but doesn\u2019t flinch for a minute.\u201d</p> \n<p>By Williamson\u2019s account, \u0141ukasz bought time for two delegates to get involved, one of them understood to be Marc Conway, an ex-offender at the conference.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey come and join the fight and it\u2019s pretty gruesome,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cI think the terrorist decided he was outnumbered. He runs for it. He goes down the main staircase and the next bit of hell is at reception. He can\u2019t get out the front door.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur guy called Gareth, who is the reception doorman, is pushing the door shut as good as he can so that Dawn, a yard behind, can get on the telephones, hit the alarms \u2013 exactly as her training has told her to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was a \u201cgreat showdown in the entrance hall\u201d involving Andy, a maintenance man, \u201ca Ministry of Defence ex-policeman and pretty cool customer\u201d, who had to weigh up whether to let Khan out on to the street.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe makes exactly the right choice,\u201d said Williamson. \u201cThe doors opened.

Khan was pulled to the ground as one man sprayed him with a fire extinguisher.</p> \n<p>\u201cI saw that he had a knife in each hand so I decided to stamp on his left wrist as hard as I could to try to free one of the knives off as it appeared to be taped to his hand,\u201d said Gray. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe only thing that we heard from the suspect was \u2018get off of me\u2019. The overall resounding message from the chaps involved was that it\u2019s not going to happen. We just kind of held him there and did what we could until the police arrived. I grew up on rugby and the mentality, be that on the pitch or off the pitch, is it\u2019s one in, it\u2019s all in.</p> \n<p>\u201cI saw that something was going on, so originally, before even knowing what the incident was, I wanted to separate the incident and make sure someone wasn\u2019t getting beaten to a pulp. While I was there and then realised what was going on, I was kind of like, \u2018I can\u2019t run away now, I\u2019ve got to stick it out and help out as best I can.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/archive-zip/giv-3902kLwPXV8AQtr6/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/archive-zip/giv-3902kLwPXV8AQtr6/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>With armed City of London police officers on the scene, Khan was surrounded.

Other members of the public also joined the fray, including Thomas Gray, 24, a Mini driver for a tour based on the film The Italian Job. Khan was pulled to the ground as one man sprayed him with a fire extinguisher. \u201cI saw that he had a knife in each hand so I decided to stamp on his left wrist as hard as I could to try to free one of the knives off as it appeared to be taped to his hand,\u201d said Gray. \u201cThe only thing that we heard from the suspect was \u2018get off of me\u2019. The overall resounding message from the chaps involved was that it\u2019s not going to happen. We just kind of held him there and did what we could until the police arrived. I grew up on rugby and the mentality, be that on the pitch or off the pitch, is it\u2019s one in, it\u2019s all in. \u201cI saw that something was going on, so originally, before even knowing what the incident was, I wanted to separate the incident and make sure someone wasn\u2019t getting beaten to a pulp. While I was there and then realised what was going on, I was kind of like, \u2018I can\u2019t run away now, I\u2019ve got to stick it out and help out as best I can.\u2019\u201d With armed City of London police officers on the scene, Khan was surrounded. One police officer could be heard shouting: \u201cHe\u2019s got a bomb, mind your backs!\u201d The men quickly stepped back and the officer shouted at Khan: \u201cDo not move!\u201d Within moments, the attack ended when officers opened fire, onlookers hearing multiple shots. Shortly afterwards Bain, by now well away from the scene, took a moment to compose a tweet: \u201cBomber is dead. Shot by London special forces. Another killed. Two injured. Evacuating to a survivors\u2019 center. I\u2019m ok. Be grateful for every day.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>They arrived in dribs and drabs \u2013 like sleeper agents converging on a dead letter drop \u2013 from all corners of a small public garden in central London. A few spoke to one another, the rest rather kept their distance until their handlers arrived with yellow clipboards. This could have been the most clandestine meeting of Lib Dems Anonymous.</p> <p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Jo. I\u2019m a Lib Dem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi Jo. Would you like to share something with us?\u201d</p> <p>After several awkward silences, there was a flurry of excitement as a man with film star good looks appeared. Closely followed by the actor, Hugh Grant. If Chuka Umunna fails in his bid to win the Cities of London and Westminster seat, formerly held by Mark \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/mark-field-suspended-as-minister-after-grabbing-climate-protester-by-neck\">grab a female protester by the neck</a>\u201d Field, then he has a lucrative career ahead of him as a catalogue model. Something that at the moment appears all too possible as Umunna is currently polling eight points behind the new Tory candidate, the former leader of Westminster council. Clearly the local residents have warmed to the prospect of the woman who has done most to cut their local public services.</p> <p>This hasn\u2019t been the best of campaigns for the Lib Dems. They started off bullishly insisting they could win more than 100 seats. But their \u201crevoke article 50\u201d declaration, combined with their insistence that Jo Swinson would be the next prime minister, went down spectacularly badly with the public and they are now down to damage limitation. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/02/hugh-grant-i-want-to-do-my-bit-to-prevent-a-national-catastrophe\">Which is where Hugh comes in</a>. Taking time out from playing a prime minister the country happened to like in Love Actually \u2013 not to mention a Lib Dem leader, Jeremy Thorpe, who was lucky not to get sent down in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/a-very-english-scandal-review-funny-and-confident-like-jeremy-thorpe\">A Very English Scandal </a>\u2013 the actor has downgraded himself to political activist.</p> <p>The introductions were made by the Lib Dem mayoral candidate, Siobhan Benita, who said she would do her best not to swoon over the presence of a Hollywood star. </p> <p>Hugh raised an eyebrow and looked as if he\u2019d rather be elsewhere. As if he was fed up with being objectified for his body. How come no one fancied him for his mind? Hell, anyone would have been outwitted by Paddington Bear. There was no disgrace in that. The burden of having come close to being a national treasure weighs heavily on him. He is not an actor who outwardly seems to enjoy his success.</p> <p>But Grant is nothing if not professional and right on cue he delivered his lines. He didn\u2019t want to be dramatic \u2013 pause \u2013 though obviously that was his job, but the country was facing a national emergency. The Conservatives had been hijacked by the far right. So he was stepping forward to do what he could by campaigning for candidates in marginal seats where there was a chance of stopping the Tories from winning. He wasn\u2019t particularly wild about the Lib Dems \u2013 though he was fond of \u201cChooka\u201d \u2013 but needs must to get a hung parliament and the chance of a second referendum.</p> <p>Umunna wasn\u2019t at all bothered that Hugh would be off campaigning for Labour on Wednesday. Rather he was just grateful for his support for even a couple of hours on a bleak December afternoon. Umunna never looks rattled by anything, but he knows he and the Lib Dems are now in the last chance saloon. The situation is desperate. </p> <p>Twice he admitted he was down to trying to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and that his only hope was a massive surge in tactical voting. There is a new pragmatism to Umunna. First we take Westminster, then we take Boden.</p> <p>There followed a somewhat awkward huddle. Grant has no great fondness for the media \u2013 since 2011 he has been one of the leading campaigners for Hacked Off \u2013 and he remains well-guarded in any interactions with journalists. So this one was kept short and sweet. No small talk. Nothing too personal. Nothing that could be construed as a sign of weakness or used against him. </p> <p>Yes, he had considered a career in politics but concluded he was too old and too pleased with himself to follow a party line. Yes, he would be prepared to pay more tax. If not always cheerfully. Unlike some newspaper owners, he had never been a non-dom.</p> <p>The closest we got to ersatz romcom intimacy was the admission that he had once been a door-to-door fire extinguisher salesman. Was he any good? \u201cI was actually,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI also sold coat hanger covers.\u201d Highly flammable ones, presumably, so he could include them in a two-for-one offer with the fire extinguishers.</p> <p>And that was it. End of. Grant and Umunna were off to go canvassing and I wasn\u2019t welcome to join them. Voters might get too much of a surprise if there were journalists present. Though obviously they wouldn\u2019t bat an eyelid to find a film and TV star on their doorstep.</p> <p>It was all rather low-key. Though it had been that kind of a day. After a weekend spent trying to make political capital out of the London Bridge terror attack, a dishevelled Boris Johnson and an unusually well-groomed Jeremy Corbyn had restricted their public appearances to attending a vigil for the victims. The lull before the storm. Later that night Donald Trump would arrive for the Nato conference. Then almost anything could happen.</p> <p><em>John Crace\u2019s new book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/decline-and-fail-9781783351930.html\">Decline and Fail: Read in Case of Political Apocalypse</a>, is published by Guardian Faber.

      "bodyText": "They arrived in dribs and drabs \u2013 like sleeper agents converging on a dead letter drop \u2013 from all corners of a small public garden in central London. A few spoke to one another, the rest rather kept their distance until their handlers arrived with yellow clipboards. This could have been the most clandestine meeting of Lib Dems Anonymous. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Jo. I\u2019m a Lib Dem.\u201d \u201cHi Jo. Would you like to share something with us?\u201d After several awkward silences, there was a flurry of excitement as a man with film star good looks appeared. Closely followed by the actor, Hugh Grant. If Chuka Umunna fails in his bid to win the Cities of London and Westminster seat, formerly held by Mark \u201cgrab a female protester by the neck\u201d Field, then he has a lucrative career ahead of him as a catalogue model. Something that at the moment appears all too possible as Umunna is currently polling eight points behind the new Tory candidate, the former leader of Westminster council. Clearly the local residents have warmed to the prospect of the woman who has done most to cut their local public services. This hasn\u2019t been the best of campaigns for the Lib Dems. They started off bullishly insisting they could win more than 100 seats. But their \u201crevoke article 50\u201d declaration, combined with their insistence that Jo Swinson would be the next prime minister, went down spectacularly badly with the public and they are now down to damage limitation. Which is where Hugh comes in. Taking time out from playing a prime minister the country happened to like in Love Actually \u2013 not to mention a Lib Dem leader, Jeremy Thorpe, who was lucky not to get sent down in A Very English Scandal \u2013 the actor has downgraded himself to political activist. The introductions were made by the Lib Dem mayoral candidate, Siobhan Benita, who said she would do her best not to swoon over the presence of a Hollywood star. Hugh raised an eyebrow and looked as if he\u2019d rather be elsewhere. As if he was fed up with being objectified for his body. How come no one fancied him for his mind? Hell, anyone would have been outwitted by Paddington Bear. There was no disgrace in that. The burden of having come close to being a national treasure weighs heavily on him. He is not an actor who outwardly seems to enjoy his success. But Grant is nothing if not professional and right on cue he delivered his lines. He didn\u2019t want to be dramatic \u2013 pause \u2013 though obviously that was his job, but the country was facing a national emergency. The Conservatives had been hijacked by the far right. So he was stepping forward to do what he could by campaigning for candidates in marginal seats where there was a chance of stopping the Tories from winning. He wasn\u2019t particularly wild about the Lib Dems \u2013 though he was fond of \u201cChooka\u201d \u2013 but needs must to get a hung parliament and the chance of a second referendum. Umunna wasn\u2019t at all bothered that Hugh would be off campaigning for Labour on Wednesday. Rather he was just grateful for his support for even a couple of hours on a bleak December afternoon. Umunna never looks rattled by anything, but he knows he and the Lib Dems are now in the last chance saloon. The situation is desperate. Twice he admitted he was down to trying to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and that his only hope was a massive surge in tactical voting. There is a new pragmatism to Umunna. First we take Westminster, then we take Boden. There followed a somewhat awkward huddle. Grant has no great fondness for the media \u2013 since 2011 he has been one of the leading campaigners for Hacked Off \u2013 and he remains well-guarded in any interactions with journalists. So this one was kept short and sweet. No small talk. Nothing too personal. Nothing that could be construed as a sign of weakness or used against him. Yes, he had considered a career in politics but concluded he was too old and too pleased with himself to follow a party line. Yes, he would be prepared to pay more tax. If not always cheerfully. Unlike some newspaper owners, he had never been a non-dom. The closest we got to ersatz romcom intimacy was the admission that he had once been a door-to-door fire extinguisher salesman. Was he any good? \u201cI was actually,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI also sold coat hanger covers.\u201d Highly flammable ones, presumably, so he could include them in a two-for-one offer with the fire extinguishers. And that was it. End of. Grant and Umunna were off to go canvassing and I wasn\u2019t welcome to join them. Voters might get too much of a surprise if there were journalists present. Though obviously they wouldn\u2019t bat an eyelid to find a film and TV star on their doorstep. It was all rather low-key. Though it had been that kind of a day. After a weekend spent trying to make political capital out of the London Bridge terror attack, a dishevelled Boris Johnson and an unusually well-groomed Jeremy Corbyn had restricted their public appearances to attending a vigil for the victims. The lull before the storm. Later that night Donald Trump would arrive for the Nato conference. Then almost anything could happen.

Here\u2019s the full draw in alphabetical order. Port Vale\u2019s president John Rudge, no stranger to a shock himself - his team beat Spurs once, from memory - is talking of the Manchester City tie.

Tony Adams has rather dressed down for this occasion, though his jacket does look a tad velvety, though might actually be brushed corduroy. He is promoting this scheme for the third round. Before the draw, we are treated to the traditional sight of Ronnie Radford smashing it in v Newcastle for Hereford United. Craig Elliott, boss of Boston United, has his sights on Rochdale, who his team must beat to reach the next round. Dave Challinor, the long throw king, is manager of Hartlepool and has to beat Exeter. Eastleigh\u2019s chief exec Mick Budny, hope his team can get past Crewe Alex. Jim Bentley, manager of AFC Fylde, is up for the Cup. He is an Evertonian and wants the Toffees in the draw.

After the first and second round shook out all but a handful of non-league teams, true giant-killers are in short supply but there is a big payday out there for one or two lower-division clubs.

      "bodyText": "Melania Trump suspects Roger Stone, a longtime ally and adviser to Donald Trump, of being behind the release of nude photos from her modelling past, a new book claims. In the book, Free, Melania, CNN correspondent Kate Bennett also writes that the first lady \u201cstill refuses to believe\u201d her husband played a role in the release. Bennett also adds to reports that the president and first lady keep separate bedrooms at the White House. Free, Melania: The Unauthorised Biography will be published on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy. In statements to the Guardian, Stone denied Bennett\u2019s claim while the White House poured scorn on her book. The pictures, from a 1996 photoshoot and published by a French magazine the following year, found their way into the New York Post on 30 July 2016, three months out from election day and as Donald Trump was embroiled in an ugly spat with the family of Capt Humayun Khan, a US soldier killed in Iraq in 2004. At the time, Stone had no formal role with the Trump campaign, having left it in August 2015. But he remained close to Trump, himself a past master in using his personal life to generate tabloid publicity, often as a means of distraction. \u201cThe theory goes,\u201d Bennett writes, \u201cthat Trump was trying to head off a bad week on the campaign.\u201d Stone has had a bad month. In mid-November, he was found guilty of obstructing the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He is now awaiting sentencing. Trump heads into the 2020 election under the shadow of an impeachment inquiry related to his conduct in foreign policy. He also faces the prospect of prosecution when he leaves office, regarding a range of potential offences, among them pay-offs to a porn star and a Playboy model who claim to have slept with him while he was married to Melania. He denies the affairs but the payments have been confirmed, and Trump allegedly played a direct role in them. \u201cThis time,\u201d Bennett writes of the release of the photos, \u201cthe idea that [Trump] would throw his naked wife under the bus was almost so gross and salacious, and the photos so B-movie bad, the press ultimately spent very little time discussing them. \u201cMelania has not commented on how she thinks they got into the hands of the tabloid and on to the cover, but friends say she still refuses to believe Trump would do that to her. As for Stone, she\u2019s not so sure.\u201d In a statement emailed to the Guardian, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said: \u201cMrs Trump is surprised at Kate Bennett\u2019s reporting.

      "bodyText": "More than half of hospitals have opened extra beds to help them cope with the NHS winter crisis amid an influx of patients with potentially fatal breathing problems. Many of the so-called escalation beds are already occupied by people suffering from flu, pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbated by the arrival of very cold weather in many parts of the UK. The British Thoracic Society (BTS), which represents specialist lung doctors and nurses, has found that 52% of UK hospitals have already created extra bed capacity to help them prepare for the imminent surge in winter demand. In addition, almost half (48%) have kept open and are still using the overflow beds they created last winter, in a sign that the sustained pressure the NHS is under is not confined to December, January and February. \u201cAs the winter season starts, life is already really tough at the coal-face of the NHS,\u201d said Prof Jon Bennett, the chair of the BTS. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the intense year-round pressure that the NHS is under that more than half of hospitals have already opened extra \u2018winter beds\u2019 to help them cope with the cold season \u2013 and that many haven\u2019t closed them from last year. \u201cWe are already hearing of rising numbers of people being admitted to hospital with potentially fatal lung and breathing problems who require specialist support. \u201c[While] an under-resourced NHS lung workforce is working tirelessly to provide the best possible care in the circumstances \u2026 we just can\u2019t carry on like this long term.\u201d The findings, which are from a survey of 69 senior doctors who report on lung care services in hospitals, reflect the situation in the whole NHS, he said. Meanwhile, one of the country\u2019s leading NHS experts has warned that flu, Brexit, the general election and the doctors\u2019 pensions dispute are set to combine to create a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of pressures this winter. \u201cIn recent years the NHS has defied the odds and somehow managed to cope despite warnings about the impact of winter pressures. This time it is heading into what is likely to be the worst winter since modern records began in the eye of a perfect storm,\u201d said Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King\u2019s Fund thinktank, in a new blog. \u201cThe NHS is heading into winter in unusually bad shape\u201d because it has not had any respite from an unusually busy summer and also because ministers have provided no extra money for winter pressures, he added. \u201cMost clinicians I speak to are anxious about the prospects of the punishing early and severe flu season in Australia\u201d \u2013 which resulted in the largest number of confirmed flu cases there for a decade, he said. The Guardian disclosed last week that hospitals in England have the smallest number of beds available on record. NHS England admitted recently that bed occupancy figures in July, August and September were the worst for the time of year since records began. Last month Northampton general hospital \u201creluctantly\u201d cancelled unspecified numbers of planned, non-urgent operations over the next few months to help it cope with winter. Other NHs trusts are likely to follow suit, in order to keep enough beds open for patients who need to be admitted over coming weeks because they have fallen and broken a limb or developed a serious breathing problem. NHS trusts and NHS England have taken unprecedented steps to minimise the disruption winter will bring by rolling out the biggest-ever flu vaccination programme, freeing up beds occupied by those who are fit enough to go home and improving the 111 telephone advice service. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cOur doctors, nurses and other staff are pulling out all the stops to look after more and more people, and a particular increase in patients who are older and have more complex illnesses. \u201cWhile hospitals will continue to open more beds as needed over the coming weeks, the public also have a role to play going into winter, and can help NHS staff by getting their flu jab if they\u2019re eligible, talking to a pharmacist for expert advice about winter bugs before they get worse, or using the NHS 111 phone or online service if they need medical help fast but aren\u2019t sure what to do.\u201d",

The remaining paragraphs outline plans to help frackers by countering the public\u2019s rising public opposition to the industry with a government-led campaign to develop a \u201cpro-shale narrative\u201d. The report, written in 2016, was finally released after an information tribunal ruled that it would be in the public interest to disclose its findings. Greenpeace has fought a long legal battle with the government over the suppression of the document. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK\u2019s head of politics, said: \u201cLooking at this black wall of redacted pages, people will be wondering why there\u2019s so little the government is willing to reveal about fracking and so much it wants to hide. \u201cIf ministers have really dropped their support for this polluting industry, why not publish this report in full and come clean about what\u2019s been going on behind closed doors for years?\u201d The report\u2019s unredacted paragraphs said that the government was \u201calready undertaking crucial work on communications to increase public acceptability of shale\u201d and promised further government help to develop a \u201cpro-shale national/regional narrative\u201d and \u201cshale champions\u201d.

The report was released to Unearthed, the investigations arm of Greenpeace, after a lengthy battle between the campaigners and the Cabinet Office. Greenpeace uncovered some of the report\u2019s findings last year through a Freedom of Information (FoI) request but the campaigners were barred by Cabinet Office officials from obtaining the full report. The FoI found that the shale gas industry was unlikely to achieve the exaggerated economic benefits promised by its proponents due to strong local opposition to fracking, with only 4% of the UK\u2019s potential shale projects likely to go ahead in the face of strong opposition. Ken Cronin of UK Onshore Oil and Gas said the case for UK shale gas development \u201cis stronger than ever\u201d because the UK is relying more heavily on gas from Qatar and Russia. \u201cThis report plainly shows that there is still a lot of work left for us to do, which is what our members will be focusing on in the coming months,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The US will take action on greenhouse gases and engage with other countries on the climate emergency despite Donald Trump\u2019s rejection of international cooperation, a delegation from the US Congress has told the UN climate conference in Madrid. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, struck a defiant stance on Monday, declaring: \u201cCongress\u2019s commitment to action on the climate crisis is iron-clad. This is a matter of public health, of clean air, of clean water, of our children, of the survival of our economies, of the prosperity of the world, of national security, justice and equality. We now must deliver deeper cuts in emissions.\u201d Her rallying call came as developing countries accused the US president of \u201cecocide\u201d and the UN secretary-general said the world\u2019s biggest emitters were falling behind. Ministers and officials from more than 190 countries gathered in Madrid on Monday for the start of two weeks of talks aimed at ironing out technical details of the 2015 Paris agreement, which needs to be completed for nations to focus on the progress on cutting carbon emissions. \u201cWe are outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris agreement,\u201d Lois Young, Belize\u2019s permanent representative to the UN and chair of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, told the conference. \u201cIn the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide.

Activists and campaigners assembled inside the conference and outside, but there was a lack of the pageantry and passion that have characterised recent COPs, galvanised by the signing of the Paris accord in 2016, seen as paving the way to international cooperation and preventing dangerous temperature rises. Progress since then has been slow, and emissions have continued to rise while most countries have failed to propose the tougher targets needed to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement. Meanwhile, scientific warnings have grown more urgent and extreme weather events have struck home the dangers of climate chaos. Several countries have also elected leaders hostile to the Paris accord and action on emissions, including Australia, Brazil and the US. Trump deposited the legal instruments needed to formally withdraw from the Paris agreement last month, which will take effect next November. But the US will continue to have a seat at the table of UN climate negotiations, as he has not withdrawn from the foundational treaty, called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Pelosi and other members of the US congressional delegation \u2013 which has no formal role at the talks \u2013 also played down perceptions of a rift between more leftwing Democrats who favour a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d that would eliminate emissions from 2030, and those behind a bill that would legislate for net zero carbon by 2050.

This fact on its own makes it a credit to all those involved, and particularly to the environmental charity, Possible (previously called 10:10 Climate Action), that came up with the idea. The enormous challenge of global heating is not easily compressed into campaign soundbites, or even into manifestos. The changes required are global as well as national, and will take more than five years to implement. But the phrase made famous by the novelist Primo Levi \u201cIf not now, when?\u201d, quoted by the Green party co-leader, Si\u00e2n Berry, was apt.</p> <p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">warning from the UN\u2019s top scientists</a>, that the window of opportunity for action to prevent catastrophic heating is shrinking, focused minds. It led to an unprecedented upsurge in grassroots environmental activism around the world. Last Thursday\u2019s debate provided an opportunity for UK voters to see whether, and to what extent, the messages from scientists and protesters have been absorbed.</p> <p>If the Greens treat every election as a \u201cclimate election\u201d, the emphasis on the environment in Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto is both unprecedented and overdue. Campaigners were disappointed that the target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, endorsed at this year\u2019s party conference, was dropped. But Labour\u2019s programme has been scored above the Liberal Democrat and SNP manifestos <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/climate-debate-party-manifestos-climate-change-nature-2/\" title=\"\">by environmentalists</a>. All are far more ambitious than Conservative plans.</p> <p>Perhaps inevitably, the urgency and power of the overall theme of climate emergency faltered, during the Channel 4 debate as in other contexts, when it came to the technical details of rival schemes to retrofit homes and tackle aviation pollution. But seeing the party leaders answer these questions directly, rather than leaving them to more junior colleagues, was important. So was the refusal of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to take part. In a Conservative campaign that has been characterised by dishonesty and bad faith, turning down Channel 4\u2019s invitation and then, at the last minute, trying to bounce the broadcaster into accepting Michael Gove as a stand-in, is a stunt for which Mr Johnson\u2019s party deserves to be punished at the ballot box.</p> <p>Climate change, and how to deal with it, is one of the biggest foreign policy challenges of the next government\u2019s term and the next decade. A hard Brexit might see the UK trying to secure a deal with the US, which has ruled out any <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2019/11/27/brexit-leak-jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson/\" title=\"\">reference</a> to climate change in trade talks. The US\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, which is expected to be enacted the day after next year\u2019s presidential election (unless it is cancelled by a different president), is a moment to be dreaded. The danger that faltering efforts at international cooperation will collapse altogether, to be replaced by a grim battle over diminishing global resources, is real. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\" title=\"\">round of UN climate talks</a> that have just opened in Madrid is a precursor to the showdown to come in Glasgow in a year\u2019s time, when countries (with or without the US) must fulfil their Paris treaty obligations by committing to binding targets for emissions cuts.</p> <p>With Brexit and the NHS higher up most voters\u2019 list of priorities than the environment, the number of people who will factor the prospect of such negotiations into their choice next week is likely to be small. The big picture of rising emissions and multilateral failures does not sit easily with ambitious promises of a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d at home. But as the polls gently narrow, the extent to which climate science has been absorbed into Labour\u2019s programme is a reason to hope for any result other than a victory for Mr Johnson. His refusal to debate a defining and existential issue of our time is yet more evidence that he is unfit to hold the office of prime minister.</p>",

If the Greens treat every election as a \u201cclimate election\u201d, the emphasis on the environment in Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto is both unprecedented and overdue. Campaigners were disappointed that the target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, endorsed at this year\u2019s party conference, was dropped. But Labour\u2019s programme has been scored above the Liberal Democrat and SNP manifestos by environmentalists. All are far more ambitious than Conservative plans. Perhaps inevitably, the urgency and power of the overall theme of climate emergency faltered, during the Channel 4 debate as in other contexts, when it came to the technical details of rival schemes to retrofit homes and tackle aviation pollution. But seeing the party leaders answer these questions directly, rather than leaving them to more junior colleagues, was important. So was the refusal of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to take part. In a Conservative campaign that has been characterised by dishonesty and bad faith, turning down Channel 4\u2019s invitation and then, at the last minute, trying to bounce the broadcaster into accepting Michael Gove as a stand-in, is a stunt for which Mr Johnson\u2019s party deserves to be punished at the ballot box. Climate change, and how to deal with it, is one of the biggest foreign policy challenges of the next government\u2019s term and the next decade. A hard Brexit might see the UK trying to secure a deal with the US, which has ruled out any reference to climate change in trade talks. The US\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, which is expected to be enacted the day after next year\u2019s presidential election (unless it is cancelled by a different president), is a moment to be dreaded. The danger that faltering efforts at international cooperation will collapse altogether, to be replaced by a grim battle over diminishing global resources, is real. The round of UN climate talks that have just opened in Madrid is a precursor to the showdown to come in Glasgow in a year\u2019s time, when countries (with or without the US) must fulfil their Paris treaty obligations by committing to binding targets for emissions cuts. With Brexit and the NHS higher up most voters\u2019 list of priorities than the environment, the number of people who will factor the prospect of such negotiations into their choice next week is likely to be small. The big picture of rising emissions and multilateral failures does not sit easily with ambitious promises of a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d at home. But as the polls gently narrow, the extent to which climate science has been absorbed into Labour\u2019s programme is a reason to hope for any result other than a victory for Mr Johnson. His refusal to debate a defining and existential issue of our time is yet more evidence that he is unfit to hold the office of prime minister.",

      "body": "<h2>Johnson accused of exploiting London Bridge terror deaths</h2> <p>Boris Johnson has sought to disprove claims that he has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/02/justice-secretary-denies-prison-cuts-risk-terrorism-london-bridge\">opportunistically exploiting</a> the London Bridge terror attack by insisting that he has been calling for longer sentences for serious offenders for years. On what might have been one of the quietest days for campaigning since the election began,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/02/general-election-swinson-condemns-johnson-over-trump-friendship-ahead-of-london-visit-live?page=with:block-5de535c58f0831141cc437de#block-5de535c58f0831141cc437de\"> Johnson gave interviews</a> responding to the charge that has dogged him for the last 48 hours, since he responded to the killings by calling for tougher sentences for terrorists. Johnson claimed it was clear from the outset that the attacker, Usman Khan, was not suitable for rehabilitation \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/12/01/london-bridge-attacker-poster-boy-rehab-scheme-targeted/\">some reports</a> have said he was seen as a model example of what could be achieved.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/02/jack-merritt-london-bridge-attack-dave-merritt\">an article for the Guardian published this afternoon</a>, Dave Merritt, whose son Jack was one of the two young rehabilitation advocates killed in the attack, said Jack would have been furious to see his death being used to justify more draconian policies:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Jack] would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that. What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens.</p> <p>That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Speaking to reporters shortly before Merritt\u2019s article was published, Johnson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course, I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt\u2019s family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia [Jones], who perished at London Bridge.</p> <p>But, be in no doubt, I\u2019ve campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years. It was in my manifesto in 2012 when I was mayor of London. I said it in August and it\u2019s in the Queen\u2019s speech. In fact, there\u2019s a bill we\u2019ve got ready to go in the Queen\u2019s speech to stop automatic early release for serious and violent offenders.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Johnson was not being wholly candid. The sentencing bill in the Queen\u2019s speech proposed changing the automatic release point from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds for people serving sentences of four years or more for a serious violent or sexual offence. The Conservative manifesto, published five days before the London Bridge attack, effectively replicated this, proposing \u201ctougher sentencing for the worst offenders\u201d and an end to automatic halfway release for serious crimes.</p> <p>But on Saturday, a day after Khan\u2019s attack, Johnson escalated his demands by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/02/general-election-swinson-condemns-johnson-over-trump-friendship-ahead-of-london-visit-live?page=with:block-5de4d0ca8f087410d98768bb#block-5de4d0ca8f087410d98768bb\">calling for two measures</a> that went beyond anything previously proposed by his party: mandatory minimum 14-year sentences for serious terrorist offences, and no early release at all for terrorism and extremism offences.</p> <h2>Farage heralds Trump\u2019s arrival for Nato summit</h2> <p>Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/02/general-election-swinson-condemns-johnson-over-trump-friendship-ahead-of-london-visit-live?page=with:block-5de502588f086d7f86dab9a4#block-5de502588f086d7f86dab9a4\">has claimed that that if the UK were to join the proposed European defence union after Brexit, Nato would collapse</a>. He made the argument at a rally in North Wales in which he also claimed that EU politicians \u201cwant Nato out of Europe\u201d. Even by the accuracy standards of this election campaign, Farage\u2019s arguments were particularly improbable. But if this is where Donald Trump is getting his advance briefing ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Nato summit at a hotel near Watford (which is not impossible), that should make for an interesting conversation.</p> <p>Farage has also suggested that Trump might use the summit to insist the US is not interested in buying the NHS. This would ostensibly help Johnson, who says the NHS will not be covered by any UK-EU trade deal, and undermine Jeremy Corbyn, who insists it will be, but given Trump\u2019s standing with the British public, and his reputation for honesty, it is hard to see any declaration making much difference either way. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/02/general-election-swinson-condemns-johnson-over-trump-friendship-ahead-of-london-visit-live?page=with:block-5de5461f8f0829bc521b51cb#block-5de5461f8f0829bc521b51cb\">Trump has already started his flight to the UK</a>.

That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that. Speaking to reporters shortly before Merritt\u2019s article was published, Johnson said: Of course, I feel, as everybody does, a huge amount of sympathy for the loss of Jack Merritt\u2019s family, and indeed for all the relatives of Jack and Saskia [Jones], who perished at London Bridge. But, be in no doubt, I\u2019ve campaigned against early release and against short sentences for many years. It was in my manifesto in 2012 when I was mayor of London. I said it in August and it\u2019s in the Queen\u2019s speech. In fact, there\u2019s a bill we\u2019ve got ready to go in the Queen\u2019s speech to stop automatic early release for serious and violent offenders. But Johnson was not being wholly candid. The sentencing bill in the Queen\u2019s speech proposed changing the automatic release point from halfway through a sentence to two-thirds for people serving sentences of four years or more for a serious violent or sexual offence. The Conservative manifesto, published five days before the London Bridge attack, effectively replicated this, proposing \u201ctougher sentencing for the worst offenders\u201d and an end to automatic halfway release for serious crimes. But on Saturday, a day after Khan\u2019s attack, Johnson escalated his demands by calling for two measures that went beyond anything previously proposed by his party: mandatory minimum 14-year sentences for serious terrorist offences, and no early release at all for terrorism and extremism offences. Farage heralds Trump\u2019s arrival for Nato summit Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has claimed that that if the UK were to join the proposed European defence union after Brexit, Nato would collapse. He made the argument at a rally in North Wales in which he also claimed that EU politicians \u201cwant Nato out of Europe\u201d. Even by the accuracy standards of this election campaign, Farage\u2019s arguments were particularly improbable. But if this is where Donald Trump is getting his advance briefing ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Nato summit at a hotel near Watford (which is not impossible), that should make for an interesting conversation. Farage has also suggested that Trump might use the summit to insist the US is not interested in buying the NHS. This would ostensibly help Johnson, who says the NHS will not be covered by any UK-EU trade deal, and undermine Jeremy Corbyn, who insists it will be, but given Trump\u2019s standing with the British public, and his reputation for honesty, it is hard to see any declaration making much difference either way. Trump has already started his flight to the UK. Corbyn has urged Johnson to break off trade talks with Trump until any reference to pharmaceuticals is struck out of Washington\u2019s negotiating objectives. Meanwhile The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a briefing suggesting council tax in England is more likely to go up under the Conservatives than under Labour. That\u2019s because Labour plans a generous settlement for local government, \u201cmore than enough money to meet rising costs and demands\u201d, even with no rise in council tax bills, while the Tory settlement would not meet rising costs and demands, \u201ceven if council tax were increased by 4% a year\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said the SNP would want to be included in talks with the EU if Labour took power and embarked on its its Brexit renegotiation.

      "body": "<p>Spotted! Jeremy Corbyn makes a late-breaking bid for sartorial supremacy. On the campaign trail in Whitby, the Labour leader wore a bespoke suit featuring his motto, \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d, stitched into the red pinstripes.</p> <p>Previously, Corbyn\u2019s attitude to his own personal style has been unflinchingly utilitarian. In 1984, he said of parliament: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fashion parade, it\u2019s not a gentleman\u2019s club, it\u2019s not a banker\u2019s institute, it\u2019s a place where the people are represented.\u201d Indeed, Corbyn\u2019s favourite fashion labels have included salt of the earth staples such as Marks &amp; Spencer (on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/dec/03/why-jeremy-corbyn-rocked-an-ms-suit-on-the-cover-of-gq\" title=\"\">cover of GQ</a>) and his mum (she knitted a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZsYvkTw4Rg\" title=\"\">biscuit-coloured jumper he once wore on Newsnight</a> in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable and perfect for the winter weather,\u201d he said at the time).</p> <p>Corbyn stepping up to the political fashion plate is significant, as politicians have long used their clothes to semaphore many things. David Cameron wore an unbuttoned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/aug/06/david-cameron-blue-holiday-shirt-back-hipper-than-ever\" title=\"\">Orlebar Brown blue shirt </a>(code: casual) on holiday in an attempt to fool the world into thinking that he knew the price of a pint of milk; Margaret Thatcher used her handbag symbolically \u2013 it was as much as an accessory as a weapon, and Theresa May used big, chunky necklaces and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/04/was-theresa-mays-frida-kahlo-bracelet-a-political-statement\" title=\"\">Frida Kahlo bracelet</a> as a Brexit-mess distraction technique, so we would be blinded by the silver and ignore what was coming out of her mouth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7ca791a3b01b858e4dd0e400a8ba32b7ed034cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7ca791a3b01b858e4dd0e400a8ba32b7ed034cf/0_0_1518_1012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Banner statement \u2026 the Labour \u2018For the many not the few\u2019 in the fabric of Corbyn\u2019s suit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banner statement \u2026 the Labour \u2018For the many not the few\u2019 in the fabric of Corbyn\u2019s suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corbyn\u2019s suit, while hinting at Balenciaga\u2019s autumn/winter 2018/19 tailoring, which featured shirts pinstriped with the brand\u2019s web address, was made by a tailor friend of Leeds North East candidate Fabian Hamilton. \u201cIt almost fits,\u201d he <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/01/jeremy-corbyns-new-suit-many-sewn-red-pinstripes-11249978/\" title=\"\">quipped</a>. It also seems inspired by a suit worn by boxer Conor McGregor, squaring up to his opponent Floyd Mayweather Jr in a pinstripe that said, in <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/2017/07/12/conor-mcgregor-fuck-you-suit/\" title=\"\">not very sporting terms</a>, get lost. But 10 days before the election, this could be Corbyn\u2019s fashion moment. The suit speaks of strong leadership and a clear socialist message. Change, he seems to be saying, is in the fabric of who he is.</p> <p>The past few weeks have been a time of sartorial protest. Taylor Swift performed at the American Music Awards, after receiving the artist of the decade accolade, wearing a white shirt emblazoned with her album titles. It seemed to allude to the legal battle she is having with music moguls Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/jul/01/taylor-swift-is-furious-at-the-sale-of-her-master-tapes-but-shes-luckier-than-most\" title=\"\">the rights to her master recordings</a>. Similarly, singer Jennifer Nettles wore a Cristian Siriano designed tuxedo suit with a pink train, that featured the words \u201cequal pay\u201d to the Country Music Awards in November. \u201cWhat better and more womanly way to invite such a conversation than with fashion that sends a message?\u201d she wrote on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B41L55FjEY-/?utm_source=ig_embed\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s suit, too, screams a message. It\u2019s enough to win in the style stakes, but is it enough to win with the electorate? </p>",

      "bodyText": "Spotted! Jeremy Corbyn makes a late-breaking bid for sartorial supremacy. On the campaign trail in Whitby, the Labour leader wore a bespoke suit featuring his motto, \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d, stitched into the red pinstripes. Previously, Corbyn\u2019s attitude to his own personal style has been unflinchingly utilitarian. In 1984, he said of parliament: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fashion parade, it\u2019s not a gentleman\u2019s club, it\u2019s not a banker\u2019s institute, it\u2019s a place where the people are represented.\u201d Indeed, Corbyn\u2019s favourite fashion labels have included salt of the earth staples such as Marks &amp; Spencer (on the cover of GQ) and his mum (she knitted a biscuit-coloured jumper he once wore on Newsnight in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable and perfect for the winter weather,\u201d he said at the time). Corbyn stepping up to the political fashion plate is significant, as politicians have long used their clothes to semaphore many things. David Cameron wore an unbuttoned Orlebar Brown blue shirt (code: casual) on holiday in an attempt to fool the world into thinking that he knew the price of a pint of milk; Margaret Thatcher used her handbag symbolically \u2013 it was as much as an accessory as a weapon, and Theresa May used big, chunky necklaces and a Frida Kahlo bracelet as a Brexit-mess distraction technique, so we would be blinded by the silver and ignore what was coming out of her mouth. Corbyn\u2019s suit, while hinting at Balenciaga\u2019s autumn/winter 2018/19 tailoring, which featured shirts pinstriped with the brand\u2019s web address, was made by a tailor friend of Leeds North East candidate Fabian Hamilton. \u201cIt almost fits,\u201d he quipped. It also seems inspired by a suit worn by boxer Conor McGregor, squaring up to his opponent Floyd Mayweather Jr in a pinstripe that said, in not very sporting terms, get lost. But 10 days before the election, this could be Corbyn\u2019s fashion moment. The suit speaks of strong leadership and a clear socialist message. Change, he seems to be saying, is in the fabric of who he is. The past few weeks have been a time of sartorial protest. Taylor Swift performed at the American Music Awards, after receiving the artist of the decade accolade, wearing a white shirt emblazoned with her album titles. It seemed to allude to the legal battle she is having with music moguls Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta over the rights to her master recordings. Similarly, singer Jennifer Nettles wore a Cristian Siriano designed tuxedo suit with a pink train, that featured the words \u201cequal pay\u201d to the Country Music Awards in November. \u201cWhat better and more womanly way to invite such a conversation than with fashion that sends a message?\u201d she wrote on Instagram. Corbyn\u2019s suit, too, screams a message. It\u2019s enough to win in the style stakes, but is it enough to win with the electorate?",

The older man, it turned out, was the prominent Catholic politician Eug\u00e8ne de Germiny, a bastion of the reactionary right who railed against the government\u2019s secular tendencies and advocated a society based on family, religion and a return to monarchy.</p> <p>The press immediately called out Germiny\u2019s double standards. Despite his protests \u2013 he claimed his adventure was merely \u201cresearch\u201d \u2013 he became a magnet for satire, his political opponents making much of his hypocrisy.

Curated by photographer Marc Martin, it delivers an extraordinary account of sanitation, censure and sex that has remained largely untold until now. Visually, it\u2019s gripping enough, from the image of Edgar Degas striding out of a <em>pissoti\u00e8re</em> to <a href=\"https://www.photo.rmn.fr/archive/00-013492-2C6NU0V9AY2D.html\">an overhead street shot by Brassai</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/henri-cartierbresson/NY040218/114\">picture by</a><a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/henri-cartierbresson/NY040218/114\"> Henri Cartier</a><a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/henri-cartierbresson/NY040218/114\">-Bresson of US writer Charles Henri Ford zipping himself up</a>. But more than anything, this show is remarkable for the story it tells.</p> <p>We begin in the early 19th century, when Paris was as notorious for its noxious odours as it was revolutionary upheaval. The streets overflowed with rubbish and horse dung, and anyone caught short in the open simply relieved themselves where they stood. To remedy this, city prefect Rambuteau ordered the construction of <em>colonnes vespasiennes</em> \u2013 phallic-looking structures with inbuilt plumbing that allowed Paris\u2019s male population to urinate with relative dignity. Unfortunately, there was no such luck for the rest of the population: though the notion of building conveniences for women was briefly entertained, it was decided they would take up too much space on public thoroughfares. It would be more than a century before Parisian women were granted any such \u201cluxury\u201d.</p> <p>Despite ignoring the needs of half of Paris\u2019s inhabitants, Rambuteau\u2019s rudimentary urinals soon took on more complex architectural form, with the <em>vespasienne</em> (or <em>tasse</em>, in the era\u2019s argot, meaning \u201ccup\u201d) eventually evolving into a structure resembling a tank turret. The design, a full-scale example of which is included in the exhibition, subsequently became a ubiquitous sight on Parisian boulevards.</p> <p>The primary function of the urinals, however, was soon subverted by other needs. The relative privacy accorded by the prefabricated confines of the <em>pissoti\u00e8res</em> provided a previously non-existent space for Paris\u2019s marginalised population of homosexual men, presenting a haven in which they could engage in acts that would otherwise have seen them locked up. Indeed, as early as 1862, the city\u2019s policemen were recording the existence of glory holes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d21cefa740b5a348b058002318e03fb77ce1fb65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d21cefa740b5a348b058002318e03fb77ce1fb65/0_0_3141_4591/684.jpg\" alt=\"A vespasienne urinal in the 1960s\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men only \u2026 a <em>vespasienne</em> urinal in the 1960s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Marc Martin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A morality crusade against these \u201cdens of vice\u201d ensued. Surveillance \u2013 of the sort in Germiny\u2019s story \u2013 was commonplace, and conservative commentators condemned public urinals as a stain on the city. \u201cThese Parisian <em>vespasiennes</em> are the exact equivalent of a chamber pot left uncovered in the sitting room,\u201d thundered one newspaper, while another complained of the \u201cdebauchery that takes place in the capital\u2019s urinals\u201d.</p> <p>Regardless of the backlash, the <em>tasses</em> proved impossible to police. Ever more esoteric subcultures sprung up around them: in one instance, we see a dictionary of toilet graffiti compiled by a sociologist; and a particularly eyebrow-raising section examining the so-called <em>soupeurs</em>, a term applied to individuals who enjoyed dipping stale bread in other people\u2019s urine and binge-eating the results.</p> <p>The <em>vespasiennes</em>\u2019 finest hour came during the German occupation of 1940-44, when the assault on freedom suddenly made the illicit encounters in public toilets seem relatively innocuous. \u201cUnder the Occupation, the streets were empty, but the <em>pissoti\u00e8res</em> were full,\u201d recounted Roger Peyrefitte. Indeed, French, German and American soldiers would flock to the urinals to satisfy their needs. And, quite apart from sexuality, they served as important meeting places for r\u00e9sistants to exchange information on enemy troop movements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6792315b5aee59c2429f408b0ec1e203e8940b0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6792315b5aee59c2429f408b0ec1e203e8940b0e/0_0_5040_6369/791.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Phallic\u2019 \u2026 plan for an original pissoir.\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Phallic\u2019 \u2026 plan for an original pissoir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Marc Martin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite their Nazi-fighting credentials, the postwar era saw the <em>vespasiennes </em>condemned to history. From 1960 onwards, they were gradually dismantled on the dubious pretext of low public usage. Only one \u2013 outside La Sant\u00e9 prison \u2013 remains. An afterlife of sorts existed in their terminal years: one vitrine here recounts the story of a <em>madame pipi</em>, or lavatory attendant, who rented out cubicles for <em>rencontres homosexuels</em> in 1988. But the glory days were over, and with them went an entire subculture.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sad ending to a show that demonstrates how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/public-toilets-council-cuts\">these most humble, yet crucial, facets of urban infrastructure</a> have had lasting effects on history.

The older man, it turned out, was the prominent Catholic politician Eug\u00e8ne de Germiny, a bastion of the reactionary right who railed against the government\u2019s secular tendencies and advocated a society based on family, religion and a return to monarchy. The press immediately called out Germiny\u2019s double standards. Despite his protests \u2013 he claimed his adventure was merely \u201cresearch\u201d \u2013 he became a magnet for satire, his political opponents making much of his hypocrisy. The writer Gustav Flaubert described the scandal as a \u201ccomfort that encourages the will to live\u201d. Germiny was sent to jail and went into exile on release. The police logbook detailing Germiny\u2019s arrest is just one of dozens of exhibits that make up a small but fascinating exhibition exploring the secret history of Paris\u2019s public urinals. Curated by photographer Marc Martin, it delivers an extraordinary account of sanitation, censure and sex that has remained largely untold until now. Visually, it\u2019s gripping enough, from the image of Edgar Degas striding out of a pissoti\u00e8re to an overhead street shot by Brassai, and a picture by Henri Cartier-Bresson of US writer Charles Henri Ford zipping himself up. But more than anything, this show is remarkable for the story it tells. We begin in the early 19th century, when Paris was as notorious for its noxious odours as it was revolutionary upheaval. The streets overflowed with rubbish and horse dung, and anyone caught short in the open simply relieved themselves where they stood. To remedy this, city prefect Rambuteau ordered the construction of colonnes vespasiennes \u2013 phallic-looking structures with inbuilt plumbing that allowed Paris\u2019s male population to urinate with relative dignity. Unfortunately, there was no such luck for the rest of the population: though the notion of building conveniences for women was briefly entertained, it was decided they would take up too much space on public thoroughfares. It would be more than a century before Parisian women were granted any such \u201cluxury\u201d. Despite ignoring the needs of half of Paris\u2019s inhabitants, Rambuteau\u2019s rudimentary urinals soon took on more complex architectural form, with the vespasienne (or tasse, in the era\u2019s argot, meaning \u201ccup\u201d) eventually evolving into a structure resembling a tank turret. The design, a full-scale example of which is included in the exhibition, subsequently became a ubiquitous sight on Parisian boulevards. The primary function of the urinals, however, was soon subverted by other needs. The relative privacy accorded by the prefabricated confines of the pissoti\u00e8res provided a previously non-existent space for Paris\u2019s marginalised population of homosexual men, presenting a haven in which they could engage in acts that would otherwise have seen them locked up. Indeed, as early as 1862, the city\u2019s policemen were recording the existence of glory holes. A morality crusade against these \u201cdens of vice\u201d ensued. Surveillance \u2013 of the sort in Germiny\u2019s story \u2013 was commonplace, and conservative commentators condemned public urinals as a stain on the city. \u201cThese Parisian vespasiennes are the exact equivalent of a chamber pot left uncovered in the sitting room,\u201d thundered one newspaper, while another complained of the \u201cdebauchery that takes place in the capital\u2019s urinals\u201d. Regardless of the backlash, the tasses proved impossible to police. Ever more esoteric subcultures sprung up around them: in one instance, we see a dictionary of toilet graffiti compiled by a sociologist; and a particularly eyebrow-raising section examining the so-called soupeurs, a term applied to individuals who enjoyed dipping stale bread in other people\u2019s urine and binge-eating the results. The vespasiennes\u2019 finest hour came during the German occupation of 1940-44, when the assault on freedom suddenly made the illicit encounters in public toilets seem relatively innocuous. \u201cUnder the Occupation, the streets were empty, but the pissoti\u00e8res were full,\u201d recounted Roger Peyrefitte. Indeed, French, German and American soldiers would flock to the urinals to satisfy their needs. And, quite apart from sexuality, they served as important meeting places for r\u00e9sistants to exchange information on enemy troop movements. Despite their Nazi-fighting credentials, the postwar era saw the vespasiennes condemned to history. From 1960 onwards, they were gradually dismantled on the dubious pretext of low public usage. Only one \u2013 outside La Sant\u00e9 prison \u2013 remains. An afterlife of sorts existed in their terminal years: one vitrine here recounts the story of a madame pipi, or lavatory attendant, who rented out cubicles for rencontres homosexuels in 1988. But the glory days were over, and with them went an entire subculture. It\u2019s a sad ending to a show that demonstrates how these most humble, yet crucial, facets of urban infrastructure have had lasting effects on history. Even the grottiest of stories, it seems, can be epic in scale. \u2022 Marc Martin: Les Tasses is at Le Point \u00c9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re, Paris 75010, until 5 December, then travelling to the Leslie Lohman Museum in New York.",

      "body": "<p>Robert Neame, who has died aged 85, helped safeguard the independence of Shepherd Neame, Britain\u2019s oldest brewery. He was a director from 1957 until 2006 and steered it through the turbulence of the 1960s and 70s, when many family breweries were taken over by national groups keen to acquire more pubs to fill with keg beer and lager.</p> <p>Bobby, as he was known, joined the family business as marketing director in 1956. Shepherd Neame, founded in 1698 in Faversham in the heart of the Kent hop fields, enjoyed a good reputation for its beer, while its large estate of pubs was tempting bait for bigger brewers. In 1967 Shepherd Neame\u2019s rival in Faversham, Fremlin\u2019s, was bought by Whitbread. Bobby and his family were determined that their brewery would not suffer a similar fate.</p> <p>Born in London, Bobby was the son of Violet (nee Cobb) and Jasper Neame, chairman and managing director of the brewery until 1961. He went to Harrow school, where he became head boy. Before he joined the family firm he went on a grand tour of breweries in Europe and Scandinavia to gain experience of both making and selling beer. He finished the tour at H\u00fcrlimann in Zurich, a visit that led to the Swiss lager being brewed at Faversham. </p> <p>One of Bobby\u2019s first tasks at the family brewery was to add keg beer to its cask and bottled ales. Such filtered and pasteurised keg beers as Watney\u2019s Red Barrel and Worthington E were taking sales away from traditional beer \u2013 and Shepherd Neame knew it had to respond with its own version.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"125416b356fdc14f5766fbdc4080cfa5ba5534e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/125416b356fdc14f5766fbdc4080cfa5ba5534e1/0_117_2362_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Shepherd Neame brewery in Faversham, Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shepherd Neame brewery in Faversham, Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shepherd Neame</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bobby was given \u00a31,000 to set up a keg plant and he recalled buying two tanks from a Mr Roberts in north London. It was like a scene from Steptoe and Son, he said, with the deal sealed behind Tottenham Hotspur football ground over a lunch of greasy chops on a tablecloth of newspapers. At the brewery the new keg beer was pasteurised in a primitive fashion, with kegs lowered into two zinc baths filled with hot water.</p> <p>Bobby became chairman of the brewery in 1971 and was able to add more distinguished beers than those brewed under the keg initiative. One of his great achievements was to launch, in 1990, a new cask and bottled beer called Spitfire. It commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, when the RAF defeated the Luftwaffe in the skies above Kent. Spitfire went on to become the brewery\u2019s best known and biggest-selling beer.</p> <p>In the 90s Bobby and the brewery faced the threat of a new invasion, with the rise of hordes of British drinkers crossing to Calais on what became known as \u201cbooze cruises\u201d. They returned with boxes of French beer that cost half the price of British beer as a result of far lower rates of duty in France.</p> <p>Shepherd Neame, close to Dover and Folkestone, was badly affected by the cheap imports. Bobby hit back by exporting his strong ale, Bishops Finger, to Calais and other parts of northern France. The beer, first brewed in the 50s, takes its name from ancient road signs directing pilgrims to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. Bishops Finger became a cult beer in France and helped counter the impact of cheap imports.</p> <p>Bobby and his fellow directors lobbied successive British governments over the punitive rates of duty imposed on British beer. The campaign had only limited success, with some freezes on duty in recent years, but Bobby was able to use another government policy to build his pub estate.</p> <p>In the early 90s the Conservative government, following advice from a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the brewing industry that had castigated the national brewers, forced the nationals (the Big Six) to sell off large parcels of their pubs. As a result, Bobby was able to snap up a number of pubs from Whitbread.</p> <p>When Bobby retired as chairman in 2005 he was given the honorary role of president.

      "bodyText": "Robert Neame, who has died aged 85, helped safeguard the independence of Shepherd Neame, Britain\u2019s oldest brewery. He was a director from 1957 until 2006 and steered it through the turbulence of the 1960s and 70s, when many family breweries were taken over by national groups keen to acquire more pubs to fill with keg beer and lager. Bobby, as he was known, joined the family business as marketing director in 1956. Shepherd Neame, founded in 1698 in Faversham in the heart of the Kent hop fields, enjoyed a good reputation for its beer, while its large estate of pubs was tempting bait for bigger brewers. In 1967 Shepherd Neame\u2019s rival in Faversham, Fremlin\u2019s, was bought by Whitbread. Bobby and his family were determined that their brewery would not suffer a similar fate. Born in London, Bobby was the son of Violet (nee Cobb) and Jasper Neame, chairman and managing director of the brewery until 1961. He went to Harrow school, where he became head boy. Before he joined the family firm he went on a grand tour of breweries in Europe and Scandinavia to gain experience of both making and selling beer. He finished the tour at H\u00fcrlimann in Zurich, a visit that led to the Swiss lager being brewed at Faversham. One of Bobby\u2019s first tasks at the family brewery was to add keg beer to its cask and bottled ales. Such filtered and pasteurised keg beers as Watney\u2019s Red Barrel and Worthington E were taking sales away from traditional beer \u2013 and Shepherd Neame knew it had to respond with its own version. Bobby was given \u00a31,000 to set up a keg plant and he recalled buying two tanks from a Mr Roberts in north London. It was like a scene from Steptoe and Son, he said, with the deal sealed behind Tottenham Hotspur football ground over a lunch of greasy chops on a tablecloth of newspapers. At the brewery the new keg beer was pasteurised in a primitive fashion, with kegs lowered into two zinc baths filled with hot water. Bobby became chairman of the brewery in 1971 and was able to add more distinguished beers than those brewed under the keg initiative. One of his great achievements was to launch, in 1990, a new cask and bottled beer called Spitfire. It commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, when the RAF defeated the Luftwaffe in the skies above Kent. Spitfire went on to become the brewery\u2019s best known and biggest-selling beer. In the 90s Bobby and the brewery faced the threat of a new invasion, with the rise of hordes of British drinkers crossing to Calais on what became known as \u201cbooze cruises\u201d. They returned with boxes of French beer that cost half the price of British beer as a result of far lower rates of duty in France. Shepherd Neame, close to Dover and Folkestone, was badly affected by the cheap imports. Bobby hit back by exporting his strong ale, Bishops Finger, to Calais and other parts of northern France. The beer, first brewed in the 50s, takes its name from ancient road signs directing pilgrims to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. Bishops Finger became a cult beer in France and helped counter the impact of cheap imports. Bobby and his fellow directors lobbied successive British governments over the punitive rates of duty imposed on British beer. The campaign had only limited success, with some freezes on duty in recent years, but Bobby was able to use another government policy to build his pub estate. In the early 90s the Conservative government, following advice from a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the brewing industry that had castigated the national brewers, forced the nationals (the Big Six) to sell off large parcels of their pubs. As a result, Bobby was able to snap up a number of pubs from Whitbread. When Bobby retired as chairman in 2005 he was given the honorary role of president. He passed to his son, Jonathan, a company producing 200,000 barrels of beer a year, with 320 pubs and hotels, and substantial free trade. Bobby was active in Kent life. A one-nation Tory, he was leader of Kent county council between 1982 and 1984. He was deputy lieutenant of Kent in 1992 and high sheriff in 2001. A passionate supporter of cricket, he was president of Kent county cricket club in 1992. He was appointed CBE in 1999. He was married twice, first in 1961 to Sally Corben. The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1974 he married Yvonne Mackenzie. He is survived by Yvonne, their daughter, Moray, his children Jonathan, Charlotte and Sarah from his first marriage, and nine grandchildren; his son Richard died in 1968. \u2022 Robert Harry Beale Neame, brewer, born 25 February 1934; died 15 November 2019",

So A = 2. Since A = 2, the left hand side of the equation is at least 8000. So D is either 8 or 9.

Now let\u2019s substitute these two values in the original equation: (2000 + 100B + 40C + 8) x 4 = 8000 + 100C + 10B + 2 Which reduces to 13B + 1 = 2C The only solutions here are B = 1 and C = 7 So the answer is 2178 x 4 = 8712 Thanks to everyone!

When faced with weak economic growth, the government\u2019s response has been to argue about \u201cthe fundamentals\u201d and use the words of the governor of the RBA in July that they \u201care strong\u201d. The prime minister suggested three times in September that the fundamentals are strong. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has watered it down a little of late, telling Ross Greenwood on Melbourne Cup day that \u201cthe fundamentals of the economy are sound\u201d and Steve Price on 20 November that the fundamentals are \u201cin a pretty good place\u201d. All in all you would think things are going along swimmingly. So let\u2019s have a look at some of the fundamentals. On Monday the latest Commonwealth Bank manufacturing purchases managers index (PMI) was released showing the index fell from 50.0 in October to 49.9 \u2013 the first time in the past three years it has fallen below 50. This came off the back of the latest private new capital expenditure figures released by the bureau of statistics late last week which revealed that for the first time in three and half years the volume of investment in the non-mining sector was below what it was a year earlier: While the long slump of mining investment looks to be over, the non-mining sector has started to go backwards \u2013 down 4.2% over the past nine months. Even worse, the latest estimate for non-mining investment for this current financial year is below what was expected for 2018-19: This does not bode well because not only does capital investment lead to stronger employment, it is also crucial for improving productivity \u2013 the most fundamental of all the fundamentals! And right now we are suffering a productivity crisis. Productivity is a hard thing to actually measure, especially at the industry level. The ABS each year releases its experimental estimates of productivity with a focus on not just labour productivity but productivity that adjusts for the quality of hours worked. This takes into account the improved skills and education of the workers. The figures also measure what is known as \u201cmulti-factor productivity\u201d (MFP), which attempts to measure how well labour uses increased capital spending. And the news is not good. In 2018-19 for the first time in eight years MFP fell and for the first time in nine years labour productivity fell when accounting for changes in labour quality. When measured merely on an hours-worked basis, 2018-19 marked the first time labour productivity fell in a financial year: A big reason is the drought \u2013 agricultural productivity plunged 10% off the back of a 10.4% drop in output. But it is not just the fault of the drought. Eight of the 16 market sectors industries saw productivity falls of more than 1%, and just four saw growth above that level: The result in the construction industry is most concerning given productivity has fallen by an average of 4.3% over the past three years. Such a result suggests the government\u2019s reintroduction of the ABCC in 2016 has been an abject failure at improving productivity in the sector. The construction sector also saw a 3.4% fall in output in 2018-19, a situation which is unlikely to be improved soon given the latest building approvals figures released on Monday. For the 23rd month in a row (just one month shy of tying the record set during the 1990s recession), the total number of private sector building approvals fell in October: For 20 consecutive months the number of building approvals for private sector houses has fallen. In October just 8,126 private houses were approved (in trend terms). That is the lowest figure in any month since April 2013. As AMP\u2019s chief economist, Diana Mousina, notes, this does not bode well for any improvement soon in dwelling investment.

AMP also expects \u201cresidential construction will remain a drag on the economy until mid-2020\u201d.

The At What Cost report, released on Tuesday by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, Save the Children and GetUp, showed the cost of offshore processing over the next three years would be $1.2bn, and $573,ooo each person a year. This was on top of the $9bn spent on offshore processing and onshore mandatory detention between 2016 and 2020, analysis of government figures undertaken for the report by Equity Economics showed. \u201cWhilst the human cost of Australia\u2019s six-year failure to find a solution for all those people trapped offshore remains devastating, so too is the economic impact for a government increasingly in search of fiscal savings,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe cost of keeping these 535 people offshore after six years is enormous, both economically and morally. A solution should be found urgently \u2013 to the benefit of both these people and the budget bottom line.\u201d The report said that detaining the same person onshore in Australia would cost $200,000 less a person, with onshore mandatory detention costing on average $346,000 each person a year. The cost for those living in the Australian community on a bridging visa is $10,221 each person a year. The new figures came as the government prepared to put the medevac repeal legislation to a vote in the Senate this week, and after Lambie met with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, on Monday to discuss her non-negotiable demand for her support. Lambie has refused to reveal details of her demand, but has not denied reports that she wants the government to accept an offer from New Zealand to take 150 refugees out of offshore detention. When asked on Monday if the government would be prepared to accept the New Zealand offer, Morrison said: \u201cOur policies on those matters haven\u2019t changed.\u201d The leader of the government in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, said the legislation would be voted on before parliament rose at the end of the week, regardless of Lambie\u2019s position. \u201cEvery individual senator has to make a decision: whether they stand on the side of stronger national security or weaker national security,\u201d he said. Debate on the legislation began in the Senate on Monday. Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, said the medical evacuation laws were working as intended and should not be repealed. \u201cDenying people medical care is un-Australian, it\u2019s inhumane, it\u2019s uncompassionate,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you or I are sick, we see a doctor, and vulnerable people in Australia\u2019s care who have already suffered significant trauma in their lives should not be forced to the brink of death to receive the medical treatment they require.\u201d The report points to the most recent Australian government figures which show that as of 31 October 2019, these were 535 transitory persons left offshore of the 3,127 who had been detained on the islands of Manus and Nauru since offshore processing began in 2013. Of this group, 449 have been found to be refugees, with another 39 progressing through their refugee status determination process. About 120 of the 535 have been approved for departure to the US and 47 have been found not to be refugees. The report said while it was positive that so many of the original cohort had been resettled, \u201cthis leaves approximately 368 offshore refugees likely in need of resettlement\u201d. But the report also raised concerns about transparency in budget reporting of the cost of detention, saying the quality of publicly available information had deteriorated since it last reported in 2016. \u201cPublished costs and arrival numbers is extremely limited and available information does not add up,\u201d it said. \u201cThis makes analysis and oversight of government activities difficult to measure and assess accurately, limiting the accountability of government public awareness of the true cost involved.\u201d",

La Poste\u2019s subsidiary, DPD, says flying packages by remote control is more reliable, quicker and safer than driving a van up narrow mountain roads in winter when they are often icy or blocked by snow. The delivery by drone, which flies at around 30km/h, takes eight minutes for a round trip, compared with 30 minutes for a vehicle. Launched during a normal postal delivery round from a special launch-and-landing platform that emerges from the side of a vehicle, the drone is guided to a \u201csecure terminal\u201d near the village where it releases the package to be collected by the customer using a code. DPD began researching the possibility of using drones to make deliveries in 2014 and has been honing the technology ever since. La Poste was given permission by France\u2019s civil aviation authority to begin using the drones, which have six electric rotors that can be charged using solar panels, and a inbuilt GPS system, for deliveries in the Is\u00e8re region of south-east France. They will carry small parcels between Fontanil-Cornillon to Mont-Saint-Martin, which is 760m above sea level and north of Grenoble in the Chartreuse mountains. \u201cThere are many benefits to drone delivery in the mountains as compared to delivery by van.

A man at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, where the incident began, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/30/narwhal-tusk-and-fire-extinguisher-used-to-tackle-london-bridge-attacker\" title=\"\">grabbed a narwhal tusk</a> that was displayed by the side of the hall\u2019s doorway and, wielding it like a lance, deployed it against the assailant outside. He acted according to instinct, yet his brave gesture, with its knightly resonance, has an emblematic power.</p> <p>In medieval times, the narwhal\u2019s tusk was invested with magic powers: ground up as a powder it was thought to protect monarchs against poisoning. Elizabeth I was given a tusk by her Arctic explorer, Sir Martin Frobisher; it was so valuable she could have bought a castle with it. Another was turned into a royal sceptre. This heavy ivory spiral \u2013 it is difficult to hold in one hand \u2013 was long believed to have belonged to the mythical unicorn, as emblazoned on the royal coat of arms along with the lion. The Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I had the animal\u2019s image etched on his jousting armour. Nowadays, tusks \u2013 which cannot be traded internationally \u2013 can change hands for \u00a325,000 in north America, where the animals are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00dqv1z\" title=\"\">still hunted</a> with high-velocity rifles.</p> <p>This enigmatic Arctic mammal\u2019s name itself has a fated aspect, being old Norse for \u201ccorpse whale\u201d, since the cetacean\u2019s spotted hide was said to resemble a drowned man. For centuries it was believed that the narwhal itself only used its tusk in jousts between males. In fact, recent research has established that the tusk \u2013 actually an extended tooth that erupts through the whale\u2019s upper lip, and spirals out for up to five metres \u2013 is sensitive with nerve endings at the surface, and that the animals rub tusks together in sensory communication.</p> <p>If one animal\u2019s tusk gets broken off, another narwhal may even break off the tip of its own tusk in the gap, perhaps the ultimate altruistic gesture. Perhaps more apposite is another new discovery: that in a fearful situation the narwhal\u2019s heart beat slows down to just <a href=\"https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/12/narwhals.html\" title=\"\">four beats</a> a minute.</p> <p>It is strange to note that only hours after the London Bridge attack, a dead minke whale stranded on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/30/eight-foot-whale-found-washed-up-on-thames-shore\" title=\"\">banks</a> of the same river, at Battersea Bridge, its sleek black carcass lying within the pooled bright lights of the city\u2019s back side at night. That whale joined two others that have perished in this waterway in the past two months, one of them killed by a ship-strike. It is hard not to see this river as a mortal place, out of Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, or TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land.</p> <p>Yet whales have forever been seen as omens \u2013 of good as well as ill. And perhaps there is another, more human poetry to be found in the terror of what happened in the heart of a metropolis that is often seen as an unfeeling, lonely place. That for people, as for whales, it is our sense of community that offers a real kind of hope. </p> <p>\u2022 Philip Hoare is an author whose books include Leviathan, or The Whale</p>",

      "bodyText": "Among the heroic responses to the terrorist attack on London Bridge on Friday, one stands out for its strangeness. A man at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, where the incident began, grabbed a narwhal tusk that was displayed by the side of the hall\u2019s doorway and, wielding it like a lance, deployed it against the assailant outside. He acted according to instinct, yet his brave gesture, with its knightly resonance, has an emblematic power. In medieval times, the narwhal\u2019s tusk was invested with magic powers: ground up as a powder it was thought to protect monarchs against poisoning. Elizabeth I was given a tusk by her Arctic explorer, Sir Martin Frobisher; it was so valuable she could have bought a castle with it. Another was turned into a royal sceptre. This heavy ivory spiral \u2013 it is difficult to hold in one hand \u2013 was long believed to have belonged to the mythical unicorn, as emblazoned on the royal coat of arms along with the lion. The Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I had the animal\u2019s image etched on his jousting armour. Nowadays, tusks \u2013 which cannot be traded internationally \u2013 can change hands for \u00a325,000 in north America, where the animals are still hunted with high-velocity rifles. This enigmatic Arctic mammal\u2019s name itself has a fated aspect, being old Norse for \u201ccorpse whale\u201d, since the cetacean\u2019s spotted hide was said to resemble a drowned man. For centuries it was believed that the narwhal itself only used its tusk in jousts between males. In fact, recent research has established that the tusk \u2013 actually an extended tooth that erupts through the whale\u2019s upper lip, and spirals out for up to five metres \u2013 is sensitive with nerve endings at the surface, and that the animals rub tusks together in sensory communication. If one animal\u2019s tusk gets broken off, another narwhal may even break off the tip of its own tusk in the gap, perhaps the ultimate altruistic gesture. Perhaps more apposite is another new discovery: that in a fearful situation the narwhal\u2019s heart beat slows down to just four beats a minute. It is strange to note that only hours after the London Bridge attack, a dead minke whale stranded on the banks of the same river, at Battersea Bridge, its sleek black carcass lying within the pooled bright lights of the city\u2019s back side at night. That whale joined two others that have perished in this waterway in the past two months, one of them killed by a ship-strike. It is hard not to see this river as a mortal place, out of Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, or TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land. Yet whales have forever been seen as omens \u2013 of good as well as ill. And perhaps there is another, more human poetry to be found in the terror of what happened in the heart of a metropolis that is often seen as an unfeeling, lonely place. That for people, as for whales, it is our sense of community that offers a real kind of hope. \u2022 Philip Hoare is an author whose books include Leviathan, or The Whale",

      "body": "<p>Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti was a bright, young playwright when life ambushed her art. She had just staged her second play, Behzti, which featured the rape of a young woman in a gurdwara, a place of worship, when some British Sikhs took affront. Protests turned into riots, and the hysteria rose to such a fever pitch that the Birmingham Repertory theatre caved in and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/21/religion.arts\">closed Behzti in the middle of its run</a>.</p> <p>It is rare for British authors to be forced to go to ground. It happened to Salman Rushdie in 1989 after a fatwa was issued over The Satanic Verses. When it happened to Bhatti, in December 2004, police put bars on the windows of her flat and installed CCTV cameras outside it. As in Rushdie\u2019s case, several ironies emerged amid the public outrage: some protesters hadn\u2019t seen the play; others mistook it for a film. Behzti\u2019s themes had been inspired by personal experience, but Bhatti was variously accused of sacrilege and betraying her community.</p> <p>The controversy led to scrappy national debates about freedom of expression versus religious sensitivities. The playwright became a cause celebre for some, a provocateur for others. Today, at the age of 50, it is a distant, though defining, memory. \u201cIt\u2019s almost exactly 15 years today since I was in rehearsal for it,\u201d says Bhatti, in her gentle, even-voiced way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebdd108c0f2f31f3d582e32b185142bd0f7eb301\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebdd108c0f2f31f3d582e32b185142bd0f7eb301/0_68_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cave in \u2026 a notice outside the Birmingham Rep announced the cancellation of Behzti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cave in \u2026 a notice outside the Birmingham Rep announced the cancellation of Behzti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It broke her heart when the play was cancelled.

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has employed a range of \u201cprogressively more innovative\u201d arguments to claim the software fitted to millions of its vehicles is not a defeat device designed to cheat emissions tests, the high court has heard. Lawyers representing more than 90,000 UK customers are bringing the biggest class action of its kind in Britain against the carmaker over the dieselgate emissions scandal. VW admitted in 2015 to having manipulated the systems in 11m vehicles worldwide to fool emissions tests. It pleaded guilty in the US two years ago to criminal charges and paid out $4.3bn (\u00a33.3bn) in civil and criminal penalties. In Australia it settled a multimillion-dollar class action which involved an agreement to pay between $87m and $127m in compensation to customers. In the face of the allegations, the VW CEO, Martin Winterkorn, apologised on behalf of the company, saying: \u201cI personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law.\u201d But in Europe VW is still denying the software in question was an illegal defeat device \u2013 despite German regulators having ruled in 2015 that the software was designed to cheat emissions tests. Lawyers for the UK customers opened a class action against VW in the high court on Monday. In 2015 the company admitted fitting the software to 1.2m of its vehicles in the UK, and rolled out a \u201cfix\u201d to make cars compliant with emissions laws. But VW\u2019s case in papers submitted to the court is that this software was not designed to breach the legal testing regime and was therefore not a defeat device. Tom de la Mare QC, representing VW\u2019s customers, said in written submission to the court: \u201cVW have raised a range of progressively more inventive arguments as to why the software function is not a defeat device \u2013 arguments which have changed over time, and have been been deployed selectively before different courts and tribunals.\u201d He added EU emissions regulations prohibited the use of defeat devices to prevent cheating of the emissions limits by manufacturers. He said the software VW fitted was clearly designed to defeat the emissions tests and was clearly a prohibited defeat device. De la Mare said the vehicles were \u201coptimised to minimise the amount of pollutants\u201d in emissions tests, meaning they operated in a \u201ccompletely different way in the street to how it operated in the test\u201d. \u201cIt is difficult to think of a more obvious cheat than the one VW used,\u201d he added. Lawyers for VW customers say emissions tests are designed to protect the public from diesel emissions. \u201cNitrogen oxides are extremely dangerous air quality pollutants, particularly in urban areas,\u201d said De la Mare, adding exposure to nitrogen dioxide carried with it significant risk to human health and citing statistics showing pollution was \u201ckilling approximately 1,000 people a day in Europe\u201d. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates exposure to nitrogen dioxide has an effect on mortality equivalent to 23,500 deaths annually in the UK. De la Mare said internal VW documents showed that the company had \u201clong known that the software was unlawful and indefensible\u201d, pointing to one document in which a VW employee said the vehicles would \u201cflunk\u201d emissions tests without the software. He submitted that the documents showed a \u201cclear acceptance that the software was the only basis on which they were meeting the emissions limits\u201d. De la Mare warned that if the court ruled in VW\u2019s favour, it would leave the regulatory regime \u201ctoothless in the face of a major fraud of precisely the kind it was surely designed to prevent\u201d. VW said in a statement: \u201cVolkswagen Group maintains that there has never been a defeat device installed in any of its vehicles in the UK. \u201cThe question the judge is deciding in this hearing is not whether the affected vehicles contained such a device, but whether the legal definition is met in certain circumstances. We will continue to defend robustly our position in the high court.\u201d Dieselgate became public in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency revealed how VW and Audi had violated the Clean Air Act, leading to investigations by government agencies around the world in the biggest scandal to hit the car industry in decades. In January former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn and four others were charged in Germany with fraud in connection with the emissions scandal. Winterkorn has denied any personal involvement with the scandal, and the case is not expected to take place until next year.",

Oh, and in case you haven\u2019t realised by now \u2026 he was also devilishly handsome.</p> <p>But Jack was also angry, frustrated, selfless, stubborn. He was angry because he saw our society failing those most in need. He was frustrated because the political elite have forgotten why it is important to be fair. He was selfless in his dedication to make things right in every second of his life. Jack devoted his energy to the purpose of Learning Together: a pioneering programme to bring students from university and prisons together to share their unique perspectives on justice. Unlike many of us, Jack did not just go to work. He lived and breathed fire in his pursuit of a better world for all humanity, particularly those most in need.</p> <p>If Jack could comment on his death \u2013 and the tragic incident on Friday 29 November \u2013 he would be livid. We would see him ticking it over in his mind before a word was uttered between us. Jack would understand the political timing with visceral clarity.</p> <p>He would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that. What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens.</p> <p>That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that.

      "bodyText": "Jack was proud. Jack was absorbingly intelligent. Jack was fiercely loyal. Jack loved music, art, eating good food with his family, and having more than one pint with his mates. Oh, and in case you haven\u2019t realised by now \u2026 he was also devilishly handsome. But Jack was also angry, frustrated, selfless, stubborn. He was angry because he saw our society failing those most in need. He was frustrated because the political elite have forgotten why it is important to be fair. He was selfless in his dedication to make things right in every second of his life. Jack devoted his energy to the purpose of Learning Together: a pioneering programme to bring students from university and prisons together to share their unique perspectives on justice. Unlike many of us, Jack did not just go to work. He lived and breathed fire in his pursuit of a better world for all humanity, particularly those most in need. If Jack could comment on his death \u2013 and the tragic incident on Friday 29 November \u2013 he would be livid. We would see him ticking it over in his mind before a word was uttered between us. Jack would understand the political timing with visceral clarity. He would be seething at his death, and his life, being used to perpetuate an agenda of hate that he gave his everything fighting against. We should never forget that. What Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens. That door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge. Where we do not consistently undermine our public services, the lifeline of our nation. Jack believed in the inherent goodness of humanity, and felt a deep social responsibility to protect that. Through us all, Jack marches on. Borrow his intelligence, share his drive, feel his passion, burn with his anger, and extinguish hatred with his kindness. Never give up his fight. To Jack Merritt. Now, and forever. \u2022 Jack Merritt\u2019s friends and family have launched a fundraiser to support a celebration of his life, with any additional funds put towards work that promotes the values Jack lived by.

      "body": "<h2>BUZZKILL</h2> <p>The Fiver was reminded of Harold Bishop\u2019s mid-90s resurrection in Neighbours when Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores returned to Watford in September. \u201cI thought he was dead!\u201d yelped Granny Fiver, spitting out her sherry and coming out in a cold sweat when she spotted the Spaniard back in the Hornets\u2019 dugout. \u201cWoah! Get a grip, Granny! It\u2019s not a soap opera, it\u2019s Watford v Arsenal. It\u2019s real,\u201d we explained, while fumbling around for her Xanax. Just three months and one league win later, Flores has again been axed from the show \u2013 because that\u2019s what Watford have become. Forget, Arsenal, Spurs and Manchester United \u2013 for ridiculous soap opera-standard drama you want to get yourself down to Vicarage Road. The club have sacked more managers than they have won league games this season, with the Pozzo family going the full Palermo in its approach to running the club.<br><br>\u201cThe appointment of a new head coach is imminent and with nearly two thirds of the season remaining, we will provide all the support necessary to make the coming months successful,\u201d parped a Watford statement after Saturday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Southampton. On Monday, they revealed an announcement is not that imminent after all, because academy manager Hayden Mullins will take charge for the inevitable defeat at Leicester. The Fiver can\u2019t wait to see which manager pops up next. If recent history is anything to go by, Javi Gracia would be the obvious choice, given that he probably still has a valid security pass. A return for Dave Bassett could come with a deal for an Amazon documentary attached, Gianfranco Zola would be good for ratings, while the second coming of Magic Marco Silva at Christmas would be pure pantomime, if only Everton would sack him already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/01/watford-expected-to-sack-quique-sanchez-flores-and-hire-chris-hughton-football\">Watford sack Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores and look to appoint Chris Hughton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadly, the leading names being linked with the club appear to be sensible options: Chris Hughton and Sam Allardyce, two men with seasoned survival tactics so tediously effective that Watford could be in danger of stumbling upon stability if they kept hold of either of them. Even the wildcard choice, former Betis boss Quique Seti\u00e9n, is known for bringing consistency and identity to his teams. Could it be that the Pozzos have realised that winging it through a kaleidoscope of managerial chaos might not be the best way to secure mid-table mediocrity after all?<br><br>With games against Liverpool, Manchester United and Sheffield United coming up, Watford need to choose their next manager wisely. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Pozzos are considering putting the brakes on their free-jazz approach to running the club. At least Allardyce or Hughton would be good for Granny Fiver\u2019s blood pressure. We\u2019re not sure she could handle another Hornet being resurrected on live TV.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join John Brewin for live non-football coverage of the FA Cup third-round draw and Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony, as our STOP FOOTBALL campaign finally gains traction.</a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve mentioned my taxi ride with [Brendan] before.

Somewhat unfunny, overly pun-laden and tenuously linked to football. But I want to be serious for once. The continued pain of Liverpool people \u2013 not fans of one club \u2013 over Hillsborough is very distressing to me, a visitor and resident of that city for 10 years. Scousers opened their hearts to me, and I to them. Their friendship and welcoming city deserves far more than they have been given so far. Football unites people of all stripes, and so does the city of Liverpool. I stand with the families of the 96 in their pursuit of justice and peace for their lost loved ones. The game of football should unite, not divide\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tate.</p> <p>\u201cFirst it was Ars\u00e8ne at Arsenal, then Emery at the Emirates. Step up, poor beleaguered Ole Gunnar \u2026\u201d \u2013 Rod de Lisle.</p> <p>\u201cDelighted to see I\u2019m not alone in seeing a resemblance between Unai Emery and the manager of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQw3PxYpF1Q\">a certain high-class bureau de change</a>. I posted this observation on Facebook a while ago \u2013 with pictures \u2013 and got three likes. Maybe we\u2019re as funny as each other. What a sobering thought\u201d \u2013 Nick Wiltsher.</p> <p>\u201cI unashamedly admit to laughing out loud when I read that you trademarked Humility Man\u2122. Oh my, I\u2019m laughing again.

      "bodyText": "BUZZKILL The Fiver was reminded of Harold Bishop\u2019s mid-90s resurrection in Neighbours when Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores returned to Watford in September. \u201cI thought he was dead!\u201d yelped Granny Fiver, spitting out her sherry and coming out in a cold sweat when she spotted the Spaniard back in the Hornets\u2019 dugout. \u201cWoah! Get a grip, Granny! It\u2019s not a soap opera, it\u2019s Watford v Arsenal. It\u2019s real,\u201d we explained, while fumbling around for her Xanax. Just three months and one league win later, Flores has again been axed from the show \u2013 because that\u2019s what Watford have become. Forget, Arsenal, Spurs and Manchester United \u2013 for ridiculous soap opera-standard drama you want to get yourself down to Vicarage Road. The club have sacked more managers than they have won league games this season, with the Pozzo family going the full Palermo in its approach to running the club. \u201cThe appointment of a new head coach is imminent and with nearly two thirds of the season remaining, we will provide all the support necessary to make the coming months successful,\u201d parped a Watford statement after Saturday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Southampton. On Monday, they revealed an announcement is not that imminent after all, because academy manager Hayden Mullins will take charge for the inevitable defeat at Leicester. The Fiver can\u2019t wait to see which manager pops up next. If recent history is anything to go by, Javi Gracia would be the obvious choice, given that he probably still has a valid security pass. A return for Dave Bassett could come with a deal for an Amazon documentary attached, Gianfranco Zola would be good for ratings, while the second coming of Magic Marco Silva at Christmas would be pure pantomime, if only Everton would sack him already. Sadly, the leading names being linked with the club appear to be sensible options: Chris Hughton and Sam Allardyce, two men with seasoned survival tactics so tediously effective that Watford could be in danger of stumbling upon stability if they kept hold of either of them. Even the wildcard choice, former Betis boss Quique Seti\u00e9n, is known for bringing consistency and identity to his teams. Could it be that the Pozzos have realised that winging it through a kaleidoscope of managerial chaos might not be the best way to secure mid-table mediocrity after all? With games against Liverpool, Manchester United and Sheffield United coming up, Watford need to choose their next manager wisely. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Pozzos are considering putting the brakes on their free-jazz approach to running the club. At least Allardyce or Hughton would be good for Granny Fiver\u2019s blood pressure. We\u2019re not sure she could handle another Hornet being resurrected on live TV.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned my taxi ride with [Brendan] before. He was with us here at beIN Sports after losing his job at Liverpool. I won\u2019t go into detail, but during the journey back to his hotel, he left me with absolutely no doubt that Arsenal\u2019s was the job he coveted\u201d \u2013 Richard Keys won\u2019t go into detail on Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Arsenal inspirations. RECOMMENDED LISTENING A piping-hot new edition of Football Weekly is over here. FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs the long-suffering editors of The Fiver will know, I occasionally send in a letter in keeping with the general tone of Fiver letters. Somewhat unfunny, overly pun-laden and tenuously linked to football. But I want to be serious for once. The continued pain of Liverpool people \u2013 not fans of one club \u2013 over Hillsborough is very distressing to me, a visitor and resident of that city for 10 years. Scousers opened their hearts to me, and I to them. Their friendship and welcoming city deserves far more than they have been given so far. Football unites people of all stripes, and so does the city of Liverpool. I stand with the families of the 96 in their pursuit of justice and peace for their lost loved ones. The game of football should unite, not divide\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tate. \u201cFirst it was Ars\u00e8ne at Arsenal, then Emery at the Emirates. Step up, poor beleaguered Ole Gunnar \u2026\u201d \u2013 Rod de Lisle. \u201cDelighted to see I\u2019m not alone in seeing a resemblance between Unai Emery and the manager of a certain high-class bureau de change. I posted this observation on Facebook a while ago \u2013 with pictures \u2013 and got three likes. Maybe we\u2019re as funny as each other. What a sobering thought\u201d \u2013 Nick Wiltsher. \u201cI unashamedly admit to laughing out loud when I read that you trademarked Humility Man\u2122. Oh my, I\u2019m laughing again. Mourinho\u2019s new nickname is appropriate and humorous on so many different levels. Thank you for making my day!\u201d \u2013 Elizabeth Frederiksen [the er, cheque\u2019s in the post, Liz]. \u201cI just won a game of Scrabble by playing the word FIVER. Is this the first case of Britain\u2019s favourite daily teatime football email being useful for something?\u201d \u2013 Richard O\u2019Hagan. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Kick-offs in all of January\u2019s FA Cup third round games will be delayed by one minute to help promote mental health awareness, the FA has announced. Working in partnership with the Heads Up campaign and the NHS\u2019s Every Mind Matters, the initiative aims to get fans thinking about their mental wellbeing. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid fans may be punished with a partial stadium closure after they chanted \u201cGriezmann, die\u201d at their former striker on his return to the Wanda Metropolitano with Barcelona. Several objects were thrown on to the pitch, including a black umbrella. Dwight McNeil for England? Sean Dyche is firing up the bandwagon. \u201cWhen I see some of the other young players getting called up, he can\u2019t be that far away in my opinion,\u201d Dyche croaked. Sergio Ag\u00fcero will sit out the weekend\u2019s Manchester derby due to his ongoing thigh knack, according to Pep Guardiola, who has also defended his continued trust in Fernandinho as a centre-back. \u201cHave you seen him play?\u201d he pouted. After rather fudging the question on Sunday, Brendan Rodgers has clarified his commitment to Leicester. \u201cWhy would I want to leave at this time?\u201d he roared, to set fans of the Queen\u2019s Celtic scoffing. And finally a nod to Ajax\u2019s terrifying under-12s outfit, who showed no mercy to MVV Maastricht\u2019s youth side, winning Saturday\u2019s contest by 50 goals to one. STILL WANT MORE? Pep Lijnders, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool lieutenant, talks secret friendlies, pressing and paddle tennis with Arthur Renard. Ten things we learned from an entirely decent weekend in the Prem.

Despite its widespread impact on women\u2019s health, the causes and risk factors for PCOS are still largely unknown.</p> <p>The condition is linked to abnormal levels of hormones, in particular high amounts of insulin, the hormone that controls sugar levels. The extra insulin causes the ovaries to overproduce testosterone, which in turn can disrupt the woman\u2019s periods and make it hard to get pregnant. The condition, which also raises the risk of type 2 diabetes, is exacerbated by obesity.</p> <p>Previous studies of PCOS suggest that genetics explains only 10% of its heritability. To further understand its drivers, Stener-Victorin ran a series of animal studies. She found that when mice in the late stage of pregnancy had testosterone injections to mimic PCOS, their female mouse pups grew up to have PCOS-like symptoms. The disorder was passed on for up to three generations. The findings suggest that high levels of male sex hormones in the womb, which are brought on by PCOS, are a major factor in passing the condition on.</p> <p>Writing in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0666-1\"> Nature Medicine</a>, the scientists describe how they identified four genes that were expressed at abnormal levels in both the mouse eggs and in serum taken from daughters of women with PCOS. If further work confirms the genes\u2019 role in PCOS, they could potentially form the basis for a screening test in young women, Stener-Victorin said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is very important for women with PCOS to be diagnosed and treated, if possible maybe lowering the androgen levels, because it may affect their future children and grandchildren,\u201d Stener-Victorin told the Guardian.</p> <p>Doctors tend to rely on a combination of assessments to diagnose PCOS, such as infrequent periods, high levels of testosterone and ultrasound scans, which can often pick up affected ovaries.</p> <p>The condition has no cure, but obese people can improve their symptoms by eating a diet rich in fruit and vegetables and reducing their weight. Many women who struggle to conceive because of PCOS are helped with drugs such as clomifene, which can re-establish regular periods, and metformin, a diabetes drug that helps lower insulin in the blood.</p> <p>\u201cThis group has done some excellent animal work to understand the mechanisms behind PCOS, but it is too early to extrapolate the findings to humans,\u201d said Stephen Franks, professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College, London. \u201cThere are indications that there are transgenerational effects of PCOS in human offspring, but we need more evidence to fully understand the picture.\u201d</p>",

If further work confirms the genes\u2019 role in PCOS, they could potentially form the basis for a screening test in young women, Stener-Victorin said. \u201cIt is very important for women with PCOS to be diagnosed and treated, if possible maybe lowering the androgen levels, because it may affect their future children and grandchildren,\u201d Stener-Victorin told the Guardian. Doctors tend to rely on a combination of assessments to diagnose PCOS, such as infrequent periods, high levels of testosterone and ultrasound scans, which can often pick up affected ovaries. The condition has no cure, but obese people can improve their symptoms by eating a diet rich in fruit and vegetables and reducing their weight. Many women who struggle to conceive because of PCOS are helped with drugs such as clomifene, which can re-establish regular periods, and metformin, a diabetes drug that helps lower insulin in the blood. \u201cThis group has done some excellent animal work to understand the mechanisms behind PCOS, but it is too early to extrapolate the findings to humans,\u201d said Stephen Franks, professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College, London. \u201cThere are indications that there are transgenerational effects of PCOS in human offspring, but we need more evidence to fully understand the picture.\u201d",

The report could have fresh implications for the impact of global heating on human health. In the US, about 25,000 babies were born up to two weeks early each year as a result of heatwaves between 1969 and 1988, according to the research published in Nature Climate Change (NCC). Childbirth rates increased by 5% on days when temperatures reached 90F, but access to air conditioning mitigated three-quarters of the impact of heat exposure. Across the world, hot days are getting hotter and more frequent as a result of global heating. If greenhouse gas emissions are not significantly curtailed, by the end of the century the National Climate Assessment estimates there will be up to 30 more days over 90F each year in the US. Another study projects that the annual number of days above 100F will double. In the NCC study, researchers analysed 56 million births in counties across the US \u2013 the most comprehensive investigation into the correlation between temperature and gestation. The average gestation period \u2013 or full term pregnancy \u2013 is 40 weeks. While very premature babies face the biggest medical challenges, multiple longitudinal studies demonstrate that late preterm (babies born at 34 to 36 weeks) and early term (37 to 38 weeks) deliveries pose a significant risk to survival, growth and development. In later life, these slightly early babies are more likely to have respiratory problems and higher blood pressure, as well as an increased risk of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Academic outcomes are also negatively affected in early babies, according to a millennium cohort study of 6,000 British children. Globally, late preterm and early term babies already account for a third of all births, with numbers in the US rising. Unless action is taken to mitigate the risks, by the end of the century an additional 42,000 babies will be delivered early annually in the US.

It\u2019s maybe a fair point. Personally I know we will get a lot of traffic to the site via search for Black Friday <em>[and Cyber Monday today]</em>, and if I can try and direct people to more sustainable and ethical choices than if they landed on a different newspaper website, then I think it is worth us doing, and providing a service to our readers. Today I\u2019m trying to be the Black Friday <em>[and now Cyber Monday]</em> live blog on the web that has a focus on giving, fund-raising and small sustainable businesses, rather than links to [REDACTED BIG BUISNESS] et al. Guardian readers are still going to buy gifts for loved ones, why not try and help them save money. But we keep it under review, I don\u2019t think we live blogged it last year, although I did do a summary article of deals I think, and a Cyber Monday live blog. I appreciate what you are saying though - it is something that we have thought about quite hard.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, I know there will be some of you who very much disagree - but that\u2019s the thinking behind it.

They are offering 25% off some indoor furniture, 20% off gifts including watches (do people still wear those?). There are also discounts <a href=\"https://www.argos.co.uk/list/shop-all-cyber-monday-kitchenaid-at-argos?tag=ar:events:cybermonday:deals:kitchenaid\">specifically on KitchenAid products</a>. </p> <h2>Lidl</h2> <p>Lidl have <a href=\"https://www.lidl.co.uk/en/c/black-friday-deals/c1272\">a page full of offers here</a> - including on the retro Sega Mega Drive mini console which has instantly sent me into a nostalgia frenzy.</p> <h2>Tesco</h2> <p>Tesco were doing an in-store clearance for Black Friday, but that is over now.</p> <h2>Waitrose</h2> <p>There\u2019s <a href=\"http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waitrosecellar.com%2F&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/nov/29/black-friday-2019-best-deals-bargains-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ddfd34c8f087410d98746bc\">a free bottle of champagne</a> when you order wine from the Waitrose Cellar apparently. They are also making a big deal about having the #1 Mince Pies - although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/28/mince-pies-tasted-by-baker-alice-fevronia-it-screams-christmas\">we reckoned that the M&amp;S ones were better</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5de4b7b38f08cd6fe586f8a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-belam\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T07:12:26.929Z\">7.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning, it is Martin Belam here, with our live blog for Cyber Monday. A live blog for Cyber Monday, you say? Are you sure Guardian?</p> <p>Well, yes. There\u2019s a couple of things different about the way we do it. It\u2019s not just a long list of major retailers with affiliate links in - although full disclaimer, there will be some of that. What we did on Black Friday was try and shine a spotlight and some smaller and more sustainable and ethical businesses, gently steering you towards buying Christmas gifts from loved ones that aren\u2019t going to ravage the planet to quite the same extent. And we try to avoid recommending companies with poor labour practices, and we don\u2019t promote any offers on flights.</p> <p>We also included some tips to reduce the impact of your Christmas shopping on the environment. And it is full of my terrible jokes, which are worth the price of the free admission alone. </p> <p>Anyway, the main thing you need to know is if you email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com with suggestions of smaller, sustainable, ethical businesses with special offers on today, and there\u2019s a good chance that I will feature them\u2026</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And that is that from me for this year. I hope you might have found some of this useful - it\u2019s worth having a flick through Friday\u2019s blog as well, as some of those deals are still active until midnight tonight. Thanks for reading. Have a good Christmas - and I\u2019ll maybe see you here next year! Lily\u2019s Kitchen are offering 20% off absolutely everything until the end of today using the code \u2018BLACKFRIDAY\u2019, meaning it\u2019s totally acceptable to treat your cat or dog to a gourmet Christmas lunch. Made.com will run their \u2018up to 20% off and free delivery\u2019 sale until midnight tonight, including some items from their very snazzy range for pets. Pets at Home have up to 40% off dog accessories and up to 50% off cat accessories and grooming products. Importantly for any pet owner, Shark are offering their vacuum that\u2019s specifically designed for homes with pets at \u00a3179.99 (usually \u00a3299.99). And with our sustainable hat on, Yora Pet Foods are offering what they claim is the world\u2019s most sustainable dog food. Just don\u2019t tell your K-9 what is in it. Not On The High Street champion small sellers and have a refreshing take on children\u2019s gifts, with between 20-50% off in their Cyber Monday sale. You\u2019ll find personalised penguin dressing gowns (\u00a315) and bracelet making kits (\u00a313.56), and seemingly everything in between. John Lewis are ending their Black Friday event today, which includes 20% off LEGO and loads of other great deals across their toys section. Debenhams also have up to 20% off for Cyber Monday which extends to their children\u2019s toys, with over 900 products listed as part of the offer. Smyths Toys are offering special deals on all sorts of children\u2019s toys, from games consoles and bundles to \u2018Ride On Unicorns\u2019 (yes, really!). It\u2019s also worth mentioning that if you buy in-store, you\u2019ll get an additional \u00a35 off when you spend \u00a350 or more, or \u00a310 when you spend \u00a3100 or more. Other Cyber Monday toy sales include Bright Minds (up to 50% off educational children\u2019s toys), The Entertainer (up to 75% off), George at Asda (including 20% off wooden toys) and Etsy (up to 70% off). Waterstones and Foyles have up to half price off popular sellers including Jamie Oliver\u2019s \u2018Veg\u2019 and David Walliams\u2019 \u2018The Beast of Buckingham Palace\u2019 so it looks like they are fairly well matched if you are looking for a good deal on books this Cyber Monday. Foyles are promoting free delivery, whereas Waterstones are only offering free delivery on all orders over \u00a320. But on the other hand, if you missed the hype, Waterstones have 50% off Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u2018The Testaments\u2019. If you\u2019d rather listen to your literature, Audible are still running their \u201850% off for 4 months\u2019 offer for Cyber Monday, whereas it\u2019s usually \u00a37.99 per month. I should add, in an \u201cOther TV listings magazines are available\u201d kind of voice, that you can also get books from the Guardian Bookshop. Not sure what to gift someone as a book? My colleague Justine Jordan has just listed the best fiction of 2019. In fact we have a whole range of listings of what our critics thought were the best books of the year in various genre - and this selection of what the year\u2019s best writers are recommending. There\u2019s something rather quaint about the idea of Cyber Monday, which is now *checks notes* in its fifteenth year. It started in 2005, when I guess it was reasonable to assume that if you were going to do something as risky as order someone\u2019s present online, you needed to leave four weeks for it to get delivered to you. How times change. Personally, I\u2019m a bit unsure of having talking speakers in your house connected to computers somewhere else to \u201cdo things\u201d for you. On the one hand it has got the kind of Star Trek vibe that you would think would appeal to the geek in me. On the other hand, it could just be that Douglas Adams\u2019 thing: \u201cAnything invented after you\u2019re thirty-five is against the natural order of things\u201d. Certainly I find myself shouting \u201cPlay Katherine Hepburn by Sparks featuring Christi Haydon\u201d and confusing the poor thing and wondering if it wasn\u2019t just easier when I had CDs and had to get out of my chair. However, if you are in the market for smart speakers, there are some very cheap deals out there. John Lewis has lots of deals on Google Home speakers, from the Mini Hands-Free Speaker for \u00a319 (\u00a330 off) to \u00a3100 off the Max Hands-Free Smart Speaker, selling at \u00a3199 (it\u2019s the same deal at Curry\u2019s). Choose from the exciting colours of Chalk or Charcoal\u2026 If Apple is more your thing, the Homepod has \u00a350 off and is selling at \u00a3229. Curry\u2019s also has \u00a350 off the SONOS One Wireless Multi-Room Speaker, selling at \u00a3149. When it comes to headphones, Beats by Dre are still among the best-selling - Curry\u2019s (again) has the wireless version for \u00a379.99, and Apple AirPods at \u00a3138, down \u00a321. John Lewis is selling the Bose Quiet Comfort Noise Cancelling Headphones for \u00a3229, so \u00a370 off. So you\u2019ll see lots of advice around about being careful about shopping over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend and making sure that things are genuinely a bargain. I\u2019ve just had the positive side of the experience, which is something that I needed and had been tracking the price of just dropped by 30%. Which was great news. I snapped it up, and just have to stop buying coffee before work now to fund it \ud83d\udc40 . Talking of coffee - this is such an amazing segue I should definitely be in local radio - one thing I had sent to me were these compostable Halo coffee capsules which are compatible with Nespresso machines. After you\u2019ve used them they apparently degrade completely in your compost bin or flower bed in less than 90 days. You can ditch the plastic or aluminium capsules, and the offer today appears to be 2 free packs when you order 6. Is there a stationery nerd in your life? Is it you? Papier have 20% off everything which will end at midnight tonight, including Christmas cards and gifts, like their personalised diaries, notebooks and stationery sets. If you stock up on enough stocking fillers and spend \u00a340, you\u2019ll also get free delivery. Ohh Deer are giving customers 50% off Christmas cards and wrapping paper for Cyber Monday, and they still have some offers left in their Black Friday event on advent calendars, planners and more. Paperchase are also weighing in with 25% off \u2018almost everything\u2019 until midnight. Moleskine are \u2018turning paper digital\u2019 for the day and offering up to 40% off selected lines. Right, I\u2019ve just had my lunch, I\u2019ve got food on my mind\u2026 Ethical Superstore are running 20% off groceries and everyday items, which covers their festive food (including vegan festive food) range, and Ethical Superstore will also be \u2018donating much-needed grocery items to the Newcastle West End Foodbank\u2019 with every single order over \u00a330 until midnight tonight. M&amp;S has 25% off wine cases when you buy two - for example, buy two of this \u2018Seasonal Six\u2019 case and save \u00a328.25 overall, getting 12 bottles of wine for \u00a384.75. Morrison\u2019s is offering a third off all Champagne. Meanwhile, Majestic are offering up to 50% off for \u2018one day only\u2019 when you mix 6 bottles. Honest Brew have up to 40% off beers, mixed cases and hampers, while Beer Bods have taken 50% off their gift beer subscriptions. Wine subscriptions site Savage Vines has 20% off sitewide with the code BLACK19. Not necessarily just for Cyber Monday but you can get 4 for 3 party food platters on M&amp;S, and they\u2019ve got free delivery on hampers. Sainsbury\u2019s will give you a \u00a35 Argos voucher AND a free chocolate pug from Cocoa et Co if you order a shop worth more than \u00a380. This is one is only for the super-organised which probably rules me out: select your date of pick-up for the 22, 23 or 24 December. Thinking about cutting down carbs before Christmas? No, I\u2019m not either, but just in case - low-carb aficionados Lo-Dough have some discounts today, like their Taster Kit for \u00a310. Hotel Chocolat are offering two free chocolatey gifts when you spend \u00a325 or more with them today, so you can pick up presents for sweet-toothed friends (chocolate penguin anyone?) and sort out your post-roast nibbles at the same time. One absolute \u201cUrgh!\u201d of Black Friday is I\u2019ve just seen some stats about the increased number of flights sold over the weekend. No thank you. Instead of suggesting holidays with flights involved, here are a few flight-free options: First things first, you can save up to \u00a3200 per booking on rail holidays from The Guardian Holidays and up to 10% off Spring and Summer bookings on Guardian Cottages. Canopy and Stars aren\u2019t doing a traditional Cyber Monday discount, but they are offering an additional \u00a350 when you buy a \u00a3150 Christmas gift card. Forest Holidays offer short breaks \u2018in the UK\u2019s most beautiful forests\u2019 and they are currently running 20% off all breaks, with low deposits on selected holidays. The National Trust are offering 10% off Winter Getaways and 15% off bookings for 10 or more guests. More sustainable fashion: Rapanui are doing a \u201cbuy one get one tree\u201d offer - a reminder that you are more likely to feature on this blog if you\u2019ve got some kind of pun going for you. They are an interesting business because they say their \u201clifelong mission is to make clothing sustainable\u201d. Everything they make has a freepost coupon and a \u00a35 voucher built. When the clothes are worn out, people can send them back to get \u00a35 off their next purchase - and Rapanui then make new products from the material they recover. Gandys is another potential source of clothes and travel gear trying to have a positive effect on the world. There\u2019s up to 70% off today. Founders Rob and Paul lost their parents in the Boxing Day tsunami that hit Sri Lanka, and sales of their travel brand contribute towards building children\u2019s homes for orphans in Sri Lanka, Malawi, Brazil and Nepal. Another sustainable way of doing fashion? Make the clothes yourself. We are knitters are offering up to 40% off today, while Wool and the Gang are offering 30% off everything. Let\u2019s celebrate a strong pun game there, too. If knitting is beyond your skills, you can also find pre-knitted discounts at the Wool Room, with 40% of bedding sets, and 35% of everything else. They make the point that their products are made of 100% British wool, though I\u2019m not personally 100% convinced sheep are especially aware of the concept of the nation state. I\u2019m not a fashionable chap myself - I\u2019ve basically retained an indie uniform of black jeans, black t-shirt and black jumper since getting into Joy Division and The Cure back in 1862. I\u2019ve got a scarf with some light grey and white stripes in it, and one of my kids the other day said \u201cDad, that is the brightest colours you ever wear.\u201d You, on the other hand, may feel like something a bit more exciting, so these deals might be to your taste: Levi\u2019s are running 30% off everything today, so if you are looking for jeans for you or a loved one, they are worth a look, especially as they reduce up to 96% of the water normally used in denim finishing. Everlane are taking a different approach today, with a \u2018choose what you pay\u2019 one-day event. Across womenswear and menswear, you can choose how much of a discount you get (by the looks of things, this is up to around 40%), or whether you pay full price in the knowledge that the brand will use the money ethically. H&amp;M\u2019s Cyber Monday sale is here with up to 50% off selected items, with the offers extending to their Conscious range (which covers Womenswear and Menswear) We mentioned People Tree on Friday who pioneer in the Fair Trade fashion space, and their \u201830% off everything\u2019 sale ends this evening at midnight. COS are also offering 20% off their \u2018wardrobe staples\u2019 and free shipping. Reformation\u2019s claim is that they are the most sustainable fashion option, second to being naked - they have got a much anticipated 30% off for Cyber Monday. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve mentioned nudity in a Cyber Monday live blog, but there we go. Probably worth a reminder at this point for those of you asking \u201cWhy is the Guardian doing this?\u201d Here\u2019s the email I was sending to people on Friday when they were messaging me asking why we were covering Black Friday: \u201cHey, thanks for your email. It\u2019s maybe a fair point. Personally I know we will get a lot of traffic to the site via search for Black Friday [and Cyber Monday today], and if I can try and direct people to more sustainable and ethical choices than if they landed on a different newspaper website, then I think it is worth us doing, and providing a service to our readers. Today I\u2019m trying to be the Black Friday [and now Cyber Monday] live blog on the web that has a focus on giving, fund-raising and small sustainable businesses, rather than links to [REDACTED BIG BUISNESS] et al. Guardian readers are still going to buy gifts for loved ones, why not try and help them save money. But we keep it under review, I don\u2019t think we live blogged it last year, although I did do a summary article of deals I think, and a Cyber Monday live blog. I appreciate what you are saying though - it is something that we have thought about quite hard.\u201d Anyway, I know there will be some of you who very much disagree - but that\u2019s the thinking behind it. For those of you who\u2019d like to recommend anything in the ethical, sustainable, small business bucket, pop it in the comments or chuck me an email at martin.belam@theguardian.com and I may feature it. Put the Guardian\u2019s resident Doctor Who nerd in charge of a Cyber Monday live blog and it is inevitable that the Cybermen are going to feature. If you are a fan of Doctor Who, Big Finish have a selection of discounts on their audiobooks and dramas. You need to use the code DOCTOR20 to access the offers which includes one of the greatest ever Cybermen stories - Spare Parts - for just one of your Earth Pounds. That\u2019s about twenty Grotzits in Andromedan money. In the offer there are also some of their stories featuring the late John Hurt reprising his 50th anniversary special one-off TV appearance as the Doctor - which I always found enjoyable as it was lovely to hear him as the character again. If you are going to be baking for Christmas, the holy grail for home bakers sees some pretty decent discounting this weekend, depending on your colour preferences. Curry\u2019s may offer the best deal with \u00a3220 off the Artisan Stand Mixer with a 4.8 litre bowl, selling at \u00a3279 - hope you like the colour \u2018latte\u2019. AO offers the same deal in space grey, while you\u2019ll need to pay an extra \u00a320 for the candy apple red model at John Lewis. Robert Dyas has the 4.3L Classic in black for \u00a3249.99. To accessorize, you can pick up the Ice Cream Maker attachment for \u00a345 at Lakeland, with the flex edge beater attachment at \u00a317.50 (no need for spatulas - if you know, you know). Talking of mindfulness, it is a truth universally acknowledged that home printers are the devil\u2019s work and that trying to get them to print something is usually the very opposite of a calming yogic experience. If you are going to spend half your monthly salary on replacement ink to print out the gig ticket you opted to \u2018print at home\u2019 because it saved you \u00a31.50 on the delivery charge, you might as well do it today and get money off - there\u2019s 30% off own brand ink cartridges from the Cartridge People. Out of the things people are suggesting to me I\u2019m maybe skewed towards things for kids, as I have two at ages where they are a bit shrug shoulders and muttering \u201cI dunno, stuff\u201d when you ask them what they want for Christmas. I\u2019m not sure these would work for my two - karate is more their thing than yoga - but Super Yogis make these flash cards. Each card has a super hero theme based around yoga, with an instruction, breathing technique or exercise on the back. It does look like an interesting way to introduce 7-12 year olds to some of the concepts around mindfulness. There is a discount on them today. Sali Hughes mentioned Spectrum Brushes in her \u201840 best sustainable beauty brands\u2019 piece earlier in the year, and for Cyber Monday they are offering up to 75% off (even on stocking fillers) and free shipping on orders over \u00a330. Kiehls are running a 20% discount on all their products (including gift sets) when you buy two or more items and use the code \u2018BLACKFRIDAY\u2019. Plus, there\u2019s free shopping regardless of how much you spend and their Christmas range with festive designs is a great option for gifting. The Body Shop are also doing up to 30% off with the code \u201814664\u2019 when you spend \u00a35. They are a useful go to for awkward relatives to gift to, since everybody has to wash. There have been some questions around their ethics over the years, but they claim to remain committed to cruelty-free beauty and ethical business as part of Natura&amp;Co. Glossier, arguably the most talked about beauty brand of 2019 [it says here in my notes], are offering 20% off absolutely everything, and up to 35% off their sets. Of the larger Beauty retailers, Lookfantastic are offering 25% off your order when you use the code \u2018CYBER\u2019 and up to a 50% discount on selected items, meanwhile Beauty Bay are offering up to 50% off selected lines and Boots and Superdrug are both offering up to 50% off their \u2018Christmas Gift\u2019 edits. Treatwell falls into this category but instead of selling beauty products, they are the largest hair and beauty bookings website in Europe and they are offering up to 50% off for Cyber Monday. You can book anything from a full-blown spa treatment to an appointment to get your nails done, if that\u2019s your thing. If you do take up that Guardian Soulmates offer I just mentioned, there\u2019s a chance you might end up with kids* - in which case why not stock up in advance with Anorak magazine, which describes itself as a \u2018happy mag\u2019 for kids, is printed on recycled paper with vegetable ink, and there\u2019s 20% off today. [*Please don\u2019t ask me how this happens in the comments today] It would be remiss of me not to mention this Guardian offer. If you sign up to Guardian Soulmates today you can get 50% off, potentially meet the love of your life, and then apply to be in our \u2018how we met\u2019 column, citing this live blog - or should I say love blog? - as the cause. And\u2026I\u2019m back. It isn\u2019t a Cyber Monday offer, but I noticed during my commute that the FA are advertising that if you buy your tickets for England\u2019s friendly with Denmark next year before 13 December, you\u2019ll get a Christmas card from Gareth Southgate. A Christmas card from Gareth Southgate. I can\u2019t stop laughing. Anyways, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we are trying to do Black Friday/Cyber Monday/Whatsitsname Tuesday live blogs with a difference here at the Guardian this year, so here\u2019s some advice from Madeleine Sugden on how, if you are cursed with having to do secret Santa in the office, you can do it in a way that doesn\u2019t just mean swapping loads of plastic tat: Be a good Secret Santa 2019 Right, so far I\u2019ve been doing this from home in between chucking corn flakes at the kids and shouting \u201cBrush your teeth!\u201d every two minutes, but I\u2019m now going to make the mad dash from Walthamstow into the Guardian offices. Yes, of course I will be listening to East 17\u2019s \u201cStay Another Day\u201d on repeat on the commute, as is the law around these parts at this time of year. Don\u2019t forget to email me - martin.belam@theguardian.com - if you\u2019d like to suggest small, sustainable and ethical businesses who have special offers on today, and I\u2019ll be carrying this blog on in about an hour\u2019s time. See you then. Peloton have taken \u00a3209 off their Works Package, with free accessories - though that is still a hefty investment at \u00a31,990. Powerhouse Fitness have a BodyMax B2 Indoor Exercise Bike and H2Row Rowing Machine for 51% off at \u00a3548.98. The Life Fitness T3 Treadmill has \u00a3500 off on John Lewis. On the bike front, Evans Cycles has 20% off Pinnacle hybrid bikes and 40% off Cannondale road bikes. They\u2019ve also branded the whole thing \u201cBlack Rideay\u201d which appeals to my sense of pun mischief. Halfords has a 20% discount on adult bikes and kids\u2019 bikes, not to mention some car cleaning gift sets if you\u2019re in the market for such a thing - maybe one for the Alan Partridge in your life. Argos has \u00a320 off selected Fitbits. Adidas has up to 65% off products today, and My Protein has 45% off everything. You\u2019d think that John Lewis would have to put prices up to pay for their Christmas ads, but they are offering a big range of discounts on brands with offers that end today. They include 15% off Sonos gear, 40% off Emma Mattresses, 30% off Le Creuset, 20% off UGG, and you can Save \u00a3100 on a Dyson V11 although you have to be careful it doesn\u2019t relocate to Singapore after having promised you that everything here is going to be wonderful. All the John Lewis deals are here. If cameras are your thing, then Canon are offering a puntastic Double Cashblack deal for all of Black Friday weekend, an offer that runs out at the end of tonight. You can get \u00a3160 \u201ccashblack\u201d on an EOS 77D, or \u00a3100 \u201ccashblack\u201d on an EOS 250D. There\u2019s also \u201ccashblack\u201d on a load of lenses and accessories. Please note that I do love a terrible pun, and if you spot an offer featuring one let me know straight away - martin.belam@theguardian.com If you were looking to splash some cash on gadgets today, then going direct to Microsoft is a good bet for deals on the XBox of their Surface Pro range. Save up to \u00a370 on Xbox One S consoles Save \u00a3150 on Xbox One X Save up to \u00a3375 on Surface Pro 7 + Type Cover bundle Save up to \u00a3240 on Surface Pro 7 Save up to \u00a3247 on Surface Pro 7 for Business plus Type Cover bundles I made it a running joke on Black Friday reminding you (i.e. myself) not to buy loved ones a vacuum cleaner for Christmas, regardless of how much of a discount was on it. Where I have had some gifting success in the past was in getting my other half things purporting to come from the kids, which had been personalised with pictures of them. Other printing companies are available, but Vistaprint are offering up to 60% off today. As I mentioned in the preamble, I\u2019m actually more interested in promoting sustainable small businesses that have got special offers on at the moment. On Black Friday we mentioned various things that caught my eye, like the kind of things you find on Not On The High Street. There are also companies doing the whole early December sale thing in a totally different way. Lucy &amp; Yak, for example, are offering donations to Fior Di Loto with every purchase to send girls to school. And fashion brand Pomp are among a host of people offering \u201cBuy one, get one tree\u201d supporting tree planting around the planet. So if you are a smaller, sustainable, ethical business, please do get in touch with me via email and I may feature you. So, to start with some of the basics, a lot of the deals knocking around today look very similar to those that were knocking around on Black Friday - here, for examples, is what the major supermarkets are doing: Argos Cyber Monday ends on Tuesday at Argos - the deals are here. They are offering 25% off some indoor furniture, 20% off gifts including watches (do people still wear those?). There are also discounts specifically on KitchenAid products. Lidl Lidl have a page full of offers here - including on the retro Sega Mega Drive mini console which has instantly sent me into a nostalgia frenzy. Tesco Tesco were doing an in-store clearance for Black Friday, but that is over now. Waitrose There\u2019s a free bottle of champagne when you order wine from the Waitrose Cellar apparently. They are also making a big deal about having the #1 Mince Pies - although we reckoned that the M&amp;S ones were better. Good morning, it is Martin Belam here, with our live blog for Cyber Monday. A live blog for Cyber Monday, you say? Are you sure Guardian? Well, yes. There\u2019s a couple of things different about the way we do it. It\u2019s not just a long list of major retailers with affiliate links in - although full disclaimer, there will be some of that. What we did on Black Friday was try and shine a spotlight and some smaller and more sustainable and ethical businesses, gently steering you towards buying Christmas gifts from loved ones that aren\u2019t going to ravage the planet to quite the same extent. And we try to avoid recommending companies with poor labour practices, and we don\u2019t promote any offers on flights. We also included some tips to reduce the impact of your Christmas shopping on the environment. And it is full of my terrible jokes, which are worth the price of the free admission alone. Anyway, the main thing you need to know is if you email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com with suggestions of smaller, sustainable, ethical businesses with special offers on today, and there\u2019s a good chance that I will feature them\u2026",

I think I might be too old and too pleased with myself to be obedient.\u201d In a brief speech alongside Umunna amid a crowd of Lib Dem activists, Grant said voters should \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to stop a Conservative government. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound dramatic \u2013 even though you could argue that is my job \u2013 but I really think we are facing a national emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that what is left of the Conservative party, once they\u2019ve expelled anyone who was responsible or decent or sane, is something I can contemplate as the government of a country that I love.\u201d Speaking to reporters afterwards, Grant said he feared \u201ca Tory majority who will take us out of the EU and in an almost certainly chaotic fashion\u201d. He said: \u201cBecause like many I give no credence to the argument that one year will be enough to make a new free trade with the EU, and that therefore we will crash out at the end of 2020. And I want to do my modest bit to try and prevent that national catastrophe.\u201d Asked if he was surprised to find himself knocking on doors to canvass for a politician, Grant said: \u201cI did used to sell fire extinguishers door-to-door. I was very good. I also sold coat hanger covers. They\u2019re brilliant. I might go back to that, actually.\u201d",

I\u2019ve heard all pf your arguments. Attenborough is a living legend. Attenborough is 93 years old.

Let\u2019s get David Attenborough to narrate The Apprentice. Come on. It isn\u2019t like he hasn\u2019t narrated people before. He used to do it all the time with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/20/david-attenborough-early-films-in-colour-bbc-zoo-quest\">The Zoo Quest Expeditions</a>, explaining the traditions and behaviours of the tribespeople he\u2019d come across. And if he can do it for them, why can\u2019t he do it for the sort of bloodless perambulating shark-eyed morons that populate The Apprentice? </p> <p>And maybe it\u2019s actually what this country needs now. Yes yes, plastic is bad, we know that now. But what about hearing a voice of hushed authority explaining the behaviour of the candidates. After all, it helped with tigers. Once, tigers were unknowably ferocious animals who urinated on anything they wanted as a show of might. But now Attenborough has explained the method behind their urination \u2013 it\u2019s a way of communicating surprisingly complex messages with other tigers \u2013 we can understand them a little more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34d9a31aadbfca6aba5688be702795392be1c2b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34d9a31aadbfca6aba5688be702795392be1c2b1/48_0_1887_1132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karren Brady and the Seven Worlds, One Planet captions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karren Brady and the Seven Worlds, One Planet captions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter/@wheelygay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wouldn\u2019t it be great if he could do the same with the sort of hateful git who applies to be on The Apprentice? Why did that man just say \u201cI love business more than sharks love blood?\u201d Is it because he really is as stupid as he sounds, or is he perhaps communicating a greater understanding of the struggles of life on Earth as we know it? </p> <p>He could dig back into the Apprentice archives if he wanted, and perhaps explain the behaviour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/10/realitytv.bbc\">Tre Azam</a> from 2007; a man whose anger at the world was so immediate and overcompensatory that it had to have its roots in some deep genetic species-wide pathology. Perhaps he could discuss how the show\u2019s total absence of morality directly created Katie Hopkins. Perhaps, if nothing else, he could explain why Alan Sugar always looks like a grumpy little hedgehog.</p> <p>Honestly, I\u2019d welcome anything. As I\u2019ve explained again and again, I cannot stand The Apprentice, but if The Greatest Englishman Alive offered to provide a running commentary, I\u2019d be back in like a shot.</p>",

But sometimes, just sometimes, magic happens. It happened this weekend, in fact, when an iPlayer glitch meant the text from an episode of Seven Worlds, One Planet played over an episode of The Apprentice. Obviously, this made for rich screenshot material \u2013 a shot of an identikit big-tied candidate gazing neutrally is captioned \u2018the leopard seal is now ready for its next victim\u2019; a moment of boardroom frustration with \u2018this is the toughest time in an animal\u2019s life\u2019. But, besides being unintentionally hilarious, could it have accidentally set an amazing idea in motion: why not get David Attenborough to narrate The Apprentice? Sure, there will be those of you who\u2019ll deride this as folly. I\u2019ve heard all pf your arguments. Attenborough is a living legend. Attenborough is 93 years old. Attenborough is now explicitly discussing the repercussions of the climate emergency, and diverting him from this mission in order to hear his breathy, awestruck voice narrating the catastrophic uber-capitalism of a bunch of reality TV twits would be to literally endanger the future of the planet as we know it. I\u2019ve heard all your arguments. Heck, I\u2019ve even argued most of them myself. And yet my point remains. Let\u2019s get David Attenborough to narrate The Apprentice. Come on. It isn\u2019t like he hasn\u2019t narrated people before. He used to do it all the time with The Zoo Quest Expeditions, explaining the traditions and behaviours of the tribespeople he\u2019d come across. And if he can do it for them, why can\u2019t he do it for the sort of bloodless perambulating shark-eyed morons that populate The Apprentice? And maybe it\u2019s actually what this country needs now. Yes yes, plastic is bad, we know that now. But what about hearing a voice of hushed authority explaining the behaviour of the candidates. After all, it helped with tigers. Once, tigers were unknowably ferocious animals who urinated on anything they wanted as a show of might. But now Attenborough has explained the method behind their urination \u2013 it\u2019s a way of communicating surprisingly complex messages with other tigers \u2013 we can understand them a little more. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if he could do the same with the sort of hateful git who applies to be on The Apprentice? Why did that man just say \u201cI love business more than sharks love blood?\u201d Is it because he really is as stupid as he sounds, or is he perhaps communicating a greater understanding of the struggles of life on Earth as we know it? He could dig back into the Apprentice archives if he wanted, and perhaps explain the behaviour of Tre Azam from 2007; a man whose anger at the world was so immediate and overcompensatory that it had to have its roots in some deep genetic species-wide pathology. Perhaps he could discuss how the show\u2019s total absence of morality directly created Katie Hopkins. Perhaps, if nothing else, he could explain why Alan Sugar always looks like a grumpy little hedgehog. Honestly, I\u2019d welcome anything. As I\u2019ve explained again and again, I cannot stand The Apprentice, but if The Greatest Englishman Alive offered to provide a running commentary, I\u2019d be back in like a shot.",

      "body": "<p>In 2004, in the days before streaming, the arrival of The L Word, a drama all about lesbians, was such an enormous event that a global black market in DVD copies sprang up around it. It is hard to imagine any other television show that has inspired such dedication, if not quite devotion. Women, particularly queer women, came together to watch it, shared discs both legal and otherwise, and developed a complicated, love-hate relationship to its shiny saga of wealthy West Hollywood lesbian life. The show has been passed on and passed down over the years, as new generations have discovered it in their own ways. Partly, its longevity, despite its flaws, stands as a testament to the heady brew the show concocted, but at the same time it stands as an indictment of the fact that nothing has really taken its place since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/24/jennifer-beals-l-world-alpha-female-going-straight-to-top\">Jennifer Beals: The L Word\u2019s alpha female is going straight to the top | Rebecca Nicholson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It might seem odd to make that claim, given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/07/lgbt-tv-characters-all-time-high-women-outnumbering-men\">there are more queer characters on screen than ever before</a>, and more of those are women. The \u201cdead lesbian\u201d trope, in which a queer woman would be introduced then killed off, seems to be dying its own death, at last. I often joke that if there isn\u2019t a queer character in a Netflix show, you wonder if you\u2019ve accidentally skipped an episode. The most recent Glaad Where We Are On TV findings report that 10.2% of primetime regulars are LGBTQ, the highest percentage in its 15-year history of reporting. But often, these characters are part of a bigger story. There is still a sense that as queer viewers, you take all the queerness you can get, even if it\u2019s the B story, which most likely it is.</p> <p>In the 10 years since The L Word ended, in a gloomy cloud of terrible writing and bizarre plot twists \u2013 justice for Jenny \u2013 the internet\u2019s intolerance for mistakes has become ferocious. There was a lot to question, first time around: biphobia and then erasure, unforgivable ethnic stereotyping, and, most famously, its tone-deaf trans storyline. Some also objected to its privilege, wealth and glossy sheen. Personally, I found that flashy, entertaining, camp over-the-top-ness to be one of its main strengths. There are plenty of miserable LGBTQ stories to be found in TV and film history. For the first time, lesbians were fun.

      "bodyText": "In 2004, in the days before streaming, the arrival of The L Word, a drama all about lesbians, was such an enormous event that a global black market in DVD copies sprang up around it. It is hard to imagine any other television show that has inspired such dedication, if not quite devotion. Women, particularly queer women, came together to watch it, shared discs both legal and otherwise, and developed a complicated, love-hate relationship to its shiny saga of wealthy West Hollywood lesbian life. The show has been passed on and passed down over the years, as new generations have discovered it in their own ways. Partly, its longevity, despite its flaws, stands as a testament to the heady brew the show concocted, but at the same time it stands as an indictment of the fact that nothing has really taken its place since. It might seem odd to make that claim, given that there are more queer characters on screen than ever before, and more of those are women. The \u201cdead lesbian\u201d trope, in which a queer woman would be introduced then killed off, seems to be dying its own death, at last. I often joke that if there isn\u2019t a queer character in a Netflix show, you wonder if you\u2019ve accidentally skipped an episode. The most recent Glaad Where We Are On TV findings report that 10.2% of primetime regulars are LGBTQ, the highest percentage in its 15-year history of reporting. But often, these characters are part of a bigger story. There is still a sense that as queer viewers, you take all the queerness you can get, even if it\u2019s the B story, which most likely it is. In the 10 years since The L Word ended, in a gloomy cloud of terrible writing and bizarre plot twists \u2013 justice for Jenny \u2013 the internet\u2019s intolerance for mistakes has become ferocious. There was a lot to question, first time around: biphobia and then erasure, unforgivable ethnic stereotyping, and, most famously, its tone-deaf trans storyline. Some also objected to its privilege, wealth and glossy sheen. Personally, I found that flashy, entertaining, camp over-the-top-ness to be one of its main strengths. There are plenty of miserable LGBTQ stories to be found in TV and film history. For the first time, lesbians were fun.

The Liberal Democrats have committed to providing some compensation but offered no detailed plan or costings.</p> <p>Jenny Hughes has voted Conservative all her life but she will never do so again, she said. \u201cI did the right things all my life, financially, but am now forced to do gardening to keep my head above water, despite my hands being riddled with arthritis. I feel the Conservatives see us 1950s women just as a burden on society, no matter how much we have put in historically.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe have been robbed, ridiculed and our plight ignored by the Conservatives. I now feel guilty and ignorant for having voted for them so long, and guilty that in doing so I thought only of myself and my own status. I will never vote Conservative again.\u201d</p> <p>Gill Wareing works as a civil servant and says she voted Conservative for many years but now feels very let down by them. She has had to sell her house and is now living in a caravan because of the pensions debacle. \u201cBefore Boris became prime minister he stated that he would do what he could to help us,\u201d she said. \u201cNow he says there is no money for us.\u201d</p> <p>Trish Vincent will also abandon a lifelong loyalty to the Tories over the issue. \u201c\u2019I\u2019ve voted Conservative since I was able to.

In contrast, the Labour government has acknowledged the injustice and has come up with a plan to compensate us,\u201d she said. \u201cWho knows if it is an election ploy to get votes? But I will vote Labour on the strength of what they are offering.\u201d</p> <p>Denise Dickson has voted Conservative all her life but also won\u2019t be doing so again. \u201cHaving been a staunch and unwavering lifelong Conservative voter, I am absolutely appalled by the disdain and breathtaking arrogance to which we have been recently subjected to by the Conservative party,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt both pains and shames me but having been cast aside and our plight trivialised and ignored by the current corrupt Conservative party I feel that I must vote Labour because it seemingly has my welfare and future at the heart of their proposals,\u201d she added.</p> <p>There are, however, lifelong Labour voters who will be abandoning Labour at the polls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/23/station-pension-age-women-labour-compensation\">despite their offer</a>.

      "bodyText": "Almost 4 million women born in the 1950s, whose retirement age was increased from 60 to 66, have been weighing their voting intentions since Labour announced a \u00a358bn compensation plan to pay back the \u201chistoric debt of honour\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has said affected women could receive up to \u00a331,300 in compensation, depending on their age. Boris Johnson, who previously pledged to consider the impact of the policy, now says he \u201ccannot promise I can magic up that money\u201d. The Liberal Democrats have committed to providing some compensation but offered no detailed plan or costings. Jenny Hughes has voted Conservative all her life but she will never do so again, she said. \u201cI did the right things all my life, financially, but am now forced to do gardening to keep my head above water, despite my hands being riddled with arthritis. I feel the Conservatives see us 1950s women just as a burden on society, no matter how much we have put in historically.\u201d She added: \u201cWe have been robbed, ridiculed and our plight ignored by the Conservatives. I now feel guilty and ignorant for having voted for them so long, and guilty that in doing so I thought only of myself and my own status. I will never vote Conservative again.\u201d Gill Wareing works as a civil servant and says she voted Conservative for many years but now feels very let down by them. She has had to sell her house and is now living in a caravan because of the pensions debacle. \u201cBefore Boris became prime minister he stated that he would do what he could to help us,\u201d she said. \u201cNow he says there is no money for us.\u201d Trish Vincent will also abandon a lifelong loyalty to the Tories over the issue. \u201c\u2019I\u2019ve voted Conservative since I was able to. Boris said he would look at our campaign but once again has let us down. \u201cI don\u2019t like Corbyn but leaders come and go,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I can believe in Labour, then \u00a331,000 of the \u00a345,000 I\u2019m owed is evidently being given to me in compensation. I\u2019ve spent my entire life worrying about the country, Europe, my kids, the NHS. Now I have to be selfish and worry about me.\u201d Carol Lamb is one of the 1950s women worse hit by the pension changes. She is struggling to survive for the full six extra years without a state pension. \u201cI have always voted Conservative,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am horrified at the injustice imposed by them on millions of women in a similar position to me. \u201cBoris Johnson initially said he might help us but has now changed his mind. In contrast, the Labour government has acknowledged the injustice and has come up with a plan to compensate us,\u201d she said. \u201cWho knows if it is an election ploy to get votes? But I will vote Labour on the strength of what they are offering.\u201d Denise Dickson has voted Conservative all her life but also won\u2019t be doing so again. \u201cHaving been a staunch and unwavering lifelong Conservative voter, I am absolutely appalled by the disdain and breathtaking arrogance to which we have been recently subjected to by the Conservative party,\u201d she said. \u201cIt both pains and shames me but having been cast aside and our plight trivialised and ignored by the current corrupt Conservative party I feel that I must vote Labour because it seemingly has my welfare and future at the heart of their proposals,\u201d she added. There are, however, lifelong Labour voters who will be abandoning Labour at the polls despite their offer. Julie Davenport was a Labour member but says she will vote Conservative for the first time at the election. \u201cLabour will borrow the money and my son and his children will pay for it. We\u2019ve already ruined the planet and left them a massive debt to inherit. And since Momentum joined Labour, I find it a hostile party for moderates.\u201d Labour\u2019s pension offer will not persuade Davenport back to the party either because, she said. \u201cThe women who most need this money, who have to use food banks and can\u2019t afford housing, heating and so on, will not see any of their compensation because the money given will be taken off of their benefits.\u201d Other women born in the fifties will, they say, vote Conservative despite Labour\u2019s offer and Johnson\u2019s U-turn. Judith Hilton would receive \u00a323,200 in compensation before tax under Labour\u2019s offer but will use the election to vote against it. \u201cI feel strongly that we should be repaid but I would rather repayment came from the court case and appeal brought by Backto60 than a blatant vote-buying pledge from Labour to partially compensate us to be paid for by even more government borrowing,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in the long-term, far-left socialist policies will greatly endanger the national economy and we will all end up worse off.\u201d Margaret Cooper, a lifelong Tory voter, agreed. \u201cThe Labour offer sounds very interesting. However, I don\u2019t trust their politics on the economy and I don\u2019t like Momentum. I\u2019ll be voting for the Conservative party again because although I want my pension, I think the Conservative party are being honest about not being able to pay it back, at least not over five years.\u201d But other 1950s women are so disillusioned by their experiences that, for the first time, they say they are unlikely to vote at all. Primrose Jones said: \u201cI never felt so conflicted about who to vote for to point I may not vote as there is no party I want to see in power.\u201dHaving voted Conservative in the past, she \u201chates what the Conservatives have done, and are doing to the less fortunate or well-off in society\u201d. But she has doubts about Labour. \u201cLabour seem the better bet for general care and welfare across society but they are a scary prospect. I am not sure I trust them on the economy. A different leader to Corbyn might make me feel differently. \u201cIn my constituency so it boils down to Conservatives versus Labour,\u201d Jones added. \u201cAnd I am beginning to think of not voting at all as there is no lesser of two evils.\u201d",

By 2015, however, Tinder had moved far beyond the campus and was registering a billion swipes on the app every day (left for \u201cno\u201d, right for \u201cyes\u201d), with users spending an average of 90 minutes a day scanning through their geographically defined options. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/11/tinder-super-like-swipe-right-dating\" title=\"\">Despite</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/11/tinder-super-like-swipe-right-dating\" title=\"\"> having added </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/11/tinder-super-like-swipe-right-dating\" title=\"\">\u201csuper-likes\u201d</a> and paid-for profile consultancy, the app has become known for one simple reason: hooking up.</p> <p><strong>How do I use it?</strong> All you need to do is upload some (ideally well-lit) photos. Personal information can be as minimal as you want it to be, although men may want to be judicious in their use of dog pics: some users were accused of \u201cdogfishing\u201d \u2013 posing with furry friends in an effort to attract more dates \u2013 on the app.</p> <p><strong>Who will I meet?</strong> Tinder is where you are most likely to find anyone and everyone in your local area: the person you see on the train platform each morning who you swear wears a wedding ring; the primary-school friend you lost touch with 15 years ago; your boss; or maybe your ex. Either person can make the first move to start a conversation on the app, so it is anyone\u2019s game.</p> <p><strong>Word of warning </strong>If you meet \u201cthe one\u201d, merely removing the app from your phone won\u2019t be enough to delete your profile \u2013 you will still be roaming the ether looking for love. You have to delete your profile as well as the app to be fully off-grid.</p> <p><strong>Use </strong><strong>it if you are looking for \u2026</strong> a late-night rendezvous.</p> <h2><strong>Bumble</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"007a3a5220a43719f960321b4c6fd166918323c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/007a3a5220a43719f960321b4c6fd166918323c2/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bumble app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What is it? </strong>Billed as the female-friendly version of Tinder, Bumble is very similar except for the fact that only women can start the conversation. When it comes to same-sex matches, either person can make the first move.</p> <p><strong>How do I use it?</strong> Again, users swipe left or right depending on their preference and the requirements for signing up are minimal: images, your name and your age.</p> <p><strong>Who will I meet? </strong><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/05/10/bumble-moves-making-impact/#7dd3bade5257\" title=\"\">With </a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/05/10/bumble-moves-making-impact/#7dd3bade5257\" title=\"\">more than 55 million users</a>, Bumble has become many people\u2019s first port of call in the digital dating world; Tinder\u2019s open door and hookup-centric reputation puts off some new users.</p> <p><strong>Word of warning</strong> Despite taking the lofty position of promising a platform for relationships rather than encounters, Bumble still exists for the same purpose, no matter what your matches may tell you.

Hinge\u2019s USP is limiting your pool of potential matches to friends of friends (as gleaned from your Facebook account) or friends of friends of friends, and so on. In theory, you or someone you know should be friends with your match.</p> <p><strong>How do I use it?</strong> There is no swiping \u2013 instead, users have to answer an array of questions that are posted on their profile page, along with their (again ideally well-lit) images. Question prompts range from the basic (\u201cMost spontaneous thing I\u2019ve ever done\u201d \u2013 for some reason, always a holiday) to the aspirational (\u201cA life goal of mine\u201d) and the bizarre (\u201cYou should <em>not</em> go out with me if \u2026\u201d).</p> <p><strong>Who will I meet?</strong> Hinge\u2019s tagline is \u201cDesigned to be deleted\u201d and the tenor of the conversations on the app makes it feel more relationship-focused than others. It is also prime territory for stumbling upon previous matches from other apps who have matured to Hinge\u2019s aesthetic.</p> <p><strong>Word of warning</strong> Hinge founder Justin McLeod\u2019s romance with his wife has been turned into an episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/18/modern-love-amazon-ed-sheeran\" title=\"\">Amazon\u2019s Modern Love series</a>, after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/style/modern-love-when-cupid-is-a-prying-journalist.html\" title=\"\">the journalist Deborah Copaken\u2019s column on him in the New York Times</a> in 2015 went viral \u2013 but it could also be a Hinge cautionary tale. McLeod and his wife met in college, broke up and spent eight years apart before Copaken encouraged him to take action before it was too late. If they had used Hinge, they might never have found their way to each other again.</p> <p><strong>Use </strong><strong>it if you are looking for \u2026 </strong>the one (or are ready to settle for less).</p> <h2><strong>Happn</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30247fbe9a9d16623f6ee3ec10460580a2fc404b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30247fbe9a9d16623f6ee3ec10460580a2fc404b/0_0_1250_960/1000.png\" alt=\"The Happn app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What is it for?</strong> Things get even stranger here. Happn is designed for you to meet someone in your vicinity, ideally someone you have just brushed past on the street or made awkward eye contact with on the train (perhaps like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/06/michael-fassbender-shame-mcqueen\" title=\"\">Michael Fassbender\u2019s opening scene in Shame</a>).</p> <p><strong>How do I use it?</strong> You need to be on the app all the time. Every time you see someone who catches your eye, you check the app to see if they are also on it. Then, rather than approach them on the street, you strike up a digital conversation, where you painstakingly recount your non-encounter in the hope that they will agree to a planned meet. Basically, a meet-cute for the socially anxious.</p> <p><strong>Who will I meet? </strong>Anyone within a 1km radius, from colleagues to commuters and \u2013 God forbid \u2013 family members.</p> <p><strong>Word of warning </strong>You are likely to bump into your matches again, so it may be harder to live down embarrassing first dates.</p> <p><strong>Use it if you are looking for \u2026</strong> convenience.</p> <h2><strong>Raya</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"94234979c884842135136cfd046cba2d6b713093\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94234979c884842135136cfd046cba2d6b713093/0_0_1500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Raya app\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What is it?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/mar/08/from-raya-to-tinder-select-the-world-of-elite-dating-apps\" title=\"\">There are plenty of apps for those with a more rarefied taste</a> \u2013 see EliteSingles, which caters for \u201cprofessionals\u201d; Luxy, which describes itself as a \u201cmillionaire dating app\u201d; and Uniform Dating, for people whose jobs usually involve wearing a uniform (firefighters ready yourselves).

      "bodyText": "Swiping singles are big money \u2013 it is estimated that the dating market is worth $12bn (\u00a39.3bn) globally. But how do we navigate the glut of options available to help us find love? With about 25 million people in the US alone thought to have regularly used dating apps this year, the sea is stocked with fish aplenty \u2013 so should we Bumble, Tinder, Happn or perhaps Grindr our way to success? Tinder What is it? The most popular and enduring of the first wave of dating apps, Tinder was founded in 2013 as a way to help US students meet each other; in other words, a social network for friendship as well as dating. By 2015, however, Tinder had moved far beyond the campus and was registering a billion swipes on the app every day (left for \u201cno\u201d, right for \u201cyes\u201d), with users spending an average of 90 minutes a day scanning through their geographically defined options. Despite having added \u201csuper-likes\u201d and paid-for profile consultancy, the app has become known for one simple reason: hooking up. How do I use it? All you need to do is upload some (ideally well-lit) photos. Personal information can be as minimal as you want it to be, although men may want to be judicious in their use of dog pics: some users were accused of \u201cdogfishing\u201d \u2013 posing with furry friends in an effort to attract more dates \u2013 on the app. Who will I meet? Tinder is where you are most likely to find anyone and everyone in your local area: the person you see on the train platform each morning who you swear wears a wedding ring; the primary-school friend you lost touch with 15 years ago; your boss; or maybe your ex. Either person can make the first move to start a conversation on the app, so it is anyone\u2019s game. Word of warning If you meet \u201cthe one\u201d, merely removing the app from your phone won\u2019t be enough to delete your profile \u2013 you will still be roaming the ether looking for love. You have to delete your profile as well as the app to be fully off-grid. Use it if you are looking for \u2026 a late-night rendezvous. Bumble What is it? Billed as the female-friendly version of Tinder, Bumble is very similar except for the fact that only women can start the conversation. When it comes to same-sex matches, either person can make the first move. How do I use it? Again, users swipe left or right depending on their preference and the requirements for signing up are minimal: images, your name and your age. Who will I meet? With more than 55 million users, Bumble has become many people\u2019s first port of call in the digital dating world; Tinder\u2019s open door and hookup-centric reputation puts off some new users. Word of warning Despite taking the lofty position of promising a platform for relationships rather than encounters, Bumble still exists for the same purpose, no matter what your matches may tell you. Watch out for the \u201csoftbois\u201d here (alternative-minded emotional manipulators who draw you in with their promises of late-night chats about Lou Reed and Ocean Vuong then leave you high and dry). Use it if you are looking for \u2026 flirtatious texting. Hinge What is it? Here is where things get a little strange. Hinge\u2019s USP is limiting your pool of potential matches to friends of friends (as gleaned from your Facebook account) or friends of friends of friends, and so on. In theory, you or someone you know should be friends with your match. How do I use it? There is no swiping \u2013 instead, users have to answer an array of questions that are posted on their profile page, along with their (again ideally well-lit) images. Question prompts range from the basic (\u201cMost spontaneous thing I\u2019ve ever done\u201d \u2013 for some reason, always a holiday) to the aspirational (\u201cA life goal of mine\u201d) and the bizarre (\u201cYou should not go out with me if \u2026\u201d). Who will I meet? Hinge\u2019s tagline is \u201cDesigned to be deleted\u201d and the tenor of the conversations on the app makes it feel more relationship-focused than others. It is also prime territory for stumbling upon previous matches from other apps who have matured to Hinge\u2019s aesthetic. Word of warning Hinge founder Justin McLeod\u2019s romance with his wife has been turned into an episode of Amazon\u2019s Modern Love series, after the journalist Deborah Copaken\u2019s column on him in the New York Times in 2015 went viral \u2013 but it could also be a Hinge cautionary tale. McLeod and his wife met in college, broke up and spent eight years apart before Copaken encouraged him to take action before it was too late. If they had used Hinge, they might never have found their way to each other again. Use it if you are looking for \u2026 the one (or are ready to settle for less). Happn What is it for? Things get even stranger here. Happn is designed for you to meet someone in your vicinity, ideally someone you have just brushed past on the street or made awkward eye contact with on the train (perhaps like Michael Fassbender\u2019s opening scene in Shame). How do I use it? You need to be on the app all the time. Every time you see someone who catches your eye, you check the app to see if they are also on it. Then, rather than approach them on the street, you strike up a digital conversation, where you painstakingly recount your non-encounter in the hope that they will agree to a planned meet. Basically, a meet-cute for the socially anxious. Who will I meet? Anyone within a 1km radius, from colleagues to commuters and \u2013 God forbid \u2013 family members. Word of warning You are likely to bump into your matches again, so it may be harder to live down embarrassing first dates. Use it if you are looking for \u2026 convenience. Raya What is it? There are plenty of apps for those with a more rarefied taste \u2013 see EliteSingles, which caters for \u201cprofessionals\u201d; Luxy, which describes itself as a \u201cmillionaire dating app\u201d; and Uniform Dating, for people whose jobs usually involve wearing a uniform (firefighters ready yourselves). But none has the cachet of Raya \u2013 the private members\u2019 club of dating apps. How do I use it? You can join only after being nominated by an anonymous \u201cglobal committee\u201d, which means Raya has become known as the dating app for celebs. Who will I meet? While you may find Made in Chelsea or Hollyoaks cast members on Bumble, celebrities said to have been spotted on Raya in the past include Cara Delevingne, Teri Hatcher and Diplo. Word of warning \u201cJournalist\u201d probably isn\u2019t on the list of Raya-friendly professions, so there is no way to verify these rumours \u2013 unless you are able to join yourself. Use it if you are looking for \u2026 a story to sell to a gossip magazine. Lumen What is it? Tinder, Bumble and Hinge are generally targeted at 18- to 35-year-olds. Lumen is the dating app designed for over-50s. The statistics suggests that this demographic needs such a service: the ONS expects 42% of marriages to end in divorce, while 12.9% of 50- to 64-year-olds in England and Wales were single as of 2017. Perhaps as a result of all of this, STI rates among over-50s doubled between 2002 and 2012. How do I use it? Founded in September 2018, Lumen reached 350,000 users in just six months with its canny reinterpretation of the swiping format. The interface is minimal but clunky \u2013 designed for the least tech-savvy Boomers \u2013 and has few market rivals. Who will I meet? Late bloomers, divorcees and basically any singleton over 50 with functioning knowledge of a smartphone. Word of warning Facebook Dating launched recently in the US. Since 72% of all online 50- to 64-year-olds use the social media site, Lumen could have a rival on its hands. Use it if you are looking for \u2026 a partner for a single parent, or love later in life. Grindr What is it? The ultimate, utilitarian ideal of the dating app world. Grindr is marketed as a \u201csocial networking app for gay, bi, trans and queer people\u201d. How do I use it? The app removes any frivolous pre-date agonising from the equation and has been serving all manner of location-based meetings since its launch in 2009. Who will I meet? From the curious to the adventurous, all are welcome. Word of warning The anti-Hinge, Grindr isn\u2019t designed to be deleted, but rather to be a quiet fixture on your phone\u2019s home screen, always on hand, no matter the time, place \u2013 or relationship status. Use it if you are looking for \u2026 anything and everything. Guardian Soulmates What is it? The Guardian\u2019s dating app. Eighty per cent of users are Guardian readers, so your political opinions and environmental consciousness will probably be reciprocated. And it is free (to start). How do I use it? This is a website and an app, so you can use your desktop to register your profile, images and personal details, then message away with other singles in your area. If you pay for a subscription, you can see more photos of potential soulmates, plus find out about their hobbies. Who will I meet? The diverse range of single Guardian readers (and maybe even some journos). With Soulmates flaunting marriages on its home page, this app is one for those who are in it for the long haul. Word of warning Do soulmates exist? Use it if you are looking for \u2026 someone to gaze at over your morning copy of the Guardian, of course.",

Children aged 16 and under would receive free rail travel under the plans, while part-time workers would be guaranteed \u201cfair\u201d fares. The party is also promising \u201ca London-style ticketing system across the nation\u201d to simplify prices using zonal fares, which would be applied to all types of public transport, and allow contactless payments.

      "bodyText": "Labour has announced a raft of new transport policies as the South Western Railway strike took its toll on commuters this morning. The party says it will bring the railways back into public ownership and cut regulated rail fares by 33% from January 2020. Children aged 16 and under would receive free rail travel under the plans, while part-time workers would be guaranteed \u201cfair\u201d fares. The party is also promising \u201ca London-style ticketing system across the nation\u201d to simplify prices using zonal fares, which would be applied to all types of public transport, and allow contactless payments. The plans would only affect fares in England as those in Wales and Scotland are devolved A 40-year-old train driver employed by SWR, with nearly 20 years of rail experience, described guards as \u201cthe human face of the railway, ensuring there is a safe, secure and accessible environment\u201d. The driver, who wished to remain anonymous, got in touch with the Guardian to call on more drivers to support the strike. He said: \u201cRunning a train without a guard is akin to flying a plane with no cabin crew: 99.99% of journeys would occur without incident, but if and when something does go wrong, the consequences are much more likely to be catastrophic.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has backed the striking railway workers and said South Western Railways need to \u201cgive their heads a shake\u201d. He accused the company of reneging on deal agreed with the union. McDonald, who has been doing the media rounds this morning, told LBC: \u201cThis is so frustrating. Right across the country, those issues have been resolved to everybody\u2019s satisfaction. Putting those safety-critical guards on trains has happened everywhere.\u201d The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a business networking and support organisation, has said the strikes will have a \u201cdetrimental impact\u201d on key sectors of London\u2019s economy.Sean McKee, director of policy and public affairs at London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: \u201cLondon businesses recognise the right to strike, but this prolonged strike action is a cynical move deliberately designed to cause inconvenience to the travelling public in the run to, and through, Christmas. It will have a detrimental impact to key sectors of the capital\u2019s economy, which rely upon festive and tourism trade.\u201d Labour has announced a raft of new transport policies as the South Western Railway strike takes its toll on commuters. The party says it will bring the railways back into public ownership and cut regulated rail fares by 33% from January 2020. Children aged 16 and under would receive free rail travel under the plans, while part-time workers would be guaranteed \u201cfair\u201d fares. Corbyn officially launched the policy outside Finsbury Park station in the Islington North constituency he has held since 1983. \u201cThey are not giveaways, they are rebalancing what we had, which was 10 years of austerity in which living standards have often fallen, income levels have been static, and in some cases fallen, and public services have been damaged and reduced,\u201d he told the press in north London. \u201cAnd if all of our spending commitments, the whole of our manifesto, is carried out to every last letter we still barely reach the levels of public services of France or Germany and that\u2019s how far behind we\u2019ve fallen because of the strategy that\u2019s been followed.\u201d Here is the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham, latest report on the strike. Some commuters have reached out to speak of their frustration: Commuters who found seats described \u201chorrendous\u201d journeys. Richard Clarke, from Farncombe, on a delayed 7.01am train to Waterloo, said: \u201cI am on the 7.01 and it is horrendous, full and standing \u2026 No one could even force their way on once we arrived at Woking.\u201d Passengers expressed anger that SWR laid on shorter trains than usual. Clare Moriarty, permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the EU, tweeted the train operator: \u201cI cannot believe that on a strike day when there are only two trains from my station in the peak hour you have *shortened* train length by a third. Please have some thought for your passengers.\u201d Within Greater London, where passengers were held outside busy stations such as Earlsfield, local bus services were quickly filled and not stopping as people sought alternatives. A 40-year-old train driver employed by SWR, with nearly 20 years of rail experience, described guards as \u201cthe human face of the railway, ensuring there is a safe, secure and accessible environment\u201d. The driver, who wished to remain anonymous, got in touch with the Guardian to call on more drivers to support the strike. He said: \u201cRunning a train without a guard is akin to flying a plane with no cabin crew: 99.99% of journeys would occur without incident, but if and when something does go wrong, the consequences are much more likely to be catastrophic.\u201d He added: \u201cTransferring door control to drivers is a necessary first step towards getting rid of guards altogether, which is why SWR and the Tories are so determined to make it happen. This is not about technology or automation, this is about the vital safety responsibilities of one grade of staff being dumped on to another grade who already have plenty to deal with. \u201cWe regularly carry in excess of a thousand passengers on a single train and the idea of having to single-handedly safely manage that number of people in a major incident is frankly terrifying. Every year the industry already sees serious incidents and near-misses which are directly caused or made worse by the absence of a guard.\u201d The Liberal Democrat candidate Monica Harding, who is running against Dominic Raab in Esher and Walton, has called on the RMT and South Western Railway (SWR) to end the strike impasse. Residents in the constituency depend heavily on SWR to commute into central London. In a recent blogpost, Harding said: \u201cUnder the Tories, Esher and Walton commuters have been catastrophically let down. People are paying way over the odds for what has often been an appalling service and fixing this is high on their list of priorities. Yet Dominic Raab has done little to represent them and even his voting record shows he has consistently voted against slowing the rises to rail fares.\u201d The situation in Esher and Walton is being closely watched as pollsters suggest it could provide this election\u2019s \u201cPortillo moment\u201d. The foreign secretary now only holds a five-point lead over the Lib Dems with less than two weeks before voting, according to a Deltapoll survey. In 2017, Raab had a massive 23,298 majority. The fact he now faces such a close race means he is vulnerable to a so-called Portillo moment \u2013 a reference to the shock defeat of Michael Portillo in the Labour landslide of 1997. Harding is also calling for rail fare freezes and the creation of a \u201cRailways Agency\u201d to hold companies to account, removing the Department for Transport from day-to-day decision-making. SWR\u2019s managing director, Andy Mellors, said the company was running more than half of its normal services. He said there had been further disruption on Monday morning after police had to board a train in Woking because of an incident unrelated to the industrial action. Mellors told PA Media: \u201cWe are running over half of our services today, so clearly there is potential for some customers to have trains that are busier than usual. \u201cBut we are here at Waterloo station and passengers are moving freely.\u201d Here\u2019s some responses to the Guardian\u2019s callout to those affected by the strike. Gary from Walton-on-Thames said he had to call work to explain he cannot get in: \u201cNot only is SWR on strike today but they have also decided to reduce the number of carriages on their trains! I stood outside with the temperature at -2 degrees this morning for almost an hour and both trains that were due to arrive were late and had reduced carriages. People couldn\u2019t get on the train (including myself). I have now had to call my work and explain that I cannot get in. This is a disgrace. The government needs to step in to do something about this. I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d Kate, who works in the City and travels from Winchester, said she feels the strikes are following her: \u201cOver half of the trains to and from Winchester are cancelled and whilst I have a very understanding boss and can work from home, I prefer to work from the office. I moved to Winchester three years ago after being on the Southern Railway route for many years and subjected to their strikes for the same reason \u2013 guards on trains. I feel the strikes are following me! I agree with having a guard on every train, without question. What is frustrating for this strike is that both sides seem to be strongly disagreeing with each other and so no-one quite know what the actual issue is.\u201d Michael Aaronson, 70, a freelance consultant from Wanborough says he and other passengers feel abandoned: \u201cI normally travel to London Waterloo. There are no trains and no replacement bus services from our station for the duration of the strike, so I and my fellow passengers from Wanborough are effectively abandoned by SWR for the whole of December. What makes this doubly absurd is that Great Western Railway (GWR), also runs trains through our station but hardly any of them stop here. So we are all thrown back to using our cars, adding yet more pressure to the congested roads around Guildford.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has backed the striking railway workers and said South Western Railways need to \u201cgive their heads a shake\u201d. He accused the company of reneging on deal agreed with the union. McDonald, who has been doing the media rounds this morning, told LBC: \u201cThis is so frustrating. Right across the country, those issues have been resolved to everybody\u2019s satisfaction. Putting those safety-critical guards on trains has happened everywhere. \u201cYet South Western, who had an agreement with the trade union, have reneged on that agreement and we now find ourselves in that terrible situation.\u201d Speaking to Nick Ferrari, he said: \u201cThey should have stuck to the agreement that had been reached, then this wouldn\u2019t be happening. \u201cI\u2019m hugely disappointed that they have taken this step and if they would do what the other train operators have done and give that guarantee and put those guards on the trains, this matter would be resolved imminently and people could go about their preparations for Christmas without any interruption whatsoever. \u201cThey need to give their heads a shake.\u201d This was the scene outside Earlsfield station, in south-west London, just after 8am. It later grew even bigger snaking round the corner. It also had a knock-on effect on local buses which quickly filled up and didn\u2019t stop at many stops due to lack of room. Here\u2019s another picture from Earlsfield station Here\u2019s a great Q&amp;A from Gwyn Topham, the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, about today\u2019s strike: When are the strikes? The strikes started at 0.01am on Monday and in effect run for the rest of the month. RMT union members will strike for 27 days \u2013 for all the rest of December except Christmas Day and Boxing Day, when no trains run anyway, and 12 December, general election day, a hiatus too short to bring back full services. How much disruption will they cause? South Western Railway (SWR) expects to run about half of its trains most weekdays, with no trains after 11pm. Peak services are likely to be extremely busy where frequencies are cut, with queueing systems in place at busy stations. For commuters already used to standing on overcrowded trains, it could be a grim month even if their trains are running. Why are they taking place? The strikes are part of an ongoing row about the role and responsibilities of guards. New trains allow driver-only or driver-controlled operation \u2013 including closing the doors \u2013 and unions want to ensure guards keep a safety-critical role. Although SWR says it will guarantee a second crew member onboard, unions say they have not had sufficient assurances and believe that guards could be axed in the future if companies choose to do so. Read more below The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a business networking and support organisation, has said the strikes will have a \u201cdetrimental impact\u201d on key sectors of London\u2019s economy. Sean McKee, director of policy and public affairs at London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: \u201cLondon businesses recognise the right to strike, but this prolonged strike action is a cynical move deliberately designed to cause inconvenience to the travelling public in the run to, and through, Christmas. It will have a detrimental impact to key sectors of the capital\u2019s economy, which rely upon festive and tourism trade.\u201d McKee added: \u201cWith peak services under increased pressure due to so many cancellations, and long queues expected at busy stations, it\u2019s sadly inevitable that this cynically long strike will have an impact on commuting workers and businesses during peak commuting times. With trains due to finish earlier it will also impact shift work and the night time economy \u2013 key to the festive economy.\u201d While commuting has been a nightmare for most passengers using South Western Railway this morning, the Guardian\u2019s editor for community, Caroline Bannock, had, to her surprise, a problem-free journey. She said: \u201cOn Monday morning at 6.30am Salisbury station car park can be quiet, but on the first day of the 27 day strike by RMT staff at South Western Railway, it was nearly empty. \u201cThe train departures board in the station showed that all the trains were running on time and there was no reduced service during heavy commuter times before 0800. After that trains were scheduled every hour, instead of every half hour. \u201cThe 6.47am left Salisbury on time. From Basingstoke, it was standing room only on my train, which didn\u2019t bode well for the next stop Woking. However the platform there was almost empty when we pulled in around 0745. \u201cThe train arrived at London Waterloo on time at 0816. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened in a while.\u201d Lucky for some ... Steve Hedley, the senior assistant general secretary of the RMT, told Sky News this morning that the strikes were about safety, not pay. He said: \u201cThis dispute is not about more money and it\u2019s not about a shorter working week. It\u2019s about the safety role of the guard. Eight out of 10 most serious accidents happen on driver-only operated trains. Assaults have gone up over 100% in the last five years on driver-only operated trains. Sexual assaults have gone up 140% in the past five years. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that there\u2019s a guard there and a guard has safety responsibility for that train.\u201d When asked whether 27 days of commuter chaos was a way to fix the issues, he raised, Hedley said: \u201cIt\u2019s the only option that people have left. We\u2019ve called off strikes in the summer and early autumn because we thought we were very, very close to a deal. \u201cIn fact, three weeks ago we had a deal on the table that everybody had agreed to that had been safety validated \u2026 And then that had been pulled and our members our absolutely furious. Look, no one wants to lose 27 days of pay coming up to Christmas, they don\u2019t want to do that, but they\u2019ve already lost nearly 40 days of pay over the past two years.\u201d You can watch the interview with Kay Burley below. Talks between the two sides collapsed last week, with the union and company blaming each other for the strike action. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: RMT members are standing rock solid and united on South Western Railway this morning as we begin a full month of strike action in support of the safest method of train operation and dispatch. This strike is solely about protecting safety and accessibility on SWR trains. \u200e \u201cRMT is angry and frustrated that a set of proposals that would have guaranteed the safety-critical role of the guard at the point of despatch, and which would have cost the company absolutely nothing, were kicked back in our faces last week. There is no rational explanation for the company position and we can only assume that either they or their paymasters in government wanted this strike action to go ahead for politically motivated purposes. \u201cThe union believes that cutting the guard out of the dispatch process reduces the second person on the train to little more than a passenger in the longer term which would give the company the option of axing them all together at some point down the line. The stakes could not be higher.\u201d Meanwhile, a South Western Railway spokesman said: We have done everything we can and more to meet the RMT\u2019s outdated demands with our promise of a guard on every train, and a safety-critical role for that guard. \u201cWhat we are not prepared to compromise on is the much-needed modernisation of the service with improved performance, safety and customer service that our new fleet of modern suburban trains will vitally deliver for customers. \u201cWe know our passengers will welcome over 10 million more passenger journeys a year arriving on time and this much-needed improvement to our service is too important to compromise. \u201cThroughout negotiations we have tried repeatedly to find ways meet the RMT\u2019s aspirations. However, every time we find a way forward on one point, the union has moved the goalposts by changing its position. They said at the outset this was about keeping the guard on the train \u2013 that is exactly what we have offered. \u201cThey said they wanted a safety-critical role for that guard \u2013 that is what we have offered. \u201cUnfortunately it is clear to us that the RMT is unclear on what this dispute is about and intent on striking no matter what. Richard Clarke, who works in insurance and travels between Farncombe and Waterloo, sent this photo of his train this morning. Clarke said: \u201cI am on the 7.01 and it is horrendous, full and standing once we left Guildford. \u201cThe trains, unsurprisingly when you consider their recent performance, were delayed. As expected, I didn\u2019t get a seat and once we had left Guildford (the stop after mine) the train was so full that no one could even force their way on once we arrived at Woking. One lady tried to but gave up, turned around and left.\u201d Some commuters are using the Twitter hashtag #swrstrike to vent their frustration about the strike. Here\u2019s a selection from those commuting this morning. Are you taking part in or affected by the South Western rail strikes? We\u2019d like to hear your experiences A month of strike action by South Western Railway (SWR) staff starts on Monday across its entire network. RMT union members will walk out every day of the month apart from 1 December, 12 December \u2013 election day \u2013 and 25 and 26 December. We want to hear about how the strikes have affected you or will affect you in the weeks to come. Are you a member of the RMT taking part in the strikes? What are your main reasons for doing so? Are you you are a commuter who uses SWR? How do you expect your journey to be affected? How do you feel about the strikes taking place? Morning, my name is Aamna Mohdin and I\u2019m running the live blog on the South Western Railway (SWR) strike. SWR is one of the busiest commuter lines in the country \u2013 used by about 600,000 passengers daily \u2013 and all who use the service are expected to be affected. Here\u2019s some background from our transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham. He reports: A month of misery for hundreds of thousands of rail commuters begins on Monday when RMT members of South Western Railway walk out on the first of 27 days of strike action. Hundreds of guards and a small number of drivers will not clock on for work again this Christmas, apart from on election day on 12 December, in a bitter row over the role and responsibilities of onboard train crew. The train firm was among others to be hit by similar strike action last year over the role of guards. Only about half of normal weekday services will run on SWR, the UK\u2019s second biggest train operator with about 600,000 passenger trips a day from Surrey, Hampshire and beyond into London Waterloo, the country\u2019s busiest station. I\u2019ll be bringing all the action and keeping you updated with all the developments. To send me tips, your best bet is to tweet me @aamnamohdin",

The Swiss striker scored twice, had one disallowed, missed a penalty and laid on the third for Hermann. It all adds up to their best start since the 1976/77 title win, with Bayern up next Saturday. \u201cWe allowed too much out wide and from dead balls,\u201d noted goalkeeper Yann Sommer, so Embolo and Marcus Thuram might have to weigh in heavily for Die Fohlen to prevail against the champs.</p> \n<p>\u2022 It was a good weekend too for Schalke, who faced Union on Friday night knowing a 4-0 win would have taken them to the top of the table, albeit temporarily, for the first time since April 2010. They got the win in the end thanks to a beautifully constructed late winner by Suat Serdar, underlining the team\u2019s growth under David Wagner. The match was also significant for the first public appearance of disgraced chairman Clemens T\u00f6nnies this season, back in the stand after his insufficiently long ban for using racist language.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"01f7a3ab-fde4-48b8-97ec-b7484404c050\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Schalke 2-1 Union Berlin, Bayern 1-2 Leverkusen, Cologne 1-1 Augsburg, Hertha Berlin 1-2 Dortmund, Hoffenheim 1-1 Fortuna Dusseldorf, Paderborn 2-3 RB Leipzig, Wolfsburg 2-3 Werder Bremen, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 4-2 Freiburg</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Sometimes, it just takes a moment when it all clicks and after over two months and eight games without a win, Leonardo Bittencourt\u2019s plunging header did that for Werder Bremen, to give them a lead at Wolfsburg. \u201cWith Leo\u2019s goal,\u201d coach Florian Kohfeldt told Sky, \u201cit all came together.\u201d There was an equaliser for Die W\u00f6lfe by William to make it 2-2 but Werder were sufficiently galvanised to chase a winner. They got it through a sublime Milot Rashica goal, which sparked big celebrations and pulled them away from the danger zone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

Klinsmann has a lot on his plate though; so much so that he failed to notice YouTuber Marvin W had smuggled himself into Sunday\u2019s training session, before assistant Henrik Kuchno spotted him and had him thrown out. \u2022 RB Leipzig briefly took led the Bundesliga after a win at Paderborn but it is Gladbach that remain the league\u2019s great entertainers, and they retook top spot by beating Freiburg 4-2 on Sunday with Breel Embolo running the show. The Swiss striker scored twice, had one disallowed, missed a penalty and laid on the third for Hermann. It all adds up to their best start since the 1976/77 title win, with Bayern up next Saturday. \u201cWe allowed too much out wide and from dead balls,\u201d noted goalkeeper Yann Sommer, so Embolo and Marcus Thuram might have to weigh in heavily for Die Fohlen to prevail against the champs. \u2022 It was a good weekend too for Schalke, who faced Union on Friday night knowing a 4-0 win would have taken them to the top of the table, albeit temporarily, for the first time since April 2010. They got the win in the end thanks to a beautifully constructed late winner by Suat Serdar, underlining the team\u2019s growth under David Wagner. The match was also significant for the first public appearance of disgraced chairman Clemens T\u00f6nnies this season, back in the stand after his insufficiently long ban for using racist language. \u2022 Sometimes, it just takes a moment when it all clicks and after over two months and eight games without a win, Leonardo Bittencourt\u2019s plunging header did that for Werder Bremen, to give them a lead at Wolfsburg. \u201cWith Leo\u2019s goal,\u201d coach Florian Kohfeldt told Sky, \u201cit all came together.\u201d There was an equaliser for Die W\u00f6lfe by William to make it 2-2 but Werder were sufficiently galvanised to chase a winner. They got it through a sublime Milot Rashica goal, which sparked big celebrations and pulled them away from the danger zone.",

      "body": "<p>The European commission is launching a new investigation into Google, examining the company\u2019s data collection practices, according to a report from Reuters.</p> <p>During the past week, the competition commission has sent out questionnaires to companies that work with Google asking them about the agreements they have made to share data with the search firm.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-alphabet-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKBN1Y40NX\">The regulator said</a>: \u201cThe commission has sent out questionnaires as part of a preliminary investigation into Google\u2019s practices relating to Google\u2019s collection and use of data.

      "bodyText": "The European commission is launching a new investigation into Google, examining the company\u2019s data collection practices, according to a report from Reuters. During the past week, the competition commission has sent out questionnaires to companies that work with Google asking them about the agreements they have made to share data with the search firm. The regulator said: \u201cThe commission has sent out questionnaires as part of a preliminary investigation into Google\u2019s practices relating to Google\u2019s collection and use of data. The preliminary investigation is ongoing.\u201d Foo Yun Chee, reporting for Reuters, said the questionnaires for the latest investigation showed that the EU\u2019s focus was on \u201cdata related to local search services, online advertising, online ad targeting services, login services, web browsers and others\u201d. The new investigation suggests that the EU is not yet done with its scrutiny of Google, which has already resulted in more than \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.8bn) of fines. A 2017 investigation into Google Shopping resulted in a fine of \u20ac2.4bn; in 2018, anticompetitive practices involving Google\u2019s Android smartphone operating system were the basis of a \u20ac4.3bn fine; and those were followed in 2019 with a \u20ac1.5bn fine over advertising violations. In the latter violations, the competition commission has placed increasing emphasis on the contracts Google has signed with third parties \u2013 restrictions which are not traditionally a part of antitrust enforcement, but which are widely seen as crucial to how companies such as Google maintain their lead. In the Android case, for example, Google was criticised for requiring handset manufacturers to agree to terms that banned them from building phones using non-Google versions of Android. Tech analyst Ben Thompson argues that such contractual restrictions are increasingly common. \u201cThis is an area ripe for enhanced antitrust enforcement,\u201d Thompson wrote in March. \u201cThese large tech companies have enough advantages, most of them earned through delivering what customers want, and abetted by the fundamental nature of zero marginal costs.

In a statement, the CMA said it \u201cis considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.\u201d The acquisition, announced in June, saw Google spending more than \u00a32bn on the company, intended to improve the analytics services Google provides customers of its cloud platform.",

Except he can\u2019t psych his opponent out, because his opponent is a 1,400lb grizzly bear who unthinkingly yanks him screaming from the platform in about 10 seconds. A commentator intones: \u201cI\u2019ve seen just about everything in sports, but this tops it all.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/02/50-best-tv-shows-2019\">The 50 best TV shows of 2019: 41-50</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Welcome to Man vs Bear. It is a television programme about some men who want to beat a bear in a fight. It is a real television programme that really exists. Donald Trump is president of America.</p> <p>In round two of Man vs Bear, the men try to push a 2,000lb barrel across a patch of land faster than a bear can. They all fail, because the bear is eight and a half feet tall, and also a bear. In round three they have to eat a giant mound of bear food faster than a bear can. Again, they all fail because the bear is a bear, and it has both the jaw size and dental structure to accommodate the food, and it weighs between six to 10 times more than the men, and the men are not bears. To reiterate, this is a real television programme that someone went to the trouble and expense of making, and Donald Trump is the leader of the free world.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a show as stupid as Man vs Bear. And that\u2019s saying something because, for a while back there, shows really tried to be stupid. There was Naked and Afraid; a Bear Grylls-style survival show about people who were nude for some reason. There was Man vs Food; a food series determined to make all food look unnaturally revolting. There was Eaten Alive; where a man attempted to get eaten whole by a snake. There was Touch the Truck. There was Don\u2019t Scare the Hare. Before streaming came along and provided everyone with a smorgasbord of prestige drama, this is the sort of dumb crud that people actually watched.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OOcQb005-c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6OOcQb005-c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So in a way, it\u2019s good that someone has made Man vs Bear. It\u2019s a beautiful throwback. It\u2019s heartening that, in this fractured media landscape, there is still room for an aggressively gormless television programme about a bunch of absolute idiots who have the sheer deluded balls to assume that they would ever be able to beat a bear at anything at all.</p> <p>And, obviously, the bear does win. The bear wins everything. It\u2019s a bear. It\u2019s a giant bear that dwarves all humans in every physical manner imaginable. Of course it\u2019s going to win. It\u2019d be a different story if the producers levelled the playing field a little and introduced a few categories that were weighted in the human\u2019s favour. Maybe if there was a round about sudoku, or tying a Windsor knot, or working on the advice of a relationship counsellor in a doomed bid to save a failing marriage, the humans might have a shot. But no. Man vs Bear is all about people who think that they can be a bear better than a bear can. They\u2019re all doomed right from the get-go. But, honestly, God bless them for having that sort of chutzpah in the first place. We need it these days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b24f637ba2014080ed692906b7b49d94ebf646ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b24f637ba2014080ed692906b7b49d94ebf646ec/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brad during the rope challenge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brad during the rope challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Discovery Channel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s hard to see what the point of Man vs Bear is, having watched the first episode. Is it that we should fear bears? Because that seems sort of redundant, given how inherently petrifying bears are. Is it that man will never be able to eat a pile of dead insects faster than a bear? Because, if it is, who does that information even serve? Is it, perhaps, that bears are some of the most majestic creatures on Earth, and that they deserve our respect? Because, if that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t make a TV show where you goad bears into playing tug-of-war with MMA fighters. Because, and I hate to break it to you like this, watching it sort of cheapens the majesty a teensy bit.</p> <p>In the final round of Man vs Bear the men get inside a big metal ball and try and stop a bear from pushing it into a ditch. They always fail, because they are normal-sized men and the bear is literally a bear. Donald Trump will be re-elected president next year.</p> <ul> <li><p>Man vs Bear starts in the US on the Discovery Channel on 4 December with a UK date to be confirmed</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "An MMA fighter stands on top of a platform, hopping up and down as he prepares for a game of tug-of-war. \u201cCome on baby, get some of this,\u201d he shouts down at his opponent, attempting to psyche him out. Except he can\u2019t psych his opponent out, because his opponent is a 1,400lb grizzly bear who unthinkingly yanks him screaming from the platform in about 10 seconds. A commentator intones: \u201cI\u2019ve seen just about everything in sports, but this tops it all.\u201d Welcome to Man vs Bear. It is a television programme about some men who want to beat a bear in a fight. It is a real television programme that really exists. Donald Trump is president of America. In round two of Man vs Bear, the men try to push a 2,000lb barrel across a patch of land faster than a bear can. They all fail, because the bear is eight and a half feet tall, and also a bear. In round three they have to eat a giant mound of bear food faster than a bear can. Again, they all fail because the bear is a bear, and it has both the jaw size and dental structure to accommodate the food, and it weighs between six to 10 times more than the men, and the men are not bears. To reiterate, this is a real television programme that someone went to the trouble and expense of making, and Donald Trump is the leader of the free world. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a show as stupid as Man vs Bear. And that\u2019s saying something because, for a while back there, shows really tried to be stupid. There was Naked and Afraid; a Bear Grylls-style survival show about people who were nude for some reason. There was Man vs Food; a food series determined to make all food look unnaturally revolting. There was Eaten Alive; where a man attempted to get eaten whole by a snake. There was Touch the Truck. There was Don\u2019t Scare the Hare. Before streaming came along and provided everyone with a smorgasbord of prestige drama, this is the sort of dumb crud that people actually watched. So in a way, it\u2019s good that someone has made Man vs Bear. It\u2019s a beautiful throwback. It\u2019s heartening that, in this fractured media landscape, there is still room for an aggressively gormless television programme about a bunch of absolute idiots who have the sheer deluded balls to assume that they would ever be able to beat a bear at anything at all. And, obviously, the bear does win. The bear wins everything. It\u2019s a bear. It\u2019s a giant bear that dwarves all humans in every physical manner imaginable. Of course it\u2019s going to win. It\u2019d be a different story if the producers levelled the playing field a little and introduced a few categories that were weighted in the human\u2019s favour. Maybe if there was a round about sudoku, or tying a Windsor knot, or working on the advice of a relationship counsellor in a doomed bid to save a failing marriage, the humans might have a shot. But no. Man vs Bear is all about people who think that they can be a bear better than a bear can. They\u2019re all doomed right from the get-go. But, honestly, God bless them for having that sort of chutzpah in the first place. We need it these days. It\u2019s hard to see what the point of Man vs Bear is, having watched the first episode. Is it that we should fear bears? Because that seems sort of redundant, given how inherently petrifying bears are. Is it that man will never be able to eat a pile of dead insects faster than a bear? Because, if it is, who does that information even serve? Is it, perhaps, that bears are some of the most majestic creatures on Earth, and that they deserve our respect? Because, if that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t make a TV show where you goad bears into playing tug-of-war with MMA fighters. Because, and I hate to break it to you like this, watching it sort of cheapens the majesty a teensy bit. In the final round of Man vs Bear the men get inside a big metal ball and try and stop a bear from pushing it into a ditch. They always fail, because they are normal-sized men and the bear is literally a bear. Donald Trump will be re-elected president next year. Man vs Bear starts in the US on the Discovery Channel on 4 December with a UK date to be confirmed",

      "body": "<p>Stefano Turati learned on Saturday morning that he was about to make his Serie A debut. One day later, he stood in front of a mob of reporters at Juventus\u2019s Allianz Stadium, wearing a turtleneck and a bewildered smile. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain everything that has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to understand it myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>The short version goes like this: Turati, at 18 years old, put in a man-of-the-match performance to help Sassuolo earn a 2-2 draw at the home of the Serie A champions. He thwarted Cristiano Ronaldo, extending his 6ft 2in frame to tip a second-half free-kick over the bar, and denied Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, too, smothering a shot from the Argentinian at point-blank range.</p> \n<p>Turati did all this while sharing a pitch with the greatest goalkeeper of all time. Gianluigi Buffon, 23 years his senior, was among the first to come and congratulate him at full-time. The Juventus player had been a teenager himself when he made his Serie A debut for Parma.</p> \n<p>It is tempting to draw parallels with that day in 1995. Buffon denied George Weah and Roberto Baggio back then, earning an unexpected draw against a juggernaut Milan team that was on its way to winning the Scudetto.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/02/andre-villas-boas-marseille-best-ligue-1-psg-monaco-europe\">Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas is quietly making Marseille best of the rest in Ligue 1</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of course, there are also countless stories in football of debutants who dazzled only to fade quickly from view. We do not know yet if Turati will even play again next weekend. His opportunity against Juventus arose following injuries to starter Andrea Consigli and his regular backup, Gianluca Pegolo.</p> \n<p>Regardless, Turati has left his mark on this Serie A campaign. Sunday\u2019s draw \u2013 inspired also by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VC-qIzz7NYk?t=61\">an exquisite chip</a> from J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga \u2013 left the door open for Internazionale to vault back into first place. They duly did, sinking Spal with a pair of goals from Lautaro Mart\u00ednez.</p> \n<p>It is worth reminding ourselves that Inter were top of the table on 3 December 2017, and finished that season by barely scraping into fourth place. A year ago today, however, Juventus were already 11 points clear. It is encouraging to think that this title race should at least endure beyond the winter break.</p> \n<p>There are reasons for Inter to believe that this time could be different. Never before have they won 12 of their opening 14 games in a top-flight campaign. Antonio Conte\u2019s coaching imprint is visible everywhere, from the confidence with which Lautaro and Romelu Lukaku are already interpreting each other\u2019s movements, to the improved crossing of Antonio Candreva.</p> \n<p>With all the inevitable focus on the top two, however, it is also easy to overlook the sides right behind them. Lazio have won their last six games in Serie A \u2013 a run not even Inter can match \u2013 and swept Udinese aside 3-0 at the weekend. They are the division\u2019s top scorers, with 33 goals from 14 games.</p> \n<p>An extraordinary 17 of those belong to Ciro Immobile, and he could have had even more. On Sunday he gave up the opportunity to complete a hat-trick, allowing Luis Alberto to take a penalty at 2-0. It is the second time this season that he has yielded spot-kick duties to a teammate he thought might benefit from a confidence boost.</p> \n<p>Immobile himself is full to the brim. He could not ask for a better setup than the one he has at Lazio. His manager, Simone Inzaghi, has built his tactics around the striker since they arrived at the club, three months apart, in 2016.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73bd68e16101844cd411a3dff0d761341770413f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73bd68e16101844cd411a3dff0d761341770413f/0_266_6048_3628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ciro Immobile is the focal point of a Lazio team packed with creative talent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ciro Immobile is the focal point of a Lazio team packed with creative talent.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Rosi/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The striker has a particular skill set. He is neither a refined technician nor a physically imposing No 9, but he boasts explosive acceleration and rare efficiency of movement that aids him both with shedding markers and releasing shots in tight spaces.</p> \n<p>Inzaghi\u2019s first Lazio sides used these attributes by playing on the counter, sitting deep and drawing opponents forward before releasing Immobile into space. That remains a weapon in their arsenal, yet they are now capable of unpicking more cautious opponents, thanks to a wealth of creative talents behind Immobile, from Alberto \u2013 whose nine assists lead the division \u2013 to Joaqu\u00edn Correa and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.</p> \n<p>Each member of that trio offers something different. If Alberto is the precision passer, and Correa the dribbler, then Milinkovic-Savic is the fascinating hybrid: a 6ft 3in colossus with deceptively delicate feet. His lack of pace means that at his worst he can look like an ineffective plodder. At his best, though, he is capable of holding off multiple defenders while picking out a teammate in a crowded penalty area, as he did for Sunday\u2019s opener.</p> \n<p>Such precision is necessary against opponents like Udinese, who had arrived with a clear intention to stifle in Luca Gotti\u2019s 5-3-2. Conceding early obliged them to come out of their shell. Correa exploited the gaps ruthlessly, twice drawing fouls inside the box. Immobile converted the first before leaving the next to Alberto.</p> \n<p>Could Lazio\u2019s attacking blend yet propel them into the title race? They have an opportunity to close within three points of Juventus on Saturday, when they host the champions at the Stadio Olimpico. Inter face Roma in Milan the night before. The Giallorossi are in excellent form themselves with five wins in their past six.</p> \n<p>We are not quite back in the days of the <em>Sette Sorelle</em> \u2013 the \u2018Seven Sisters\u2019 (Juventus, Milan, Inter, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, Parma) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, yet there is something nostalgic about seeing both clubs from the capital nipping at the heels of the top two.</p> \n<p>Or maybe all that is just for us old folks. Stefano Turati, after all, has only known one Serie A champion since he turned 10 years old. No wonder he was feeling a little overwhelmed, after thwarting them on his professional debut.</p> \n<h2><strong>Talking points</strong></h2> \n<p>\u2022 Yet another setback for Napoli, beaten at home by Bologna despite having more than 60% possession, a half-time lead, and taking 30 shots to their opponents\u2019 11. Carlo Ancelotti is taking his team back into <em>ritiro</em> (mandatory training camp) from Wednesday even as the fallout continues from the decision by owner Aurelio De Laurentiis to impose similar conditionslast month.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"495a44c91b3b9dd508f0de56f06c569ec9908d34\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/495a44c91b3b9dd508f0de56f06c569ec9908d34/0_137_3600_2558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlo Ancelotti could face a player mutiny after enforcing another mandatory training camp.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlo Ancelotti could face a player mutiny after enforcing another mandatory training camp.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IPA/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 It\u2019s fair to say that Atalanta\u2019s supporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dirono/status/1200881847774928898\">enjoyed their derby win</a> over Brescia. Defeat appears to have cost Fabio Grosso his job as Brescia manager after just three games in charge, with reports that his predecessor, Eugenio Corini, could be reappointed on Monday.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The knee injury suffered by Franck Rib\u00e9ry during Fiorentina\u2019s loss to Lecce is less severe than first feared, with reports variously suggesting he could return either against Roma on 20 December or soon after the winter break. In any case, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/sep/26/franck-ribery-and-a-tale-of-the-unexpected-for-fiorentina\">early-season optimism</a> around the Viola has evaporated. Fans have called for a change of manager at the Artemio Franchi, but the club\u2019s president Rocco Commisso has insisted that he can see progress, and \u201cwants to protect the manager and the team\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 A win, at last, for Milan. Left-back Theo Hernandez, whose instinctive finish sealed the points against Parma, is now joint-top scorer.

      "bodyText": "Stefano Turati learned on Saturday morning that he was about to make his Serie A debut. One day later, he stood in front of a mob of reporters at Juventus\u2019s Allianz Stadium, wearing a turtleneck and a bewildered smile. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain everything that has happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to understand it myself.\u201d The short version goes like this: Turati, at 18 years old, put in a man-of-the-match performance to help Sassuolo earn a 2-2 draw at the home of the Serie A champions. He thwarted Cristiano Ronaldo, extending his 6ft 2in frame to tip a second-half free-kick over the bar, and denied Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, too, smothering a shot from the Argentinian at point-blank range. Turati did all this while sharing a pitch with the greatest goalkeeper of all time. Gianluigi Buffon, 23 years his senior, was among the first to come and congratulate him at full-time. The Juventus player had been a teenager himself when he made his Serie A debut for Parma. It is tempting to draw parallels with that day in 1995. Buffon denied George Weah and Roberto Baggio back then, earning an unexpected draw against a juggernaut Milan team that was on its way to winning the Scudetto. Of course, there are also countless stories in football of debutants who dazzled only to fade quickly from view. We do not know yet if Turati will even play again next weekend. His opportunity against Juventus arose following injuries to starter Andrea Consigli and his regular backup, Gianluca Pegolo. Regardless, Turati has left his mark on this Serie A campaign. Sunday\u2019s draw \u2013 inspired also by an exquisite chip from J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga \u2013 left the door open for Internazionale to vault back into first place. They duly did, sinking Spal with a pair of goals from Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. It is worth reminding ourselves that Inter were top of the table on 3 December 2017, and finished that season by barely scraping into fourth place. A year ago today, however, Juventus were already 11 points clear. It is encouraging to think that this title race should at least endure beyond the winter break. There are reasons for Inter to believe that this time could be different. Never before have they won 12 of their opening 14 games in a top-flight campaign. Antonio Conte\u2019s coaching imprint is visible everywhere, from the confidence with which Lautaro and Romelu Lukaku are already interpreting each other\u2019s movements, to the improved crossing of Antonio Candreva. With all the inevitable focus on the top two, however, it is also easy to overlook the sides right behind them. Lazio have won their last six games in Serie A \u2013 a run not even Inter can match \u2013 and swept Udinese aside 3-0 at the weekend. They are the division\u2019s top scorers, with 33 goals from 14 games. An extraordinary 17 of those belong to Ciro Immobile, and he could have had even more. On Sunday he gave up the opportunity to complete a hat-trick, allowing Luis Alberto to take a penalty at 2-0. It is the second time this season that he has yielded spot-kick duties to a teammate he thought might benefit from a confidence boost. Immobile himself is full to the brim. He could not ask for a better setup than the one he has at Lazio. His manager, Simone Inzaghi, has built his tactics around the striker since they arrived at the club, three months apart, in 2016. The striker has a particular skill set. He is neither a refined technician nor a physically imposing No 9, but he boasts explosive acceleration and rare efficiency of movement that aids him both with shedding markers and releasing shots in tight spaces. Inzaghi\u2019s first Lazio sides used these attributes by playing on the counter, sitting deep and drawing opponents forward before releasing Immobile into space. That remains a weapon in their arsenal, yet they are now capable of unpicking more cautious opponents, thanks to a wealth of creative talents behind Immobile, from Alberto \u2013 whose nine assists lead the division \u2013 to Joaqu\u00edn Correa and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. Each member of that trio offers something different. If Alberto is the precision passer, and Correa the dribbler, then Milinkovic-Savic is the fascinating hybrid: a 6ft 3in colossus with deceptively delicate feet. His lack of pace means that at his worst he can look like an ineffective plodder. At his best, though, he is capable of holding off multiple defenders while picking out a teammate in a crowded penalty area, as he did for Sunday\u2019s opener. Such precision is necessary against opponents like Udinese, who had arrived with a clear intention to stifle in Luca Gotti\u2019s 5-3-2. Conceding early obliged them to come out of their shell. Correa exploited the gaps ruthlessly, twice drawing fouls inside the box. Immobile converted the first before leaving the next to Alberto. Could Lazio\u2019s attacking blend yet propel them into the title race? They have an opportunity to close within three points of Juventus on Saturday, when they host the champions at the Stadio Olimpico. Inter face Roma in Milan the night before. The Giallorossi are in excellent form themselves with five wins in their past six. We are not quite back in the days of the Sette Sorelle \u2013 the \u2018Seven Sisters\u2019 (Juventus, Milan, Inter, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, Parma) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, yet there is something nostalgic about seeing both clubs from the capital nipping at the heels of the top two. Or maybe all that is just for us old folks. Stefano Turati, after all, has only known one Serie A champion since he turned 10 years old. No wonder he was feeling a little overwhelmed, after thwarting them on his professional debut. Talking points \u2022 Yet another setback for Napoli, beaten at home by Bologna despite having more than 60% possession, a half-time lead, and taking 30 shots to their opponents\u2019 11. Carlo Ancelotti is taking his team back into ritiro (mandatory training camp) from Wednesday even as the fallout continues from the decision by owner Aurelio De Laurentiis to impose similar conditionslast month. \u2022 It\u2019s fair to say that Atalanta\u2019s supporters enjoyed their derby win over Brescia. Defeat appears to have cost Fabio Grosso his job as Brescia manager after just three games in charge, with reports that his predecessor, Eugenio Corini, could be reappointed on Monday. \u2022 The knee injury suffered by Franck Rib\u00e9ry during Fiorentina\u2019s loss to Lecce is less severe than first feared, with reports variously suggesting he could return either against Roma on 20 December or soon after the winter break. In any case, the early-season optimism around the Viola has evaporated. Fans have called for a change of manager at the Artemio Franchi, but the club\u2019s president Rocco Commisso has insisted that he can see progress, and \u201cwants to protect the manager and the team\u201d. \u2022 A win, at last, for Milan. Left-back Theo Hernandez, whose instinctive finish sealed the points against Parma, is now joint-top scorer. On three goals \u2026",

      "body": "<p>Barbacoa is a celebratory dish from central Mexico: the marinade of chillies, spices and garlic is slathered over goat or lamb and cooked overnight in a deep pit. Ancho chillies are often used for their sweet, earthy flavour, along with other chilli varieties, depending on the region and the cook. We made a mutton barbacoa at <a href=\"https://www.thegoodlifeexperience.co.uk/\">The Good Life Experience</a> (a festival of music, food and books in Wales) this autumn, spreading the marinade over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/06/10-best-cauliflower-recipes\">cauliflower</a> for the non meat-eaters. I loved the result: a vegetarian supper full of deeply complex flavours and wonderful sweetness.</p> <h2><strong>Barbacoa roast cauliflower with coriander rice and almonds</strong></h2> <p>This makes an excellent plant-based meal if you leave out the sour cream; and a delicious vegetarian one if you don\u2019t.</p> <p>Prep <strong>15 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>1 hr</strong><br>Serves <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>250g short-grain brown rice</strong><br><strong>120ml olive oil</strong><br><strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br><strong>1 tsp salt</strong><br><strong>Small bunch coriander</strong>, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped<br><strong>3 ancho chillies</strong><br><strong>60ml cider vinegar</strong><br><strong>1 \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br><strong>1 \u00bd tsp cumin seeds</strong><br><strong>1 \u00bd tsp dried oregano</strong><br><strong>1 \u00bd tbsp brown sugar</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp tomato puree</strong><br><strong>2 large heads cauliflower</strong>, broken into large florets, along with any tender leaves</p> <p>To serve<br><strong>1 handful toasted, skin-on almonds</strong>, chopped<br><strong>1 lime</strong>, quartered<br><strong>Soured cream or Greek yoghurt </strong>(optional)</p> <p>Heat the oven to 220C (200C)/gas 7. Rinse the rice well in several changes of cold water. Put two tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat, and add a third of the chopped garlic, half the salt, the coriander stalks and the rice. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the grains start to darken, then add 600ml water. Bring to simmering point and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting, cover and leave the rice to finish cooking.</p> <p>Meanwhile, remove the stem and seeds from the chillies and open them up like a book. Warm a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat and, when hot, toast the chillies on both sides for about 30-40 seconds, until they are smelling fragrant and the skin softens \u2013 be careful not to burn them or they will taste bitter. Pop them into a small bowl and cover with boiling water for 10 minutes, until soft.</p> <p>Put the chillies in a blender with 50ml of the soaking water, and blend until finely chopped. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the cauliflower, and puree until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl, tip in the cauliflower florets, any young, tender leaves and the rest of the salt, and use your hands to coat the cauliflower in the marinade. Spread out on to one large oven tray lined with baking paper, and roast for 30-35 minutes, until dark and charred around the edges.</p> <p>Use a fork to fluff up the rice and serve with the cauliflower, a scattering of almonds and coriander leaves, lime wedges and some soured cream, if you like.</p> <h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong><br></h2> <p>The barbacoa marinade is delicious slathered over everything from pumpkin wedges and celeriac to chicken thighs and lamb shoulder \u2013 experiment.

      "bodyText": "Barbacoa is a celebratory dish from central Mexico: the marinade of chillies, spices and garlic is slathered over goat or lamb and cooked overnight in a deep pit. Ancho chillies are often used for their sweet, earthy flavour, along with other chilli varieties, depending on the region and the cook. We made a mutton barbacoa at The Good Life Experience (a festival of music, food and books in Wales) this autumn, spreading the marinade over cauliflower for the non meat-eaters. I loved the result: a vegetarian supper full of deeply complex flavours and wonderful sweetness. Barbacoa roast cauliflower with coriander rice and almonds This makes an excellent plant-based meal if you leave out the sour cream; and a delicious vegetarian one if you don\u2019t. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 250g short-grain brown rice 120ml olive oil 4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped 1 tsp salt Small bunch coriander, leaves picked and stalks finely chopped 3 ancho chillies 60ml cider vinegar 1 \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon 1 \u00bd tsp cumin seeds 1 \u00bd tsp dried oregano 1 \u00bd tbsp brown sugar 2 tbsp tomato puree 2 large heads cauliflower, broken into large florets, along with any tender leaves To serve 1 handful toasted, skin-on almonds, chopped 1 lime, quartered Soured cream or Greek yoghurt (optional) Heat the oven to 220C (200C)/gas 7. Rinse the rice well in several changes of cold water. Put two tablespoons of oil in a medium saucepan over a medium-high heat, and add a third of the chopped garlic, half the salt, the coriander stalks and the rice. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the grains start to darken, then add 600ml water. Bring to simmering point and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting, cover and leave the rice to finish cooking. Meanwhile, remove the stem and seeds from the chillies and open them up like a book. Warm a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat and, when hot, toast the chillies on both sides for about 30-40 seconds, until they are smelling fragrant and the skin softens \u2013 be careful not to burn them or they will taste bitter. Pop them into a small bowl and cover with boiling water for 10 minutes, until soft. Put the chillies in a blender with 50ml of the soaking water, and blend until finely chopped. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the cauliflower, and puree until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl, tip in the cauliflower florets, any young, tender leaves and the rest of the salt, and use your hands to coat the cauliflower in the marinade. Spread out on to one large oven tray lined with baking paper, and roast for 30-35 minutes, until dark and charred around the edges. Use a fork to fluff up the rice and serve with the cauliflower, a scattering of almonds and coriander leaves, lime wedges and some soured cream, if you like. And for the rest of the week The barbacoa marinade is delicious slathered over everything from pumpkin wedges and celeriac to chicken thighs and lamb shoulder \u2013 experiment. Mix leftover cider vinegar with farmhouse apple juice and sparkling water for a gut-friendly, non-alcoholic cocktail.",

But in the letter, sent on Monday, Corbyn called on him to take a series of concrete steps to show he is serious. These include bringing all services back in-house; repealing the Health and Social Care Act, and suspending trade talks until Washington changes its negotiating objectives. Corbyn says Johnson should decline to press ahead with talks on a bilateral trade deal unless Trump excludes any reference to pharmaceuticals from US negotiating plans and accept the role of the regulator \u2013 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in setting drugs prices. Washington\u2019s negotiating objectives, a public document, include the demand that \u201cstate-owned enterprises\u201d should \u201caccord non-discriminatory treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of goods and services\u201d. It also calls for \u201cfull market access for US products\u201d, for what it calls \u201cgovernment regulatory reimbursement regimes\u201d for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Trump\u2019s public appearances during his visit will be scrutinised closely for any comments about a future trade deal. When he and Johnson met at the Biarritz G7 meeting in August, the US president lavished praise on Johnson, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been saying it for a long time: he\u2019s the right man for the job.\u201d He has also criticised Corbyn in the past. Labour hopes switching the debate back to the NHS will help it to persuade traditional supporters to stick with the party.

I decided to take my power back.\u201d Page left the FBI in May 2018 amid controversy, driven by Trump, over her role in the Russia investigation and an extra-marital relationship she had with bureau agent Peter Strzok, who went on to work for special counsel Robert Mueller. Strzok was fired in August 2018. At a rally in Minnesota in October, Trump read from messages between Page and Strzok, from August 2016, three months before the election. Apparently pretending to have an orgasm, the president said: \u201cI love you, Peter! I love you too Lisa! Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, Oh God, I love you, Lisa. \u201cAnd if [Hillary Clinton] doesn\u2019t win, Lisa, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy, Lisa! We\u2019ll get that son of a bitch out.\u201d The messages between Strzok and Page were made public during Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. In one famous exchange, Page asked: \u201c[Trump\u2019s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d Strzok replied: \u201cNo. No he\u2019s not. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d The pro-Trump right immediately seized on the messages as evidence of supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d bias against the president. But while the deep state conspiracy theory holds that a permanent government of bureaucrats and intelligence operatives exists to thwart Trump, one of its first proponents, former White House strategist Steve Bannon, has said on record it is \u201cfor nut cases\u201d. Being the subject of sustained presidential invective, Page said, was \u201calmost impossible to describe. It\u2019s like being punched in the gut. My heart drops to my stomach when I realise he has tweeted about me again. The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world. He\u2019s demeaning me and my career. It\u2019s sickening.\u201d Page, now in private practice, said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t even call [her experience] [post-traumatic stress disorder] because it\u2019s not over. It\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s not a historical event that is being relived. It just keeps happening\u201d. Referring to a tweet sent by Trump four days before the interview, she said: \u201cWhen Roger Stone got convicted, he asked: why isn\u2019t Page in jail too? Not to mention, you know, his truly reprehensible, degrading stunt at his rally, in which he used my name to simulate an orgasm. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t ever know when the president\u2019s going to attack next. And when it happens, it can still sort of upend my day. You don\u2019t really get used to it.\u201d Like most of Washington \u2013 and the president \u2013 Page is now awaiting the publication on 9 December of a report by the justice department inspector general into Trump\u2019s claim that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign. Page is expected to be exonerated of acting unprofessionally or with bias against Trump. Of the political views she exchanged with Strzok, she told the Beast \u201chaving an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds\u201d of regulations covering political activity by federal employees. The Department of Justice was roundly criticised for releasing Page and Strzok\u2019s messages to the press. Page said it was \u201cvery painful to see to places like the FBI and the Department of Justice that represent so much of what is excellent about this country, not fulfilling the critical obligation that they have to speak truth to power\u201d. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s crushing to see the noble justice department, my justice department, the place I grew up in, feel like it\u2019s abandoned its principles of truth and independence.\u201d",

While at Automotive high school in Brooklyn, he played in a local drum and bugle corps, but it was not until his early 20s that he began to develop a real interest in music. Joining the US army in 1943, he fought in Burma during the second world war and began to play the saxophone, sing in the army choir and learn the church organ.</p> <p>In peacetime, using money made available by the GI bill, he signed up to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York and used the same source of funding to undertake voice studies at the University of Arizona and then the University of Southern California.</p> <p>Having become friends with the Jamaican writer and folklorist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/01/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Louise Bennett-Coverley</a>, who added greatly to the store of traditional Caribbean folk songs he had learned in his childhood, from 1953 Burgie began performing as a singer and guitarist under the name Lord Burgess, mainly in folk clubs and often with a backing band called the Serenaders.</p> <p>By 1955, however, he had joined up with his fellow New Yorker Belafonte, who had been advised by Attaway, a mutual friend, to listen to Burgie\u2019s latest compositions. Up to that point much of Belafonte\u2019s material had been oriented towards the American folk tradition, but when he heard Burgie\u2019s Caribbean-focused work he decided on a shift in direction. The songs formed the backbone of Calypso, which became Belafonte\u2019s landmark album and won him a massive worldwide following.</p> <p>Despite the title of the record, most of its offerings were in fact based around the traditional mento music of Jamaica rather than the calypso of Trinidad. Nonetheless, the popularity of its contents further stoked a post-war \u201ccalypso boom\u201d that had its origins in the US and UK with the release in 1945 of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiayZdPESno\" title=\"\">Rum and Coca Cola by the Andrews Sisters</a>.</p> <p>The music historian Cary Ginell judged that aside from greatly boosting the popularity of Caribbean music, Burgie\u2019s songs had an \u201cinestimable influence\u201d on folk artists of all backgrounds, to the extent that \u201cfor a decade afterwards, just about every folk singer or folk group featured in their repertoire at least one song that was of West Indian origin or one that had a calypso beat\u201d.</p> <p>Even though Belafonte, keen to avoid typecasting, was quite sparing thereafter with his use of Caribbean material, the bulk of Burgie\u2019s earnings \u2013 around $20m \u2013 came from royalties on the more than 30 compositions he wrote for his friend across three bestselling albums.</p> <p>When not writing for Belafonte he took the opportunity to branch off into other projects, creating the lyrics and music for a 1963 off-Broadway musical called Ballad for Bimshire, and in 1966 taking up a commission to pen the words to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goGjLXgfLP8\" title=\"\">the national anthem of Barbados</a>. He used his money to indulge a love of travel and to quietly support civil rights causes and community projects in New York, where he lived all his life.</p> <p>Although for the most part Burgie was content to concentrate on songwriting, in 1996 he did eventually release a solo album, Island in the Sun, which he followed up with another, The Father of Modern Calypso, in 2003.</p> <p>In 2007 he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the same year he brought out his autobiography, Day-O!!! He was also author of The West Indian Song Book (1972) and Caribbean Carnival: Songs of the West Indies (1993).</p> <p>In 1956, Burgie married his first wife, Page Turner; she died in 2003, and his second wife, Vivia Heron, died in 2007. He is survived by two sons, Andrew and Irving Jr, a grandchild and a great-grandchild.</p> <p>\u2022 Irving Louis Burgie, songwriter, born 28 July 1924; died 29 November 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "Virtually overnight, a 1956 album entitled Calypso made the American singer Harry Belafonte into one of the biggest names of 20th century popular music. A collection of 11 songs that projected a folksy, romantic image of the Caribbean, it was the first record by a solo artist to sell a million copies, spending 31 weeks at the top of the album charts. Yet the man who wrote eight of those successful compositions, Belafonte\u2019s fellow American Irving Burgie, remained largely unheralded outside songwriting circles. Burgie, who has died aged 95, had the great knack of reworking traditional West Indian folk songs in a way that retained their bittersweet inner core while coating them with an accessible, easy listening shell that was perfect for Belafonte\u2019s precise, heartfelt delivery. Among them was the now immortal Banana Boat Song (also known as Day-O), an adaptation of a Jamaican work tune in which a weary docker yearns for the end of a back-breaking night shift with the lines: \u201cCome, mister tally man, tally me banana/ Daylight come and me wan\u2019 go home\u201d. The song had been around for decades in one colloquial form or another, but it was Burgie\u2019s imaginative and supremely polished version (achieved with some help from the writer William Attaway) that brought it to widespread attention, both on Belafonte\u2019s album and as a top ten single in the UK and US in 1957. It became one of Belafonte\u2019s signature tunes, but more than that has remained in the public consciousness ever since, continuing its life through countless cover versions, in films and on television shows, in cabaret routines and at sporting events, and in bar-room singsongs across the world. Almost equally as recognisable to the ear, though rather less familiar by title, is Burgie\u2019s Jamaica Farewell, created for the same album from an old folk tune and overlaid with lyrics in which a sailor laments his departure from the Jamaican capital, Kingston, where he has left behind a lover. If both songs have come to represent, in many people\u2019s hearing, the essence of Caribbean music, then so too has a third Burgie number, Island in the Sun, which he wrote jointly with Belafonte for the 1957 film of the same name. That a trio of such quintessentially West Indian compositions, all hugely and enduringly popular, could have emerged from the same hand is quite remarkable. Born in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood of Brooklyn in New York, Irving was the son of Louis Burgie, an African-American slaughterhouse labourer from Virginia, and his wife, Viola (nee Callender), a seamstress who had moved from Barbados to the US in the early 1900s. While at Automotive high school in Brooklyn, he played in a local drum and bugle corps, but it was not until his early 20s that he began to develop a real interest in music. Joining the US army in 1943, he fought in Burma during the second world war and began to play the saxophone, sing in the army choir and learn the church organ. In peacetime, using money made available by the GI bill, he signed up to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York and used the same source of funding to undertake voice studies at the University of Arizona and then the University of Southern California. Having become friends with the Jamaican writer and folklorist Louise Bennett-Coverley, who added greatly to the store of traditional Caribbean folk songs he had learned in his childhood, from 1953 Burgie began performing as a singer and guitarist under the name Lord Burgess, mainly in folk clubs and often with a backing band called the Serenaders. By 1955, however, he had joined up with his fellow New Yorker Belafonte, who had been advised by Attaway, a mutual friend, to listen to Burgie\u2019s latest compositions. Up to that point much of Belafonte\u2019s material had been oriented towards the American folk tradition, but when he heard Burgie\u2019s Caribbean-focused work he decided on a shift in direction. The songs formed the backbone of Calypso, which became Belafonte\u2019s landmark album and won him a massive worldwide following. Despite the title of the record, most of its offerings were in fact based around the traditional mento music of Jamaica rather than the calypso of Trinidad. Nonetheless, the popularity of its contents further stoked a post-war \u201ccalypso boom\u201d that had its origins in the US and UK with the release in 1945 of Rum and Coca Cola by the Andrews Sisters. The music historian Cary Ginell judged that aside from greatly boosting the popularity of Caribbean music, Burgie\u2019s songs had an \u201cinestimable influence\u201d on folk artists of all backgrounds, to the extent that \u201cfor a decade afterwards, just about every folk singer or folk group featured in their repertoire at least one song that was of West Indian origin or one that had a calypso beat\u201d. Even though Belafonte, keen to avoid typecasting, was quite sparing thereafter with his use of Caribbean material, the bulk of Burgie\u2019s earnings \u2013 around $20m \u2013 came from royalties on the more than 30 compositions he wrote for his friend across three bestselling albums. When not writing for Belafonte he took the opportunity to branch off into other projects, creating the lyrics and music for a 1963 off-Broadway musical called Ballad for Bimshire, and in 1966 taking up a commission to pen the words to the national anthem of Barbados. He used his money to indulge a love of travel and to quietly support civil rights causes and community projects in New York, where he lived all his life. Although for the most part Burgie was content to concentrate on songwriting, in 1996 he did eventually release a solo album, Island in the Sun, which he followed up with another, The Father of Modern Calypso, in 2003. In 2007 he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the same year he brought out his autobiography, Day-O!!! He was also author of The West Indian Song Book (1972) and Caribbean Carnival: Songs of the West Indies (1993). In 1956, Burgie married his first wife, Page Turner; she died in 2003, and his second wife, Vivia Heron, died in 2007. He is survived by two sons, Andrew and Irving Jr, a grandchild and a great-grandchild. \u2022 Irving Louis Burgie, songwriter, born 28 July 1924; died 29 November 2019",

His cosmic arrival had scattered mutational meteor rock throughout Smallville, a canny plot device that created a Krypton factory line of freaks and empowered geeks for him to contend with. This X-Files flavour enhanced the angsty teen melodrama, which mostly involved Clark mooning over local beauty Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). Clark\u2019s loving foster parents the Kents were the heart of the show, instilling values into their alien adoptee. But Clark\u2019s most intense relationship was with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), a billionaire heir whose conniving patter was as smooth as his bald bonce. Their meet-cute involved Clark retrieving a drowning Lex and giving him mouth-to-mouth.

Copenhagen\u2019s maritime and commercial court ruled in favour of Tal R, forbidding the duo from going ahead with their project and ordering them to pay 31,550 Danish krone (\u00a33,600) in legal costs, arguing that as the scheme was an alternation rather than a destruction of the work, it contravened copyright law.

      "body": "<p>I used to think the saddest place in Prague was a prospect high above the Vltava River. It is a peaceful though somewhat neglected spot, buttressed by granite ramparts covered with graffiti and popular with families out for a stroll, skateboarders, joggers and tourists taking selfies against the backdrop of the city. At its centre is a gently mounded plateau, empty except for a giant metronome, soon to be taken down.</p> <p>The area has no name on current maps of Prague, but it was once known, in popular parlance, as \u201cU Stalina\u201d \u2013 Stalin\u2019s place. In 1955, two years after the Soviet dictator\u2019s death, a massive 50-foot high granite monument to him was unveiled on this spot, the largest representation of Stalin in the world. Commissioned in the late 1940s when Czechoslovakia was being turned into a Soviet satellite state, and already under construction as Stalin lay dying, the monstrous memorial remained in place until 1962 when, in the spirit of de-Stalinisation, it was blown to smithereens by the same regime that erected it.</p> <p>Over the past month, 30 years after a series of popular revolts cascaded through central and eastern Europe and swept Soviet-style totalitarianism into history, the city has seen hundreds of conferences, rallies, re-enactments, concerts and street parties commemorating what the Czechs call their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/nov/13/czechoslovakia-velvet-revolution-november-1989\">Velvet Revolution</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b62c5bde39b245d6ab3c0f752cf76b9b2e63332\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b62c5bde39b245d6ab3c0f752cf76b9b2e63332/0_0_3500_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Czechoslovak students shout in support of Vaclav Havel for presidency during protest rally at Wenceslas Square in Prague in November 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Czechoslovak students shout in support of Vaclav Havel for presidency during protest rally at Wenceslas Square in Prague in November 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lubomir Kotek/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet beneath the mood of celebration, you could feel a note of anxiety that can be summed up in a single question: with the rise of autocratic governments in Poland and Hungary, with the apparent fragility of the European Union, and with the bizarre alliances US president Donald Trump is forging with some of the world\u2019s worst dictators, can the free-market democracy the Czechs have built over the past three decades survive? Given the history of the past century, during which Prague experienced eight abrupt and radically different regime changes and two military invasions, the question is not an idle one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/nov/16/czechoslovakias-velvet-revolution-1989-in-pictures\">Czechoslovakia\u2019s Velvet Revolution, 1989 - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In its 4 November issue, the country\u2019s most influential weekly magazine, Respekt<em>, </em>ran a small survey that in its own way encapsulated the uncertainty. The magazine asked a panel that included a sculptor, an historian of architecture, a former dissident writer and a young social activist: should Prague have a memorial to the Velvet Revolution? And if so, where should it be located?</p> <p>Eda Kriseov\u00e1, a writer who took an active part in the Velvet Revolution, told the magazine she couldn\u2019t imagine a conventional memorial that would adequately represent an event that was \u201cso alive, so spontaneous, so joyful\u201d. In any case, she cautioned, \u201cwe haven\u2019t had the best experience with stone memorials.\u201d</p> <p>Her answer points to a problem that is universal but particularly acute in Prague. Monuments erected in moments of political or historical zeal can quickly become embarrassing or even offensive when feelings and attitudes change. The movement to tear down or alter statues of racist colonial figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/sep/26/statue-wars-what-should-we-do-with-troublesome-monuments\">has become a global phenomenon</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7566aa74c47b0d563947c7c537ce5fb41b38df7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7566aa74c47b0d563947c7c537ce5fb41b38df7f/0_116_4884_2931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A defaced statue of Soviet field marshal Ivan Konev in Prague in May 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A defaced statue of Soviet field marshal Ivan Konev in Prague in May 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: V\u00edt \u0160im\u00e1nek/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The architecture historian Zden\u011bk Luke\u0161, who worked for over a decade in the Prague Castle under the late president V\u00e1clav Havel, told Respekt he\u2019d prefer to wait until the country emerged from its current political malaise before considering any grand, permanent memorial to 1989. The plaque that already exists on the site of the student demonstration that triggered the revolution is memento enough, he said.</p> <p>When I asked Luke\u0161 why he thought the Czechs were so quick to remove monuments to the past, he said it may have to do with a lack of certainty about their identity. By way of illustration, Luke\u0161 told me a story about the fate of the statues depicting the country\u2019s much-loved patriarch Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, who became president when Czechoslovakia was created in 1918.</p> <p>Erected in several towns shortly after his death in 1935, the statues were taken down and buried when the Nazis occupied the country in 1939. After the second world war they were dug up and reinstated, only to be buried once more in 1948 when the communists seized power. During the Prague Spring in 1968, Masaryk was disinterred again, but then removed and buried after the Soviet invasion and occupation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e0a1867ff0d5b4b8bf77b1f8ec3c66d7e01c29b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e0a1867ff0d5b4b8bf77b1f8ec3c66d7e01c29b/0_260_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, first president of Czechoslovakia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Statue of Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, first president of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Bottle/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His final resurrection occurred after 1989, when he became a symbol of democracy restored. It all happened in the dark, as it were, with no public input or debate \u2013 and if the story seems amusing today, it\u2019s also a sobering reminder of why the Czechs, even now, might feel their democracy, and their existence as a nation, to be more fragile than it is.</p> <p>As if to ward off that capricious future, the most beloved Czech leader since Masaryk has no statue to him at all. Just as he once dominated the Velvet Revolution, V\u00e1clav Havel, the playwright who became president, has loomed large over the 30th anniversary proceedings; according to a recent poll, 74% of young people between 18 and 29 consider him the best post-communist president.</p> <p>Havel died in 2011, yet there are few memorials to him around the city, unless you count the modest plaque outside his post-presidential office in the centre of Prague, or \u201cHavel\u2019s Place\u201d \u2013 a table and two chairs arranged as if for intimate conversation outside a restaurant on Malt\u00e9zsk\u00e9 Square in Prague\u2019s Mal\u00e1 Strana quarter. The two places in Prague that bear Havel\u2019s name \u2013 the city\u2019s international airport, and a modest square behind the New Stage of the National Theatre \u2013 come with a touch of irony: Havel hated flying, and he hated the new National Theatre building.</p> <p>The Velvet Revolution triggered a whole new wave of iconoclasm. In addition to the many plaques and busts of Lenin and of the first communist president, Klement Gottwald, hundreds of pieces of public art created during the communist era, most of them with no political or artistic significance, were removed without fanfare or regret. It also unleashed an unprecedented wave of bold creativity in public art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c968b0b7a0d98a8027c10ae1eff700b040c66d74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c968b0b7a0d98a8027c10ae1eff700b040c66d74/0_131_3261_1957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vaclav Havel waves to a crowd of thousands of demonstrators gathered on Prague\u2019s Wenceslas Square on 10 December 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vaclav Havel waves to a crowd of thousands of demonstrators gathered on Prague\u2019s Wenceslas Square on 10 December 1989.

The action radically altered the meaning of the memorial while leaving it intact.</p> <p>In the past 30 years \u010cern\u00fd has become the most prolific Czech sculptor (at least since Matthias Braun, whose 18th-century sculptures are still standing on Prague\u2019s Charles Bridge). \u010cern\u00fd\u2019s work ranges from the monumental, like the giant stainless-steel kinetic sculpture of Kafka\u2019s head in the centre of Prague, to the subtle, like the enigmatic and barely noticeable \u201cEmbryo\u201d installed as part of the downspout outside the Theatre on the Balustrade, where Havel premiered his early plays in the 1960s.</p> <p>\u010cern\u00fd\u2019s <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Quo_vadis_(David_%C4%8Cern%C3%BD)#/media/File:Trabbi_prague.jpeg\">Quo Vadis (Trabant)</a>, installed in the garden of the German embassy, is a reminder of the mass exodus of East Germans to the west before the Wall was breached on 9 November 1989; and his rendition of St Wenceslas \u2013 mounted on a dead horse suspended upside-down from the ceiling of the Lucerna Palace \u2013 was inspired by a period of political depression in the late 1990s.

      "bodyText": "I used to think the saddest place in Prague was a prospect high above the Vltava River. It is a peaceful though somewhat neglected spot, buttressed by granite ramparts covered with graffiti and popular with families out for a stroll, skateboarders, joggers and tourists taking selfies against the backdrop of the city. At its centre is a gently mounded plateau, empty except for a giant metronome, soon to be taken down. The area has no name on current maps of Prague, but it was once known, in popular parlance, as \u201cU Stalina\u201d \u2013 Stalin\u2019s place. In 1955, two years after the Soviet dictator\u2019s death, a massive 50-foot high granite monument to him was unveiled on this spot, the largest representation of Stalin in the world. Commissioned in the late 1940s when Czechoslovakia was being turned into a Soviet satellite state, and already under construction as Stalin lay dying, the monstrous memorial remained in place until 1962 when, in the spirit of de-Stalinisation, it was blown to smithereens by the same regime that erected it. Over the past month, 30 years after a series of popular revolts cascaded through central and eastern Europe and swept Soviet-style totalitarianism into history, the city has seen hundreds of conferences, rallies, re-enactments, concerts and street parties commemorating what the Czechs call their Velvet Revolution. Yet beneath the mood of celebration, you could feel a note of anxiety that can be summed up in a single question: with the rise of autocratic governments in Poland and Hungary, with the apparent fragility of the European Union, and with the bizarre alliances US president Donald Trump is forging with some of the world\u2019s worst dictators, can the free-market democracy the Czechs have built over the past three decades survive? Given the history of the past century, during which Prague experienced eight abrupt and radically different regime changes and two military invasions, the question is not an idle one. In its 4 November issue, the country\u2019s most influential weekly magazine, Respekt, ran a small survey that in its own way encapsulated the uncertainty. The magazine asked a panel that included a sculptor, an historian of architecture, a former dissident writer and a young social activist: should Prague have a memorial to the Velvet Revolution? And if so, where should it be located? Eda Kriseov\u00e1, a writer who took an active part in the Velvet Revolution, told the magazine she couldn\u2019t imagine a conventional memorial that would adequately represent an event that was \u201cso alive, so spontaneous, so joyful\u201d. In any case, she cautioned, \u201cwe haven\u2019t had the best experience with stone memorials.\u201d Her answer points to a problem that is universal but particularly acute in Prague. Monuments erected in moments of political or historical zeal can quickly become embarrassing or even offensive when feelings and attitudes change. The movement to tear down or alter statues of racist colonial figures has become a global phenomenon. The architecture historian Zden\u011bk Luke\u0161, who worked for over a decade in the Prague Castle under the late president V\u00e1clav Havel, told Respekt he\u2019d prefer to wait until the country emerged from its current political malaise before considering any grand, permanent memorial to 1989. The plaque that already exists on the site of the student demonstration that triggered the revolution is memento enough, he said. When I asked Luke\u0161 why he thought the Czechs were so quick to remove monuments to the past, he said it may have to do with a lack of certainty about their identity. By way of illustration, Luke\u0161 told me a story about the fate of the statues depicting the country\u2019s much-loved patriarch Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, who became president when Czechoslovakia was created in 1918. Erected in several towns shortly after his death in 1935, the statues were taken down and buried when the Nazis occupied the country in 1939. After the second world war they were dug up and reinstated, only to be buried once more in 1948 when the communists seized power. During the Prague Spring in 1968, Masaryk was disinterred again, but then removed and buried after the Soviet invasion and occupation. His final resurrection occurred after 1989, when he became a symbol of democracy restored. It all happened in the dark, as it were, with no public input or debate \u2013 and if the story seems amusing today, it\u2019s also a sobering reminder of why the Czechs, even now, might feel their democracy, and their existence as a nation, to be more fragile than it is. As if to ward off that capricious future, the most beloved Czech leader since Masaryk has no statue to him at all. Just as he once dominated the Velvet Revolution, V\u00e1clav Havel, the playwright who became president, has loomed large over the 30th anniversary proceedings; according to a recent poll, 74% of young people between 18 and 29 consider him the best post-communist president. Havel died in 2011, yet there are few memorials to him around the city, unless you count the modest plaque outside his post-presidential office in the centre of Prague, or \u201cHavel\u2019s Place\u201d \u2013 a table and two chairs arranged as if for intimate conversation outside a restaurant on Malt\u00e9zsk\u00e9 Square in Prague\u2019s Mal\u00e1 Strana quarter. The two places in Prague that bear Havel\u2019s name \u2013 the city\u2019s international airport, and a modest square behind the New Stage of the National Theatre \u2013 come with a touch of irony: Havel hated flying, and he hated the new National Theatre building. The Velvet Revolution triggered a whole new wave of iconoclasm. In addition to the many plaques and busts of Lenin and of the first communist president, Klement Gottwald, hundreds of pieces of public art created during the communist era, most of them with no political or artistic significance, were removed without fanfare or regret. It also unleashed an unprecedented wave of bold creativity in public art. The first and most spectacular example was an apparent act of creative vandalism when a Soviet tank, mounted on a pedestal as a monument to the Soviet liberation of Prague in 1945, was painted pink by a young sculptor, David \u010cern\u00fd, in 1991. The action radically altered the meaning of the memorial while leaving it intact. In the past 30 years \u010cern\u00fd has become the most prolific Czech sculptor (at least since Matthias Braun, whose 18th-century sculptures are still standing on Prague\u2019s Charles Bridge). \u010cern\u00fd\u2019s work ranges from the monumental, like the giant stainless-steel kinetic sculpture of Kafka\u2019s head in the centre of Prague, to the subtle, like the enigmatic and barely noticeable \u201cEmbryo\u201d installed as part of the downspout outside the Theatre on the Balustrade, where Havel premiered his early plays in the 1960s. \u010cern\u00fd\u2019s Quo Vadis (Trabant), installed in the garden of the German embassy, is a reminder of the mass exodus of East Germans to the west before the Wall was breached on 9 November 1989; and his rendition of St Wenceslas \u2013 mounted on a dead horse suspended upside-down from the ceiling of the Lucerna Palace \u2013 was inspired by a period of political depression in the late 1990s. His works radiate a self-deprecating humour that seems intrinsic to the Czech nature, though it seldom finds expression in its public art. One sign that Prague is becoming a normal country again is the current controversy over a statue erected in 1980 to honour the Soviet field marshal Ivan Stepanovich Konev. He led the army that drove the Germans out of part of Czechoslovakia at the end of the second world war, but he also crushed the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and is suspected of having helped plan the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Last year, after a number of incidents of vandalism, a plaque providing more details of Konev\u2019s legacy was added to the statue. The plaque merely inflamed resentment, and the incidents of vandalism intensified. Ond\u0159ej Kol\u00e1\u0159, the mayor of Prague 6, where the statue is located, declared that he was tired of \u201cpolishing the marshal\u2019s boots\u201d and had the statue surrounded by scaffolding draped in opaque plastic. That only made matters worse. Communist members of parliament and Russian embassy officials vehemently protested, accusing the mayor of being a Nazi sympathiser. A vicious social media campaign, rumoured to be fuelled by Russian trolls, spread misinformation about him, and he and his family received death threats and were placed under police protection. The Prague 6 council has voted to relocate the statue to \u201ca dignified place\u201d, most probably to a newly proposed Museum of Memorials of the Twentieth Century. But the controversy is still simmering, and is yet another reminder of continuing tension between the Russians and the Czechs. As if to acknowledge that victory can be ephemeral, the public memorials that do survive over time tend to honour the victims and martyrs of Czech history rather than its victors. A monument to Jan Hus, an early religious reformer who was burned at the stake for heresy in 1415, was erected in Prague\u2019s Old Town Square in 1915, and has lasted through the many regime changes since then. The city walls still hold many small plaques and niches commemorating people killed during clashes with the retreating Germans at the end of the second world war, or who died confronting Warsaw Pact troops during the invasion of August 1968. Olbram Zoubek\u2019s memorial to the victims of communism \u2013 a set of skeletal figures arranged on an illuminated staircase to nowhere \u2013 is popular with visitors to Prague, as is the memorial to Jan Palach, the student who burned himself to death on Wenceslas Square in 1969 as a protest against the Soviet occupation. Until recently, there was even a plaque to Milan Hlavsa, the founding member of the much-harassed underground band I once played with, the Plastic People of the Universe. It had a slot where, for a crown, it would play his most famous song, The Destroying Angel. The sculptor Pavel Karous, who has made a study of the country\u2019s ambiguous relationship to its public memorials, told Respekt that the 30th anniversary should be an occasion, not for empty celebration, but for critical self-reflection.

      "body": "<h2>The highs \u2026</h2> <h2>Hamilton\u2019s imperious driving</h2> <p>Even by his own high standards Lewis Hamilton set a new benchmark in 2019. In a class of his own, his sixth championship was defined by opening with an almost crushing, relentless run that all but had the job done by the summer break. After Valtteri Bottas started strongly and the teammates shared two wins apiece, Hamilton found another plane. Four from four followed including harassing Sebastian Vettel into an error in Canada, a tyre management masterclass in Monaco and a clinical, precision dissection in France where he finished 18 seconds ahead. Silverstone and Hungary were standouts too, as was Mexico. The 34-year-old was near flawless, Germany being almost the only exception. His touch and control were unmatched in a season that showcased a sportsman at the peak of his powers.</p> <h2>Leclerc\u2019s impressive Ferarri debut</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/25/ferrari-historic-penchant-crisis-90-years-anniversary-maranello\">Ferrari\u2019s historic penchant for a good crisis remains \u2013 90 years down the track | Richard Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Few imagined Charles Leclerc could arrive at Ferrari in his first season for the Scuderia and rise to the challenge with such consummate ability. In only his second season in F1, Leclerc gave notice he has every chance to be a future world champion. Lined up against the four-time champion Vettel, who was given lead\u2011driver status, and under the scrutiny and spotlight of driving for Ferrari, the 22-year-old was majestic. His run in only the second round in Bahrain was magnificent, that of a driver beyond his years and a win was denied only by a mechanical problem. He scored the most poles this season with seven and deservedly took victories at Monza and Spa. Of course he made errors but after every one he appeared to emerge wiser and stronger. Other drivers have wilted under similar pressure, Leclerc blossomed.</p> <h2>Verstappen shows champion quality</h2> <p>Since his crash in practice at Monaco last year, after which he faced considerable criticism for his driving style, Max Verstappen has developed as a more complete driver. This season he exhibited the qualities that define him as a champion in waiting. The aggressive, daring instincts that make him so compelling to watch remain, as demonstrated in his pass on Leclerc in Austria and again in Abu Dhabi, but they have been tempered with more control and judgment. His battle with Leclerc at Silverstone was equally gripping while his win in the wet in Germany was a tour de force as all around him fell apart at the Hockenheimring. Perhaps most indicative of how far he has come was the clinical victory, having been on top all weekend, in Brazil. Verstappen\u2019s fifth season in F1 was his best yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8852e5c7458208c3cce7dd77ca64fc48423a7d1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8852e5c7458208c3cce7dd77ca64fc48423a7d1e/4_553_4849_2909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Verstappen this season showed the qualities that define him as a future world champion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max Verstappen this season showed the qualities that define him as a future world champion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>McLaren\u2019s resurgence</h2> <p>There is a way to go until they are back fighting with the big three but seeing a resurgent McLaren is only good for F1. Their fourth place in the championship is their highest finish since 2012 and was thoroughly deserved as they were consistently the best of the rest. With a car that was competitive, the team proved to be able to step up to match it with their execution. Better still in Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz they have a formidable driver pairing. Britain\u2019s Norris proved every bit of his potential in a debut season of which he and the team can be proud. He was not awed by going wheel to wheel with Hamilton and Vettel, and was impressively mature in coping with setbacks out of his control. Sainz, too, showed exactly why he has long been highly rated. His pass on Alexander Albon and Daniil Kvyat up the hill at Monaco was breathtaking.</p> <h2>The mid-season purple patch</h2> <p>A largely turgid French Grand Prix closed with Mercedes and Hamilton looking to run away with the season and perhaps fears the racing would subsequently not deliver, but a sequence of meetings following that were stunning. Austria was gripping with Verstappen hunting Leclerc; then Silverstone was an end-to-end tumult of passing, scrapping and incident, with the drivers coming away once more with high praise for the old airfield. Chaos, error and drama followed in Germany at a race where second place was held by nine drivers and the crowd roared their approval of Verstappen\u2019s win. Then in Hungary Hamilton and Mercedes came back at Red Bull and Verstappen. It was the first time they had been wheel to wheel and unmissable. The four-race sequence was salutary reminder that F1 can still deliver like no other series.</p> <h2>The lows \u2026</h2> <h2>Ferrari fight falls away</h2> <p>After winter testing every indication was that Ferrari were going into the season with a pace advantage. A real fight at the front with Mercedes was highly anticipated. Within four races it had almost entirely dissipated. Their engine indeed had the edge but it transpired they lacked the balance, downforce and grip to exploit it on the majority of tracks. While Mercedes proved they had their front-wing concept working perfectly, Ferrari were foundering. Even with an advantage, the Scuderia, Vettel and Leclerc would have had to be at the top of their games to challenge Mercedes and often they were not. With the car not where they needed it to be, and Vettel in particular finding it a handful, they swiftly fell away. Ferrari\u2019s disappointment at failing to challenge was echoed by fans spoiling for a good fight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e134056a8559e2801e128e4ea3d7bdf8595b8ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e134056a8559e2801e128e4ea3d7bdf8595b8ec/0_141_5330_3199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Vettel had a disappointing F1 season with Ferrari.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sebastian Vettel had a disappointing F1 season with Ferrari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hubert\u2019s death at Spa</h2> <p>The death of the Frenchman Anthoine Hubert in an F2 race during the Belgian F1 Grand Prix weekend at Spa was a huge blow for the sport and a tragedy for everyone involved. Hubert died after a high-speed accident when exiting Eau Rouge. The 22-year-old went off and, having hit the barriers and returned to the track, then took a second impact from the car of Juan Manuel Correa, who could do nothing to avoid it. Hubert was taken to the medical centre but died shortly afterwards. Correa had to receive extensive leg and spinal surgery and is beginning a lengthy recovery process. The accident was so severe that it shocked everyone, but there was also great sadness this year at the deaths of Niki Lauda and the FIA race director Charlie Whiting. In each case the racing community came together in grief and sympathy and to pay tribute, displaying the very best of the sport at some of its lowest ebbs.</p> <h2>Worst ever season for Williams</h2> <p>For Williams the final chequered flag can surely not have fallen soon enough on a season they will want to forget. Their car was unfinished for the opening days of the first test and when they finally put it on track it was way off the pace, lacked downforce and stability and the team became rooted to the back of the grid. With only one point, this is their worst season in a 42-year history that has returned nine constructor titles and seven drivers\u2019 championships. There was no pleasure to be had in seeing the team who epitomise the spirit of racing in F1 brought so low. Yet in the midst of all this Britain\u2019s George Russell, in his rookie season, managed to tame the recalcitrant beast with a series of performances that gave notice as to why he, too, has a such a promising career in front of him. </p>",

The polymath as entertainer? There are still plenty of public intellectuals, but they are not often funny and not so often on TV any more. What James and Miller shared was a habit of cultural irreverence that was only possible because of their love of culture. Both flourished in part because British TV at the time had more confidence in the wits of its viewers. Almost every obituary notices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/28/my-debt-to-clive-james-the-howlingly-funny-critic-who-made-tv-writing-sing\" title=\"\">James\u2019 delight</a> in moving back and forth between high and low culture. British TV, it should be said, gave him many opportunities to do so in the early 1970s, when he began writing his Observer columns.</p> <p>And what did the television schedule at the time, as reported by James, look like? An hour-long interview with Harold Pinter rubs elbows with a report on the lyrics of leading contenders in the Eurovision song contest. A Ken Russell film about Wordsworth and Coleridge is found more absurd and less entertaining than an episode of the current affairs programme Nationwide featuring child impersonators. Of course, it took James to find out the incongruities. Analysis of the latest episode of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/01/dallas-old-v-new\" title=\"\">Dallas</a> (of whose delicious absurdities he was a connoisseur) would be illustrated by an epigraph from Nietzsche. James\u2019s prose had a kind of deadpan poetry in which you heard his voice. I still recall his description of a piece of footage that I had actually seen a few days earlier: ski jumping from Kitzb\u00fchel, where a competitor lost one ski in mid-air. James imagined the jumper (otherwise immaculate) having to decide whether to land on the foot with the ski or the foot without. \u201cHe chose the leg without \u2013 a huge error.\u201d</p> <p>Both men were proof against charlatanism by openly suspecting themselves of such. Miller was comically self-conscious about his own contradictions. (Thus, the perfect title of Kate Bassett\u2019s excellent biography of him: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/12/in-two-minds-jonathan-miller-review\" title=\"\">In Two Minds</a>.) Not the least of these was his attitude to the medium that made him familiar to millions: television. He sometimes seemed to think that TV numbed the mind, yet he ended up becoming a vivid TV personality. In his own recent memoir, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/19/william-miller-how-i-failed-to-get-away-from-my-famous-father\" title=\"\">son William</a> recalls how his father refused to have a television in the house, until he fronted his own multi-part series The Body in Question. Watching Miller, in that series, convey lessons about medicine and health even as he sickeningly experienced increased gravity in a looping plane, or put on a face mask that gradually reduced his oxygen intake, you wondered whether the comic aspects were intentional or not.</p> <p>TV made them famous for their voices and their faces and their bodies: James, a genial retired <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/rules_and_equipment/4215912.stm\" title=\"\">prop forward</a>; Miller, a performance artist of long, tangled limbs. It is extraordinary to think that James once fronted a primetime ITV show that traded on his sardonic wit. Miller, in contrast, was a BBC man: in the index to Bassett\u2019s biography, the single longest entry is \u201cBBC\u201d, while ITV has no entry at all. Miller was confident that TV could give us Shakespeare or a multi-part inquiry into the nature of language or an engaging history of atheism. James, the natural TV aficionado, ended up seeming more doubtful. His 1995 address to the Royal Television Society was entitled Bring Back the Overqualified. You get the drift. He once thought that TV could be entertaining while \u201cdelivering enlightenment to the public\u201d, but by then had started thinking that it did not want to do this any more.</p> <p>None of the undergraduates whom I asked last week had heard of either man \u2013 but that is hardly surprising. Clive James and Jonathan Miller may have shared an educated reverence for the art, music and literature that could outlive its times, but both men lived for the fizz of their own cultural moment. Miller\u2019s productions of plays and operas live on in the memories of those who saw them (and, evidently, in the memories of those who performed in them). You can read James\u2019s collections of TV reviews today, but if you read them first in the newspaper then they have done their work. If the two men belonged to a lost age of \u201cthe overqualified\u201d, it was because both knew enough to think that they were hardly qualified at all.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London</p>",

Analysis of the latest episode of Dallas (of whose delicious absurdities he was a connoisseur) would be illustrated by an epigraph from Nietzsche. James\u2019s prose had a kind of deadpan poetry in which you heard his voice. I still recall his description of a piece of footage that I had actually seen a few days earlier: ski jumping from Kitzb\u00fchel, where a competitor lost one ski in mid-air. James imagined the jumper (otherwise immaculate) having to decide whether to land on the foot with the ski or the foot without. \u201cHe chose the leg without \u2013 a huge error.\u201d Both men were proof against charlatanism by openly suspecting themselves of such. Miller was comically self-conscious about his own contradictions. (Thus, the perfect title of Kate Bassett\u2019s excellent biography of him: In Two Minds.) Not the least of these was his attitude to the medium that made him familiar to millions: television. He sometimes seemed to think that TV numbed the mind, yet he ended up becoming a vivid TV personality. In his own recent memoir, his son William recalls how his father refused to have a television in the house, until he fronted his own multi-part series The Body in Question. Watching Miller, in that series, convey lessons about medicine and health even as he sickeningly experienced increased gravity in a looping plane, or put on a face mask that gradually reduced his oxygen intake, you wondered whether the comic aspects were intentional or not. TV made them famous for their voices and their faces and their bodies: James, a genial retired prop forward; Miller, a performance artist of long, tangled limbs. It is extraordinary to think that James once fronted a primetime ITV show that traded on his sardonic wit. Miller, in contrast, was a BBC man: in the index to Bassett\u2019s biography, the single longest entry is \u201cBBC\u201d, while ITV has no entry at all. Miller was confident that TV could give us Shakespeare or a multi-part inquiry into the nature of language or an engaging history of atheism. James, the natural TV aficionado, ended up seeming more doubtful. His 1995 address to the Royal Television Society was entitled Bring Back the Overqualified. You get the drift. He once thought that TV could be entertaining while \u201cdelivering enlightenment to the public\u201d, but by then had started thinking that it did not want to do this any more. None of the undergraduates whom I asked last week had heard of either man \u2013 but that is hardly surprising. Clive James and Jonathan Miller may have shared an educated reverence for the art, music and literature that could outlive its times, but both men lived for the fizz of their own cultural moment. Miller\u2019s productions of plays and operas live on in the memories of those who saw them (and, evidently, in the memories of those who performed in them). You can read James\u2019s collections of TV reviews today, but if you read them first in the newspaper then they have done their work. If the two men belonged to a lost age of \u201cthe overqualified\u201d, it was because both knew enough to think that they were hardly qualified at all. \u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London",

      "body": "<p>In 1978, Steven Spielberg was aghast to find that footage from his debut film, Duel, had been reused in an episode of the television series The Incredible Hulk. The experience led him to insist on a contractual clause preventing other film-makers from cannibalising his work. \u201cI\u2019d hate to see the mothership from Close Encounters end up on Laverne &amp; Shirley five years from now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But it appears he has given his blessing for one of his most beloved characters to sell cable, internet and phone services. A new, four-minute advertisement for Comcast Xfinity brings ET, the main character of Spielberg\u2019s 1982 masterpiece ET: The Extra-Terrestrial, back to Earth for a reunion with Elliot, his friend and protector from that movie. The original actor, Henry Thomas, has returned to play Elliot, and to give his stamp of approval to the project.</p> <p>\u201cThe audience is going to get everything they want out of a sequel without the messy bits that could destroy the beauty of the original and the special place it has in people\u2019s minds and hearts,\u201d Thomas says, displaying a touching eagerness to come out with any old guff so long as the cheque from Comcast has cleared. Imbecilic PR statements aside, Thomas looks in pretty good shape for 48. Whether ET has aged is harder to say since he was as wrinkled as a wizened crone to begin with.</p> <p>At the start of the advertisement (no, we\u2019re not calling it a sequel), the alien\u2019s ship lands in the back garden of the house where Elliot now lives. In a 1996 short story, the critic David Thomson imagined that the boy, bereft by the departure of his intergalactic BFF, would go on to a life of aimless alienation full of drugs and weightlifting. The Comcast version is rather different. Elliot has a wife and two children, and is apparently unscarred by having ridden through the night sky on a flying bicycle at the age of 11 to escape the clutches of sinister government forces.</p> <p>The commercial amounts to a greatest hits parade of rehashed moments from the film. Elliot\u2019s children scream when they find ET, and the alien screams along with them. There is a glimpse of Reese\u2019s Pieces, the confectionery brand that made a killing when M&amp;Ms turned down the chance to be featured in the movie.</p> <p>ETis also seen reviving a bunch of wilted flowers with one wave of his leathery hand. \u201cYou came back!\u201d exclaims Elliot, although he doesn\u2019t ask why because the answer would probably produce from ET an uncomfortable response such as: \u201cI had no choice. Comcast, which owns Universal, the studio which produced and distributed the original film that made me famous, has full dominion over the exploitation of my IP rights.\u201d</p> <p>Dishing up a dinner of salad and cupcakes, Elliot remarks that \u201ca lot has changed since you were here\u201d but as there simply isn\u2019t time to sit down to explain Iran-Contra, the first Gulf War, 9/11, the second Gulf War, #MeToo and fidget spinners, his son brandishes a tablet and instead says simply: \u201cIt\u2019s called the internet.\u201d The child then makes a gesture intended to suggest that his mind is blown, but which seems more like he has just shot himself in the head. Either interpretation would be fitting under the circumstances.</p> <p>ET puts on a set of virtual-reality goggles and falls over at the sight of a dinosaur lurching towards him. Don\u2019t they have anything as sophisticated as VR in his part of the galaxy? Then they all cuddle up in front of the TV for Christmas movies. The plaintive look on ET\u2019s face as he gazes at Elliot could mean \u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u201d or he may just be thinking: \u201cI didn\u2019t fly halfway across the universe to watch Bing sodding Crosby.\u201d</p> <p>Either way, he\u2019s off a few seconds later, commandeering a pair of bicycles to whisk him and the children through the sky to \u2026 where exactly? Wasn\u2019t his spaceship parked in the back garden? Ah well, no time for logic when there is internet and cable to be sold. John Williams\u2019s triumphant score fills our ears and then it\u2019s time to say goodbye.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d says ET to Elliot\u2019s son, touching his chest. Yeah, about that. Not sure that the current US immigration policy is going to look too kindly on the free movement of aliens. That\u2019s not really where the world is at right now.</p> <p>Still, at least the 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special \u2013 of which George Lucas tried to remove all traces before being thwarted by the rise of YouTube \u2013 now has a rival for the title of Worst Ever Festive Spin-Off of a Hit Movie. Some have described the ET commercial as \u201cheartwarming\u201d, and I suppose it is, in the sense that a bonfire of your fondest dreams, memories and possessions can still generate a certain amount of heat.</p>",

A new, four-minute advertisement for Comcast Xfinity brings ET, the main character of Spielberg\u2019s 1982 masterpiece ET: The Extra-Terrestrial, back to Earth for a reunion with Elliot, his friend and protector from that movie. The original actor, Henry Thomas, has returned to play Elliot, and to give his stamp of approval to the project. \u201cThe audience is going to get everything they want out of a sequel without the messy bits that could destroy the beauty of the original and the special place it has in people\u2019s minds and hearts,\u201d Thomas says, displaying a touching eagerness to come out with any old guff so long as the cheque from Comcast has cleared. Imbecilic PR statements aside, Thomas looks in pretty good shape for 48. Whether ET has aged is harder to say since he was as wrinkled as a wizened crone to begin with. At the start of the advertisement (no, we\u2019re not calling it a sequel), the alien\u2019s ship lands in the back garden of the house where Elliot now lives. In a 1996 short story, the critic David Thomson imagined that the boy, bereft by the departure of his intergalactic BFF, would go on to a life of aimless alienation full of drugs and weightlifting. The Comcast version is rather different. Elliot has a wife and two children, and is apparently unscarred by having ridden through the night sky on a flying bicycle at the age of 11 to escape the clutches of sinister government forces. The commercial amounts to a greatest hits parade of rehashed moments from the film. Elliot\u2019s children scream when they find ET, and the alien screams along with them. There is a glimpse of Reese\u2019s Pieces, the confectionery brand that made a killing when M&amp;Ms turned down the chance to be featured in the movie. ETis also seen reviving a bunch of wilted flowers with one wave of his leathery hand. \u201cYou came back!\u201d exclaims Elliot, although he doesn\u2019t ask why because the answer would probably produce from ET an uncomfortable response such as: \u201cI had no choice. Comcast, which owns Universal, the studio which produced and distributed the original film that made me famous, has full dominion over the exploitation of my IP rights.\u201d Dishing up a dinner of salad and cupcakes, Elliot remarks that \u201ca lot has changed since you were here\u201d but as there simply isn\u2019t time to sit down to explain Iran-Contra, the first Gulf War, 9/11, the second Gulf War, #MeToo and fidget spinners, his son brandishes a tablet and instead says simply: \u201cIt\u2019s called the internet.\u201d The child then makes a gesture intended to suggest that his mind is blown, but which seems more like he has just shot himself in the head. Either interpretation would be fitting under the circumstances. ET puts on a set of virtual-reality goggles and falls over at the sight of a dinosaur lurching towards him. Don\u2019t they have anything as sophisticated as VR in his part of the galaxy? Then they all cuddle up in front of the TV for Christmas movies. The plaintive look on ET\u2019s face as he gazes at Elliot could mean \u201cI\u2019ve missed you\u201d or he may just be thinking: \u201cI didn\u2019t fly halfway across the universe to watch Bing sodding Crosby.\u201d Either way, he\u2019s off a few seconds later, commandeering a pair of bicycles to whisk him and the children through the sky to \u2026 where exactly? Wasn\u2019t his spaceship parked in the back garden? Ah well, no time for logic when there is internet and cable to be sold. John Williams\u2019s triumphant score fills our ears and then it\u2019s time to say goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d says ET to Elliot\u2019s son, touching his chest. Yeah, about that. Not sure that the current US immigration policy is going to look too kindly on the free movement of aliens. That\u2019s not really where the world is at right now. Still, at least the 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special \u2013 of which George Lucas tried to remove all traces before being thwarted by the rise of YouTube \u2013 now has a rival for the title of Worst Ever Festive Spin-Off of a Hit Movie. Some have described the ET commercial as \u201cheartwarming\u201d, and I suppose it is, in the sense that a bonfire of your fondest dreams, memories and possessions can still generate a certain amount of heat.",

      "body": "<p>It has been a good year for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/giggs\">Giggs</a>. The industrious rapper from Peckham \u2013 AKA Nathaniel Thompson \u2013 kicked off 2019 by releasing his fifth album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/22/giggs-big-bad-review-british-rap\">Big Bad</a>, a sprawling 18-track field study of urban life and strife delivered in his distinctive, unhurried and often seismic baritone. Featuring guest spots from local fixtures (Labrinth, Wretch 32) and US imports (Lil Yachty, Swizz Beatz), it confirmed the 36-year-old\u2019s status as UK rap\u2019s self-assured kingpin.</p> <p>In April, Giggs joined his admiring collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/drake\">Drake</a> on stage at one of the latter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/13/drake-live-02-london-review\">O2 extravaganzas</a>; this current tour will conclude with his own headline show at Wembley Arena. On a subzero night in Glasgow, it is a relatively stripped-back experience: just Giggs prowling back and forth in a black T-shirt, trackie bottoms and an eye-catching gold medallion that would not look out of place in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Despite the venue\u2019s toweringly high roof, the packed room thrums with the energy of a basement club night.</p> <p>An early highlight is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jrLk3R9rk2I\">Terminator</a>, a martial advance of regal fanfares and dense drum fills, featuring doomy warnings to would-be rivals looking to move up the food chain. It sets a rolling, relentless tone as Giggs daisy-chains tracks together, with only the occasional pit stop to address the crowd and sip what looks like a pint of Guinness. \u201cThis is the exercise segment!\u201d he shouts cheerily as the beats crank up.</p> <p>Grime MC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jme\">JME</a> makes an unexpected guest appearance for the strident 2015 track Man Don\u2019t Care, perhaps the prickliest song ever to mention digestive biscuits.

      "bodyText": "It has been a good year for Giggs. The industrious rapper from Peckham \u2013 AKA Nathaniel Thompson \u2013 kicked off 2019 by releasing his fifth album, Big Bad, a sprawling 18-track field study of urban life and strife delivered in his distinctive, unhurried and often seismic baritone. Featuring guest spots from local fixtures (Labrinth, Wretch 32) and US imports (Lil Yachty, Swizz Beatz), it confirmed the 36-year-old\u2019s status as UK rap\u2019s self-assured kingpin. In April, Giggs joined his admiring collaborator Drake on stage at one of the latter\u2019s O2 extravaganzas; this current tour will conclude with his own headline show at Wembley Arena. On a subzero night in Glasgow, it is a relatively stripped-back experience: just Giggs prowling back and forth in a black T-shirt, trackie bottoms and an eye-catching gold medallion that would not look out of place in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Despite the venue\u2019s toweringly high roof, the packed room thrums with the energy of a basement club night. An early highlight is Terminator, a martial advance of regal fanfares and dense drum fills, featuring doomy warnings to would-be rivals looking to move up the food chain. It sets a rolling, relentless tone as Giggs daisy-chains tracks together, with only the occasional pit stop to address the crowd and sip what looks like a pint of Guinness. \u201cThis is the exercise segment!\u201d he shouts cheerily as the beats crank up. Grime MC JME makes an unexpected guest appearance for the strident 2015 track Man Don\u2019t Care, perhaps the prickliest song ever to mention digestive biscuits. On newer track Baby, Giggs is more playful, test-driving chat-up lines over an addictive bass hook. There is a noticeable audience leap at the opening bars of KMT, his collaboration with Drake \u2013 while the crowd loyally echo that hit\u2019s sporadic \u201cOK, OK\u201d refrain, they are also word-perfect on Lock Doh, Giggs\u2019s sonically sparse but lyrically saucy ode to abundant romance. It is the stealthy standout in a crammed, rambunctious hour, and its theme of being in-demand suits him well. \u2022 At O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, on 3 December. Then touring until 6 December.",

In the immortal words of Senator Arthur Vandenberg: \u201cPolitics stops at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d</p> <p>The concept of \u201cforeign policy\u201d emerged in 18th-century England as a strategy to insulate the Crown\u2019s authority abroad from parliamentary pressure at home. \u201cWe ought not to pry into such secrets as relate to foreign affairs,\u201d implored Sir William Yonge of his fellow Members of Parliament in 1743. \u201cAs our business relates chiefly to domestick affairs, we ought to keep within that province.\u201d But in the US, foreign policy \u2013 and its notion of a national interest protected by the executive \u2013 became a cherished ideal behind which the founders promised to lead their city on the hill.</p> <p>Trump has laid waste to this worldview. From welcoming Russian electoral interference in the US to seeking dirt on rivals in relations with China and Ukraine, Trump has eschewed the traditional rules of foreign policy to practice a novel form of <em>foreign politics</em>: a framework of international affairs with little regard for Vandenberg\u2019s cardinal rule.</p> <p>To the horror of the Beltway establishment, he leaves half the state department empty and elevates transactional horse-trading above institutional protocol. Rather than relying on career diplomats and respecting old alliances, he takes to Twitter and courts useful dictators. Rather than pretending to represent the national interest, he openly advocates for a narrow swath of supporters and cronies.</p> <p>This is a paradigm shift long in formation. Over the course of the last two centuries, the Westphalian system that inspired the founding architects of US foreign policy \u2013 a world of sovereign nation-states communicating through their respective executives \u2013 has broken down, displaced by a new set of transnational networks often dominated by non-state actors: Facebooks and Googles, Blackrocks and Deutsche Banks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump has eschewed the traditional rules of foreign policy to practice a novel form of foreign politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this new global context, the boundaries between foreign and domestic have blurred. China, for example, owns more US debt, trades more with the US, and emits more greenhouse gases than any other country. Unlike with past adversaries, the interests of countless American businesses cannot be disentangled from Chinese economic success.</p> <p>The notion of a single \u201cnational interest\u201d, for its part, has degraded to mere farce. After five decades of stagnant wages and inflamed wealth inequality, few believe that the boats still rise together. When the US government protects the intellectual property of its pharmaceutical companies \u2013 raising prices for American patients while guaranteeing offshore profits \u2013 whose interest does it really serve?</p> <p>Trump\u2019s election was a symptom of a foreign policy paradigm in terminal decline; his <em>foreign politics</em> a dark premonition of what might replace it. Not only were his supporters reacting to a general sense that they had lost control over their national borders in the process of rapid international integration; they were also reacting to a more acute sense that the US government and its army of diplomats merely channeled the interests of a transnational economic elite. Trump promised to attack that elite, and \u2013 through his diplomacy-by-Twitter \u2013 cut out the middlemen unworthy of trust.</p> <p>Trump is, of course, not alone. From Benjamin Netanyahu to Vladimir Putin, rightwing leaders are practicing foreign politics to advance their personal interests, linking up in a network of like-minded authoritarians who have little respect for the cherished norms of the liberal international order.</p> <p>Where does that leave the Democratic party and its presidential contenders?</p> <p>Broadly divided into three camps: the Restorers, the Restrainers and the Transformers. Each takes a different view of foreign policy, though none faces up to the paradigm shift at hand.</p> <p>Restorers like Joe Biden view Donald Trump as the great aberration who pushed US foreign policy off its stable path; their policies aim, therefore, to reset the clock: rejoin the Paris accords, re-sign the Iran deal. This is a platform of nostalgic denial: Restorers neither appreciate the fragility of Obama\u2019s foreign policy victories, nor recognize his many failings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The rules of the global game have changed for good. Trump and his allies see it clearly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Restrainers, by contrast, reckon with the failings of foreign policy past \u2013 in particular, a string of broken promises with respect to America\u2019s armed intervention abroad. Their core commitment is to \u201cend the endless war\u201d, drastically downsizing the US military and demanding greater oversight of its operations. In other words, their aim is not necessarily to replace the old foreign policy toolkit wholesale, but to catch the arm of the US government as it reaches for its most lethal tool.</p> <p>In this sense, the Restrainers ultimately defend the foreign policy paradigm, appealing to the more noble traditions of American diplomacy. But by calling for a more \u201cresponsible\u201d form of statecraft, the Restrainers betray their own nostalgia for the calm waters of the liberal international order. The principle of restraint is certainly an important virtue in international affairs.

      "bodyText": "There are few phrases as fundamental to US politics as foreign policy. It shapes the balance of power between branches of government. It separates a special class of public servants. And it commands sober respect from both sides of the partisan aisle. Indeed, in American politics, \u201cforeign policy\u201d is a phrase used so unthinkingly that it may be strange to point out what it really is: a paradigm first developed to protect the English monarchy, imported across the Atlantic by our nation\u2019s founders, stretched to breaking point by over two centuries of geopolitical change, and broken \u2013 at last \u2013 by the presidency of Donald Trump. According to the old paradigm of foreign policy, there is a clear line between domestic and foreign: inside our borders, we may fight about taxes, transfers and fundamental rights; but once we venture outside those borders, it is our \u201cnational interest\u201d against the world. In the immortal words of Senator Arthur Vandenberg: \u201cPolitics stops at the water\u2019s edge.\u201d The concept of \u201cforeign policy\u201d emerged in 18th-century England as a strategy to insulate the Crown\u2019s authority abroad from parliamentary pressure at home. \u201cWe ought not to pry into such secrets as relate to foreign affairs,\u201d implored Sir William Yonge of his fellow Members of Parliament in 1743. \u201cAs our business relates chiefly to domestick affairs, we ought to keep within that province.\u201d But in the US, foreign policy \u2013 and its notion of a national interest protected by the executive \u2013 became a cherished ideal behind which the founders promised to lead their city on the hill. Trump has laid waste to this worldview. From welcoming Russian electoral interference in the US to seeking dirt on rivals in relations with China and Ukraine, Trump has eschewed the traditional rules of foreign policy to practice a novel form of foreign politics: a framework of international affairs with little regard for Vandenberg\u2019s cardinal rule. To the horror of the Beltway establishment, he leaves half the state department empty and elevates transactional horse-trading above institutional protocol. Rather than relying on career diplomats and respecting old alliances, he takes to Twitter and courts useful dictators. Rather than pretending to represent the national interest, he openly advocates for a narrow swath of supporters and cronies. This is a paradigm shift long in formation. Over the course of the last two centuries, the Westphalian system that inspired the founding architects of US foreign policy \u2013 a world of sovereign nation-states communicating through their respective executives \u2013 has broken down, displaced by a new set of transnational networks often dominated by non-state actors: Facebooks and Googles, Blackrocks and Deutsche Banks. In this new global context, the boundaries between foreign and domestic have blurred. China, for example, owns more US debt, trades more with the US, and emits more greenhouse gases than any other country. Unlike with past adversaries, the interests of countless American businesses cannot be disentangled from Chinese economic success. The notion of a single \u201cnational interest\u201d, for its part, has degraded to mere farce. After five decades of stagnant wages and inflamed wealth inequality, few believe that the boats still rise together. When the US government protects the intellectual property of its pharmaceutical companies \u2013 raising prices for American patients while guaranteeing offshore profits \u2013 whose interest does it really serve? Trump\u2019s election was a symptom of a foreign policy paradigm in terminal decline; his foreign politics a dark premonition of what might replace it. Not only were his supporters reacting to a general sense that they had lost control over their national borders in the process of rapid international integration; they were also reacting to a more acute sense that the US government and its army of diplomats merely channeled the interests of a transnational economic elite. Trump promised to attack that elite, and \u2013 through his diplomacy-by-Twitter \u2013 cut out the middlemen unworthy of trust. Trump is, of course, not alone. From Benjamin Netanyahu to Vladimir Putin, rightwing leaders are practicing foreign politics to advance their personal interests, linking up in a network of like-minded authoritarians who have little respect for the cherished norms of the liberal international order. Where does that leave the Democratic party and its presidential contenders? Broadly divided into three camps: the Restorers, the Restrainers and the Transformers. Each takes a different view of foreign policy, though none faces up to the paradigm shift at hand. Restorers like Joe Biden view Donald Trump as the great aberration who pushed US foreign policy off its stable path; their policies aim, therefore, to reset the clock: rejoin the Paris accords, re-sign the Iran deal. This is a platform of nostalgic denial: Restorers neither appreciate the fragility of Obama\u2019s foreign policy victories, nor recognize his many failings. Restrainers, by contrast, reckon with the failings of foreign policy past \u2013 in particular, a string of broken promises with respect to America\u2019s armed intervention abroad. Their core commitment is to \u201cend the endless war\u201d, drastically downsizing the US military and demanding greater oversight of its operations. In other words, their aim is not necessarily to replace the old foreign policy toolkit wholesale, but to catch the arm of the US government as it reaches for its most lethal tool. In this sense, the Restrainers ultimately defend the foreign policy paradigm, appealing to the more noble traditions of American diplomacy. But by calling for a more \u201cresponsible\u201d form of statecraft, the Restrainers betray their own nostalgia for the calm waters of the liberal international order. The principle of restraint is certainly an important virtue in international affairs. But it is a brittle one: it implies that the US is holding back from serving its true interests, and is therefore vulnerable to strongmen who vow to break taboos and serve them better. This is where the Transformers should come in. Represented in the presidential race by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Transformers recognize the profound shift in international affairs and the range of new methods that will be necessary as a result. Sanders speaks, for example, of the need for an \u201cinternational progressive front\u201d that supports \u201cpartnerships not just between governments, but between peoples\u201d. Elizabeth Warren describes a similar seismic shift in our foreign affairs. \u201cThe world was changing before President Trump took office, and it will continue to change after he has gone,\u201d Elizabeth Warren wrote in her pitch for a \u201cForeign Policy for All\u201d. But the Transformers, too, have offered little to move us beyond the old paradigm. Sanders provides few concrete plans to build a progressive front or international institutions to facilitate people-to-people partnerships. And Warren\u2019s vision remains faithful to its core myth of a unified national interest. Her \u201cforeign policy for all\u201d is a contradiction in terms: protecting some American interests on the global stage will require undermining others. Here, we can start to see the outline a different kind of a foreign politics: a progressive foreign politics, which begins from the same premise as Trump \u2013 that politics no longer stops at the water\u2019s edge \u2013 but inverts its strategies, policies and priorities. One that builds new multilateral institutions, rather than wrecking them; one that powers democratic movements, rather than squashing them; one that is unafraid to champion the shared interests of a global 99% against those of a consolidated transnational oligarchy. The rules of the global game have changed for good. Trump and his allies see it clearly. Democrats must now step up and confront their new reality. Politics no longer end at the water\u2019s edge. But from watching these debates, Democrats seem like the last to know. David Adler is a policy leader fellow at the School of Transnational Governance at the European University Institute.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. UN chief praises youth \u2018leadership\u2019 over climate emergency As delegates from across the globe descend on Madrid for the start of the two-week COP25 climate summit, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has contrasted the inaction of the world\u2019s governments with the \u201cleadership\u201d shown by young people on climate. The annual summit is smaller than expected, after plans to hold the event in Santiago were scrapped amid Chile\u2019s political unrest. The Alliance of Small Island States, whose members face inundation by rising sea levels, issued a plea ahead of the summit, urging developed countries to take their plight seriously. \u2018World War Zero\u2019. Former Democrat secretary of state John Kerry has launched a bipartisan coalition of high-profile power-brokers hoping to address the climate crisis. Fossil fuels. Fossil fuel lobbyists are trying to water down planned EU rules designed to prevent so-called \u201cinvestment greenwashing\u201d. Meanwhile US insurers have joined their European counterparts in withdrawing cover for coal projects. Amazon accused of \u201caggressively avoiding\u201d tax worldwide Amazon and the five other major US tech firms have been accused collectively of \u201caggressively avoiding\u201d $100bn in global tax over the past decade. The online retail giant is named as the worst offender of a group that also includes Facebook, Google, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft, in a new report by the tax transparency campaign group Fair Tax Mark. The report found the firms moving revenue and profits through tax havens or low-tax countries to avoid tax, and delaying the payment of those taxes they do incur. World\u2019s richest. Amazon, whose founder Jeff Bezos is currently the world\u2019s richest person, paid just $3.4bn in tax over a decade during which it recorded revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn, according to the report. Trump and lawyers refuse to attend impeachment hearing Donald Trump and his lawyers have refused to take part in the house judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearings this week, after complaining about a lack of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d to the proceedings. The White House had been given until Sunday evening to say whether the president would send a legal representative to take part in the panel\u2019s consideration of possible articles of impeachment, which would see him charged with misconduct over his dealings with Ukraine. \u2018Unfair process\u2019. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to committee chairman Jerry Nadler, saying Trump could not be \u201cexpected to participate \u2026 while it remains unclear whether the judiciary committee will afford the president a fair process\u201d. Rudy Giuliani. Despite his protestations to the contrary, the man once known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d appears to face ever-increasing legal jeopardy over his involvement in the Ukraine scandal, as Tom McCarthy reports. Johnson accused of politicising London attack as election issue Boris Johnson has been accused of twisting the facts of Friday\u2019s London Bridge terror attack for electoral purposes, against the express wishes of the family of Jack Merritt, one of the victims. The UK prime minister blamed the Labour opposition for the release from prison last year of the suspect, Usman Khan. As the UK intelligence service MI5 began an inquiry into the attack, investigators said they believed Khan, 28, had acted alone and may have acquired the materials for his attack as little as 24 hours beforehand. Former associate. A former jihadist jailed with Khan over their 2010 plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange \u2013 and who, like Khan, had been released on licence \u2013 was arrested on Saturday over a suspected breach of his licence conditions. Ex-offenders. Two former offenders, included a convicted murderer, were among the members of the public who intervened to thwart Khan\u2019s attack. Cheat sheet Four police officers and 17 cartel gunmen have been shot dead over the weekend in Villa Uni\u00f3n, a town in Mexico\u2019s Coahuila state, fuelling a debate over Donald Trump\u2019s recent designation of Mexico\u2019s drug cartels as terrorist organisations. The prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, has resigned amid the escalating political crisis sparked by the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. The BBC is set to broadcast a potentially explosive interview with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew. The artist Tal R is waiting for a Danish court to decide whether a pair of art world provocateurs who recently purchased one of his paintings will be allowed to cut up the canvas to use as decorative faces for a line of limited edition luxury watches. Must-reads Liam Payne on life after One Direction Liam Payne was once known as the most vanilla member of the world\u2019s biggest boyband. But behind the scenes, he says, \u201cI was slowly losing the plot.\u201d Elle Hunt hears about his battles with alcohol and the pressures of young fatherhood. Big brother is watching in Chongqing China has just introduced a rule requiring all mobile phone users to submit to a facial recognition scan. But that sort of privacy invasion is nothing new to residents of Chongqing, the world\u2019s most heavily surveilled city, which has one CCTV camera for every six of its residents. Matthew Keegan reports. How Biden helped create the student loan problem On the presidential campaign trail, Joe Biden has repeatedly promised to fix the student loan crisis, which has saddled 45 million Americans with crippling debt that now totals a staggering $1.5tn. What Biden doesn\u2019t mention, writes Ed Pilkington, is his own role in creating that crisis. Kim steps out of his grandfather\u2019s sartorial shadow In the early years of his leadership, Kim Jong-Un dressed as if in homage to his popular grandfather and North Korea\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung. But in recent months he appears to have expanded his wardrobe and embraced a more ecletic personal style, says Justin McCurry. Opinion Donald Trump\u2019s presidency coincides with a growing public distrust in the commercially driven media. But with the facts under siege, says Robert Reich, now is the time to invest in journalism that exists solely to serve the public. Trump\u2019s lies and ongoing attacks on his critics in the media score points with his base but at the expense of a weakened democracy. If a large enough portion of the public comes to trust Trump\u2019s own words more than the media\u2019s, Trump can get away with saying \u2013 and doing \u2013 whatever he wants. When that happens, democracy ends.

      "body": "<p>For Ingrid, a 15-year-old in La Crosse, Wisconsin, going to high school means being monitored on surveillance cameras in her hallways and classrooms. Students are required to carry their school supplies in clear backpacks, as ordinary backpacks might be used to conceal a weapon, she said. Water bottles must also be clear, so school officials can see the color of the liquid inside. The monitoring continues on the laptops students use in school. Teenagers are warned that the school is tracking what they do, and that they can get in trouble for visiting inappropriate websites.</p> <p>This level of surveillance is \u201cnot too over-the-top\u201d, Ingrid said, and she feels her classmates are generally \u201caccepting\u201d of it.</p> <p>When it comes to digital surveillance of what they do on school laptops, \u201cI feel like everyone\u2019s adjusted. I don\u2019t think anyone really cares at this point,\u201d Ingrid said. \u201cThe subject doesn\u2019t really come up until someone\u2019s gotten in trouble for something. Usually it\u2019s just like, \u2018Oh, that person is stupid, looking at what they were doing on a school device. They should have known better.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>If the school were monitoring anything on her personal cellphone, that would be a privacy violation, Ingrid said. But on her school-issued laptop? \u201cI have no problem with it, because it\u2019s a school device, you know?\u201d</p> <p>For decades, American school shootings have driven a booming school security industry. Last year\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead, has helped expand the market for products that allow schools to monitor what students are doing on their computers for signs of violence or self-harm. Tech companies are now offering a range of products that help schools track the websites kids are visiting and the searches they are making; that monitor everything students are writing in school emails, chats and shared documents; or that even attempt to track what students are posting on their public social media accounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d82fdc91e302852b9432caf44cd1f0bde76aee64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d82fdc91e302852b9432caf44cd1f0bde76aee64/42_18_5681_3409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US tech companies offer products that allow schools to monitor what students are doing on their computers for signs of violence or self-harm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US tech companies offer products that allow schools to monitor what students are doing on their computers for signs of violence or self-harm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Hero Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One leading student privacy expert estimated that as many as a third of America\u2019s roughly 15,000 school districts may already be using technology that monitors students\u2019 emails and documents for phrases that might flag suicidal thoughts, plans for a school shooting, or a range of other offenses.</p> <p>In interviews, students and parents across the United States said they were still grappling with how this new school surveillance works, whether it goes too far in violating student privacy, and what effect it might have on a generation of children.</p> <p>Dozens of parents, students and educators responded to a Guardian <a href=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/american_school_surveillance\">callout</a> asking for perspectives on public schools\u2019 adoption of new digital surveillance technology. The Guardian is quoting children by their first names only, and contacted each of the children\u2019s parents to confirm how they would be identified in print.</p> <p>Some parents said they were alarmed and frightened by schools\u2019 new monitoring technologies. Others said they were conflicted, seeing some benefits to schools watching over what kids are doing online, but uncertain if their schools were striking the right balance with privacy concerns.

But, \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, I think there should be some evidence out they\u2019re that you\u2019re making a good, informed decision about how you\u2019re going to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Certain groups of students could easily be targeted by the monitoring more intensely than others, she said.

The Parent Coalition for Student Privacy was founded in 2014, in the wake of parental outrage over the attempt to create a standardized national database that would track hundreds of data points about public school students, from their names and social security numbers to their attendance, academic performance, and disciplinary and behavior records, and share the data with education tech companies. The effort, which had been funded by the Gates Foundation, collapsed in 2014 after fierce opposition from parents and privacy activists.</p> <p>The coalition currently has about 4,000 people on its mailing list, and nearly 100 active core members, according to Leonie Haimson, one of the co-founders of the group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c7abee7fd8d4f926b10af1333cef4167220f6cad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7abee7fd8d4f926b10af1333cef4167220f6cad/0_30_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One leading student privacy expert estimated that as many as a third of America\u2019s roughly 15,000 school districts may already be using technology that monitors students\u2019 emails and documents.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One leading student privacy expert estimated that as many as a third of America\u2019s roughly 15,000 school districts may already be using technology that monitors students\u2019 emails and documents.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMore and more parents are organizing against the onslaught of ed tech and the loss of privacy that it entails.

      "bodyText": "For Ingrid, a 15-year-old in La Crosse, Wisconsin, going to high school means being monitored on surveillance cameras in her hallways and classrooms. Students are required to carry their school supplies in clear backpacks, as ordinary backpacks might be used to conceal a weapon, she said. Water bottles must also be clear, so school officials can see the color of the liquid inside. The monitoring continues on the laptops students use in school. Teenagers are warned that the school is tracking what they do, and that they can get in trouble for visiting inappropriate websites. This level of surveillance is \u201cnot too over-the-top\u201d, Ingrid said, and she feels her classmates are generally \u201caccepting\u201d of it. When it comes to digital surveillance of what they do on school laptops, \u201cI feel like everyone\u2019s adjusted. I don\u2019t think anyone really cares at this point,\u201d Ingrid said. \u201cThe subject doesn\u2019t really come up until someone\u2019s gotten in trouble for something. Usually it\u2019s just like, \u2018Oh, that person is stupid, looking at what they were doing on a school device. They should have known better.\u2019\u201d If the school were monitoring anything on her personal cellphone, that would be a privacy violation, Ingrid said. But on her school-issued laptop? \u201cI have no problem with it, because it\u2019s a school device, you know?\u201d For decades, American school shootings have driven a booming school security industry. Last year\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 people dead, has helped expand the market for products that allow schools to monitor what students are doing on their computers for signs of violence or self-harm. Tech companies are now offering a range of products that help schools track the websites kids are visiting and the searches they are making; that monitor everything students are writing in school emails, chats and shared documents; or that even attempt to track what students are posting on their public social media accounts. One leading student privacy expert estimated that as many as a third of America\u2019s roughly 15,000 school districts may already be using technology that monitors students\u2019 emails and documents for phrases that might flag suicidal thoughts, plans for a school shooting, or a range of other offenses. In interviews, students and parents across the United States said they were still grappling with how this new school surveillance works, whether it goes too far in violating student privacy, and what effect it might have on a generation of children. Dozens of parents, students and educators responded to a Guardian callout asking for perspectives on public schools\u2019 adoption of new digital surveillance technology. The Guardian is quoting children by their first names only, and contacted each of the children\u2019s parents to confirm how they would be identified in print. Some parents said they were alarmed and frightened by schools\u2019 new monitoring technologies. Others said they were conflicted, seeing some benefits to schools watching over what kids are doing online, but uncertain if their schools were striking the right balance with privacy concerns. Many said they were not even sure what kind of surveillance technology their schools might be using, and that the permission slips they had signed when their kids brought home school devices had told them almost nothing. Some believe students are already fully adjusted to the experience of intensive school surveillance. \u201cThey\u2019re resigned to it,\u201d said Jarrett Dapier, 40, a parent of a middle school student, and a young adult librarian in Skokie, Illinois. \u201cThey all know \u2013 at least the ones I\u2019ve talked to \u2013 that this is going on. It\u2019s sort of like: this is the cost of getting a school device. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty disturbing,\u201d he said. When Dapier talks with other teen librarians about the issue of school surveillance, \u201cwe\u2019re very alarmed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sort of trains the next generation that [surveillance] is normal, that it\u2019s not an issue. What is the next generation\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg going to think is normal? \u201cIt\u2019s the school as panopticon, and the sweeping searchlight beams into homes, now, and to me, that\u2019s just disastrous to intellectual risk-taking and creativity.\u201d Sara, a 16-year-old private school student from New York City, said that there should be limits to what schools can do in the name of protecting student safety. \u201cIf we\u2019re not in the digital age, and a student writes something in their diary about suicide or about drugs or about something that\u2019s harmful, even though the school is obviously keeping the student safe by reading it, it\u2019s too far into their privacy,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the school should be surveilling any of that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d to define the digital equivalent of a student\u2019s diary, Sara said. \u201cI guess, if you have an Instagram account and it\u2019s private, or even public, the school shouldn\u2019t be looking at your Instagram, or your social media,\u201d she said. By that measure, some American schools are already crossing the line. As of 2018, at least 60 American school districts had also spent more than $1m on separate monitoring technology to track what their students were saying on public social media accounts, an amount that spiked sharply in the wake of the 2018 Parkland school shooting, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive advocacy group that compiled and analyzed school contracts with a subset of surveillance companies. Farid Chaouki, an app developer from New Jersey, said his two daughters are constantly being signed up for new digital programs at their public school, including school Google accounts. There are virtual learning platforms, platforms for coordinating with teachers, platforms that specialize in teaching kids math. \u201cThey are all mandatory, and the accounts have been created before we\u2019ve even been consulted,\u201d he said. Parents are given almost no information about how their children\u2019s data is being used, or the business models of the companies involved. Any time his kids complete school work through a digital platform, they are generating huge amounts of very personal, and potentially very valuable, data. The platforms know what time his kids do their homework, and whether it\u2019s done early or at the last minute. They know what kinds of mistakes his kids make on math problems. When he talks to other parents about privacy and surveillance, they treat him like he\u2019s \u201cparanoid\u201d, Chaouki said. But as an app developer, he said, he is well aware of how much data digital platforms collect about their users, and how freely they offer to sell it to other companies. \u201cI believe anything my kids are doing will be used used against them later in life,\u201d he said. And it\u2019s not just situations where kids get in trouble that might haunt them later, he said. Will the data generated by the accounts his kids use at school be factored into decisions about whether they get a job later in life, or how much they have to pay for insurance? \u201cIt\u2019s not really a far future,\u201d he said. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Some students, like Ingrid, the 15-year-old from La Crosse, Wisconsin, said that the awareness of being monitored online had not forced her to make many changes in her life. Ingrid said she is careful to use her personal device when she wants to look up sensitive issues, since she knows \u201cteachers will let your parents know what you\u2019re doing on your school computer.\u201d Even on a personal device, she is wary of connecting to the school wifi, since she is not sure if that enables the school to track what she\u2019s looking at on her phone. Instead, she said, she uses her own data plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me being sensitive.\u201d But this did not seem like a major hurdle for her, since most of her classmates have their own personal devices. \u201cWith the technology becoming more and more invasive, I feel like it could get worse in the future,\u201d Ingrid said. Other students said that school surveillance had already had a chilling effect on them. Two years ago, when he was 10, Felix, a student at a public school in northern California, got in trouble for having files on his computer about school shootings and guns. His father, who said he raised Felix to be curious and opinionated, said he told school officials that he knew this was something his son had been researching. Now in middle school, Felix said he recently heard that another student in his school got in trouble for writing something negative about another student on a school account. It had not even been directed to that student. Still, the student got in trouble \u201con the charge of thinking about cyberbullying, I guess\u201d. Felix, now 12, said he is frustrated that the school \u201cdoesn\u2019t really [educate] students on what is OK and what is not OK. They don\u2019t make it clear when they are tracking you, or not, or what platforms they track you on. \u201cThey don\u2019t really give you a list of things not to do,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019re in trouble, they act like you knew.\u201d Felix said that he used to spend his free time at school researching issues that interested him on his school computer \u2013 topics like gun violence or pollution in the oceans.

(He asked that his last name and his son\u2019s school district not be published, to preserve his son\u2019s privacy.) The incident was resolved easily, he said, in part because Ben\u2019s family already had close relationships with the school administrators. While, as a tech and security specialist, Ben considers himself a privacy advocate, \u201cI am willing to put up with a few false positives from my kids\u2019 actions for whatever \u2018greater good\u2019 is decided upon, as long as there is a demonstrable difference made,\u201d he said. Although surveillance tech companies tout anecdotal evidence about hundreds of lives saved through flagging students\u2019 online searches or private emails about self-harm, there is still no independent evaluation of whether this kind of surveillance technology actually works to reduce violence and suicide. But Ben said he also saw benefits to embracing the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d of teaching his kids to conduct all of their \u201cprivate business\u201d on \u201cself-owned computers and networks\u201d, and leave \u201cschool-owned tech for school things\u201d. What needed to change, he said, was the level of transparency in the process, and the level of input that parents were given over what kind of monitoring schools were doing, and how it was carried out, so school boards or school IT departments were not making these decisions unilaterally. Vanessa Cumming, a parent in Broward county, Florida, said she wanted to see more proof that school surveillance was actually helping students in some way. \u201cThere\u2019s no validated evidence that there\u2019s tangible benefits that have been demonstrated from having this type of surveillance, and I can see all types of risk,\u201d Cumming said. \u201cI think it would be unrealistic to say I don\u2019t think it should be used at all,\u201d she said. But, \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, I think there should be some evidence out they\u2019re that you\u2019re making a good, informed decision about how you\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Certain groups of students could easily be targeted by the monitoring more intensely than others, she said. Would Muslim students face additional surveillance? What about black students? Her daughter, who is 11, loves hip-hop music. \u201cMaybe some of that language could be misconstrued, by the wrong ears or the wrong eyes, as potentially violent or threatening,\u201d she said. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Some parents have begun to organize around the issue of school data collection. The Parent Coalition for Student Privacy was founded in 2014, in the wake of parental outrage over the attempt to create a standardized national database that would track hundreds of data points about public school students, from their names and social security numbers to their attendance, academic performance, and disciplinary and behavior records, and share the data with education tech companies. The effort, which had been funded by the Gates Foundation, collapsed in 2014 after fierce opposition from parents and privacy activists. The coalition currently has about 4,000 people on its mailing list, and nearly 100 active core members, according to Leonie Haimson, one of the co-founders of the group. \u201cMore and more parents are organizing against the onslaught of ed tech and the loss of privacy that it entails. But at the same time, there\u2019s so much money and power and political influence behind these groups,\u201d Haimson said. Administrators who support using surveillance technology said it gives schools a powerful tool to intervene and help students who are struggling in different ways, and particularly students who are struggling with self-harm and thoughts of suicide. But some privacy experts \u2013 and students \u2013 said they are concerned that surveillance at school might actually be undermining students\u2019 wellbeing. \u201cI think it does have an effect on our brains that we\u2019re constantly being surveilled, and there\u2019s cameras where we are most of the day,\u201d said Sara, the 16-year-old private school student from New York City. And not just in school: \u201cA lot of kids have cameras in front of their house, on the subway, in stores.\u201d When students are not on school cameras or city cameras or store cameras, they\u2019re on their own phone cameras. \u201cAnxiety and depression is the highest that it\u2019s been,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think the constant screen surveillance has affected our anxiety levels and our levels of depression.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s over-guarding kids,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to let them make mistakes, you know? That\u2019s kind of how we learn.\u201d",

Votes from our critics were split across six different songs, but edging out in front was Not, a masterpiece of indie rock with a savage truth at its heart. In a world besieged by lies, we can no longer say what we are, only what we\u2019re not. This comes out as a wry, poetic laundry list from Adrianne Lenker: \u201cNot a ruse / Not heat / Not the fire lapping up the creek / Not food / That you eat.\u201d The matter-bending guitar solo has the ragged glory of Neil Young\u2019s finest. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong>11</strong></h2> <h2>Rosal\u00eda and J Balvin \u2013 Con Altura</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to remember any self-made star having such a swift and well-deserved rise to the top as Rosal\u00eda, who already commands outsized influence given her relatively brief career to date (see: Camila Cabello\u2019s second album). This year she released an embarrassment of brilliant one-off singles that show off her wide-ranging prowess, from uncompromising experimentation (A Pal\u00e9 and Aute Cuture) to nimble pop flexes such as Con Altura. It is completely addictive: the combined charisma of the Spanish star and J Balvin snaking around the blunt dembow stutter and a synth whirr that coos like a curious wood pigeon. <em>LS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0515fdc0368426946a3a11478422ccd816aadc97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0515fdc0368426946a3a11478422ccd816aadc97/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosal\u00eda and J Balvin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rise \u2026Rosal\u00eda and J Balvin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty Images for Coachella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>10</strong></h2> <h2>Georgia \u2013 About Work the Dancefloor</h2> <p>One of the year\u2019s warmest success stories: when Georgia released Started Out, the first single from her second album for indie Domino, at the end of 2018, it became a surprise Radio 1 hit. So did its follow-up, About Work the Dancefloor, prompting the label to push her album to 2020 to give the singles time to breathe. AWtD is a fine teaser for a record that is worth the wait, showing off Georgia\u2019s newfound focus on songcraft and the depth of her references as a producer (the satisfyingly meaningless title is her tribute to the robotic proclamations of Detroit techno forefathers Cybotron). Lacing the juddering pulse of adrenaline with her vulnerable vocal delivery, AWtD puts Georgia in the big, Robyn-shaped pop leagues. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong>9</strong></h2> <h2>Clairo \u2013 Bags</h2> <p>The hot, wretched sickness of young love is rendered so acutely here by 21-year-old US indie-pop star Clairo. There\u2019s a sullen black humour as she war-games the worst thing that could happen \u2013 her lover walking out with their bags \u2013 as a way to edge away from the erotic terror of the best thing happening. \u201cCan you see me using everything to hold back?\u201d she frets, holding nothing back.

He voices someone \u201cstruggling with anxiety\u201d, who is freaked out by a tutting checkout girl and thinks a busker is using Wonderwall to swear at them. Racist violence is close at hand. But jogging \u2013 represented here by a rolling beat reminiscent of, appropriately, Kate Bush\u2019s Running Up That Hill \u2013 keeps them going. The dogged, synth-laden climax is a triumphant affirmation of the human spirit through personal and social collapse. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong>7</strong></h2> <h2>Vampire Weekend \u2013 Harmony Hall</h2> <p>The east coast sibling to Lana Del Rey\u2019s The Greatest: how did we get here, with antisemitism resurgent and \u201cwicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified\u201d, Ezra Koenig asks? As with Del Rey\u2019s valedictory ballad, he avoids obvious musical darkness and shoots for a more striking contrast by invoking the vivid, happy sounds of various 20th-century utopias: the pattering hand percussion calls back to hippies sitting in circles during the age of Aquarius; its sweet guitar filigree is straight out of Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, the show that taught empathy to a generation of American kids. The rising piano chatter sits halfway between house music and Bruce Hornsby, and by the time the shaky beat kicks in, it\u2019s turned into the ecstasy-laced optimism of the Stone Roses. These eras rise and fall, Koenig suggests, offering his own song so it might be remembered as a gesture of hope and intellect during a particularly senseless one. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong>6</strong></h2> <h2>FKA twigs \u2013 Cellophane</h2> <p>You imagine FKA twigs was thinking of Blue-era Joni Mitchell when she named her comeback single. \u201cAt that period in my life, I had no personal defences,\u201d Mitchell said years later. \u201cI felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn\u2019t pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defences there either.\u201d Twigs\u2019s Cellophane comes from the same place, where honesty becomes confrontation. \u201cDidn\u2019t I do it for you?\u201d she asks an ex-lover, as glacial piano and a pocked beat suggest someone circling a precious museum exhibit and gesturing at its impressive facets: what kind of moron could disregard such beauty? But her contempt ebbs away, replaced by gasping desperation that reveals the damage done by their neglect. <em>LS</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d02bb7f8fdda5160ab94115107c0ccda3661c352\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d02bb7f8fdda5160ab94115107c0ccda3661c352/191_691_8368_5020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FKA twigs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confrontation \u2026 FKA twigs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5</strong></h2> <h2>Lizzo \u2013 Juice</h2> <p>It\u2019s a misconception that tumultuous political times produce better music, but relative prosperity is certainly responsible for its fair share of drivel. The close of the Obama era was defined by the trifecta of Daft Punk\u2019s Get Lucky, Pharrell\u2019s Happy and Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson\u2019s Uptown Funk, all mining retro good vibes that were addictive yet asinine. Juice is cut from the same cloth, with a warped VHS vibe that only adds to the throwback air. Yet whereas her predecessors served up toothless victory-lap optimism, Lizzo\u2019s calling card single runs on defiance: she\u2019s not looking to the mirror on the wall to affirm her excellence, but proclaiming it with a riot of radical food gags. She\u2019s \u201cthe pudding in the proof\u201d, \u201cdrippin\u2019 so much sauce got a bitch looking like ragu\u201d. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong>4</strong></h2> <h2>Billie Eilish \u2013 Bad Guy</h2> <p>Pop tends to stand up straight, but Bad Guy crouched. It was a delightfully malevolent presence in the charts this year, a shadow between the sprightly boasts of pop-rap and the howled emotion of pop ballads. The melody is the kind of thing Tim Burton would use to announce the arrival of an evil Victorian workhouse owner. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-the-pop-icon-who-defines-21st-century-teenage-angst\">Eilish</a>, casting herself as a \u201cmight-seduce-your-dad type\u201d, teases you right in your ear, so close you can hear every tiny creak and breath \u2013 and then, with that none-so-teenage \u201cduh!\u201d, she laughs at how much she\u2019s freaked you out. The result is the most original pop song of the year. <em>BBT</em></p> <h2><strong>3</strong></h2> <h2>Charli XCX<strong> </strong>\u2013 Gone (feat Christine and the Queens)</h2> <p>The pressure of expectations is a topic that pop stars, jaded after their ascent, often end up visiting. But they are rarely this tortured. \u201cAm I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?\u201d wonders Chris, poetically losing control of her own narrative; Charli, meanwhile, is \u201cjust now realising they don\u2019t care\u201d, and, chillingly, she could mean anyone. The glitched-up coda sees meaning dissolve altogether. But the brilliance of the echoing electro-funk backing offers a route out: you can always dance through a crisis. <em>BBT</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0dba9788741d74545e0c632828233f266f1a986\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0dba9788741d74545e0c632828233f266f1a986/0_1322_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charli XCX.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Narrative \u2026 Charli XCX.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcus Cooper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>2</strong></h2> <h2>Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Seventeen</h2> <p>Growing up mostly means shedding naivety, getting less headstrong, sanding down the youthful volatility that just adds unnecessary friction to life. But what if we smooth off the wrong edges, betraying idealism and determination for the sake of an easier ride? On Seventeen, Sharon Van Etten beholds her younger self with equal measures tenderness, frustration and envy, while remaining well aware of how resistant that tempestuous girl would be to her concern; how withering she would be of what she has become. A Jersey girl herself, she borrows classic Springsteen-y triumph for this perfectly pitched epic powered by heroism and hubris. <em>LS</em></p> <h2><strong>1</strong></h2> <h2>Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus)</h2> <p>Not only is it the most popular song of 2019, spending a record-breaking 19 consecutive weeks at No 1 in the US, plus 10 weeks in the UK Top 3, Old Town Road is also the most 2019 song of 2019. Its initial traction came from people miming to it on TikTok as part of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/27/fight-for-your-right-to-yeehaw-lil-nas-x-and-countrys-race-problem\">yeehaw</a>\u201d viral craze for amusingly hackneyed cowboy shenanigans. It was then boosted by an identity-politics controversy after it was deemed not country enough for the country charts \u2013 the subsequent addition of the none-more-country Billy Ray Cyrus for the remix was a rebuttal of utter mic-drop magnificence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Ov5jzm3j8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w2Ov5jzm3j8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Using the absurdist deadpan humour of meme culture weaponised its online popularity, while splicing rap and country earned it twice as many fans \u2013 and the line \u201cridin\u2019 on my tractor / lean all in my bladder\u201d did both at once. It would all have been for naught, though, were it not a completely brilliant song, top to bottom. Every part, from the drawled verses to the hearty chorus and taunting bridge, sounds amazing hollered from the back of a car, karaoke bar, or Shetland pony ride. Its biggest line may be a triple negative \u2013 \u201ccan\u2019t nobody tell me nothing\u201d \u2013 but Old Town Road\u2019s success is nothing but positive. <em>BBT</em></p> <p>\u2022 Playlists compiled by Lowri Ellcock.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 50 Guardian music writers were polled for their favourite albums and tracks of the year, and a bewilderingly complex spreadsheet was created to tally their votes. Ahead of our countdown of the resulting 50 best albums of the year, we\u2019re kicking off with a list of the 20 best songs. We\u2019ve also put as many as possible of the 593 tracks that were voted for into a Spotify and Apple Music playlist. 20 Fat White Family \u2013 Feet For the Serfs Up! album, which opened with this track, Fat White Family moved to Sheffield to get off heroin \u2013 but, it transpired, this merely meant not injecting it. That paradox suffuses Feet: its groove has very much got its shit together, but there\u2019s still a sickness at its heart. It\u2019s like a sleazy wallflower who slinks out of the dingy corner of some dive bar, and, snake-hipped, starts throwing some unexpectedly impressive disco shapes on the floor. BBT 19 Lizzo \u2013 Tempo (feat Missy Elliott) Lizzo made her name this year with her powerfully positive affirmations of selfhood, but Tempo tees off in much snarkier style: \u201cSlow songs, they for skinny hoes,\u201d she declares. \u201cI\u2019m a thick bitch, I need tempo.\u201d Sure enough, this is a sterner, clubbier track than her other big 2019 hits Juice and Truth Hurts (the latter not eligible for this list as it first came out in 2017). Her incitement to cunnilingus is admirably casual, but Missy Elliott steals the show with her menagerie of purrs and trills. BBT 18 Mark Ronson \u2013 Late Night Feelings (feat Lykke Li) Self-destructive behaviour wouldn\u2019t be so common if there were no thrill involved: the fantasy that your desires might pan out after all, even though you know there\u2019s not a hope in hell. It\u2019s that perverse optimism that Mark Ronson captures in Late Night Feelings. Even as Lykke Li catalogues the torments doled out by her would-be lover, the distant steel pan chime, sparkling disco chorus and sugar-spun melodies maintain the glimmering mirage of possibility. LS 17 Normani \u2013 Motivation Motivation is the pop equivalent of an Olympics-winning gymnastics routine: Normani serves take-it-or-leave-it cool, effortless vocal workouts and nonchalant cheerleader authority on the Ariana Grande co-write. In the video, her athletic choreography and throwback bellybutton piercing evoke the drilled spectacles of millennium-era Britney and Beyonc\u00e9. The former Fifth Harmony member swiftly establishes her own brand of excellence, and demands that lovers and fans alike recognise her game. LS 16 AJ Tracey \u2013 Ladbroke Grove AJ Tracey might have been a touch worried about his mainstream prospects: the first single from his album only reached No 18 in the charts, and he was upstaged on one of his biggest tracks to date, Thiago Silva, by the bucket-hatted Alex going viral with AJ\u2019s verse on stage with Dave at Glastonbury. Luckily, he had Ladbroke Grove up his sleeve. This shamelessly nostalgic UK garage track dominated the summer, AJ toasting like a club MC being heckled with champagne. No street corner was left unmolested by the words \u201cYo, it\u2019s the hyperman set!\u201d blasting from a hatchback\u2019s open windows. BBT 15 Lana Del Rey \u2013 The Greatest Having the freedom not to care is harder to come by for some people than others \u2013 and harder to come by at all these days. Those rare moments of reprieve aren\u2019t the banner memories of mental supercuts, but fleeting sensations you don\u2019t miss until they\u2019re gone. On The Greatest, Lana Del Rey watches those squandered moments slip away on the breeze as news of missile attacks, forest fires and Kanye West darkens the horizon. Elegant and valedictory, it\u2019s a masterpiece of west coast songwriting classicism: \u201cI guess I\u2019m signing off after all,\u201d she gasps, and a rich, rusty guitar solo soars out of the gate, languid and carefree as a skateboarder sailing along the boardwalk. LS 14 Stormzy \u2013 Vossi Bop With a Glastonbury headline slot on the horizon and a crown to maintain, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Stormzy would return with some kind of weighty, state-of-the-nation opus. Nah: the twitchy, tantalising Vossi Bop was a raw reminder of his charisma, the way he kisses words like the pope anointing a baby (\u201cgyal say I\u2019m bougie\u201d) and how pretenders wither to dust in his gaze. \u201cThe rules are kinda different when you\u2019re baddin\u2019 up the game,\u201d indeed. LS 13 Dave \u2013 Black Unlike the three tracks from his album Psychodrama that reached the Top 10, Black scraped the Top 40, and \u2013 being a bleak, jaded treatise on contemporary racism \u2013 it stuck out like a sore thumb amid the poppy stuff on daytime Radio 1. Dave confronts one ill after another like he can scarcely believe his own words: colonialism, social mobility, media sensationalism \u2026 but ultimately, there\u2019s such pride as he considers his hair, his history, his skin. BBT 12 Big Thief \u2013 Not With two albums in 2019 stuffed full of instantly classic songs \u2013 Forgotten Eyes, Cattails, Shoulders, Orange \u2013 Brooklyn\u2019s Big Thief are the band of the year. Votes from our critics were split across six different songs, but edging out in front was Not, a masterpiece of indie rock with a savage truth at its heart. In a world besieged by lies, we can no longer say what we are, only what we\u2019re not. This comes out as a wry, poetic laundry list from Adrianne Lenker: \u201cNot a ruse / Not heat / Not the fire lapping up the creek / Not food / That you eat.\u201d The matter-bending guitar solo has the ragged glory of Neil Young\u2019s finest. BBT 11 Rosal\u00eda and J Balvin \u2013 Con Altura It\u2019s hard to remember any self-made star having such a swift and well-deserved rise to the top as Rosal\u00eda, who already commands outsized influence given her relatively brief career to date (see: Camila Cabello\u2019s second album). This year she released an embarrassment of brilliant one-off singles that show off her wide-ranging prowess, from uncompromising experimentation (A Pal\u00e9 and Aute Cuture) to nimble pop flexes such as Con Altura. It is completely addictive: the combined charisma of the Spanish star and J Balvin snaking around the blunt dembow stutter and a synth whirr that coos like a curious wood pigeon.

The close of the Obama era was defined by the trifecta of Daft Punk\u2019s Get Lucky, Pharrell\u2019s Happy and Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson\u2019s Uptown Funk, all mining retro good vibes that were addictive yet asinine. Juice is cut from the same cloth, with a warped VHS vibe that only adds to the throwback air. Yet whereas her predecessors served up toothless victory-lap optimism, Lizzo\u2019s calling card single runs on defiance: she\u2019s not looking to the mirror on the wall to affirm her excellence, but proclaiming it with a riot of radical food gags. She\u2019s \u201cthe pudding in the proof\u201d, \u201cdrippin\u2019 so much sauce got a bitch looking like ragu\u201d. LS 4 Billie Eilish \u2013 Bad Guy Pop tends to stand up straight, but Bad Guy crouched. It was a delightfully malevolent presence in the charts this year, a shadow between the sprightly boasts of pop-rap and the howled emotion of pop ballads. The melody is the kind of thing Tim Burton would use to announce the arrival of an evil Victorian workhouse owner. Eilish, casting herself as a \u201cmight-seduce-your-dad type\u201d, teases you right in your ear, so close you can hear every tiny creak and breath \u2013 and then, with that none-so-teenage \u201cduh!\u201d, she laughs at how much she\u2019s freaked you out. The result is the most original pop song of the year. BBT 3 Charli XCX \u2013 Gone (feat Christine and the Queens) The pressure of expectations is a topic that pop stars, jaded after their ascent, often end up visiting. But they are rarely this tortured. \u201cAm I a smoke? Am I the sun? Who decides?\u201d wonders Chris, poetically losing control of her own narrative; Charli, meanwhile, is \u201cjust now realising they don\u2019t care\u201d, and, chillingly, she could mean anyone. The glitched-up coda sees meaning dissolve altogether. But the brilliance of the echoing electro-funk backing offers a route out: you can always dance through a crisis. BBT 2 Sharon Van Etten \u2013 Seventeen Growing up mostly means shedding naivety, getting less headstrong, sanding down the youthful volatility that just adds unnecessary friction to life. But what if we smooth off the wrong edges, betraying idealism and determination for the sake of an easier ride? On Seventeen, Sharon Van Etten beholds her younger self with equal measures tenderness, frustration and envy, while remaining well aware of how resistant that tempestuous girl would be to her concern; how withering she would be of what she has become. A Jersey girl herself, she borrows classic Springsteen-y triumph for this perfectly pitched epic powered by heroism and hubris. LS 1 Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus) Not only is it the most popular song of 2019, spending a record-breaking 19 consecutive weeks at No 1 in the US, plus 10 weeks in the UK Top 3, Old Town Road is also the most 2019 song of 2019. Its initial traction came from people miming to it on TikTok as part of the \u201cyeehaw\u201d viral craze for amusingly hackneyed cowboy shenanigans. It was then boosted by an identity-politics controversy after it was deemed not country enough for the country charts \u2013 the subsequent addition of the none-more-country Billy Ray Cyrus for the remix was a rebuttal of utter mic-drop magnificence. Using the absurdist deadpan humour of meme culture weaponised its online popularity, while splicing rap and country earned it twice as many fans \u2013 and the line \u201cridin\u2019 on my tractor / lean all in my bladder\u201d did both at once. It would all have been for naught, though, were it not a completely brilliant song, top to bottom. Every part, from the drawled verses to the hearty chorus and taunting bridge, sounds amazing hollered from the back of a car, karaoke bar, or Shetland pony ride. Its biggest line may be a triple negative \u2013 \u201ccan\u2019t nobody tell me nothing\u201d \u2013 but Old Town Road\u2019s success is nothing but positive.

Midway through 2019, it hadn\u2019t inspected any. A spokesperson for the public health department told the Guardian statewide data for this year was not immediately available. </p> <p>In the past, water and public health officials have raised concerns over the machines\u2019 safety when they are not properly regulated.</p> <p>In 1997, when the public health department still relied on water vending operators to inspect their own machines, the environmental toxicology bureau in Los Angeles county found that the dispensers located in southern California supermarkets <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-05-me-19680-story.html\">had higher levels of bacteria</a> than plain tap water \u2013 probably related to old filters or dirty spigots on the machines.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re safer drinking the tap water,\u201d a water official said at the time. \u201cNot only are you safer, but you\u2019re paying, oh, let\u2019s see, about 250 times less per gallon.\u201d</p> <p>A few years later, a study by the not-for-profit <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/about-us\">Environmental Working Group</a> found that water from two-thirds of the machines they tested in California, owned by the then industry leader, Glacier Water, <a href=\"https://static.ewg.org/reports/2002/IsWaterFromVendingMachinesReallyChemicalFree.pdf?_ga=2.56827242.1713316250.1574645644-166706387.1573012901\">did not match its marketing </a>claims in terms of contaminants.</p> <p>California\u2019s vended water market is dominated by Primo water, which purchased Glacier Water in 2016 and owns 85% of the vended water kiosks in California.</p> <p>At the time of its merger, Primo said the acquisition gave it 46,000 retail locations in the US and Canada. Today Primo is valued at $400m.</p> <p>Vending machine companies usually offer a cut of their sales and possibly a signing bonus to stores that allow them to use their space.</p> <p>The market is so profitable it has sparked ugly turf wars between water companies competing for the coveted space in front of stores.</p> <p>About seven years ago, one vending machine company, Mountain\u2019s Peak, filed a complaint against Glacier and accused it of threatening and pressuring store owners to sign contracts with Glacier. Glacier, in turn, accused Mountain Peak of benefiting from a plot to sabotage its machines and steal business.</p> <p>The two companies eventually settled and agreed not to tamper with each other\u2019s machines.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a nasty business. It\u2019s not a gentleman\u2019s business,\u201d Ed Rose, an attorney who represented Mountain\u2019s Peak, <a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/science-environment/water-vending-businesses-tap-into-customer-fears-over-water-quality/\">told Voice of San Diego</a> this year.</p> <h2>\u2018It is cynical and exploitative\u2019</h2> <p>The concerns raised over lax regulation don\u2019t seem to matter to the dozens of customers who line up to fetch water from the machines \u2013 many of them located in front of liquor stores and strip malls in low-income neighborhoods and immigrant communities.</p> <p>Watermill Express, which operates the windmill-shaped water kiosks, did not respond to questions from the Guardian. But when asked in 2015 why so many kiosks were found in low-income neighborhoods, Lani Dolifka, the Watermill co-founder, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3051484/these-vending-machines-dispense-clean-water-for-a-price\">told Fast Company</a> that \u201cbudget conscious\u201d clientele deserve options, too.</p> <p>\u201cNot everyone can afford to buy bottled water or have a water delivery service, but everyone needs access to safe, affordable, pure drinking water,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Debi Ores, a senior attorney with the Community Water Center, a not-for-profit organization that works to improve access to clean water for residents in central California, said the distrust of tap water is understandable for immigrants who come from countries without clean drinking water.</p> <p>\u201cIf the water looks or smells a little funny, they might not have faith that the water is safe to drink. Especially if they\u2019ve known people or had family members who\u2019ve gotten sick from drinking the water.\u201d</p> <p>But the Environmental Working Group, which researches environmental issues, took a sharper view of the marketing in a 2002 report. At the time, it said the then industry leader, Glacier, was exploiting immigrants\u2019 fear of tap water <a href=\"https://static.ewg.org/reports/2002/IsWaterFromVendingMachinesReallyChemicalFree.pdf?_ga=2.56827242.1713316250.1574645644-166706387.1573012901\">in order to turn a profit.</a></p> <p>Glacier at the time estimated that 60% of its market in California came from Latino and Asian customers.</p> <p>\u201cOn the surface, the targeting of recent immigrants may seem like smart niche marketing. But on closer examination, it is cynical and exploitative,\u201d the report read.</p> <p>\u201cGlacier\u2019s marketing strategy takes advantage of the fact that new arrivals, many of whom have limited English skills, may not know that California tap water is safer than the water back home. Then it charges people who can least afford it an inflated price for a basic necessity.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Primo nor Watermill Express responded to multiple phone calls and emails from the Guardian.</p> <p>Questions over marketing aside, residents could be forgiven for not trusting the contents of their tap water.</p> <p>In recent years, California schools have been scrutinized for providing drinking water with high concentrations of lead \u2013 contamination that can happen when ageing pipes leach lead into the water before it leaves the faucet, said Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist with EWG.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no safe levels of lead, especially for children,\u201d Temkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a problem with the quality of the water that the utility is providing, but what\u2019s coming out in the back end,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In a school less than two miles away from where Eddie and Martinez filled up their jugs, officials were alerted to contaminated water after a <a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/the-therapy-dog-that-might-have-sniffed-out-a-major-problem-for-kids-across-the-district/\">therapy dog reportedly refused to drink</a>. When officials tested the water they found lead as well as a chemical that came from plastic pipes. It was probably the reason the school nurse reported that students vomited after drinking the water.</p> <p>More than schools are at risk, though; homes in low-income communities are particularly prone to contamination tied to ageing infrastructure and lax monitoring standards, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"159826ff8138239a49512504fbb50bc343d7c172\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/159826ff8138239a49512504fbb50bc343d7c172/0_0_1999_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"There are about 9,200 water vending machines are clustered throughout the state.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are about 9,200 water vending machines clustered throughout the state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Francis Peters/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Not a great solution\u2019</h2> <p>Anxiety over having enough clean water has loomed over California for years.</p> <p>Panic set in four years ago after a winter of unusually low snowfall, which the state relies on to refill water reservoirs, exacerbated drought conditions. Cities began issuing water restrictions, but by May of that year nearly 2,000 wells had run dry, leaving some communities without water.</p> <p>The seven-year drought <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/15/california-drought-free-after-7-years-dry-conditions-remain/3168753002/\">officially ended</a> this year, but the dry stretch highlighted the precarious nature of water in California.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an estimated 1 million residents in California still <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/editorials/article231133013.html\">go without clean water</a>, many of them in the Central Valley, the state\u2019s agricultural hub, which produces a quarter of the nation\u2019s produce.</p> <p>Water vending machines may seem like an appropriate response to providing clean water for communities that struggle to provide it. But experts and advocates list a number of reasons why vended water falls short as a solution and may even further strain the residents who most need it.</p> <p>While the majority of water kiosks are found in southern California, the regions that accrued the most violations for contaminated drinking water are located north of Los Angeles, in less populous areas of the state, according to <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/\">EWG\u2019s tap water database</a>, which includes enforcement and compliance related information.</p> <p>And the fact that the kiosks typically need a water supply that already meets federal and state standards means the machines wouldn\u2019t work for areas where clean water is most scarce \u2013 places such as the San Joaquin Valley, which Jonathan London, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, <a href=\"https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/thousands-san-joaquin-valley-have-unsafe-drinking-water-clean-water-close/\">has studied extensively</a>.</p> <p>Vended water could help some, but it also imposes additional burdens on families, London said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a great solution, long-term,\u201d London said. \u201cThe vending machines unfortunately are not well-regulated.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of the people who are dependent on vended water don\u2019t have cars, so it is hard for them to actually access it, he said. And buying filtered water, on top of the water coming through their pipes, puts an extra financial burden on low-income families and cuts into their monthly income, he said.</p> <p>London and Ores instead favor longer-term solutions, like getting more residents off private-well water and on to public water systems of larger jurisdictions, which have more resources to treat and monitor water.</p> <p>The Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, linked to legislation the California governor, Gavin Newsom, signed this year, could provide some relief. The plan allocates up to $130m a year to help cash-strapped districts improve access to clean water.</p> <p>Ores said it was a step toward sustainability and providing people the clean water they are entitled to.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with communities that pay up to 10% of their monthly income on water,\u201d she said, referring to places where people pay for vended or bottled water on top of what they spend on the unclean water pumped into their homes.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are spending a huge part of their income just on a basic human right.\u201d</p>",

But when asked in 2015 why so many kiosks were found in low-income neighborhoods, Lani Dolifka, the Watermill co-founder, told Fast Company that \u201cbudget conscious\u201d clientele deserve options, too. \u201cNot everyone can afford to buy bottled water or have a water delivery service, but everyone needs access to safe, affordable, pure drinking water,\u201d she said. Debi Ores, a senior attorney with the Community Water Center, a not-for-profit organization that works to improve access to clean water for residents in central California, said the distrust of tap water is understandable for immigrants who come from countries without clean drinking water. \u201cIf the water looks or smells a little funny, they might not have faith that the water is safe to drink. Especially if they\u2019ve known people or had family members who\u2019ve gotten sick from drinking the water.\u201d But the Environmental Working Group, which researches environmental issues, took a sharper view of the marketing in a 2002 report. At the time, it said the then industry leader, Glacier, was exploiting immigrants\u2019 fear of tap water in order to turn a profit. Glacier at the time estimated that 60% of its market in California came from Latino and Asian customers. \u201cOn the surface, the targeting of recent immigrants may seem like smart niche marketing. But on closer examination, it is cynical and exploitative,\u201d the report read. \u201cGlacier\u2019s marketing strategy takes advantage of the fact that new arrivals, many of whom have limited English skills, may not know that California tap water is safer than the water back home. Then it charges people who can least afford it an inflated price for a basic necessity.\u201d Neither Primo nor Watermill Express responded to multiple phone calls and emails from the Guardian. Questions over marketing aside, residents could be forgiven for not trusting the contents of their tap water. In recent years, California schools have been scrutinized for providing drinking water with high concentrations of lead \u2013 contamination that can happen when ageing pipes leach lead into the water before it leaves the faucet, said Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist with EWG. \u201cThere\u2019s really no safe levels of lead, especially for children,\u201d Temkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a problem with the quality of the water that the utility is providing, but what\u2019s coming out in the back end,\u201d she said. In a school less than two miles away from where Eddie and Martinez filled up their jugs, officials were alerted to contaminated water after a therapy dog reportedly refused to drink. When officials tested the water they found lead as well as a chemical that came from plastic pipes. It was probably the reason the school nurse reported that students vomited after drinking the water. More than schools are at risk, though; homes in low-income communities are particularly prone to contamination tied to ageing infrastructure and lax monitoring standards, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \u2018Not a great solution\u2019 Anxiety over having enough clean water has loomed over California for years. Panic set in four years ago after a winter of unusually low snowfall, which the state relies on to refill water reservoirs, exacerbated drought conditions. Cities began issuing water restrictions, but by May of that year nearly 2,000 wells had run dry, leaving some communities without water. The seven-year drought officially ended this year, but the dry stretch highlighted the precarious nature of water in California. Meanwhile, an estimated 1 million residents in California still go without clean water, many of them in the Central Valley, the state\u2019s agricultural hub, which produces a quarter of the nation\u2019s produce. Water vending machines may seem like an appropriate response to providing clean water for communities that struggle to provide it. But experts and advocates list a number of reasons why vended water falls short as a solution and may even further strain the residents who most need it. While the majority of water kiosks are found in southern California, the regions that accrued the most violations for contaminated drinking water are located north of Los Angeles, in less populous areas of the state, according to EWG\u2019s tap water database, which includes enforcement and compliance related information. And the fact that the kiosks typically need a water supply that already meets federal and state standards means the machines wouldn\u2019t work for areas where clean water is most scarce \u2013 places such as the San Joaquin Valley, which Jonathan London, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, has studied extensively. Vended water could help some, but it also imposes additional burdens on families, London said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great solution, long-term,\u201d London said. \u201cThe vending machines unfortunately are not well-regulated.\u201d A lot of the people who are dependent on vended water don\u2019t have cars, so it is hard for them to actually access it, he said. And buying filtered water, on top of the water coming through their pipes, puts an extra financial burden on low-income families and cuts into their monthly income, he said. London and Ores instead favor longer-term solutions, like getting more residents off private-well water and on to public water systems of larger jurisdictions, which have more resources to treat and monitor water. The Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, linked to legislation the California governor, Gavin Newsom, signed this year, could provide some relief. The plan allocates up to $130m a year to help cash-strapped districts improve access to clean water. Ores said it was a step toward sustainability and providing people the clean water they are entitled to. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with communities that pay up to 10% of their monthly income on water,\u201d she said, referring to places where people pay for vended or bottled water on top of what they spend on the unclean water pumped into their homes. \u201cPeople are spending a huge part of their income just on a basic human right.\u201d",

Megan Mullally, who played Salazar\u2019s boss Karen Walker, is among the shows\u2019 stars who have paid tribute to Morrison, writing on Twitter that \u201c[I] just got a bulletin on my phone that Shelley morrison has passed. my heart is heavy. putting shelley, her beloved husband walter &amp; their children in the light. thank you for your friendship &amp; partnership, shell. you accomplished wonderful things in this world. you will be missed.\u2019 Meanwhile, Debra Messing, who played Grace, paid tribute to Morrison on Instagram: \u2018Oh, Shelley ... what a loss. Our dear Rosario has passed on. Shelley had a career that spanned decades, but she will always be our dear Rosie. All my love to Walter and the entire family\u201d. Will and Grace returned for the first of three rebooted series in 2017, the third of which is currently airing in the US. Morrison\u2019s career also included roles in the US soap General Hospital and long-running series including Murder, She Wrote and LA Law. She is survived by her husband of over 40 years, Walter Dominguez, and their three sons and three daughters.",

Hohn accused BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, of \u201cgreenwash\u201d because it does not require emissions disclosures. \u201cAsset owners should fire asset managers that do not require such disclosure,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t need to wait on regulators who are asleep at the switch and unwilling or unable to regulate emissions properly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can use their voting power to force change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriously. Investors have the power, and they have to use it.\u201d TCI\u2019s move comes as the world\u2019s governments meet in Madrid this week for the UN climate summit, and as the UN appointed the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, who steps down in January, as its special envoy for climate action and finance from February. A new report shows almost half of UK boards (46%) spent zero hours discussing the climate emergency this year, and they were the least likely of all the countries studied to do so. Almost a third of UK boards (32%) feel little or no responsibility for the climate crisis, according to a global survey of 640 chairs and non-executive directors by recruitment firm Harvey Nash and London Business School\u2019s Leadership Institute.",

But if you can muster the energy, evidence shows that exercise has a powerfully beneficial effect. One <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689\" title=\"\">2019 study</a>, published in JAMA Psychiatry, found that physical activity is an effective prevention strategy for depression. <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09638288.2014.972579\" title=\"\">Another 2015 paper</a> found that exercise can be as helpful in treating mild to moderate depression as antidepressants and psychotherapy.</p> <p>\u201cWe have known for a long time that exercise promotes physiological and neurochemical responses that make you feel good,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/nanette-mutrie\" title=\"\">Prof Nanette Mutrie</a> of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s Institute for Sport, Physical Education and Health Sciences.

All of this forms part of the mix. There\u2019s this synergy of positive things that is happening.\u201d</p> <p>If you are struggling with your mental health and are anxious about exercise, the best advice is to start small. \u201cYour goals should be really achievable,\u201d advises Sarah Overall, a London-based <a href=\"https://overallfit.co.uk/\" title=\"\">personal trainer</a> who is qualified to take referrals from the NHS. \u201cTake it slowly and be proud of every step you take.\u201d She also says you will have setbacks along the way and shouldn\u2019t feel discouraged. \u201cFitness isn\u2019t linear,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can go for a run one day and feel OK, and the next time feel rubbish.\u201d She suggests exercising with a trusted friend, so that you have someone to check in with if you are feeling anxious.</p> <p>Mutrie suggests a simple walking programme. \u201cAim to increase the amount you are walking over the course of a month. Start with walking for 10 minutes a day and gradually up it.\u201d Most smartphones now have pedometers, so you can track your steps: 7,000 steps a day is a good target to set yourself, with the aim of eventually increasing it to the government recommendation of 10,000 steps daily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bf087e11c34332a473695cdbf26a0d7334e7b93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bf087e11c34332a473695cdbf26a0d7334e7b93/0_488_4869_2921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman runner takes a break\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Running can be a great way of improving your self-esteem \u2013 but take it slowly at first.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Harrington/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jermainejohnsonpt/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Jermaine Johnson,</a> another personal trainer who often trains clients with depression and anxiety, suggests avoiding cardio. \u201cThat can raise the heart rate and fuel your anxiety,\u201d he says.

If you\u2019re able to slip away from work, gyms are generally quiet in the mid-afternoon. Plus, you won\u2019t have to drag yourself out of bed at the crack of dawn. \u201cIf it\u2019s dark or rainy, it can be hard to get up early, especially if you\u2019re struggling with depression,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Just being in nature has also been shown to have beneficial mental health effects. \u201cYou need sunlight for vitamin D, and vitamin D lifts your mood,\u201d says Overall.

Is it more that you know Than that, even as in April, So in November, Winter is gone that must go? Or is all your lore Not to call November November, And April April, And Winter Winter \u2013 no more? But I know the months all, And their sweet names, April, May and June and October, As you call and call I must remember What died into April And consider what will be born Of a fair November; And April I love for what It was born of, and November For what it will die in, What they are and what they are not, While you love what is kind, What you can sing in And love and forget in All that\u2019s ahead and behind.

Sport as a sort of human-rights Heineken, somehow able to refresh and open up countries that traditional statecraft can\u2019t reach. The reality does not match the rhetoric. Professor Simon Chadwick of the Salford Business school, who specialises in the geo-politics and marketing of sport, is blunt. \u201cIt is difficult to identify a country anywhere in the world that has fundamentally and sustainably changed for the better as a result of sport,\u201d he says. Chadwick accepts there have been small improvements in some Gulf states: women being allowed into football matches in Saudi Arabia and Iran, for instance. \u201cBut without other, broader policy measures, it won\u2019t bring about a massive shift in attitudes and behaviours,\u201d he warns.</p> <p>Even the small changes in workers\u2019 rights for those working on 2022 football World Cup stadiums comes with a caveat. \u201cThese improvements are not necessarily being replicated in other industrial sectors across the country,\u201d Chadwick says. \u201cQatar now has a twin-track labour market: one where standards are robust even by international standards and another where practices remain deeply suspect.\u201d Nick McGeehan, a co-director of the human rights research organisation Fair/Square Research &amp; Projects, is even more sceptical about sport\u2019s power to improve human rights in repressive countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a great line for sports administrators to trot out but the Gulf provides numerous examples of why the argument tends to be bogus and self-serving,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"287930398f1e8bd0e69282208b758f6dd16a26dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/287930398f1e8bd0e69282208b758f6dd16a26dc/0_55_3422_2053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Joshua has encountered criticism for staging his rematch with Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Joshua has encountered criticism for staging his rematch with Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He cites the UAE, which has gone further than most regimes in using sport, as well as arts and literature festivals, to boost its image in the west. \u201cProponents say this will create space for free expression and improve the rights climate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t. On the contrary, there has been a drastic decline in the human-rights situation.\u201d McGeehan argues the presence of golf\u2019s European Tour, Formula One and ATP Tennis, along with Abu Dhabi\u2019s ownership of Manchester City, \u201chave provided it with cover and enabled it to present itself as liberal, western-friendly and open for business \u2013 everything Saudi Arabia now wants to do\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Recap: Sign up for our weekly roundup of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Recap: Sign up for our weekly roundup of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sport has extraordinary power to changes lives and challenge cultures. No one disputes that. It is helping people get more active, reducing violence between gangs, or even, or in the case of Football 4 Peace International, improving relations between Palestinian and Israeli children. But this sporting evangelism, which dates back at least as far as Thomas Hughes\u2019 Christian socialism of the 19th century and is propagated most loudly by the International Olympic Committee and Fifa, can only stretch so far before it looks silly.</p> <p>Bringing Formula One to Bahrain has not made the country substantially more liberal. Saudi Arabia, according to Amnesty, is in the midst of a \u201chuman-rights crackdown\u201d despite its modernisation claims. China has become more authoritarian since the world\u2019s eyes fixed on it during the 2008 Olympics. And while those who work in sport appear to believe the good-news stories they tell themselves, Chadwick notes when events are taken to such countries they merely \u201cinduce micro-changes within cultures rather than fundamentally make societal and macro-cultural change\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/11/high-time-nike-iaaf-right-thing-athletes\">High time that Nike and the IAAF did the right thing by athletes | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps things will eventually shift. Chadwick notes there is often an internal feud between traditionalists and modernisers in Gulf states, with younger, western-educated elites more willing to embrace some reform. Whether such reforms would be enough for human rights groups is another matter. For now, though, we can say this with confidence. Holding sporting events in repressive regimes does far more to serve the political and economic interests of those in power \u2013 and swell the coffers of sporting bodies and athletes \u2013 than to improve the lot and lives of ordinary people.</p> <p>That does not necessarily mean Joshua should not be fighting in Saudi Arabia, or the IAAF should not stage the world championships in Doha, but heads should not be buried in the sand either.</p>",

Chadwick accepts there have been small improvements in some Gulf states: women being allowed into football matches in Saudi Arabia and Iran, for instance. \u201cBut without other, broader policy measures, it won\u2019t bring about a massive shift in attitudes and behaviours,\u201d he warns. Even the small changes in workers\u2019 rights for those working on 2022 football World Cup stadiums comes with a caveat. \u201cThese improvements are not necessarily being replicated in other industrial sectors across the country,\u201d Chadwick says. \u201cQatar now has a twin-track labour market: one where standards are robust even by international standards and another where practices remain deeply suspect.\u201d Nick McGeehan, a co-director of the human rights research organisation Fair/Square Research &amp; Projects, is even more sceptical about sport\u2019s power to improve human rights in repressive countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a great line for sports administrators to trot out but the Gulf provides numerous examples of why the argument tends to be bogus and self-serving,\u201d he says. He cites the UAE, which has gone further than most regimes in using sport, as well as arts and literature festivals, to boost its image in the west. \u201cProponents say this will create space for free expression and improve the rights climate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t. On the contrary, there has been a drastic decline in the human-rights situation.\u201d McGeehan argues the presence of golf\u2019s European Tour, Formula One and ATP Tennis, along with Abu Dhabi\u2019s ownership of Manchester City, \u201chave provided it with cover and enabled it to present itself as liberal, western-friendly and open for business \u2013 everything Saudi Arabia now wants to do\u201d. Sport has extraordinary power to changes lives and challenge cultures. No one disputes that. It is helping people get more active, reducing violence between gangs, or even, or in the case of Football 4 Peace International, improving relations between Palestinian and Israeli children. But this sporting evangelism, which dates back at least as far as Thomas Hughes\u2019 Christian socialism of the 19th century and is propagated most loudly by the International Olympic Committee and Fifa, can only stretch so far before it looks silly. Bringing Formula One to Bahrain has not made the country substantially more liberal. Saudi Arabia, according to Amnesty, is in the midst of a \u201chuman-rights crackdown\u201d despite its modernisation claims. China has become more authoritarian since the world\u2019s eyes fixed on it during the 2008 Olympics. And while those who work in sport appear to believe the good-news stories they tell themselves, Chadwick notes when events are taken to such countries they merely \u201cinduce micro-changes within cultures rather than fundamentally make societal and macro-cultural change\u201d. Perhaps things will eventually shift. Chadwick notes there is often an internal feud between traditionalists and modernisers in Gulf states, with younger, western-educated elites more willing to embrace some reform. Whether such reforms would be enough for human rights groups is another matter. For now, though, we can say this with confidence. Holding sporting events in repressive regimes does far more to serve the political and economic interests of those in power \u2013 and swell the coffers of sporting bodies and athletes \u2013 than to improve the lot and lives of ordinary people. That does not necessarily mean Joshua should not be fighting in Saudi Arabia, or the IAAF should not stage the world championships in Doha, but heads should not be buried in the sand either.",

In the US, its lead role was taken by camp sitcom stars Jim Parsons and Sean Hayes. Now standup Zoe Lyons plays the capricious Almighty who, when asked why there is no consistent justice in her world, barks: \u201cI prefer mysterious ways!\u201d Although described as a \u201cone-God show\u201d, Lyons \u2013 in silk pyjamas on Tim Shortall\u2019s heavenly king-size bed set \u2013 is joined by buff Tom Bowen as archangel Gabriel, reciting verses from a Gutenberg Bible. In the auditorium, archangel Michael (Matt Tedford) solicits audience questions, before staging a minor rebellion and venturing niggling doubts of his own. Playwright David Javerbaum\u2019s iconography \u2013 messianic woman, two camp angels \u2013 brings to mind Lucy McCormick\u2019s hit show Triple Threat, next to which Act of God feels tame. It starts frothily, as louche Lyons reveals the same-sex truth about Ada and Eve, and tries to excuse the biblical flood: \u201cIt drowned me more than it drowned you.\u201d There are divine one-liners: the show is more quotable than the good book itself. There are topical asides, too \u2013 on Brexit, on Prince Andrew \u2013 in a show Javerbaum has adjusted for UK audiences. There\u2019s a final-act gear change, as God (and the play) gets a bit pious about Jesus, and volunteers belated penitence for her behaviour. (\u201cIncompetence and omnipotence is a recipe for disaster.\u201d) Javerbaum\u2019s satiric point \u2013 that the Old Testament God is a psychopath, who we\u2019d be better off without \u2013 might create a frisson in the States. To British audiences, it feels less of a Revelation. But it\u2019s funny \u2013 as you\u2019d expect from a writer whose 13 Emmys are mostly for comedy writing. Everyday and biblical idiom are spliced to droll effect; attention is amusingly drawn (if seldom for the first time) to God\u2019s moral illogic and scriptural credibility gaps wider than the parting of the Red Sea. It trips along enjoyably in Benji Sperring\u2019s production \u2013 but it\u2019s more sweet breeze than thunderbolt. \u2022 At the Vaults, London, until 12 January.",

There is always a cost to being honest.\u201d \u201cIn regards to my detention, my grandfather was shocked and passed away, and my child was scared,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope I can take some of your time for a cup of coffee.\u201d The criticism from within China is rare for Huawei, one of the most popular brands within the country and a symbol of national pride. Chinese citizens have rallied behind the company as it battles accusations of government influence, pushing Huawei smartphone sales up. On Sunday, Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese Huawei executive who was arrested in Canada a year ago, published an open letter thanking Chinese citizens for their support, writing: \u201cYour passion and support have always warmed my heart. Netizens have gone out of their way to express their ongoing trust, support, and care for us as well. You can see their comments online every time Huawei is in the news.\u201d In comments below Meng\u2019s letter, commentators accused her of hypocrisy. One user wrote: \u201cLi Hongyuan has worked hard for a dozen years and was forced to resign at the age of 35. He ends up in detention for protecting his own worker\u2019s right \u2026 your suffering is called suffering, but what about those in jail for 251 days?\u201d A Weibo user wrote: \u201cAll day Huawei spouts patriotism and decries the kidnapping [of Meng], then it goes and jails its own workers.\u201d Additional reporting by Jiahui Huang",

      "body": "<p>The crowd that gathered outside Hungary\u2019s neo-gothic parliament building on Friday was loud, young and passionate. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/29/hundreds-of-thousands-of-students-join-global-climate-strikes\">latest round of global school climate strikes</a> drew several thousand people in Budapest, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/opposition-parties-candidate-wins-budapest-mayoral-race\">city\u2019s newly elected liberal mayor</a>. They sang, chanted and shouted demands to the country\u2019s politicians to take the climate emergency seriously.</p> \n<p>But there was little sign that inside parliament, dominated by the Fidesz party of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/viktor-orban-trumpets-far-right-procreation-anti-immigration-policy\">far-right prime minister, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/viktor-orban-trumpets-far-right-procreation-anti-immigration-policy\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>, the politicians were listening. It was an illustration of a key new political divide in Europe, between rightwing forces who preach that the greatest danger to life as we know it is migration, and those who say instead that the biggest threat comes from the climate emergency.</p> \n<p>One of the clearest examples of this is in Germany, which has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/german-greens-rise-nation-divided\">parallel increases in popularity</a> for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) and the Greens.

In October, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, an opposition politician who stood on a platform that prominently featured green issues, won a surprise victory in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/17/gergely-karacsony-mayor-budapest-eu-hungary-liberal-viktor-orban\">Budapest\u2019s mayoral election</a> against Orb\u00e1n\u2019s preferred candidate.

      "bodyText": "The crowd that gathered outside Hungary\u2019s neo-gothic parliament building on Friday was loud, young and passionate. The latest round of global school climate strikes drew several thousand people in Budapest, including the city\u2019s newly elected liberal mayor. They sang, chanted and shouted demands to the country\u2019s politicians to take the climate emergency seriously. But there was little sign that inside parliament, dominated by the Fidesz party of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the politicians were listening. It was an illustration of a key new political divide in Europe, between rightwing forces who preach that the greatest danger to life as we know it is migration, and those who say instead that the biggest threat comes from the climate emergency. One of the clearest examples of this is in Germany, which has seen parallel increases in popularity for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) and the Greens. In the eastern half of Europe, where traditionally green politics has found little support, there are signs of a similar divide appearing. Here, too, the climate emergency is filtering into the public consciousness, particularly though not exclusively among younger people in the cities. In October, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, an opposition politician who stood on a platform that prominently featured green issues, won a surprise victory in Budapest\u2019s mayoral election against Orb\u00e1n\u2019s preferred candidate. His team believes that the climate issue has the potential to galvanise opposition to the government. \u201cDue to the rise of Greta [Thunberg, the Swedish teenage activist] and the whole movement it has entered a lot of people\u2019s consciousness in the past year, and I see a lot of people who weren\u2019t involved in any activism before starting to get involved,\u201d said D\u00e1vid Dorosz, the deputy mayor in the new administration, speaking on the sidelines of Friday\u2019s protest which he attended together with Kar\u00e1csony. There are several policy plans that will help make Budapest a greener city, he said, but to what extent they can be implemented will depend on funding from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s central government. Orb\u00e1n has shied away from pure denial of climate science, but has on repeated occasions suggested the green movement is being used as a cover for liberal, globalist designs. \u201cAside from a few dozen activists, the whole topic interests no one, which only shows the sanity of Hungarian society,\u201d his chief of staff, Gergely Guly\u00e1s, said in September. He also called Thunberg \u201ca sick child\u201d. Benedek J\u00e1vor, a Hungarian green politician and former MEP, said the climate scepticism was born out of political rather than ideological reasons. \u201cOrb\u00e1n has decided to position Fidesz on the populist extreme right and to oppose those new challenges to the political structure posed by the climate movement and Greens,\u201d he said. At a European council summit in June, Hungary was among four countries that blocked an EU-wide plan for net zero-carbon emissions by 2050: the others were Poland, the Czech Republic and Estonia. All have rightwing, populist governments with the exception of Estonia, but there, too, the governing coalition includes a far-right party. Estonia has said in the interim that it is ready to back the target, but the other three holdouts look unlikely to budge. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, asked at the June summit: \u201cWhy should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?\u201d Last week, the European parliament declared a global \u201cclimate and environmental emergency\u201d, but activists have said the words will be meaningless if they are not backed up with tougher action. At a summit next week, the European council may try again to agree the 2050 target. In September, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, singled out Poland for blocking attempts to enshrine the carbon neutrality goal. \u201cMarching every Friday to say that the planet is burning, that\u2019s nice, but that is not the problem. Go protest in Poland! Help me move those I cannot push forward,\u201d he said. Poland has said its reliance on coal means it will need to be compensated more from the central EU budget before it can commit to carbon neutrality. In Hungary, the government says its opposition to the target is also based on purely financial considerations. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to rush. We have an accepted strategy to 2030, if you want to change that you have to reconfigure the set of available data.

Partly because much of the media has been focused on maximizing profits, catering to what is popular or sensational rather than what citizens need to know.

Four years later, the networks allocated 114 minutes to policy. In 2016, by late October, they had devoted a total of just 32 minutes.</p> <p>The popular and sensational are also driving social media, where <a href=\"https://www.journalism.org/2018/09/10/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2018/\">some 68%</a> of the American public now gets its news.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s presidency marks the culmination of these trends. Schooled in reality television and New York tabloids, Trump understands how to drive ratings and get attention. As the 2016 presidential race heated up, Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464\">admitted</a> the Trump phenomenon \u201cmay not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s lies and ongoing attacks on his critics in the media score points with his base but at the expense of a weakened democracy. If a large enough portion of the public comes to trust Trump\u2019s own words more than the media\u2019s, Trump can get away with saying \u2013 and doing \u2013 whatever he wants. When that happens, democracy ends.</p> <p>How, then, can print and broadcast news rebuild public trust? Publishers and editors must demonstrate to the public that their news stories are produced accurately and intelligently by following five principles.</p> <p>First, news-gathering and reporting must be independent of executives who represent the interests of shareholders.</p> <p>Second, media outlets should clearly state their processes for checking facts and correcting errors, and ensuring that the public is made aware of corrections.</p> <p>Third, they must separate facts and analysis from opinions and advocacy.</p> <p>Fourth, they must inform readers and viewers of any news or news-gathering that is funded by organizations with a stake in what\u2019s reported.</p> <p>Social media should make clear which content is paid for and by whom, as well as the sources of all non-paid content, including the names and addresses of individuals responsible.</p> <p>Fifth, they should have ombudsmen to investigate public complaints about their coverage, along with public editors who serve as paid in-house critics.</p> <p>Even with all this, there is also a need for at least some truly independent newspapers and media outlets, like the Guardian, financed not by commercial sponsors or any party with a financial or other interest, but which exist solely to serve the public.</p> <p>These steps are necessary not only to rebuild public trust but also to restore the media to its rightful place in our democracy and protect the truth as a common good.</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Capitalism-Many-Not-Few/dp/0345806220\">Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052552049X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\">The Common Good</a>.

A Tyndall Report study found that in the 2008 presidential election the major TV networks devoted a total of 220 minutes to reporting candidates\u2019 positions on issues of public policy. Four years later, the networks allocated 114 minutes to policy. In 2016, by late October, they had devoted a total of just 32 minutes. The popular and sensational are also driving social media, where some 68% of the American public now gets its news. Donald Trump\u2019s presidency marks the culmination of these trends. Schooled in reality television and New York tabloids, Trump understands how to drive ratings and get attention. As the 2016 presidential race heated up, Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS, admitted the Trump phenomenon \u201cmay not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS\u201d. Trump\u2019s lies and ongoing attacks on his critics in the media score points with his base but at the expense of a weakened democracy. If a large enough portion of the public comes to trust Trump\u2019s own words more than the media\u2019s, Trump can get away with saying \u2013 and doing \u2013 whatever he wants. When that happens, democracy ends. How, then, can print and broadcast news rebuild public trust? Publishers and editors must demonstrate to the public that their news stories are produced accurately and intelligently by following five principles. First, news-gathering and reporting must be independent of executives who represent the interests of shareholders. Second, media outlets should clearly state their processes for checking facts and correcting errors, and ensuring that the public is made aware of corrections. Third, they must separate facts and analysis from opinions and advocacy. Fourth, they must inform readers and viewers of any news or news-gathering that is funded by organizations with a stake in what\u2019s reported. Social media should make clear which content is paid for and by whom, as well as the sources of all non-paid content, including the names and addresses of individuals responsible. Fifth, they should have ombudsmen to investigate public complaints about their coverage, along with public editors who serve as paid in-house critics. Even with all this, there is also a need for at least some truly independent newspapers and media outlets, like the Guardian, financed not by commercial sponsors or any party with a financial or other interest, but which exist solely to serve the public. These steps are necessary not only to rebuild public trust but also to restore the media to its rightful place in our democracy and protect the truth as a common good.

Another Test win at home over Pakistan (Australia have now recorded 14 on the bounce since 1995, when they last lost to Pakistan on these shores) and another home series win over this opponent (Pakistan have never won a Test series in Australia). And it was as comprehensive as it sounds. Dave Warner, whose mind boggling 335 not out in Adelaide took his series tally to 489 runs, is back in form, Marnus Labuschagne has sewn up first drop for a time to come and Australia\u2019s attack showed yet again how devastating and versatile it is. The pacemen shared the wickets and, on this fourth day in Adelaide, Nathan Lyon claimed his 16th five-wicket bag to remind all and sundry that when his time comes, he rarely fluffs his lines. And to think, amongst all this, Steve Smith was barely sighted. Australia will find a greater challenge in New Zealand, but in Pakistan they have partaken in a confidence-building exercise that will stand them in good stead. Onwards and upwards.

      "bodyText": "Another innings victory for Australia. Another Test win at home over Pakistan (Australia have now recorded 14 on the bounce since 1995, when they last lost to Pakistan on these shores) and another home series win over this opponent (Pakistan have never won a Test series in Australia). And it was as comprehensive as it sounds. Dave Warner, whose mind boggling 335 not out in Adelaide took his series tally to 489 runs, is back in form, Marnus Labuschagne has sewn up first drop for a time to come and Australia\u2019s attack showed yet again how devastating and versatile it is. The pacemen shared the wickets and, on this fourth day in Adelaide, Nathan Lyon claimed his 16th five-wicket bag to remind all and sundry that when his time comes, he rarely fluffs his lines. And to think, amongst all this, Steve Smith was barely sighted. Australia will find a greater challenge in New Zealand, but in Pakistan they have partaken in a confidence-building exercise that will stand them in good stead. Onwards and upwards. Thanks for your company. Please join us again in Perth. Musa jumps around the crease like a, well, teenage No.11 making his Test debut, but manages to get a thick edge over the slip cordon for four before Abbas sets off for a single to get on strike but is sent back, and packing, as Cummins effects a direct hit from mid on. Game over. Australia win the series 2-0. Hazlewood on for Lyon and he strikes with his first effort, a straight one that moves ever so slightly in the air and finds its way through Rizwan\u2019s forward defensive. 81st over: Pakistan 235-8 (Rizwan 45, Abbas 1) New ball taken. Abbas has the questionable honour of facing it with his first ball, but he gets off strike immediately by pushing Starc for one. Rizwan puts the No.10 back on strike straight away, as you do, and Abbas is equal to the challenge, if you can call being beaten all ends up across the body equal to the challenge. 80th over: Pakistan 233-8 (Rizwan 44, Abbas 0) Lyon finishes his over, conceding a boundary to Rizwan, and now the new ball is due. Not far away from the resumption of play. To bide the remaining minutes, here\u2019s John Phaceas: \u201cHi Scott, Playing lookalikes is a pretty low rent game, but your comment about Marnus Labuschagne smiling like the Joker got me thinking. I reckon there\u2019s a bit of strip-club Freddy from Mr In-Between about him. Give him another 15 years, and shift him to the \u2018Cross \u2026\u201d Firstly, I\u2019ll pay that. Secondly, playing lookalikes is not low rent at all. The day I unleashed Mitch Johnson-Dave Grohl on a crowded room, it went down like a cruise missile. The end is nigh. Pakistan have showed some fight, but when you give a team like Australia a 15-length start you\u2019re playing a game of catch-up that cannot be won. Like Thanos, the result of this match was likely inevitable from the moment Dave Warner\u2019s eye was in. 80th over: Pakistan 229-8 (Rizwan 40) Rizwan hands over the strike with a single off Lyon\u2019s first ball (hmmm!) and Shaheen can\u2019t resist one of good length outside off, but he gets little of his slog and does no more than find Hazlewood running in from long off. That\u2019s Lyon\u2019s 16th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. All five have fallen his way today. And that is dinner. 79th over: Pakistan 228-7 (Rizwan 39, Shaheen 1) Starc again but again no breakthrough for the quick. One more over before the new ball is due. 78th over: Pakistan 227-7 (Rizwan 38, Shaheen 1) Lyon, a fifth wicket in the crosshairs, gets Shaheen on strike with two balls remaining but the No.9 shows decent defensive technique to keep him at bay. Taking you back a few overs now, but Dave Arthur pondered thus: \u201cI wonder how many times a #6 of the team batting first has not got a hit in a result match? Wouldn\u2019t be often!\u201d I put that to Ric Finlay, someone much more knowledgeable than I, and he came back with: \u201cFor Aus, never happened before.\u201d So there you have it. Rare indeed. 77th over: Pakistan 226-7 (Rizwan 37, Shaheen 1) Starc now on for Cummins, the new ball available three overs after this one. Full and straight, Shaheen survives an appeal for leg before (going down leg, just) before managing to keep out a yorker that has designs on uprooting all three stumps. Maiden over from Starc to the tailender. 76th over: Pakistan 226-7 (Rizwan 37, Shaheen 1) Lyon traps Yasir in front, back in the crease, and his appeal for leg before is readily upheld by umpire Illingworth. Yasir asks for a review but that is plumb. On your way, son. Lyon coming into his own on this flat fourth-day pitch. That\u2019s four wickets now in this dig for Gaz, all taken today. Rizwan finishes the over with a heave over midwicket for four. 75th over: Pakistan 221-6 (Rizwan 33, Yasir 10) Cummins again, this time with a leg gully in place. No doubt Rizwan is still hurting after that blow to the armpit (you don\u2019t write that often) and no doubt he\u2019s expecting more chin music. Three from the over, all from Lyon, and a bit ineffectual from Cummins. Tiring perhaps? 74th over: Pakistan 218-6 (Rizwan 33, Yasir 10) Lyon continues. Nice air and turn, but these two are prepared to defend and work him around the wicket for ones and twos. Four from the over. Dave Arthur writes in with this: \u201cHi Scott, I wonder how many times a #6 of the team batting first has not got a hit in a result match? Wouldn\u2019t be often!\u201d Hi Dave. Not often but I\u2019m tipping it\u2019s happened more often than you think. I\u2019ve consulted the one and only Ric Finlay to see if he has the answer. Watch this space. 73rd over: Pakistan 214-6 (Rizwan 32, Yasir 7) Good, hostile short bowling from Cummins, and he thinks he\u2019s set Yasir up but the straight, full one that follows just isn\u2019t straight enough, inviting Yasir to clip him backward of square for four. For a player who\u2019s batting average prior to this Test was 12, Yasir is in fine touch. Nice bloke, too, offering Labuschagne an apology and how-are-you after clobbering a pull shot into the short leg\u2019s helmet. I\u2019d say good fielding from Labuschagne. The medicos are out but Marnus is smiling like The Joker, hopefully not from any concussion-related issues. He\u2019s fine. Not sure about his helmet, though. 72nd over: Pakistan 206-6 (Rizwan 30, Yasir 2) A maiden from Lyon and a lovely one at that, highlighted by one that straightened up and beat Rizwan\u2019s bat. Pakistan trail by by 81 runs. Here\u2019s that Cummins comet from the previous over. 71st over: Pakistan 206-6 (Rizwan 30, Yasir 2) Rizwan wears a Cummins lifter on the upper ribs, just below the armpit. Yowser. The bat immediately flies out the hand. Not surprising. The human body wasn\u2019t designed to absorb little rocks zooming at speeds of 140kph. Rizwan is stretching his arms, his torso. With a stiff upper lip, he gets off the strike with a pull shot for one. A big appeal for leg before to end the over is turned down, with no review, and Yasir survives. Yep, going down leg. 70th over: Pakistan 205-6 (Rizwan 29, Yasir 2) A single off Lyon\u2019s over. Not much to report other than with a keeper, short leg, slip and leg slip in place, the Pakistan batsmen will have plenty of hard-to-understand voices in their ears. 69th over: Pakistan 204-6 (Rizwan 28, Yasir 2) Hazlewood to Yasir, no slips but a short leg in place. The new ball not far away. Amazing, really, how little movement in the air this pink ball has offered. Hazlewood overpitches and strays too far down leg, leaving Starc to effect some sharp fielding at fine leg to save two runs. Here\u2019s Labuschagne\u2019s catch. See, I wasn\u2019t lying. He can hold onto them. 68th over: Pakistan 201-6 (Rizwan 27, Yasir 0) Labuschagne hangs onto one! Iftikar pops one up to short leg and the entire world (sort of) holds their breath as Labuschagne juggles once and then claims the catch. Yasir the new batsman. Wouldn\u2019t Pakistan like another hundred from him. Thanking you muchly, Jonathan. Some admirable fight on display here from Pakistan. We\u2019ve seen that a few times this series with their backs against the wall. Perhaps catch-up is Pakistan\u2019s game. The first box, drawing level with Australia\u2019s first-innings run orgy, is getting closer to being ticked. But, as Dave Warner and co so devastatingly illustrated, this is a ripper of a batting deck. Even on this fourth day. A little like my faith in Father Christmas, this Adelaide pitch is holding up surprisingly well. Let\u2019s see how the rest of today plays out. It\u2019s a pleasure to have your company. Get involved by emailing me or dipping into the eclectic environs of Twitter - @scott_heinrich 67th over: Pakistan 201-5 (Iftikhar 27, Rizwan 27) Hazlewood returns to plan A, the bumper barrage, but he can\u2019t find the right length, sending a couple of loopy bouncers over Rizwan\u2019s head that are easy to evade. And that\u2019s drinks. Which means it\u2019s time for Scott Heinrich to take over and for me to have a rest. Will Scott see Australia home? 66th over: Pakistan 199-5 (Iftikhar 27, Rizwan 25) Pakistan deal with the second over of Lyon\u2019s spell much more comfortably than they did the first, Rizwan sweeping smartly for two in an over worth four runs. 65th over: Pakistan 195-5 (Iftikhar 26, Rizwan 22) Apologies to Rizwan, that chance in the previous over was not actually a chance after all. Snicko confirms the ball missed the inside-edge on its way up and over the batsman\u2019s head. Hazlewood continues to probe from the other end and Australia reckon there might be a hint of reverse swing for him to exploit. It manifests in an LBW shout that\u2019s easy to decline, but still refreshing to see the ball deviate off straight for perhaps the third time this Test. 64th over: Pakistan 192-5 (Iftikhar 23, Rizwan 22) Belatedly, it\u2019s Lyon time, and his impact is almost immediate but yet another chance goes begging, this time in comical fashion. Rizwan makes a mess of his shot, scooping the ball almost directly above his head, but Paine has no idea where the ball has gone and so fails to pouch a simple chance. The close fielders all converged like a pack of seagulls after a hot chip but none were close enough to complete the dismissal. 63rd over: Pakistan 191-5 (Iftikhar 23, Rizwan 21) The first change since tea is like for like with Hazlewood replacing Cummins from the cathedral end. He reprises Cummins\u2019 early tactic of searching for the mistimed pull and he almost succeeds but Rizwan doesn\u2019t get enough bat on his swipe for it to carry to the leg-side sweeper. Iftikhar almost perishes the following ball but the inside-edge back towards his stumps from a lazy back-foot prod somehow doesn\u2019t send the bails flying. 62nd over: Pakistan 191-5 (Iftikhar 23, Rizwan 21) Starc is afforded another over but there\u2019s little to write home about, even after the big left-armer shifts from over to around the wicket. This partnership is now settled and attuned to the benign conditions. 61st over: Pakistan 188-5 (Iftikhar 23, Rizwan 18) Cummins continues for now and again Pakistan score three runs off his bowling with a back-foot squeeze behind square on the off-side. Matters are drifting again out in the middle of Adelaide Oval. 60th over: Pakistan 184-5 (Iftikhar 20, Rizwan 17) Iftikhar is happy to use the angle of Starc\u2019s stock ball from over the wicket and work it behind square on the off-side. He engineers a couple using that method before rotating strike with it shortly afterwards. After a bright start following the tea break Australia have gone a bit flat again in the field. Perhaps time for more Nathan Lyon? 59th over: Pakistan 181-5 (Iftikhar 17, Rizwan 17) Iftikhar guides Cummins smartly behind point for three but the bowler responds superbly by jagging a length delivery off the seam that prompts a full-throated but futile appeal. Cummins is bang on the money thereafter, hitting Rizwan\u2019s bat hard and causing the Pakistani keeper to skittishly look to rotate strike at every opportunity. 58th over: Pakistan 176-5 (Iftikhar 13, Rizwan 16) Livelier from Starc to begin the second over of his spell and that extra grunt beats Rizwan for pace outside his off stump. Starc retains an excellent line and length and ends a searching over with a maiden. 57th over: Pakistan 176-5 (Iftikhar 13, Rizwan 16) Cummins has the badge on the front of the Pakistan helmet in his crosshairs as he tests both batsmen with a series of short balls. Neither Iftikhar nor Rizwan can resist hooking, and neither looks especially composed, but both survive with singles down to deep square-leg. 56th over: Pakistan 173-5 (Iftikhar 12, Rizwan 14) Starc shares duties with Cummins after the tea break, perhaps surprisingly considering how effective Lyon was before the interval. He finds a tidy line and length quickly and it almost earns him a wicket but a beauty that finds the shoulder of Iftikhar\u2019s bat is dropped by Smith at second slip. That was a very tough chance, the ball dying on the diving fielder, but it\u2019s yet another life to Pakistan. Australia have been uncharacteristically generous this Test. 55th over: Pakistan 170-5 (Iftikhar 10, Rizwan 13) We\u2019re back in business after tea, and it\u2019s the far from overused Pat Cummins with the ball in his hand. Just eight overs so far this innings from the no. 1 bowler in Test cricket. Cummins\u2019 spell begins with a full half-volley that Rizwan leans into and caresses for three through the covers. An up and down session that ends with Australia edging closer to an innings victory. They bowled and fielded poorly for about 90 minutes before Nathan Lyon stepped up with a decisive intervention, spinning out the two set batsman, Shan Masood and Asad Shafiq. There\u2019s still nothing in the pitch which means it\u2019s hard work for the bowlers, especially the pacemen. We\u2019ll be back in 20 minutes or so to keep an eye on their toil. 54th over: Pakistan 167-5 (Iftikhar 10, Rizwan 10) The first well-struck shot in anger for some time sees Rizwan\u2019s score advance by four. The right-hander swept Lyon powerfully from outside off stump to behind square-leg. 53rd over: Pakistan 162-5 (Iftikhar 10, Rizwan 5) Hazlewood follows up Lyon\u2019s over with a good \u2018un of his own, hitting the bat hard from a decent length. 52nd over: Pakistan 161-5 (Iftikhar 10, Rizwan 4) Maiden from Lyon to Iftikhar. Tea on the horizon. 51st over: Pakistan 161-5 (Iftikhar 10, Rizwan 4) Hazlewood fancies the short ball to this pair of right-handers. It nearly worked in the previous over to Rizwan but this time it\u2019s Iftikhar reflex pulling just short of deep square-leg, the ball spending plenty of time in the air. 50th over: Pakistan 160-5 (Iftikhar 9, Rizwan 4) Lyon is dictating terms out there now, ripping the ball into the right-handers from around the wicket and getting serious bounce. It almost leads to another wicket but a Rizwan bat-pad flies just wide of the diving Labuschagne at short-leg. 49th over: Pakistan 159-5 (Iftikhar 8, Rizwan 4) Lyon\u2019s recall to the attack around half-an-hour ago has transformed this session. It\u2019s not been the best couple of hours of cricket in Australia\u2019s history but the off-spinner\u2019s ability to make something happen and energise his colleagues has handed his team two priceless breakthroughs. Hazlewood has been a good foil at the other end too, keeping Pakistan honest with his line and length. He\u2019s lacked Lyon\u2019s luck though, as exemplified in a wild hook from Rizwan flying safely for four behind Tim Paine when it could easily have resulted in a catch. Lyon does it again! A good duel of an over with Asad ends with the batsman tickling an inside-edge onto his thigh pad, sending the ball looping into the safe hands of David Warner at leg slip. That was Lyon\u2019s trademark overspin at work, getting the ball to bounce more than Asad expected. 47th over: Pakistan 154-4 (Asad 57, Iftikhar 7) Hazlewood beats Iftikhar\u2019s outside edge and is so excited at the sight he bellows hard and long for a catch behind. The problem is he\u2019s the only man appealing and the umpire\u2019s index finger remains curled in his fist. Decent over from the big paceman though, operating as best he can stump-to-stump with a legside field. 46th over: Pakistan 150-4 (Asad 57, Iftikhar 3) Pakistan get busy against Lyon, the two right-handers using their feet and wrists to good effect to keep the scoreboard moving. The pick of an eight-run over is a swept boundary from Asad. 45th over: Pakistan 142-4 (Asad 50, Iftikhar 2) Starc\u2019s brief and unconvincing spell is ended by the recall of Hazlewood, who is immediately in the thick of things. A rank short ball is helped around the corner by Asad but it\u2019s perilously close to Paine\u2019s dive, the third near-miss of that variety this session. That boundary takes Asad to 49 and by the end of the over he\u2019s 50, raising his bat modestly for the 25th time in Tests. 44th over: Pakistan 137-4 (Asad 45, Iftikhar 2) Tight over from Lyon, accompanied by plenty of chat among the Australian fielders. There\u2019s been a welcome rise in intensity over the past 20 minutes or so. 43rd over: Pakistan 136-4 (Asad 44, Iftikhar 2) Lovely shot for three from Asad who leans elegantly into a cover drive that is well stopped in the shadow of the sponsor\u2019s hoarding by Nathan Lyon. He picks up three more to the same fielder in the same square footage of Adelaide Oval to round the over out, this time off the back foot. Starc is still yet to fully fire in this spell, perhaps still hampered his rolled ankle yesterday evening. 42nd over: Pakistan 129-4 (Asad 38, Iftikhar 1) Lyon thinks there\u2019s a chance of a second quick wicket but Warner is wrong-footed at leg-slip and the ball passes him in the air. The signal is leg-byes though so it didn\u2019t matter. Otherwise Pakistan are happy to defend their stumps and accept the occasional single. 41st over: Pakistan 126-4 (Asad 37, Iftikhar 1) The wicket brings spearhead Starc immediately back into the attack but the big paceman is slow to get up to full speed and it\u2019s an unimpressive over largely of looseners. Brian Withington has dropped in to the the drop-in debate. \u201cI\u2019m liking Andy\u2019s suggestion of tailored drop in pitches - maybe these could include a worn day 5 option? I\u2019m reminded of the story of some of the coconut matting wickets used on the sub-continent back in the day. Apparently touring sides suspected that the tension was adjusted between innings to favour the home team spinners. Bring back the classic sticky dog uncovered wickets, I say - with sprinkler attachments.\u201d Within reason, Brian, within reason... 40th over: Pakistan 123-4 (Asad 35, Iftikhar 0) Wicket maiden for Lyon, just the fillip Australia required the game drifting. Wahey! That was a splendidly timed previous entry. The increasingly assured Shan Masood has just dumped a mistimed drive straight down Mitchell Starc\u2019s throat at mid-off. Nathan Lyon has a wicket, Australia have a gift, and Pakistan relinquish their hard-earned initiative. 39th over: Pakistan 123-3 (Shan 68, Asad 35) That\u2019s the 100 partnership for Shan Masood and Asad Shafiq, and it is one that is looking increasingly assured. 38th over: Pakistan 117-3 (Shan 67, Asad 33) Asad has some craft at the crease and he shows his deftness to work Lyon for three down to fine-leg. Australia still going through the motions with a lack of intent. 37th over: Pakistan 114-3 (Shan 67, Asad 30) Labuschagne remains in the attack. \u201cNot sure Australia should be persisting with this bowling partnership,\u201d remarks Damien Fleming on the telly. By contrast, Pakistan are quite happy with the current state of affairs, and they advance their score by four singles in an over lacking incident. 36th over: Pakistan 110-3 (Shan 65, Asad 28) A bit more life in Lyon\u2019s first over after drinks, one featuring a couple of optimistic appeals for bat-pad catches. Asad and Shan prevail though as they have all afternoon so far. 35th over: Pakistan 106-3 (Shan 64, Asad 25) For the second day in a row Marnus Labuschagne\u2019s part-time legspin is called upon early in the piece. His opening over is serviceable but unlikely to cause Pakistan any sleepless nights. Drinks arrive on the field with Australia facing some awkward questions. 34th over: Pakistan 104-3 (Shan 63, Asad 24) A relieved Lyon enjoys a rare rapid maiden that caused Asad some discomfort. Andy\u2019s back to keep the conversation about drop-ins going. \u201cYou may be right regarding pitches; can\u2019t put the chicken back in the egg and all that. So maybe the push should be to make drop in pitches with variation \u2013 maybe a different character for each venue? What we have may be functional but it is so obviously not perfect. Maybe CA should hint that they would be open to procuring pitches from someone who can develop something a little less \u201csamey\u201d? Or even fund some R&amp;D to make a better product? They themselves would be the beneficiaries after all; better viewing spectacle, better attendance, better for skill development for both Shield and the international team. So JH, you with me? Let\u2019s get into them and tell them to pull out their cheque book for improved drop-ins!\u201d Ha! I like the passion Andy. To be fair to CA I think the standard of drop-ins is improving. For example, I think the MCG surface on Boxing Day this year should be the best we\u2019ve seen in some time. Perth\u2019s new drop-in is ok, and Adelaide\u2019s hasn\u2019t been that bad since the change. This one would be fine if was showing signs of deterioration. 33rd over: Pakistan 104-3 (Shan 63, Asad 24) 100 up for Pakistan and the milestone is achieved in nail-biting fashion. For the second time today Shan fails to connect with a pull and gloves down the legside, but for the second time today the ball flies agonisingly out of reach of Paine\u2019s dive. Hazlewood is going through his full deck of variations now, slower balls, cutters, knuckle balls and bouncers. This is not a fun day to be a fast bowler. 32nd over: Pakistan 98-3 (Shan 57, Asad 24) Shan has scored freely off Lyon today and that pattern continues when he slaps a long-hop through point. He nurdles another single before Asad picks up the baton, sneaking a couple courtesy of another example of Australia\u2019s lackadaisical fielding then smashing Lyon over long-off for four. 31st over: Pakistan 87-3 (Shan 52, Asad 18) Hazlewood provides an excellent measure of the conditions because he is so consistent on all surfaces around the world. Today his conventional line and length is so unthreatening Asad is able to watch the bowler\u2019s arm come over, count the leaves on the Moreton Bay figs next to the scoreboard, lean forward with the full face of the bat presented and calmly jog two runs. An hour gone and Australia\u2019s brains trust will be scratching their heads. 30th over: Pakistan 84-3 (Shan 51, Asad 16) After a sketchy few minutes to open the day Shan is now flying. He reaches his sixth Test 50 by stepping down and bullying Lyon through mid-on for four. 29th over: Pakistan 79-3 (Shan 46, Asad 16) Asad blocks a maiden over from Hazlewood. This could be a long couple of days in the field for Australia. Andy in FNQ has joined in via email. \u201cSaw the earlier comment regarding the lifeless pitch; think that this is far more of an issue than the ball. It is no accident that the Gabba is the best pitch in Australia; it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t use a drop-in pitch. These blights on Australian cricket have been shown, summer after summer, to be identical, single paced, and far too durable. They don\u2019t wear, and offer nothing for pace or spin. When are Australia\u2019s major stadiums (with Cricket Australia\u2019s support) going to stand up to the AFL and say centre wickets are coming back for good? Brisbane play at the Gabba without any issues on its centre wicket; time for the other venues to follow their great example!\u201d An admirable sentiment Andy but I think that particular genie is out of the bottle never to return. 28th over: Pakistan 79-3 (Shan 46, Asad 16) Lyon sends down the ball of the day so far, ripping one past Shan\u2019s outside edge that misses the bat by the width of a Higgs boson. Around that beauty Pakistan collect a couple of singles pretty straightforwardly. 27th over: Pakistan 77-3 (Shan 45, Asad 15) Tim Paine is really overcomplicating things this morning. Hazlewood begins his second over with an extra fielder on the legside, meaning there are four fielders either catching or saving one between square leg and mid-on. Guess what he sends down? That\u2019s right, a long-hop wide of off stump that is dismissively cut to the third-man fence by Asad. Over the past two days, save for that one spell of Starc\u2019s under lights with the new ball, Australia have bowled and fielded very poorly. They\u2019ll need to be better against New Zealand. 26th over: Pakistan 73-3 (Shan 45, Asad 11) Tighter from Lyon, getting some nice drift on his offies and tempting Asad into driving on the front foot. The batsman looks assured against the slow spin though, as you\u2019d expect from a top-order Pakistani. 25th over: Pakistan 71-3 (Shan 44, Asad 10) Double change for Australia with Hazlewood replacing Cummins from the cathedral end. Shan is now determined to attack, regardless of who happens to be bowling, pulling firmly well in front of square to a short ball. Australia\u2019s tactics to him so far today have been questionable - too short and straight - and Ricky Ponting on TV has had enough. What\u2019s wrong with the top of off, he asks forlornly. 24th over: Pakistan 66-3 (Shan 39, Asad 10) Spin for the first time today with Lyon replacing Starc and giving Shan something new to consider from the river end. He spends all of three balls in a state of contemplation, then he skips down the track and deposits a testosterone fuelled six over the bowler\u2019s head like it\u2019s payday in the IPL not a 180-over vigil to scrape a draw. Tremendous fun. 23rd over: Pakistan 59-3 (Shan 33, Asad 9) It\u2019s a battle of wills between the right-handers Cummins and Asad in these early exchanges. The bowler is finding a consistent line and length, keeping the batsman pinned to his crease, but Asad holds his nerve and finally drops the ball into a gap to collect his first run of the day. Following that wake-up call form Starc Shan is now motoring. He backs up his consecutive fours from the previous over with a lovely checked off-drive for two, then a glance off his hip for one more. 22nd over: Pakistan 55-3 (Shan 30, Asad 8) Starc again focuses on Shan\u2019s stumps, and it almost pays dividends when the left-hander aims an uppish drive in the direction of the two catchers at short midwicket, but fortunately for Pakistan the stroke is so mistimed it doesn\u2019t carry on the full. Shan is even more fortunate a couple of balls later when he gloves a pull down the legside that lands just wide of the diving Paine. It appears that let-off sparks something in the opener because he then smashes consecutive boundaries, both pulls through midwicket, the second of which is sweetly timed. A curious over. 21st over: Pakistan 45-3 (Shan 20, Asad 8) Cummins is proving difficult to get away with his angle into the right-handed Asad from over the wicket. The pressure almost induces an error when Asad under-edges a square cut in the direction of his stumps but there\u2019 no harm done. 20th over: Pakistan 45-3 (Shan 20, Asad 8) Starc is persisting with that straight line of attack to Shan, preying on the batsman\u2019s tendency to drive with a closed bat face. Despite a couple of catchers stationed in the same short midwicket region Shan still manages to work a couple of runs into the legside. 19th over: Pakistan 43-3 (Shan 18, Asad 8) Just the single to document from an over of Cummins deliveries on a tight line and length to Shan. \u201cIf Australia were playing a more resilient opponent who also scored 400+ in an innings, would we be saying this is an awful pitch and something should be done about it?\u201d asks Murray Henman. \u201cI\u2019m also wondering whether this question also applies to the Gabba?\u201d Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. This is a lifeless pitch that has shown little sign of deteriorating, exacerbated by a lifeless ball that has shown no indication it wants to travel any direction other than gun barrel straight. In defence of the Adelaide Oval curator he might have expected the pink ball to do much more under lights than it has, and therefore prepared a surface to even out the balance somewhat. But regardless, the outcome has been disappointing. 18th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Shan 17, Asad 8) Mitchell Starc with the first full over of the day, the left-armer loping in from the river end, targeting the left-handed Shan Masood\u2019s stumps with a field inviting a tighter line than perhaps we\u2019ve become accustomed to. Inevitably that means Starc leaks onto Shan\u2019s pads and Pakistan work their first runs of the day through square-leg. 17th over: Pakistan 39-3 (Shan 14, Asad 8) Asad Shafiq props forward and defends the final ball from the Pat Cummins over that began yesterday evening. We are away! The players are making their way out into the middle. Day four will be up and running imminently. There\u2019s some cricket happening just across the ditch too, where England have given themselves a sniff of an unlikely victory. Do you want something meaty to chew on in the minutes leading up to the first ball of the day? Well, sink your teeth into this Geoff Lemon classic on David Warner\u2019s 335. Pitch: The Adelaide Oval surface has been dull for three days and there\u2019s little indication that\u2019s going to change today. Missed what happened yesterday? Catch up on all the action, including Yasir Shah\u2019s sparkling century, right here. Weather: The good news is it\u2019s dry in Adelaide and forecast to remain so for the rest of the day. However it is cool (top of 17C) and there is a gusty souwesterly keeping the flags afluttering on top of the famous old scoreboard. Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the fourth day of the second Test between Australia and Pakistan from Adelaide Oval. Once again play will get underway half-an-hour earlier than scheduled to make up overs lost to rain. That means today\u2019s session times are as follows (in AEDT): 2pm-4.30pm | 4.50pm-6.50pm | 7.30pm-9.30pm. Australia will be disappointed if the match progresses deep into the floodlit portion of the day. Just seven Pakistan wickets are required to complete an innings victory, and with Babar Azam already dismissed, there is little to concern the hungry home attack. Although that may be being unfairly dismissive of first-innings centurion Yasir Shah, who was by some margin Sunday\u2019s star performer.

      "body": "<h2>1) Zaha and Palace moving in right direction</h2> \n<p>After a medley of mid-table finishes, could this be the season Crystal Palace return to the top half? They finished 10th four years ago under Alan Pardew and after victory at Burnley are part of a chasing pack on the tails of fifth-placed Tottenham. The win stopped a worrying rot of five games without victory and, with Wilfried Zaha having come to the fore in recent outings, there is plenty for a painfully inconsistent Palace to build on. December looks kind, too, with Bournemouth the visitors to Selhurst Park on Tuesday before matches against Watford, Brighton, Newcastle, West Ham and Southampton. After a quiet start Zaha, who has scored in successive games, is beginning to take centre stage, which is right where Palace need him. \u201cHe has been very good in recent games,\u201d Roy Hodgson said. \u201cWe are grateful for the three points but now we need to use this feeling going forwards.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher </strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/30/burnley-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Burnley 0-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2019/dec/01/the-dozen-the-weekends-best-premier-league-photos\">The Dozen: the weekend\u2019s best Premier League photos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Chelsea miss Abraham\u2019s mobility</h2> \n<p>Expect Tammy Abraham to walk straight back into the Chelsea team if he has recovered from a hip injury in time to face Aston Villa on Wednesday. They were clueless in attack during the home defeat by West Ham and badly missed Abraham\u2019s mobility up front. Olivier Giroud started for the first time since August and a laboured performance from the striker could persuade Frank Lampard to sell him next month. However, Chelsea\u2019s squad is not deep. Lampard made five changes after the draining draw with Valencia but it was a muddled display. Pedro, another who could be allowed to leave, struggled after being handed a rare start and it was surprising Michy Batshuayi stayed on the bench when Chelsea, who finished with the diminutive Christian Pulisic playing through the middle, were chasing an equaliser. Lampard needs Abraham back. <strong>Jacob Steinberg </strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/30/chelsea-west-ham-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Chelsea 0-1 West Ham</a></em></p> \n<h2>3) Everton have the players but not the finish</h2> \n<p>Whatever the future of Marco Silva, Everton are not a team bereft of talent. Djibril Sidib\u00e9, playing as a wing-back, supplied the excellent cross from which Richarlison scored a diving header of which Andy Gray and Graeme Sharp, the strike partnership of the club\u2019s 1980s golden era, would have been proud. And the Brazilian goalscorer maintained his threat right up to the point Leicester stole the game with Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s late winner. Moise Kean\u2019s brief cameo started with an improvised chip that had Kasper Schmeichel beaten and scrabbling. Alex Iwobi played a second-half crossfield pass of wonderful vision amid other flashes of creativity. James Maddison, Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes were kept unusually quiet by the midfield endeavour of Tom Davies and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Defeat, though, came when concentration dropped. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/01/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Leicester 2-1 Everton</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f872a878fa4e08fad4463a758e161ed70bc303c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f872a878fa4e08fad4463a758e161ed70bc303c/0_148_5157_3094/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moise Kean brought a brief spark to proceedings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moise Kean brought a brief spark to proceedings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony McArdle - Everton FC/Everton FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Liverpool the set-piece kings</h2> \n<p>Graham Potter\u2019s analysis of defeat at Anfield nailed the simple truth that Liverpool are impossible to stop. Brighton matched the Premier League leaders in open play but were powerless to prevent them making it 40 set-piece goals since the start of last season \u2013 nine more than Bournemouth in second. \u201cYou can be good in 90% of the pitch but if you are not good in that part they can do all sorts of things to hurt you,\u201d the Brighton manager said. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably got the best deliverer of the ball and the best attacker of the ball in the world.\u201d He was referring to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk. J\u00fcrgen Klopp said: \u201cI am not so silly that I say I only want to see a game where I only see \u2018blitz\u2019 football. A lot of teams sit back, especially in the last one and a half years, so we have to play around that wall.

Jack Grealish is no Cristiano Ronaldo but it says a fair bit about Manchester United\u2019s last decade that they are now playing the role of hapless bruisers. As for the Aston Villa man, the fact he is the Premier League\u2019s most fouled player \u2013 and by an astonishing distance \u2013 is a reflection of defenders\u2019 inability to deal with him legally.

      "bodyText": "1) Zaha and Palace moving in right direction After a medley of mid-table finishes, could this be the season Crystal Palace return to the top half? They finished 10th four years ago under Alan Pardew and after victory at Burnley are part of a chasing pack on the tails of fifth-placed Tottenham. The win stopped a worrying rot of five games without victory and, with Wilfried Zaha having come to the fore in recent outings, there is plenty for a painfully inconsistent Palace to build on. December looks kind, too, with Bournemouth the visitors to Selhurst Park on Tuesday before matches against Watford, Brighton, Newcastle, West Ham and Southampton. After a quiet start Zaha, who has scored in successive games, is beginning to take centre stage, which is right where Palace need him. \u201cHe has been very good in recent games,\u201d Roy Hodgson said. \u201cWe are grateful for the three points but now we need to use this feeling going forwards.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Burnley 0-2 Crystal Palace 2) Chelsea miss Abraham\u2019s mobility Expect Tammy Abraham to walk straight back into the Chelsea team if he has recovered from a hip injury in time to face Aston Villa on Wednesday. They were clueless in attack during the home defeat by West Ham and badly missed Abraham\u2019s mobility up front. Olivier Giroud started for the first time since August and a laboured performance from the striker could persuade Frank Lampard to sell him next month. However, Chelsea\u2019s squad is not deep. Lampard made five changes after the draining draw with Valencia but it was a muddled display. Pedro, another who could be allowed to leave, struggled after being handed a rare start and it was surprising Michy Batshuayi stayed on the bench when Chelsea, who finished with the diminutive Christian Pulisic playing through the middle, were chasing an equaliser. Lampard needs Abraham back. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 0-1 West Ham 3) Everton have the players but not the finish Whatever the future of Marco Silva, Everton are not a team bereft of talent. Djibril Sidib\u00e9, playing as a wing-back, supplied the excellent cross from which Richarlison scored a diving header of which Andy Gray and Graeme Sharp, the strike partnership of the club\u2019s 1980s golden era, would have been proud. And the Brazilian goalscorer maintained his threat right up to the point Leicester stole the game with Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s late winner. Moise Kean\u2019s brief cameo started with an improvised chip that had Kasper Schmeichel beaten and scrabbling. Alex Iwobi played a second-half crossfield pass of wonderful vision amid other flashes of creativity. James Maddison, Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes were kept unusually quiet by the midfield endeavour of Tom Davies and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Defeat, though, came when concentration dropped. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Leicester 2-1 Everton 4) Liverpool the set-piece kings Graham Potter\u2019s analysis of defeat at Anfield nailed the simple truth that Liverpool are impossible to stop. Brighton matched the Premier League leaders in open play but were powerless to prevent them making it 40 set-piece goals since the start of last season \u2013 nine more than Bournemouth in second. \u201cYou can be good in 90% of the pitch but if you are not good in that part they can do all sorts of things to hurt you,\u201d the Brighton manager said. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably got the best deliverer of the ball and the best attacker of the ball in the world.\u201d He was referring to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk. J\u00fcrgen Klopp said: \u201cI am not so silly that I say I only want to see a game where I only see \u2018blitz\u2019 football. A lot of teams sit back, especially in the last one and a half years, so we have to play around that wall. There are different ways to finish a game off.\u201d Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Brighton 5) Grealish takes the hits from United\u2019s bruisers Old Trafford was treated to a familiar sight in the opening 10 minutes, as a spindly, cocksure attacking midfielder was kicked from pillar to post by brutish opponents before responding with a wondrous goal. Jack Grealish is no Cristiano Ronaldo but it says a fair bit about Manchester United\u2019s last decade that they are now playing the role of hapless bruisers. As for the Aston Villa man, the fact he is the Premier League\u2019s most fouled player \u2013 and by an astonishing distance \u2013 is a reflection of defenders\u2019 inability to deal with him legally. The 24-year-old would be wise, though, to think twice when the heavyweights inevitably come calling. The opponents he played against on Sunday, who included Juan Mata, Fred and Luke Shaw, offer all the evidence he needs about the power of a big move to derail a decent career. Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 2-2 Aston Villa 6) Shelvey too sharp for Manchester City Before kick-off a plane flew over St James\u2019 Park trailing a banner urging everyone to Vote Brexit Party and, perhaps warming to the election theme, Pep Guardiola\u2019s post-match message was similarly unconvincing. \u201cWe played so good,\u201d said City\u2019s manager, applying the sort of spin capable of making even a politician blush. In reality his side were always vulnerable to Newcastle\u2019s counterattacking pace and had no excuses when the former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey quite possibly handed his old club the title after being left unmarked as Christian Atsu shaped to take a late free-kick before pulling the ball back for Shelvey to equalise. \u201cI\u2019d love to say it was due to wonderful training-ground coaching,\u201d Steve Bruce said, \u201cbut Jonjo saw City had nobody on the edge of the box, which is very rare for teams these days, and had a word with Christian.\u201d Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 2-2 Manchester City 7) VAR becomes the fans\u2019 opera Talking about VAR: fine.

Hasenh\u00fcttl said Saturday was not the time to berate his players\u2019 worrying first-half performance but if his side can replicate the kind of urgency they displayed in the later stages of their first home win since April then they will give themselves a fighting chance.

      "bodyText": "In 10 weeks\u2019 time Joe Biden will lay \u201cJoe\u2019s vision for America\u201d at the feet of Iowa\u2019s caucus-goers in the hope that the first voters in the Democratic presidential race will put him on the road to the White House. Among his promises is that he will fix the student loan crisis saddling 45 million Americans with crippling debt now totalling a staggering $1.5tn. One idea is to allow people struggling to repay private student loans owed to banks and credit card companies to discharge them in bankruptcy. The pledge is one of the most striking policies on offer from Democratic candidates in the 2020 race, given how the problem Biden now proposes to resolve came about in the first place. Private student loans were largely stripped of bankruptcy protections in 2005 in a congressional move that had the devastating impact of tripling such debt over a decade and locking in millions of Americans to years of grueling repayments. The Republican-led bill tightened the bankruptcy code, unleashing a huge giveaway to lenders at the expense of indebted student borrowers. At the time it faced vociferous opposition from 25 Democrats in the US Senate. But it passed anyway, with 18 Democratic senators breaking ranks and casting their vote in favor of the bill. Of those 18, one politician stood out as an especially enthusiastic champion of the credit companies who, as it happens, had given him hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions \u2013 Joe Biden. Roots of the student loan crisis Student debt has become a hot-button issue on the Democratic campaign trail. Candidates are vying to position themselves as having the most radical solution to the crisis, which now holds more than one in three young adults in its grip as well as 3 million Americans beyond the age of 60 still laboring to honor college loans they took out decades ago. More than 1 million people default on their student loans every year. By 2023 the proportion of borrowers falling behind with repayments is expected to reach 40% \u2013 puncturing a massive hole in the system. But very little discussion has been devoted to how this monumental disaster came about. How was it, for instance, that the sum of outstanding educational loans borrowed from private financial entities shot up from $56bn in 2005 to $150bn in just 10 years \u2013 contributing to an overall student debt burden second in the US only to home mortgages. Until 2005, private student loans were eligible for bankruptcy protections just like other forms of private credit. But in that year Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, a law that made it vastly more difficult for struggling former students to rebuild their lives by discharging the debts and starting over. Earlier this year, Biden tried to justify his backing of the 2005 act. His campaign spokesman told Politico that \u201cknowing that the bill was likely to make it through the Republican-led Congress, he worked to moderate the bankruptcy bill and protect middle class families. He believed that if you have income and consumer debts you can pay, you should agree to a repayment plan that you can afford.\u201d Dig into the record, and you find a more complicated story that puts Biden in a less flattering posture. His offer to the caucus-goers of Iowa when they gather on 3 February is in effect that he will reverse a damaging provision that in 2005 he himself voted through. Despite his protestations, it is indisputable that Biden was an avid supporter of the 2005 bill as a whole and of its overall thrust of tightening up the bankruptcy code largely to the benefit of lenders at the expense of distressed families who would find it harder to file for bankruptcy. \u201cBiden was one of the most powerful people who could have said no, who could have changed this.

The book will be appreciated by its readers precisely because it resists false notes. It was clear from Say Something Back (2016), Riley\u2019s unforgettable poetry collection, which included a poem about the death of her son, that she has, emotionally, perfect pitch. It was apparent, too, that she is an out-of-the-ordinary narrator \u2013 approaching her son\u2019s tragedy crab-wise. It is only halfway through this new book that we learn that Jake was found dead in a still-running bath, having possibly died of a heart attack. These facts are offered not to satisfy our anxious curiosity but noted almost incidentally as Riley pores over his autopsy, wondering whether she might have prevented his death.

Before the start of a critical conference on the climate crisis on Monday, he said the world had the technical and economic means to halt climate chaos, but what was missing was political will. \u201cThe technologies that are necessary to make this possible are already available. Signals of hope are multiplying. Public opinion is waking up everywhere. Young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation. [But we need] political will to put a price on carbon, political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels [and start] taxing pollution instead of people.\u201d Guterres called for further investment from rich countries and support for poor nations to make the changes needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of global heating. Amid rising temperatures, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts and floods, the danger signals were clear and must be acted on without further delay, he said. \u201cIn the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments \u2013 particularly from the main emitters \u2013 to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\u201d He was joined in his call by the leaders and representatives of some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, which are suffering most from climate change. The countries most at risk of deluge from climate chaos have issued an impassioned plea to the industrialised world ahead of crucial negotiations on the Paris agreement that start on Monday in Madrid. \u201cWe see [these talks] as the last opportunity to take decisive action,\u201d Janine Felson, deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) told the Guardian. \u201cAnything short of vastly greater commitment to emission reduction, a new climate finance goal and tangible support for disaster risk reduction will signal a willingness to accept catastrophe.\u201d Pacific atolls and other low-lying islands are likely to be inundated if temperatures rise to more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels, while current Paris commitments put the world on track for a \u201cdisastrous\u201d 3C. \u201cWe are mired in a planetary emergency of existential proportion,\u201d said the leaders of the 44 states of AOSIS, in a joint statement. \u201cThe impacts are real and current for people living on small islands. This does not have to be our destiny or legacy.\u201d While small islands are at greatest risk, rich countries were also suffering, said Clarence Samuel, lead negotiator for the Marshall Islands. \u201cNone of us are immune,\u201d he said. \u201cAll month we have watched in horror as our Pacific cousins Australia have literally watched their country burn, fuelled by a climate crisis of our own making.\u201d To fulfil the Paris goals, far tougher targets on emissions are needed, while this year\u2019s negotiations \u2013 known as COP25, running from 2 December to 13 December \u2013 will focus on technical issues such as a mechanism for trading carbon within the Paris agreement. Resolving these technicalities will allow the UN to wrap up the Paris \u201crulebook\u201d, setting out how to measure and achieve emissions cuts, but experts are concerned that it leaves too little time for the substantive question of targets, which under the rules must be resolved by the end of 2020.

Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.</p> <h2><strong>What is special about the meetings?</strong></h2> <p>The COPs, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which can be frustrating and means some countries \u2013 notably Saudi Arabia \u2013 can act as a drag on more ambitious action, but gives COP decisions global authority.</p> <p>Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty and no country has yet opted to withdraw from it. That includes the US, which is in the process of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\" title=\"\">withdrawing from the Paris accord</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Remind me \u2013 what was agreed at Paris?</strong></h2> <p>Under the landmark 2015 agreement, nations committed to holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.

These are known as nationally defined contributions which will have to be ratcheted up next year if the aims of Paris are to be met.</p> <h2><strong>Who will be the disruptors</strong><strong>?</strong></h2> <p>So far, the US has played a low-key role in the UN climate process under Donald Trump, but that could change to more damaging obstruction. \u201cAs in years past, the US plans to send an interagency delegation. The US delegation will engage in negotiations to protect US interest and level the playing field for US businesses,\u201d the state department said. Other potential obstructors include big oil powers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, as well as Brazil and Bolivia. Key to progress at COP are China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, and India, whose emissions are rapidly rising.</p> <h2><strong>Isn\u2019t China the new </strong><strong>green leader?</strong></h2> <p>China has been working hard to cut emissions, not least from the coal-fired power plants that have generated widespread air pollution. But new research from Global Energy Monitor has found that the country has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/china-appetite-for-coal-power-stations-returns-despite-climate-pledge-capacity\" title=\"\">increased its coal-burning capacity</a> by more than 40GW in the 18 months to June, and plans more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f288f9cd87174d41bd47a5a5d6b2ec894bf544f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f288f9cd87174d41bd47a5a5d6b2ec894bf544f9/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man tends to vegetables as emissions rise from cooling towers at a coal-fired power station in Tongling, Anhui province, China\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man tends to vegetables as emissions rise from cooling towers at a coal-fired power station in Tongling, Anhui province, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christine Shearer, an analyst at the NGO, said: \u201cChina\u2019s proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet.\u201d China is also funding the building of new coal-fired power plants elsewhere, including in South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p> <h2><strong>What will be decided this year?</strong></h2> <p>The main subject up for discussion is a provision in the Paris agreement known as article 6, which allows for the use of a global market in carbon to help countries cut emissions and to fund measures that reduce emissions in developing countries.</p> <p>Carbon markets have been around since the 1997 Kyoto protocol. The broad idea is that rich countries could meet their targets by buying carbon credits that were awarded to projects reducing emissions in the developing world. In this way, rich nations bought themselves time, and poorer nations got cash to help them on the road to a green future. But the mechanism had basic flaws \u2013 with too many easy credits devaluing the system.</p> <p>The financial crisis of 2008 led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/10/global-carbon-trading-system\" title=\"\">outright collapse of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/10/global-carbon-trading-system\" title=\"\">carbon market</a>. It has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/22/carbon-markets-back-from-the-brink-of-collapse-says-world-bank\" title=\"\">never fully recovered</a>, and today projects to cut carbon in developing countries are more likely to rely on conventional fundraising or overseas aid.</p> <p>Reviving the carbon markets through article 6 is seen as a worthy aim by many involved in climate finance. Trading could also help raise funds to prevent deforestation.</p> <p>For some campaigners, however, the markets are a scam aimed at allowing rich countries to get away with continuing to burn fossil fuels while paying poor countries to clean up. \u201cWe do not have the luxury of talking about carbon offsets, we need absolute emissions cuts now. Offsetting is unacceptable in the face of the scale and pace of emissions reductions required, and we will oppose the creation of a new global carbon market,\u201d says Juan Pablo Osornio of Greenpeace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dab3808639eee8c1d780406286c75613b2996180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dab3808639eee8c1d780406286c75613b2996180/0_0_3741_2494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trees in the nursery at the Instituto Terra in Aimor\u00e9s, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trees in the nursery at the Instituto Terra in Aimor\u00e9s, Brazil.

Cooperation among developed and developing countries is crucial, in his view. By funding, using and sharing technologies and methods of bringing down emissions in the developing world, rich countries are helping solve a crucial part of the global problem.</p> <p>However, he agrees that \u201cno deal on article 6 is better than a bad deal\u201d, and some countries are in danger of undermining the discussions by insisting on rule changes. Brazil, for instance, is accused of seeking double counting of its forests, by being allowed to count its tree cover towards its commitments to cut emissions under Paris, while also seeking to sell to other countries carbon credits received for keeping its forests standing.</p> <p>This sets the scene for a bitter fight over article 6, which would endanger the delicate consensus achieved at Paris, and that must be preserved if countries are to fulfil the aims of Paris by ratcheting up their commitments to bring down emissions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Climate%20finance&amp;description=Reducing%20emissions%2C%20and%20adapting%20the%20world%20to%20warmer%20temperatures%2C%20will%20take%20%3Cstrong%3Evast%20amounts%20of%20money%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20But%20climate%20finance%20%E2%80%93%20investment%20devoted%20to%20cutting%20greenhouse%20gases%20and%20developing%20resilience%20-%20suffered%20a%20surprise%20fall%20last%20year%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Climate%20Policy%20Initiative.%20Global%20investment%20tumbled%20by%2011%25%20from%20%24612bn%20in%202018%20to%20%24546bn.%20CPI%20said%20the%20fall%20was%20less%20significant%20when%20seen%20as%20part%20of%20a%20broader%20rising%20trend%20over%20the%20last%20few%20years%2C%20because%20an%20uneven%20pipeline%20of%20big%20projects%20mean%20the%20flow%20is%20lumpy%20and%20can%20vary%20from%20year%20to%20year.%20The%20average%20investment%20for%202017%20and%202018%20was%2025%25%20higher%20than%20for%20the%20period%202015%20and%202016.%20%3Cstrong%3EBarbara%20Buchner%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2C%20executive%20director%20of%20climate%20finance%20at%20CPI%2C%20says%3A%20%E2%80%9CGiven%20the%20urgency%20of%20the%20climate%20challenge%2C%20it%20is%20a%20positive%20sign%20that%20we%20have%20passed%20the%20half%20trillion%20dollar%20mark%20of%20investment%20towards%20climate%20change%20activities.%20%5BBut%20current%20investment%5D%20is%20simply%20not%20enough%2C%20especially%20as%20investment%20in%20polluting%20industries%20continue%20to%20effectively%20cancel%20out%20these%20efforts%20to%20address%20climate%20change.%20Leaders%20should%20be%20focused%20on%20total%20economic%20transformation.%E2%80%9D%0A%0A&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"box 1\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Climate%20finance&description=Reducing%20emissions%2C%20and%20adapting%20the%20world%20to%20warmer%20temperatures%2C%20will%20take%20%3Cstrong%3Evast%20amounts%20of%20money%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20But%20climate%20finance%20%E2%80%93%20investment%20devoted%20to%20cutting%20greenhouse%20gases%20and%20developing%20resilience%20-%20suffered%20a%20surprise%20fall%20last%20year%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Climate%20Policy%20Initiative.%20Global%20investment%20tumbled%20by%2011%25%20from%20%24612bn%20in%202018%20to%20%24546bn.%20CPI%20said%20the%20fall%20was%20less%20significant%20when%20seen%20as%20part%20of%20a%20broader%20rising%20trend%20over%20the%20last%20few%20years%2C%20because%20an%20uneven%20pipeline%20of%20big%20projects%20mean%20the%20flow%20is%20lumpy%20and%20can%20vary%20from%20year%20to%20year.%20The%20average%20investment%20for%202017%20and%202018%20was%2025%25%20higher%20than%20for%20the%20period%202015%20and%202016.%20%3Cstrong%3EBarbara%20Buchner%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2C%20executive%20director%20of%20climate%20finance%20at%20CPI%2C%20says%3A%20%E2%80%9CGiven%20the%20urgency%20of%20the%20climate%20challenge%2C%20it%20is%20a%20positive%20sign%20that%20we%20have%20passed%20the%20half%20trillion%20dollar%20mark%20of%20investment%20towards%20climate%20change%20activities.%20%5BBut%20current%20investment%5D%20is%20simply%20not%20enough%2C%20especially%20as%20investment%20in%20polluting%20industries%20continue%20to%20effectively%20cancel%20out%20these%20efforts%20to%20address%20climate%20change.%20Leaders%20should%20be%20focused%20on%20total%20economic%20transformation.%E2%80%9D%0A%0A&link=false\">box 1</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>So, one article and we\u2019re good?</strong></h2> <p>There are far bigger issues hanging over COP, but they will not be decided this year, just hinted at. The biggest alarm is that the aspiration set in Paris to constrain temperature rises will require unprecedented efforts to achieve. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/30/worlds-climate-pledges-likely-to-lead-to-less-than-3c-of-warming-un\" title=\"\">individual country commitments</a> to steer the world towards that best-case scenario were not part of the binding Paris deal, but contained in a non-binding addition.</p> <p>So emissions are increasing again, temperatures are higher than ever, countries are not mandated by law to act \u2013 and time is running out: the IPCC concluded that on current rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">we have little over a decade</a> to halt emissions growth and bring down carbon rapidly to keep warming within the 1.5C threshold.</p> <p>Current commitments made by national governments under the Paris agreement fall far short of what is required \u2013 taken together, they would still condemn the world to an estimated temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of the century. According to the UN\u2019s latest \u201cemissions gap\u201d report, published a few days before the start of this year\u2019s talks, countries must reduce their greenhouse gases by about 7.6% a year for the next 10 years, to stay within the 1.5C limit. Closing that gap will be COP26\u2019s biggest task.</p> <h2><strong>Wait \u2013 there\u2019s another one after this?</strong></h2> <p>Every year, alas. To meet the Paris objectives, it is clear the national targets must be revised upwards, and the deadline for that process is next year \u2013 which is also when previous targets, set at Copenhagen, expire for many countries. That makes 2020 a pivotal year for climate action.</p> <p>Arguably the most important function of this year\u2019s COP is to clear the way for the crunch summit next year, the most important meeting on the climate emergency since the Paris agreement was struck in 2015.

      "bodyText": "What is COP \u2013 and how will it help? For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to \u201cavoid dangerous climate change\u201d, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. COP stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC, and the annual meetings have swung between fractious and soporific, interspersed with moments of high drama and the occasional triumph (the Paris agreement in 2015) and disaster (Copenhagen in 2009). This year is the 25th iteration. Delegates started arriving last night for the two-week summit. Where is it happening? This year\u2019s COP has already needed a last-ditch rescue. Costa Rica wanted to host the event but lacked the resources, so Latin America\u2019s richest per-capita economy \u2013 Chile \u2013 took control. Everything was set for a December COP in Santiago, billed as \u201cthe blue COP\u201d because at long last issues about the oceans would take centre stage. But rioting in the capital and a political crisis forced the COP to be moved. The Spanish government \u2013 despite being in the throes of a general election \u2013 stepped up and offered Madrid, where this year\u2019s talks will now take place. The abrupt change of venue has caused many headaches, not least for the young campaigner Greta Thunberg, who had to hitch a lift back across the Atlantic by boat. There will be less opportunity for Latin Americans to showcase their vital role in reducing emissions, and Brazil may escape some of the attention on its recent moves to exploit the Amazon rainforest. It also means the conference will be scaled down, with room for fewer NGOs and businesses. Activists and protesters are hurriedly gearing up to make public pressure felt, and participants are hoping that the act of rescue will focus minds and lead to a spirit of cooperation. Who will be there? World leaders will not be turning up, though appearances by VIPs and celebrities cannot be ruled out. The negotiations, which run until 13 December, will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations. What is special about the meetings? The COPs, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which can be frustrating and means some countries \u2013 notably Saudi Arabia \u2013 can act as a drag on more ambitious action, but gives COP decisions global authority. Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty and no country has yet opted to withdraw from it. That includes the US, which is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord. Remind me \u2013 what was agreed at Paris? Under the landmark 2015 agreement, nations committed to holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. The vast majority of nations have now ratified the deal. Though the deal is legally binding, the commitments that countries have made to cut their emissions are not. These are known as nationally defined contributions which will have to be ratcheted up next year if the aims of Paris are to be met. Who will be the disruptors? So far, the US has played a low-key role in the UN climate process under Donald Trump, but that could change to more damaging obstruction. \u201cAs in years past, the US plans to send an interagency delegation. The US delegation will engage in negotiations to protect US interest and level the playing field for US businesses,\u201d the state department said. Other potential obstructors include big oil powers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, as well as Brazil and Bolivia. Key to progress at COP are China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, and India, whose emissions are rapidly rising. Isn\u2019t China the new green leader? China has been working hard to cut emissions, not least from the coal-fired power plants that have generated widespread air pollution. But new research from Global Energy Monitor has found that the country has increased its coal-burning capacity by more than 40GW in the 18 months to June, and plans more. Christine Shearer, an analyst at the NGO, said: \u201cChina\u2019s proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet.\u201d China is also funding the building of new coal-fired power plants elsewhere, including in South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh. What will be decided this year? The main subject up for discussion is a provision in the Paris agreement known as article 6, which allows for the use of a global market in carbon to help countries cut emissions and to fund measures that reduce emissions in developing countries. Carbon markets have been around since the 1997 Kyoto protocol. The broad idea is that rich countries could meet their targets by buying carbon credits that were awarded to projects reducing emissions in the developing world. In this way, rich nations bought themselves time, and poorer nations got cash to help them on the road to a green future. But the mechanism had basic flaws \u2013 with too many easy credits devaluing the system. The financial crisis of 2008 led to the outright collapse of the carbon market. It has never fully recovered, and today projects to cut carbon in developing countries are more likely to rely on conventional fundraising or overseas aid. Reviving the carbon markets through article 6 is seen as a worthy aim by many involved in climate finance. Trading could also help raise funds to prevent deforestation. For some campaigners, however, the markets are a scam aimed at allowing rich countries to get away with continuing to burn fossil fuels while paying poor countries to clean up. \u201cWe do not have the luxury of talking about carbon offsets, we need absolute emissions cuts now. Offsetting is unacceptable in the face of the scale and pace of emissions reductions required, and we will oppose the creation of a new global carbon market,\u201d says Juan Pablo Osornio of Greenpeace. Nat Keohane, senior vice-president at the US Environmental Defense Fund, and a former US COP delegate, rejects that analysis. \u201cIt is about cooperation \u2013 markets are cooperation, and they are a pathway to reducing emissions fast,\u201d he says. Cooperation among developed and developing countries is crucial, in his view. By funding, using and sharing technologies and methods of bringing down emissions in the developing world, rich countries are helping solve a crucial part of the global problem. However, he agrees that \u201cno deal on article 6 is better than a bad deal\u201d, and some countries are in danger of undermining the discussions by insisting on rule changes. Brazil, for instance, is accused of seeking double counting of its forests, by being allowed to count its tree cover towards its commitments to cut emissions under Paris, while also seeking to sell to other countries carbon credits received for keeping its forests standing. This sets the scene for a bitter fight over article 6, which would endanger the delicate consensus achieved at Paris, and that must be preserved if countries are to fulfil the aims of Paris by ratcheting up their commitments to bring down emissions. So, one article and we\u2019re good? There are far bigger issues hanging over COP, but they will not be decided this year, just hinted at. The biggest alarm is that the aspiration set in Paris to constrain temperature rises will require unprecedented efforts to achieve. But individual country commitments to steer the world towards that best-case scenario were not part of the binding Paris deal, but contained in a non-binding addition. So emissions are increasing again, temperatures are higher than ever, countries are not mandated by law to act \u2013 and time is running out: the IPCC concluded that on current rates we have little over a decade to halt emissions growth and bring down carbon rapidly to keep warming within the 1.5C threshold. Current commitments made by national governments under the Paris agreement fall far short of what is required \u2013 taken together, they would still condemn the world to an estimated temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of the century. According to the UN\u2019s latest \u201cemissions gap\u201d report, published a few days before the start of this year\u2019s talks, countries must reduce their greenhouse gases by about 7.6% a year for the next 10 years, to stay within the 1.5C limit. Closing that gap will be COP26\u2019s biggest task. Wait \u2013 there\u2019s another one after this? Every year, alas. To meet the Paris objectives, it is clear the national targets must be revised upwards, and the deadline for that process is next year \u2013 which is also when previous targets, set at Copenhagen, expire for many countries. That makes 2020 a pivotal year for climate action. Arguably the most important function of this year\u2019s COP is to clear the way for the crunch summit next year, the most important meeting on the climate emergency since the Paris agreement was struck in 2015. The past five years have been spent thrashing out the \u201crulebook\u201d by which Paris would be implemented, in a long series of technical discussions on issues as arcane as how carbon sinks should be accounted for. Those discussions have been necessary to deal with the bureaucratic side of this complex international treaty, but they have not addressed the central issue of what emissions reduction commitments governments are prepared to offer. COP26 will take place in Glasgow, and the UK will be charged with the vital diplomatic role of coaxing countries into the commitments needed \u2013 commitments that were so ambitious, compared with governments\u2019 meagre and sometimes reluctant offerings, that they could not be achieved in Paris five years ago. In the years since Paris, new high-carbon infrastructure such as roads, coal-fired power plants and skyscrapers have continued to be built, and new oil and gas fields opened up. In addition, governments in some countries \u2013 the US, Brazil and Australia among the major economies \u2013 have been elected which are openly hostile to climate action. This doesn\u2019t sound promising \u2026 Indeed. You could argue that three decades of negotiation have produced just one agreement to hold temperatures to a limit that is too high, and we are not even remotely on track to honour that agreement. All the hard decisions in the Paris agreement have been put off to a conference next year that might be a disaster, going on current form. Meanwhile, the Amazon is burning, bush fires are raging in Australia and America, climate chaos is causing a humanitarian disaster every week, and our global plan is to have some more meetings. And yet if we didn\u2019t have this UN process, we\u2019d have to invent it. Without it, the world would be truly adrift and fully at the mercy of individual governments and vested commercial interests. Osornio says: \u201cWhether or not the UNFCCC is adequate isn\u2019t really the point \u2013 at the moment, it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. Without [it], we would have to create another multilateral process for the world to come together and address the global climate crisis. Upholding existing multilateral processes, like the UNFCCC, helps against the rise in nationalism and isolationism already threatening international cooperation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A 15-year-old boy was told to \u201chold your dick and lift your balls up and show me your gooch\u201d and a police officer \u201cran his hands around\u201d the buttocks of a 17-year-old during two of 25 potentially illegal strip-searches conducted at an underage music festival in Sydney, an inquiry has heard. On Monday the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC) began public hearings into the strip-search of \u201cseveral young people\u201d at the Lost City Music festival, an under-18s event held in Sydney in February. The inquiry is investigating the strip-searches of three boys aged 15, 16 and 17 at the festival, none of which found any illegal drugs, as well as the \u201cgeneral question\u201d of how police exercise their strip-search powers in New South Wales. On its opening morning the counsel assisting the commission, Peggy Dwyer, told the hearing at least 30 strip-searches were conducted on minors at the festival. In NSW, officers must not conduct a strip-search outside a police station unless the urgency and seriousness of the situation requires it. In the case of minors, a parent or guardian must be present unless an immediate search is necessary to protect the person or prevent the destruction of evidence. But the inquiry heard only five of the 30 searches were conducted in the presence of a support person. In one case, the support person provided to a 13-year-old girl was herself a minor; a 17-year-old girl from the Red Frog charity. Dwyer read from statements given to the commission by all three boys, which included one by a 17-year-old who told investigators an officer had \u201cran his hands around his buttocks\u201d during a search. The use of strip search powers has been the focus of increasing scrutiny in NSW in recent months. Last month the state opposition called for a review of the legislation underpinning their use after Guardian Australia revealed police had strip-searched 122 girls, including two 12-year-olds in the past three years. On Monday a senior police officer who had worked on at least 20 music festivals said he believed the legislation was too vague on the question of what constituted serious and urgent circumstances. \u201cWhy are we even speaking about ambiguity with the legislation? It shouldn\u2019t even be there,\u201d the officer said. \u201cIt should be spelt out what seriousness and urgency is, because I\u2019m sure everyone in this room would have a different opinion.\u201d The inquiry also heard evidence that two State Emergency Services volunteers had been organised to act as independent adults for children being strip-searched at the festival. When the LECC\u2019s chief commissioner Michael Adams, QC, questioned why they were suitable a senior officer at the event said they were members of a \u201cvery reputable organisation\u201d. Adams replied: \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not part of their ordinary duties to watch naked young people be searched by police.\u201d The 15-year-old told investigators he was \u201cso nervous he was shaking\u201d during the strip-search. \u201cI mean, it was just \u2026 they all sort of like look at you and when there\u2019s like 20 faces they all turn to you in that blue uniform. Like I felt like I just done something wrong but like, I\u2019m just trying to go to a music festival,\u201d he said. Dwyer told the inquiry the 15-year-old was stopped after an indication from a drug dog. During the search, which was conducted without a parent or support person, he was told to lift his shirt and show his armpits before being asked to \u201cpull his pants down\u201d. \u201cAnd the officer told him, quote, to \u2018hold your dick and lift your balls up and show me your gooch\u2019,\u201d Dwyer told the inquiry. A gooch is a slang term for the space between the testicles and anus. Dwyer said the young person lifted his testicles and the officer \u201cbent down to have a look, approximately one metre away from him\u201d. \u201cI sort of froze for a bit I guess, like, cause \u2026 I had my shirt up and then he\u2019s like, all right now like pull your pants down,\u201d the 15-year-old said. \u201cAnd I was sort of like, just stood there for a bit like, are you sure?

During a third search, a 17-year-old was told to \u201cgrab his penis and to lift it up\u201d before a male officer allegedly \u201cinserted his hands inside\u201d his underwear, \u201cand made contact with his testicles\u201d. \u201cIt was just like checking in the undie bit. Like they were, like his hand was, like it was touching \u2019em and then he\u2019s like ... moved to see if there\u2019s like anything in the undies,\u201d the 17-year-old said in a statement to the commission\u2019s investigators. Dwyer told the inquiry it was further alleged that after touching the 17-year-old the officer \u201cmoved around behind\u201d him, \u201cplaced both hands inside [his] shorts and ran his hands around his buttocks, in a circular motion, apparently in an effort to detect if drugs were concealed there\u201d. \u201cThe officer\u2019s hands made contact on the young person\u2019s skin,\u201d Dwyer told the hearing. The hearings form part of an investigation by the watchdog into the practice of strip-searching minors, amid increasing scrutiny of the possible misuse of the controversial police power. Dwyer told the commission a strip search was \u201cby necessity a grave intrusion of a citizen\u2019s privacy and dignity\u201d. \u201cAbsent any legal justification it would constitute an assault punishable by imprisonment,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle imagination is needed to understand how stressful and potentially embarrassing a strip search may be, even for law-abiding adults. Even more so for young people with little experience of law enforcement in this context and limited understanding of their rights.\u201d Earlier public hearings in October revealed the allegedly illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival. The LECC\u2019s commissioner, Michael Adams QC, told the hearing it would also look at the \u201cgeneral question\u201d of how police were exercising their strip-search powers in NSW. \u201cIt is very likely the particular examples which the commission has identified are but examples of much wider conduct which requires attention,\u201d he said.",

Porter said he thought the call was appropriate and was so \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cbasic\u201d that he did not seek advice from his department. </li> <li><strong>Protesters converged on parliament </strong>to voice their anger at the failings <strong>of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan</strong>. Farmers were asking for a pause or scrapping of the plan, saying it has failed them and their communities, as well as the environment. The protesters reached the front door of parliament and were making themselves heard. A handful also disrupted Senate question time and were hauled out for abuse directed at agriculture minister Bridget McKenzie. </li> <li>The <strong>medevac repeal legislation</strong> came before the Senate for debate. <strong>Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally</strong> and Greens senator <strong>Nick McKim</strong> both pleaded with the crossbench to <strong>keep the medevac law,</strong> saying it was humane and saving the lives of asylum seekers. Jacqui Lambie is yet to make her position clear. </li> <li>The federal government announced <strong>a new taskforce encompassing intelligence and policing agencies to detect and disrupt foreign interference</strong>. We didn\u2019t get a lot of detail on what the taskforce will actually do, but it will involve Asio, the Australian Federal Police, Austrac, and the home affairs department, among other agencies. </li> <li>The 10-year anniversary of the defeat of Labor\u2019s <strong>carbon pollution reduction scheme</strong> prompted a day of <strong>sparring between Labor and the Greens</strong>. </li> <li>Former senator <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong> courted some controversy for his <strong>new role with Huawei</strong>, the Chinese telecommunications giant that was infamously barred from involvement with Australia\u2019s 5G network over security concerns. Xenophon spent the day defending his new client from what he said were unfair and inaccurate attacks about its links to the Chinese Communist Party. Tim Wilson, Liberal MP, said history will not look kindly on Xenophon\u2019s decision. </li> <li>Scott Morrison and foreign affairs minister Marise Payne both voiced serious concerns about the <strong>treatment of Australian citizen and author, Yang Hengjun</strong>, by the Chinese government. </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T07:15:59.449Z\">at 7.15am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de4b42b8f08dcf251b4cde2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T07:01:37.078Z\">7.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Greens are voting with the Liberals in the Senate</strong> against an urgency motion on the carbon pollution reduction scheme.

That has prompted a NSW police investigation. </li> <li>The <strong>attorney-general, Christian Porter, </strong>confirmed he was <strong>in the room with Scott Morrison when the prime minister made a call to the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller,</strong> about the investigation. Porter said Fuller knew he was on the call. </li> <li>Porter said he <strong>did not seek advice on the appropriateness of the call</strong>. He said he didn\u2019t believe it was necessary because it was so short and basic. </li> <li>The attorney-general said it was a <strong>completely appropriate call</strong> to make and attacked Labor for vexatious referrals to police. </li> <li>Labor also asked why Taylor had <strong>not properly declared interests in a company</strong> named GFA F1 Pty Ltd. Taylor said all his financial interests were properly disclosed.</li> <li>In the Senate, we had some <strong>fairly unedifying displays from protesters opposed to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan</strong>.

The bill was introduced to the Senate with <strong>the support of Labor and Centre Alliance</strong>. It would, among other things, ban payday lenders from making unsolicited offers encouraging individuals to repeatedly take out payday loans. </p> <p>The Consumer Action Law Centre\u2019s chief executive, Gerard Brody, said the bill would protect hundreds of thousands of Australians exploited by payday lenders. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a broad consensus across the community that stronger consumer protections for payday loans are needed. Why then are prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg letting payday lenders and consumer lease providers escape legislative reform?\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>The government has previously promised action to regulate the payday loan industry. A draft of small amount credit contract legislation to increase protections for vulnerable consumers was released by the government in 2017, but despite promising it would introduce the bill by the end of that year, it failed to do so.</p> <p> \u201cIn the three years that these reforms have stalled, payday lenders have profited to the tune of some $550m,\u201d Brody said. Recent data from the Stop the Debt Trap Alliance\u2019s report on payday lending uncovered a booming market, projecting that it would reach a staggering $1.7bn in gross payday lending stock by the end of this year.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-02T02:20:21.706Z\">at 2.20am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de46a398f08cd6fe586f725\"

That is to do with an intergovernmental agreement that was first struck in 1914,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said the scientifically-based basin plan was about ensuring the long-term viability of the system for all its users, and said the 12-year period leading up to its full implementation in 2024 was particularly difficult. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got this immediate pain for this long-term gain, and it\u2019s very hard to see it, particularly during drought,\u201d he said. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69726fd7ea1e954dc1313d17c1ef0f69e4834a06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69726fd7ea1e954dc1313d17c1ef0f69e4834a06/0_0_5091_3226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheep drink from a water trough after eating feed on the outskirts of the north-western New South Wales town of Boggabri, Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T22:32:48.478Z\">at 10.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de437e78f08cd6fe586f60c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T22:08:57.304Z\">10.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting tidbit about <strong>Nick Xenophon</strong>, the former crossbench senator, emerged this morning.

There\u2019s a few issues bubbling away already this morning.</p> <ul> <li>Farmers from across the Murray Darling Basin will descend on Canberra to <strong>protest against the Murray Darling Basin Plan</strong>. They say the management of water under the plan is failing farmers, communities and the environment. The protesters are calling for a royal commission into the plan. Some are calling for it to be immediately scrapped, a position that has caused a split with the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. </li> <li>The government will <strong>continue to seek the support of crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/02/jacqui-lambie-to-meet-with-the-government-on-medevac-repeal\">in its bid to repeal the medevac legislation</a>. Lambie is playing hardball. She has asked for unknown promises from the government before giving it her support. We don\u2019t know precisely what she\u2019s asked for, because she\u2019s keeping it under wraps for \u201cnational security\u201d reasons. Her vote is, of course, critical to the government getting its way. </li> <li>Speaking of those pesky crossbenchers, we\u2019re also likely to see continued fallout from One Nation\u2019s decision to <strong>deny the government passage of its union-busting ensuring integrity</strong> <strong>bill</strong> in the Senate last week. The government is expected to reintroduce the legislation into the lower house this week, though it won\u2019t come up for a vote. They may seek to win the support of Lambie instead, who has indicated she would be open to discussions. </li> <li>We can also expect Labor to <strong>continue its attack on Angus Taylor</strong>. Taylor has come under immense pressure since the Guardian revealed he relied on a <strong>falsified document to attack the City of Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore</strong> for her travel-related emissions. Taylor has since been referred to NSW police, which has set up a taskforce to investigate. The prime minister Scott Morrison got himself into trouble last week by <strong>calling the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller,</strong> an old personal acquaintance, to check up on the investigation. </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T21:43:08.247Z\">at 9.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de42b8d8f08cd6fe586f5b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T21:14:27.576Z\">9.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to the last week of parliament for the year. </p> <p>It\u2019s <strong>Christopher Knaus</strong> here filling in for your usual live blog extraordinaire, <strong>Amy Remeikis</strong>. <br></p> <p>We\u2019re almost there.

      "bodyText": "The first day of the last week of parliament is done. There\u2019s been plenty to talk about, from Nick Xenophon\u2019s new job with Huawei, to the continuing pressure on Angus Taylor. So what did we learn today? The attorney-general, Christian Porter, has revealed he was in the room when prime minister Scott Morrison called NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller about an active investigation involving cabinet minister Angus Taylor. Porter said he thought the call was appropriate and was so \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cbasic\u201d that he did not seek advice from his department. Protesters converged on parliament to voice their anger at the failings of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Farmers were asking for a pause or scrapping of the plan, saying it has failed them and their communities, as well as the environment. The protesters reached the front door of parliament and were making themselves heard. A handful also disrupted Senate question time and were hauled out for abuse directed at agriculture minister Bridget McKenzie. The medevac repeal legislation came before the Senate for debate. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally and Greens senator Nick McKim both pleaded with the crossbench to keep the medevac law, saying it was humane and saving the lives of asylum seekers. Jacqui Lambie is yet to make her position clear. The federal government announced a new taskforce encompassing intelligence and policing agencies to detect and disrupt foreign interference. We didn\u2019t get a lot of detail on what the taskforce will actually do, but it will involve Asio, the Australian Federal Police, Austrac, and the home affairs department, among other agencies. The 10-year anniversary of the defeat of Labor\u2019s carbon pollution reduction scheme prompted a day of sparring between Labor and the Greens. Former senator Nick Xenophon courted some controversy for his new role with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that was infamously barred from involvement with Australia\u2019s 5G network over security concerns. Xenophon spent the day defending his new client from what he said were unfair and inaccurate attacks about its links to the Chinese Communist Party. Tim Wilson, Liberal MP, said history will not look kindly on Xenophon\u2019s decision. Scott Morrison and foreign affairs minister Marise Payne both voiced serious concerns about the treatment of Australian citizen and author, Yang Hengjun, by the Chinese government. The Greens are voting with the Liberals in the Senate against an urgency motion on the carbon pollution reduction scheme. The motion, brought on by senator Malarndirri McCarthy, asked the Senate to recognise that the Greens and Liberals joined together to vote against the CPRS 10 years ago today. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the motion was \u201call about the Labor party\u201d and a \u201chuge distraction\u201d. It is all about the Labor party trying to steal votes off of the Greens. In fact, I suspect it is all about one senator in this chamber, Penny Wong. This chamber should not be used as a personal vanity project for any senator. Seven News in Melbourne are reporting that Tony Abbott visited cardinal George Pell in prison. The full story has not yet been aired. My colleague Graham Readfearn has just published a story on Australia\u2019s concessions to Unesco that climate change had adversely affected the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s world heritage unique values. He reports: Australia has conceded in an official report that the Great Barrier Reef\u2019s unique values as a world heritage site have been adversely affected by climate change. In the report to Unesco\u2019s world heritage committee, the Queensland and federal governments say the reef is \u201can icon under pressure with a deteriorating long-term outlook\u201d. The committee will review the status of the Great Barrier Reef at its June 2020 meeting in China, with the potential to place the reef on its \u201cin danger\u201d list. As part of the process, the committee asked Australia to submit a comprehensive \u201cstate of conservation\u201d report for the reef \u2013 the first since 2015. The report says mass coral bleaching events of 2016 and 2017, together with six tropical cyclones, flood plumes and outbreaks of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish \u201chave impacted the [outstanding universal value] of the property since the last State Party Report in 2015\u201d. The Greens senator Larissa Waters said the report was an \u201cexercise in spin\u201d. \u201cAn honest reef report would read \u2013 the reef is cooked unless we boldly and quickly ramp up rescue efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cYet, rather than taking strong action to address climate change, the Australian government in this report is saying it\u2019s everybody else\u2019s problem, after having lobbied for climate change to be removed as a consideration in world heritage in danger listings.\u201d Xenophon is asked whether he is comfortable with Huawei\u2019s involvement in the mass surveillance of Uighurs in Xinjiang province in China. A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute this week found Chinese tech companies \u201care engaged in deeply unethical behaviour in Xinjiang, where their work directly supports and enables mass human rights abuses\u201d. Xenophon said he was troubled by the Chinese government\u2019s actions, but not of the suppliers of technology. The issue is not what Huawei or Intel or Hewlett-Packard supply, it is the way that it is being used in that country. And that is something that is quite separate in my view. I\u2019m troubled by it in terms of the actions of the government, not of the supplier. Nick Xenophon is doing the rounds spruiking for his new client, Huawei. He\u2019s been on the ABC and says he won\u2019t need to place himself on the government\u2019s new foreign influence transparency register, despite his new role. No, unless of course I was lobbying politicians, but I think I\u2019ve had enough of politicians, they\u2019ve probably had enough of me. Xenophon says his job is to respond to \u201cslurs\u201d and \u201cuntruths\u201d against Huawei. It\u2019s my job to represent Huawei in terms of giving them appropriate legal advice and when things are said about Huawei that go beyond the 5G ban... they\u2019ve been accused of things that are quite frankly ridiculous, they are untrue. He then questions the advice of security agencies of Australia, which advised the government against involving Huawei in the 5G network on security grounds. He then compares their advice to the advice on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which was later proven wrong. \u201cI\u2019m not conflating them,\u201d he assures viewers. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan protesters have made their way up to the front doors of Parliament House. They\u2019re certainly making themselves heard. Speaking of Angus Taylor, which seems to be an interminable exercise at the moment, there\u2019s a slight question about his first speech to parliament. He referenced his memory of \u201ca young Naomi Wolf\u201d as a student at Oxford wanting to remove a Christmas tree from the common room \u201cbecause some people might be offended\u201d. Taylor described his outrage at this form of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. Wolf, a US author and journalist, has questioned some of Taylor\u2019s factual assertions on Twitter. We\u2019re looking into it, rest assured. The Liberal MP Tim Wilson has some tough words for the former senator Nick Xenophon and his decision to act as Huawei\u2019s strategic counsel. \u201cI think history will judge him harshly for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s made a choice and he\u2019s chosen who he is going to work for ... he has chosen to represent a telecommunications company that has been denied access to Australia\u2019s telecommunications network for a reason.\u201d Labor\u2019s Mark Butler is speaking on what he says is Angus Taylor\u2019s failure to declare interests in a company named GFA F1 Pty Ltd. Taylor has a partnership interest in the company through a separate venture, Farm Partnerships Australia, which he has declared appropriately. Labor says he should have also declared the interest in GFA F1 Pty Ltd on his pecuniary interests register. Butler says the scandals by themselves don\u2019t warrant Taylor\u2019s sacking. But take them together. If the prime minister does not now act against Angus Taylor, then his ministerial standards are not worth the paper they are written on. Taylor says he has declared all interests appropriately. His colleague Tim Wilson has just described the criticism as a \u201cjoke\u201d. We\u2019ve just got some vision from the debate on the medevac repeal bill a little earlier. Kristina Keneally spoke out against the \u201cinhumane\u201d attempts to deny proper medical care to asylum seekers. Mike Bowers captured all the colour from Labor\u2019s assault on Angus Taylor during question time this afternoon. I\u2019ve just come back from the CanthePlan protest out the front of Parliament House. The organiser Carly Marriott told Guardian Australia that \u201cenvironmental water is not an out-and-out good thing\u201d but rather is a piece of \u201cbranding\u201d used to persuade the public. She said: They\u2019re banking on ignorance. They\u2019re banking on the urban voter to think the government is doing what is right for the environment when in actual fact they punch that much water down a natural waterway to deliver on things ... that don\u2019t need to happen. The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP for the NSW seat of Murray, Helen Dalton, explained that Australia is an \u201cephemeral environment\u201d and high water levels in the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers \u201cis actually causing a lot of environmental damage\u201d. Dalton said: They just think adding water to the environment is good. In Australia it\u2019s not, we expect to be dry, this is the beginning of summer. We know what our environment is: It\u2019s not with rivers running full banker 24/7 12 months a year. You\u2019ve got everything out of whack in the environment. You\u2019ve got proliferation of carp, carp are undermining the banks of the river, and destroying aquatic reeds which filter the water. Marriott said: Farmers, if given water, they can manage their environment. We deliver on the triple bottom line: we look after our economy, our environment and our people. The Murray-Darling Basin plan is undermining all of that. Pauline Hanson said One Nation have been \u201cworking extremely hard\u201d to fix the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, complaining that parliament had knocked back her call to debate setting up the Bradfield Scheme. She said: I\u2019ve done three days in the Murray-Darling, and I\u2019ve spoken to the communities and I\u2019ve spoken to the farmers. It\u2019s not good enough, it needs to be revised, it needs to be thrown out and we need to come up with something that\u2019s going to give the water to the people of this nation. I\u2019m so angry when we have our water sold to foreign ownership \u2013 20% of the water is in foreign ownership, 15% of our licences. Water shouldn\u2019t be owned by anyone just to use for a trade to make their pockets bigger. Ahead of the rally, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation put out a statement acknowledging farmers\u2019 concerns, but warning that \u201cno plan\u201d is no solution. The NFF president, Fiona Simson, said: We have continued to advocate, increasingly stridently, for changes and reforms to the way the plan is being implemented and welcome the support from farmers also seeking to improve the plan... Not having a plan is a complex proposal. Even without it there would continue to be an intergovernmental agreement on water distribution; there would continue to be environmental water; there would continue to be competition in the water market and the status of the drought would remain uninfluenced. No plan is not the answer to this very complex challenge. Marriott said the push to scrap or rewrite the basin plan will not be derailed or stopped by a press release. And that\u2019s a wrap on question time. It ends with a ceasefire of sorts. Scott Morrison wishes his dad happy birthday during what he says is a difficult time. Labor echoes the sentiments. Anthony Albanese: Some things should be above politics \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s father\u2019s birthday is one of them. So happy birthday from everyone on this side as well. So just to recap quickly: Labor began with an attack on the Coalition\u2019s economic management, citing slowing economic growth and sluggish wage growth. It then seized on Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s criticism of the Coalition\u2019s climate policy to criticise the government\u2019s ongoing climate action. Labor then shifted into full-frontal assault mode on Angus Taylor, who remains under pressure on several fronts. The issue continuing to cause him most difficulty is his reliance on a falsified document to attack the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, for her travel-related emissions. That has prompted a NSW police investigation. The attorney-general, Christian Porter, confirmed he was in the room with Scott Morrison when the prime minister made a call to the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, about the investigation. Porter said Fuller knew he was on the call. Porter said he did not seek advice on the appropriateness of the call. He said he didn\u2019t believe it was necessary because it was so short and basic. The attorney-general said it was a completely appropriate call to make and attacked Labor for vexatious referrals to police. Labor also asked why Taylor had not properly declared interests in a company named GFA F1 Pty Ltd. Taylor said all his financial interests were properly disclosed. In the Senate, we had some fairly unedifying displays from protesters opposed to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They heckled and attacked Bridget McKenzie with abuse, including one who described her as \u201cfucking useless\u201d. Some individuals were escorted out. Scott Morrison says Labor is engaged in \u201cgrubby smears and political games\u201d in the attack on Angus Taylor because it can\u2019t face the fact it was rejected by the voting public. They don\u2019t want your higher taxes, they don\u2019t want your job-destroying emissions reduction targets, they don\u2019t want the fact that they blow a budget any time they see it. They were rejected and they have been sulking ever since.\u201d Anthony Albanese begins to rattle off the various controversies involving Angus Taylor. It takes so long that he can\u2019t finish his question. Scott Morrison jumps to his feet: Thank you. I can confirm that the leader of the opposition can\u2019t get a question out in 30 seconds.\u201d Labor asks Angus Taylor why he has failed to declare to parliament that he holds partnership shares in a company named \u201cGFA F1 Pty Ltd\u201d for more than five years. Taylor insists he has declared all his financial interests, as required. My interests are declared in accordance with the rules as I have said many times in this House.\u201d Labor\u2019s Terri Butler asks Christian Porter \u201chow on earth\u201d he, as the first law officer of Australia, judged it appropriate to call the NSW police chief, Mick Fuller, about an active investigation involving a cabinet minister\u2019s office. Porter responds: Because the call was totally appropriate. It was precisely what the prime minister undertook to do. He did it. He came back to the house with the response to the call.\u201d He then asks how Labor could think it was appropriate to recklessly refer attorneys general in the past to police for vague allegations of corruption. You are responsible for all of those referrals. All eight of them. Eight-zero.\u201d Back in the lower house, Dreyfus again asks Christian Porter whether he sought advice on the phone call to Mick Fuller. Porter says the phone call was so brief that it didn\u2019t need advice. Mr Speaker, the phone call was very brief, the description of it by the prime minister was completely accurate. The description of it by the police commissioner was completely accurate. It was not the sort of phone call, because it was so basic and simple, that required any advice to be sought or given. Some disruptions in Senate question time, where Murray-Darling basin plan protesters are shouting abuse at Bridget McKenzie Mark Dreyfus, the shadow attorney general, steps up the attack after Christian Porter\u2019s confirmation that he was in the room for the Morrison-Fuller call. He asks whether Porter gave advice about whether the call should be made, or whether departmental advice was sought. Porter responds: Mr Speaker, the descriptions of that call provided by the prime minister and commissioner Fuller have been absolutely accurate. But what I won\u2019t be lectured to about taking advice from someone who has an 8-0 record of referring Coalition members to the police \u2013 eight referrals, zero success.\u201d Labor\u2019s attack pivots to the ongoing Angus Taylor scandal. The attorney general, Christian Porter, is asked whether Mick Fuller knew that he was on the call with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, when he rang to discuss an active investigation into Taylor\u2019s reliance on a falsified document. Porter responds: Yes I was and I note with respect to his call, he said the prime minister didn\u2019t ask any questions that were inappropriate. I also note with respect to that call he said something else very interesting. He said that matters like the one that was referred by the shadow attorney general are, in his words, a great diverter of my time.\u201d The chamber erupts as Porter alleges Labor is wasting police time with \u201cvexatious\u201d referrals. David Littleproud, the drought minister, is asked why the Coalition won\u2019t intervene to increase dairy prices. You\u2019ll remember, of course, that One Nation has introduced a bill to protect dairy farmers, though the government has voted to block debate on it. Littleproud said the concept was a \u201ccruel hoax\u201d played on dairy farmers. Not only [will it] have created oversupply, but you will also recklessly put at risk the international trade agreements that we have put in place, not just for dairy, but for every other commodity.\u201d Anthony Albanese is making hay of comments by the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, that the Coalition\u2019s climate policy is incoherent and holding back billions of dollars of investment. Morrison responds: Our policies are working. Our policies are working. On the other side, they cannot still say whether they are for the policy they took the last election. They have had six months to deliberate.\u201d The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, is on his feet, talking about the benefits of \u201cpuff organic grain\u201d for some reason. Don\u2019t know about you, but \u201cpuff organic grain\u201d sounds to me like something consumed by those inner-city lefties McCormack is always railing against. Guess they\u2019re good for something after all. There\u2019s a bit of argy-bargy in the chamber. Anthony Albanese challenged the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on an earlier answer, which he said was misleading. Morrison had claimed Labor did not conclude any free trade agreements while in office. Albanese rattles off a few free trade agreements finalised by Labor. Morrison responds: Start and finish is the test, Mr Speaker. When you start an agreement and finish an agreement, then I suppose you can claim those. I\u2019m happy to acknowledge that some were concluded under the former Labor government, Mr Speaker, but what I can acknowledge also is when they left government just 26% of our trade was covered by trade agreements. It\u2019s 70% now, Mr Speaker.\u201d The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, asks whether the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, views low wage growth as \u201cmission accomplished\u201d. Frydenberg shoots back: I thank the member for Rankin and I thank the leader of the opposition for letting him out of witness protection. He\u2019s been averaging one question a sitting week since the election.\u201d Frydenberg says real wage growth is at the long-term average of 0.6%. I know that the member for Rankin rarely gets a question, but when he does, I appreciate it.\u201d Morrison gets a dixer. He\u2019s asked to update the house on what the government is doing to ensure Australia\u2019s \u201cnational economic and environmental security\u201d. You already know the rest, so I won\u2019t bother transcribing the response. Labor kicks off question time with an attack on the Coalition\u2019s economic management, saying growth has slowed, and labour productivity has declined for the first time since records began. Morrison responds: Thank you. I can confirm that after the election, people\u2019s taxes didn\u2019t go up, Mr Speaker.\u201d The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has just spoken on the 10-year anniversary of the defeat of the carbon pollution reduction scheme by the Liberals and the Greens. He said it was a \u201cgreat opportunity lost\u201d and all it required was the five Greens senators to vote in favour. What we needed was economy-wide action on climate change. As a result there has been 218m additional tonnes of carbon put into the atmosphere. It has been a decade in which we have today no energy policy, no emissions policy. We have an emissions reduction minister where emissions are rising.\u201d Back to the Senate, where Nick McKim continues to speak against the medevac repeal bill. He is discussing the case of Hamid Kehazaei, whose death from infection on Manus Island was caused by a cascading series of errors and systemic failures in the Australian-run offshore detention centre. Queensland coroner Terry Ryan, who investigated the death of Kehazaei, deemed it to be entirely preventable, and said the healthcare on Manus was not the same as he would have received in Cape York, Australia. McKim said he wa not evacuated to Australia because of the \u201cmendacious bureaucrats and politicians and the system they created\u201d. There\u2019s blood on people\u2019s hands here, and the blood is on the hands of the LNP. And the blood will be on the hands of One Nation if they vote to support the legislation.\u201d You can read more about the case here: An update today on the status of the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, and his referral to the state\u2019s police integrity watchdog. Last week NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge formally referred Fuller to the law enforcement conduct commission, over his phone call with Scott Morrison about the police investigation into Angus Taylor. Morrison had spoken to Fuller to discuss the active investigation into Taylor, something Shoebridge claims was \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d, and a potential breach of section 10 of the LECC Act (serious misconduct). Today Shoebridge has sent a second letter, updating his referral with a specific regulation that Fuller may have breached. It is clause 76 of the NSW police regulation 2005: \u201cA member of the NSW police force must treat all information which comes to his or her knowledge in his or her official capacity as strictly confidential, and on no account without proper authority divulge it to anyone. \u201cA police officer must observe the strictest secrecy ... and is forbidden to communicate without proper authority in any way to any person outside the NSW police force any information in regard to police or other official business.\u201d Fuller has told the Australian newspaper that his conversation with Morrison was \u201cextremely short\u201d and gave \u201cno more or less information than what was in the media release\u201d. \u201cHe just wanted confirmation we were conducting an investigation,\u201d Fuller said. Shoebridge said this was \u201can unambiguous law\u201d that \u201cbinds the commissioner as much as any constable\u201d. \u201cAll information that commissioner Fuller had about the investigation had to be treated as confidential unless he had a valid basis to disclosure it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date neither the PM nor the commissioner have been able to establish any legitimate basis for this briefing.\u201d Meanwhile, in Liberal MP Tim Wilson\u2019s office: Greens senator Nick McKim is on his feet to speak on the medevac bill. He says the debate boils down to a simple question: Do you think sick people should get the treatment that medical professionals say they need? If you answer yes to that question, you will join the Greens in opposing this legislation.\u201d McKim said the old regime had led to deaths, because it denied asylum seekers the care they needed. The medevac legislation has saved lives. It has delivered people the healthcare that they so desperately needed and that they had previously been deliberately deprived of by mendacious ministers and bureaucrats.\u201d The government has turned offshore processing into indefinite detention, Keneally said. This, she said, was what made medevac such a critical piece of legislation. It is why medevac was needed and required: to ensure people who are sick should receive the medical attention they require. Denying people medical care is un-Australian. It\u2019s inhumane. It\u2019s uncompassionate. If you or I are sick, we see a doctor. And vulnerable people in Australia\u2019s care who have already suffered significant trauma in their lives should not be forced to the brink of death to receive the medical treatment they require.\u201d Keneally says there is widespread public support for the medevac bill. But the government has made \u201cbrazen, desperate, and dishonest\u201d attempts to discredit the law. That includes leaking national security advice to the Australian newspaper, and the dissemination of private and personal details of asylum seekers. Let\u2019s not forget, these are people who, in the majority of cases, have fled persecution and have been found to be owed protection. We have seen their medical conditions misconstrued and exploited for political gain. These people have had their photos published, the treatment they have undergone shared and their information exploited \u2013 without their permission. How would minister Dutton feel if he woke up one morning to see his personal medical details on the front page of a national newspaper? An investigation would be launched within minutes.\u201d Just a reminder: we still don\u2019t know which way the votes will fall on this repeal bill. It all hinges on Jacqui Lambie, and we are yet to discover if she has won the concessions she sought from the Coalition. Debate has begun on the medevac repeal bill \u2013 formally known as the migration amendment (repairing medical transfers) bill 2019 \u2013 in the Senate. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally is on her feet. I say from the outset that the name of this bill is a fallacy. There is nothing to \u2018repair\u2019 when it comes to the medical transfers of sick people from regional processing countries to Australia. The name of this bill \u2013 like so many pieces of legislation from this visionless government in the post-truth era \u2013 is untruthful, misleading and misdirected.\u201d Keneally speaks of a letter she received from a doctor formerly on Nauru, named Chris Jones. She quotes Jones\u2019s letter: It is like being witness to people dying on a palliative care ward, slowly fading away, physically and emotionally. The only difference here is that they do not have the dignity of palliative care.\u201d Keneally says the current system allowed bureaucrats with no medical qualifications to overrule doctors on the ground. She said successive ministerial directions greatly discouraged the transference of asylum seekers to Australia for treatment. Over time, the problem grew, and medical transfers were denied time and time again. People\u2019s physical injuries were left to worsen \u2013 often to the stage where people were facing lifelong disabilities. Children were denied transfers because they didn\u2019t want to be separated from their parents. Women were denied the opportunity to have their reproductive health seen to. Mental health across the cohort of Manus \u2013 and later broader PNG \u2013 and Nauru diminished terribly. It is because of all of these circumstances that Labor and the crossbench moved to put provisions in place \u2013 medevac \u2013 to fix the issues of this third term Liberal National government\u2019s own creation.\u201d Consumer advocates have welcomed the introduction of a bill to crack down on exploitative payday loans, a form of short-term, high-interest lending that can trap vulnerable consumers in debt. The bill was introduced to the Senate with the support of Labor and Centre Alliance. It would, among other things, ban payday lenders from making unsolicited offers encouraging individuals to repeatedly take out payday loans. The Consumer Action Law Centre\u2019s chief executive, Gerard Brody, said the bill would protect hundreds of thousands of Australians exploited by payday lenders. \u201cThere is a broad consensus across the community that stronger consumer protections for payday loans are needed. Why then are prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg letting payday lenders and consumer lease providers escape legislative reform?\u201d he said. The government has previously promised action to regulate the payday loan industry. A draft of small amount credit contract legislation to increase protections for vulnerable consumers was released by the government in 2017, but despite promising it would introduce the bill by the end of that year, it failed to do so. \u201cIn the three years that these reforms have stalled, payday lenders have profited to the tune of some $550m,\u201d Brody said. Recent data from the Stop the Debt Trap Alliance\u2019s report on payday lending uncovered a booming market, projecting that it would reach a staggering $1.7bn in gross payday lending stock by the end of this year. Mike Bowers has been roaming the corridors of parliament this morning and has all the colour from the prime minister\u2019s press conference and, earlier, an event launching the Friends of our Pacific Family. A little earlier this morning, Greens MP Adam Bandt introduced a bill that would compel the Climate Change Authority to report on the impact of three degrees or more of global warming on the Australian environment, economy and society. \u201cThe Australian people need to know that the Morrison government\u2019s current climate targets will take us into a three-degree world, with catastrophic consequences for Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing the severe impacts of a one-degree world with the climate crisis driving the fire emergency and the record drought. The Australian people need to know what the prime minister\u2019s targets will do to the country when they take us to three degrees.\u201d There\u2019s not a lot of bipartisanship on display in Canberra this morning. But there\u2019s one thing Labor and Liberal MPs are both happy to put their names to: an invitation to the industry-sponsored \u201cparliamentary friends of resources\u201d Christmas drinks. The invitation has just been jointly sent out by Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon and the Liberal party\u2019s Craig Kelly. The event is to be held in parliament house on 4 December. It is sponsored by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. It is described thusly: Sponsored by the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association (APPEA), the event will showcase Bright Sparks, an initiative that tells the stories of hard-working people employed directly and indirectly by Australia\u2019s natural gas industry.\u201d Sounds like fun. We know Jacqui Lambie is critical to the government\u2019s plans to repeal medevac. For \u201cnational security\u201d reasons, Lambie has been coy about what she wants in exchange, though one report has suggested she wants Australia to accept New Zealand\u2019s offer to take 150 refugees from offshore detention. Morrison appeared to shut down that option in his press conference. Asked whether he would be prepared to take New Zealand\u2019s offer, Morrison said simply: \u201cThose policies on those matters haven\u2019t changed.\u201d The organisers of the Murray-Darling basin protest are expecting about 200 trucks to descend on Canberra today. They plan to encircle Federation Mall, the strip between the new and old parliament houses. Organiser Carly Marriott, who lives on property just north of the Murray river, says the plan has grossly restricted her access to water, something she likens to having \u201cyour hands tied behind your back\u201d. She spoke to the ABC a little earlier: It\u2019s a very peaceful rally, but it\u2019s based out of frustration and anger at the politicians\u2019 lack of action and inability to listen to us. We\u2019re trying to grow food for Australians and we\u2019re not being listened to and it\u2019s hurting people out in the country. So the fact that we have to pack up and come into Canberra to get this message across, we\u2019re giving it our all.\u201d Peter Dutton has said he believed it was entirely appropriate for the prime minister to call the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, about the active investigation into Angus Taylor\u2019s office. Dutton, a former police officer, was asked whether he would have appreciated such a call. \u201cI said at the time last week I thought the prime minister\u2019s call was entirely appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister has obligations under the ministerial code of conduct and the alternative view would have been that he didn\u2019t avail himself of the information and, therefore, he couldn\u2019t fulfil his obligation under the ministerial code of conduct.\u201d He said nobody had \u201csought to impede\u201d NSW police\u2019s investigation. The phone call has been criticised by Labor and integrity experts, including a former anti-corruption commissioner and judge, David Ipp, who said it appeared to be an attempt to use the office to further party political interests. Morrison is asked about Nick Xenophon\u2019s new job with Huawei and whether he should place himself on the government\u2019s new foreign influence register. \u201cHe needs to comply with the law like everybody else,\u201d Morrison says. Huawei was not directly targeted in the government\u2019s decision to restrict involvement in the 5G network, Morrison says. \u201cLook, I wish Nick all the best in his new employment and sounds like he\u2019s prosecuting his case. It\u2019s a free country.\u201d The prime minister also speaks about China\u2019s detention of Yang Hengjun, an author and Australian citizen. The latest consular report suggests he is being interrogated daily, sometimes in shackles. He says: Australia always has to stand up for our citizens and we have to be true to who we are as a people. [We] are very concerned following the most recent consular access that we have had about the treatment and we have raised these issues consistently now for some time and we would like to see the issues about access to lawyers, about getting a clear enunciation of what the matter is that have been brought against the Australian citizen at the centre of this case, and, thirdly, that his access to family and treatment that would meet, you know, world standards is being provided to him. \u201cNow, the most recent consular access was a matter of great concern to me and the foreign minister and we will continue to make those representations on behalf of an Australian citizen.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, are holding a press conference on the government\u2019s new $87.8m taskforce to detect and disrupt foreign interference. The taskforce, which brings together intelligence and policing capabilities, has been announced after extraordinary revelations about China\u2019s efforts to plant a candidate in Australia\u2019s parliament and the defection of a man who claims to be associated with Chinese intelligence. \u201cForeign interference comes from many, many different sources and it\u2019s important that we have the capacity to deal with it,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cIt\u2019s an evolving threat and it\u2019s also been a building and evolving response.\u201d I mentioned a little earlier that bushfire survivor Melinda Plesman had travelled to parliament to call for climate action. Her home was lost in the bushfires that devastated the east coast in recent months. She has brought the remains of her home to parliament as a gift to Scott Morrison. Plesman spoke to reporters a little earlier: We need the parliament and the prime minister and the opposition, we need them to listen to the science, to look at all the data that has been collected ... and to do something. I want direct climate action and I want it now, I don\u2019t want prayers. I don\u2019t want glib comments about the cricket. Richard Di Natale, the Greens leader, is responding to Wong\u2019s attack. He says Labor\u2019s criticism of events 10 years ago are a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the \u201ccoal hugging Liberals\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be here to fight the Tories, not the Greens,\u201d he says. Di Natale said today was the first day Labor had wanted to talk about climate change since the devastating fires on the east coast. \u201cWhat are the Labor party doing? Turning their attention to the Greens. We had half the country on fire last week. We have had the east coast burning. We have had people losing their homes. You know what the response was from the Labor party? Well, again they joined the Liberal party: now is not the time to talk about climate change.\u201d Di Natale says the Greens were the only party to take a carbon price policy to the election. \u201cIf you are so desperate to have a climate price introduced, let\u2019s get together and work on one,\u201d he said. Still in the Senate, Labor\u2019s Penny Wong is speaking about the 10-year anniversary of the defeat of the carbon pollution reduction scheme, which was voted down by the Liberals and Greens. Wong isn\u2019t wasting the opportunity to lay the boot into the Greens. She describes the Liberals and Greens as an \u201cunholy alliance\u201d that derailed Australia\u2019s action on climate change. \u201cThe Greens political party voted against cumulative reduction of Australia\u2019s carbon emissions by 280m tonnes over the last decade,\u201d she says. Wong says the Greens justified their decision by complaining the targets were inadequate and industry assistance was too great. \u201cJust two years later they voted for the clean energy future package, which had the same emissions targets for 2020 and more industry assistance,\u201d Wong says. Finance minister Mathias Cormann describes Wong\u2019s statement as a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d. \u201cThis is just all about a tiff between the Labor party and the Greens,\u201d he says. For his part, Cormann says he stands by the decision to vote down the CPRS. Cormann says the CPRS would never have helped reduce emissions, but simply just shifted Australia\u2019s emissions to another part of the world. Over in the Senate, One Nation\u2019s Pauline Hanson is attempting to have her bill protecting dairy farmers debated today. The bill is an attempt to require that fair prices be paid for milk. Hanson wants it debated in private senators\u2019 time, just after midday. Labor has supported attempts to bring on debate on the bill, and has previously challenged the Nationals to do the same. But the government is resisting and just won a vote denying One Nation the ability to debate the bill. That is slightly unusual, in that the government does not typically use its numbers to dictate what bills can be debated during private senators\u2019 time. One Nation will bring on the bill anyway, but further debate has been adjourned. Nick Xenophon has just been on Sky News, talking about his new role as \u201cstrategic counsel\u201d with Chinese telecommunications behemoth Huawei. Huawei was banned from any role in Australia\u2019s 5G network over concerns of potential foreign influence, a decision that infuriated the Chinese government and the company. Xenophon is asked how much he is being paid, and whether he is selling out his good name to act as a mouthpiece for a company associated with the Chinese Communist party. \u201cWe are being paid on an hourly rate, it\u2019s about the same as any other client that I\u2019m acting for,\u201d Xenophon said. \u201cSo there\u2019s no premium, there\u2019s no danger rate.\u201d He said all he wants is to \u201cshut down false, unfair attacks on Huawei\u201d. \u201cIn my view this decision to ban Huawei was a decision that was ill-considered. It was highly political, in my view,\u201d he said. Xenophon said it was wrong to suggest he was acting as a mouthpiece for a CCP-linked company. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. Wrong on so many levels. Huawei is a private company, it\u2019s owned by its employees, its owned by its key executives, it\u2019s been fiercely independent.\u201d Melinda Plesman has arrived in Canberra with a present for the prime minister Scott Morrison. Plesman lost her home in bushfires that swept through Nymboida, on the NSW north coast near Grafton. She has brought the ashes of her property down to gift Morrison to highlight the Coalition\u2019s lack of climate action. Foreign minister Marise Payne has issued a statement on China\u2019s treatment of Yang Hengjun, an Australian writer detained on unspecified criminal charges. The Guardian reported this morning that Dr Hengjun is being subjected to daily interrogations with his arms and legs shackled, as Chinese security officials try to \u201cbreak\u201d him, and have him confess to unspecified allegations of espionage that potentially carry the death penalty. Payne said the Australian government was \u201cvery concerned\u201d by reports from a recent consular visit to Hengjun. She described his treatment as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. His circumstances of detention include increased isolation from the outside world, with restrictions on his communications with family and friends, and the resumption of daily interrogation, including while shackled. This is unacceptable. We have made repeated requests to the Chinese authorities for an explanation of the charges against Dr Yang. We have also made repeated requests for him to be afforded basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment, in line with international norms, including access to his lawyers and to his family, both of which continue to be denied to him. This has not led to any substantive changes in his treatment. We will continue to express our expectations in clear terms to the Chinese authorities \u2013 both in Beijing and in Canberra \u2013 including that Dr Yang be released and that, while his detention continues, he be treated fairly and humanely. Labor has seized on a report showing budget surpluses would not be as large as the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, predicted in April. The report, from Deloitte Access Economics, suggests a surplus of $5.3bn for the 2019/20 financial year, which would be smaller than the $7.1bn forecast in April. Economist and partner at Deloitte Access Economics Chris Richardson said that while overall strong commodity prices have benefited Australia, coal prices are now off the boil. Labor\u2019s Andrew Leigh said the report \u201cconfirmed that Australia\u2019s economic problems were homegrown\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s given the lie to the claim that it\u2019s purely international problems that are causing the weakness in the domestic economy,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cDeloitte has made absolutely clear that there are domestic economic problems that need to be handled. They pointed again to the fact that wages are growing woefully while profits are growing powerfully.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve indicated very clearly that far from the world causing only problems for the Australian economy, indeed the iron ore price \u2013 a factor entirely outside the control of the government \u2013 has given the budget more benefit than had been expected at budget time.\u201d You can read a full report on Deloitte\u2019s findings here: In an interesting (and welcome) development, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has agreed to commence an inquiry into the administration of government grants, including the trouble-plagued regional jobs and investment packages program. Labor had written to the audit committee asking it to look into the program\u2019s administration after the auditor general released a scathing report into the Coalition\u2019s handling of the $220m regional jobs scheme. The RJIP paid out funds across 10 regional areas, but doubts have been raised about the process, given a ministerial panel made decisions against the recommendations of the department. In a statement this morning, the chair of the committee, Liberal MP Lucy Wicks, confirmed the inquiry and said it would likely conduct public hearings in 2020. The audit committee will also look at the Australian Research Council\u2019s administration of the national competitive grants program. We mentioned a little earlier that farmers were congregating in Canberra to protest the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which they say is failing rural communities and the environment. One of their chief concerns is what they see as unfair water allocation between the basin states. The chief executive of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Phillip Glyde, was on ABC radio this morning and acknowledged the \u201csignificant pain\u201d farmers were experiencing. \u201cWe have to acknowledge the significant pain that people are going through as a result of the drought, the significant pain that has occurred as a result of 15 years or more of water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin,\u201d he said. But Glyde said concerns about water allocation had little to do with the basin plan. \u201cThe allocation of water between the states, which is currently the major issue, is not something to do with the basin plan or the water market. That is to do with an intergovernmental agreement that was first struck in 1914,\u201d he said. He said the scientifically-based basin plan was about ensuring the long-term viability of the system for all its users, and said the 12-year period leading up to its full implementation in 2024 was particularly difficult. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this immediate pain for this long-term gain, and it\u2019s very hard to see it, particularly during drought,\u201d he said. An interesting tidbit about Nick Xenophon, the former crossbench senator, emerged this morning. He\u2019s taken up the cause of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications behemoth that was barred from involvement in Australia\u2019s 5G network. The ban was prompted by security concerns, and has further strained the relationship between Canberra and Beijing. Xenophon will be part of the strategic counsel representing Huawei. He has described the company as an \u201cunderdog\u201d. \u201cThey have been treated incredibly unfairly,\u201d he told the Australian on Monday. Trade minister Simon Birmingham was asked about Xenophon\u2019s new gig a little earlier. He said it was \u201cfor Nick to explain the nature of his work\u201d but questioned what his parliamentary colleagues in Canberra and South Australia would make of it. Andrew Wilkie will launch yet another attempt to wind back Australia\u2019s live export trade this morning. The trade subjects animals to cruel and horrific conditions and Wilkie\u2019s bill would impose a permanent ban from July 2022. \u201cLive export is systemically cruel, not in Australia\u2019s economic self-interest and lacks popular support,\u201d Wilkie said. \u201cNo wonder so many Australians want to see this vile trade shut down.\u201d Wilkie\u2019s private member\u2019s bill is unlikely to pass. He has attempted to introduce a similar bill four times in the past and it has never won support from the government or Labor. \u201cIt\u2019s high time both sides of the parliament took notice, started representing their constituents and supported this bill to ban live export.\u201d The government this morning announced a new $87.8m taskforce to counter foreign interference. The taskforce will bring together intelligence agencies, the Australian federal police, Austrac, and the home affairs department in a concerted effort to detect and disrupt attempts by foreign actors to interfere in Australian politics. \u201cIt will be led by a senior Asio officer and bring together a new team of Australian federal police investigators and representatives from Austrac, the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Geospatial Intelligence Organisation,\u201d the government said in a statement this morning. \u201cThe Office of National Intelligence will also support the taskforce.\u201d This announcement, of course, comes after disturbing reports last week about a Chinese government plot to plant Bo \u201cNick\u201d Zhao in Australia\u2019s parliament, and the defection of Wang Liqiang, a man who claims to be associated with Chinese intelligence. Reports suggest the taskforce had been in the works for some time, but was signed off by cabinet last week. Trade minister Simon Birmingham has just been on Sky News talking about medevac, making it clear that the government is proceeding with the bill, regardless of whether it will be defeated. He concedes the government may lose the vote. \u201cGovernments will lose votes on the Senate floor, governments always have and governments almost certainly always will.\u201d Birmingham is refusing to say what Lambie is demanding of the government, but says the Coalition would consider \u201csensible requests\u201d. Asked whether senators will actually know what they\u2019re voting on, given little is known about Lambie\u2019s demands, Birmingham says: \u201cPeople in that chamber will be voting in relation to the medevac repeal bill.\u201d Birmingham is asked whether Labor will be given a briefing on Lambie\u2019s \u201cnational security\u201d demands. He says: \u201cIf Labor want to talk about the repeal of the medevac laws, we would welcome the debate. but I don\u2019t see any signs of the Labor party waking up to their error and their mistake.\u201d Finance minister Mathias Cormann has just been speaking on the medevac bill. The government is slated to meet with Jacqui Lambie this morning. But Cormann was pretty emphatic about the possibility it will not horse trade to secure her vote to repeal medevac. \u201cWe will not be horse-trading on national security,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cThere will be no horse-trading on the medevac repeal bill.\u201d He appears to be making two things clear this morning. Firstly that Lambie\u2019s support has not yet been secured. And secondly, the government does not intend to pull the bill. That doesn\u2019t leave a great deal of wiggle room. But let\u2019s see where the chips fall. So what can we expect from today? There\u2019s a few issues bubbling away already this morning. Farmers from across the Murray Darling Basin will descend on Canberra to protest against the Murray Darling Basin Plan. They say the management of water under the plan is failing farmers, communities and the environment. The protesters are calling for a royal commission into the plan. Some are calling for it to be immediately scrapped, a position that has caused a split with the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. The government will continue to seek the support of crossbench senator Jacqui Lambie in its bid to repeal the medevac legislation. Lambie is playing hardball. She has asked for unknown promises from the government before giving it her support. We don\u2019t know precisely what she\u2019s asked for, because she\u2019s keeping it under wraps for \u201cnational security\u201d reasons. Her vote is, of course, critical to the government getting its way. Speaking of those pesky crossbenchers, we\u2019re also likely to see continued fallout from One Nation\u2019s decision to deny the government passage of its union-busting ensuring integrity bill in the Senate last week. The government is expected to reintroduce the legislation into the lower house this week, though it won\u2019t come up for a vote. They may seek to win the support of Lambie instead, who has indicated she would be open to discussions. We can also expect Labor to continue its attack on Angus Taylor. Taylor has come under immense pressure since the Guardian revealed he relied on a falsified document to attack the City of Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore for her travel-related emissions. Taylor has since been referred to NSW police, which has set up a taskforce to investigate. The prime minister Scott Morrison got himself into trouble last week by calling the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, an old personal acquaintance, to check up on the investigation. Hello and welcome to the last week of parliament for the year. It\u2019s Christopher Knaus here filling in for your usual live blog extraordinaire, Amy Remeikis. We\u2019re almost there. Four more sitting days left until this chaotic parliamentary year is done and dusted. There\u2019s still plenty to come. From the continuing Angus Taylor saga to the government\u2019s continuing attempts to repeal medevac, it\u2019s set to be a busy week. So grab a coffee and strap in.",

This prompted a popular legal blogger and best-selling author, known as the Secret Barrister, to accuse No 10 of having copied and pasted parts of a blogpost they had written on the issue to debunk earlier inaccuracies made by Johnson. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, condemned Johnson\u2019s response to the attack. She told BBC Radio 5: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a community which is coming together in a brilliant way and straight out of the door the prime minister\u2019s trying to make it an election issue \u2013 I just think it\u2019s pretty distasteful.\u201d But the foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, denied that the Conservatives were politicising the attack. However, he cited the incident to warn against what he said would be harmful Labour policies. \u201cThe question is, for people who are watching the show, who they trust: Boris Johnson to keep us safe or Jeremy Corbyn, with his track record?\u201d he told Sky News. The Labour leader said on Sunday that convicted terrorists should \u201cnot necessarily\u201d serve their full sentence, calling instead for a wider focus on issues such as rehabilitation and deradicalisation In a later speech, Corbyn condemned cuts to areas such as probation and mental health or youth services, saying this was likely to create \u201cmissed chances to intervene in the lives of people who go on to commit inexcusable acts\u201d. Blaming the Iraq war and other UK foreign policy decisions for fuelling terrorism, Corbyn said: \u201cReal security doesn\u2019t only come from strong laws and intelligence, it comes also from effective public services that have the funding they need.\u201d Cambridge University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Stephen J Toope, said he was devastated by the attack. He said: \u201cWhat should have been a joyous opportunity to celebrate the achievements of this unique and socially transformative programme, hosted by our Institute of Criminology, was instead disrupted by an unspeakable criminal act.\u201d The NHS confirmed on Sunday night that one of the three people injured in the attack had been allowed to return home. The other two remained in a stable condition.",

      "body": "<p>The red, fertile earth glistens in the Kenyan sun. Here in the lush green of the tea plantation uplands of Kericho County are some of the most lucrative lands in Africa.</p> <p>Theaceae trees with their leathery, serrated leaves stretch in every direction. They provide tea to Europeans, making millions for the multinational companies that operate in the region. Yet for 85-year-old Peter Torongei, and thousands like him, there is very little hope. His tin shack sits firmly in the area called \u201cSquatters Land\u201d.</p> <p>Torongei\u2019s ancestors once owned land on these rolling hillsides. But it was reallocated to white settlers, who planted tea. He barely has enough to feed his family and himself.</p> <p>Torongei is from the Kipsigis and Talai clans, who once lived in what are now known as Kericho and Bomet counties \u2013 land known locally as the \u201cWhite Highlands\u201d. They say they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/12/kenyans-who-claim-british-army-drove-them-from-their-land-seek-united-nations-inquiry\">moved by the British army</a>, under instructions from the former colonial administration, from their own rich lands to arid and disease-prone \u201cnative reserves\u201d where malaria was endemic and water scarce \u2013 with no compensation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95b9843b8df58f50866b8e23c6f0dd93d3234547\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95b9843b8df58f50866b8e23c6f0dd93d3234547/336_600_3923_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Torongei\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Torongei lives with his wife, Rodah, in a space divided into three makeshift rooms.

But those sent to live there, many of them children at the time, shared a \u201chostile environment not habitable for human beings\u201d, with its lions, reptiles, crocodiles, diseases, starvation and malnutrition.</p> <p>In 1962, some \u2013 like Torongei \u2013 were allowed to return to their homeland but put into a holding area. Five decades on, they are still living in \u201cpens\u201d, barely 50ft by 100ft, with no means of finding work or growing crops like their forefathers had done.</p> <p>Torongei, a father of six and grandfather of 10, lives with his wife, Rodah, in a space divided into three makeshift rooms. He has an eighth of an acre with his four sons and their children. The land taken from his father ran to more than 100 acres.</p> <p>The walls are adorned on one side with photographs of their children and grandchildren. On the other is a Manchester United poster.</p> <p>Torongei laughs shyly. \u201cYes, we like,\u201d he says. \u201cNever see \u2026 [but] Manchester good.\u201d</p> <p>Born in exile, Torongei tells how his parents were evicted and walked for 11 days, crossing 150km, to reach banishment in the barren Gwassi Hills with nothing but the clothes on their backs.</p> <p>\u201cI was born there in 1934. Our homes were torn down under instruction of the government. We lost our cattle, everything,\u201d says Torongei. \u201cWhen we came back from Gwassi, we found that other people had settled in our lands and we were basically homeless, so we were put into this holding area. There were roll calls to make sure that we did not escape from this place. We were kept in poverty.</p> <p>\u201c[When I see the tea plantations] I feel very sad that my land is still held by foreigners. All these years after independence \u2013 and I lived through that \u2013 other people benefit from my land.\u201d</p> <p>In his 85 years he has never had a place he could call home. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what my fate is because I have been told, for all these years, that I will be given land.</p> <p>\u201cLife here is particularly difficult because I cannot keep animals, we cannot keep any livestock, we cannot grow any crops, we are just living on subsistence with no income. My children could not go to school because we could not afford the fees, so we have lived in poverty all along.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses and looks at the ground. \u201cI am tired,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Torongei is not alone. There are 115,000 people originally from Kericho who claim they were forcibly removed from ancestral lands by the British.</p> <p>Other victims have slowly been trickling into central Kericho since 5am from villages across the county.

We were in peace,\u201d says the 94-year-old survivor of the mass deportation.</p> <p>Ngasura holds photographs of himself as a 10-year-old standing alongside Kenyan police, known as askaris, employed by loyalist chiefs to carry out atrocities, and British officers outside his former home in Kericho. He remembers the day vividly.</p> <p>He remembers the fear and confusion as he was separated from his family and the long walk to the alien plains of Gwassi.</p> <p>\u201cWe begged to be told where we were going, but the white people would not say. When we got to Gwassi we were put into a colonial government-constructed dormitory house which was subdivided, but several people died soon after we came,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a hard life. Many, many people died. The feeling of having been forcibly evicted from our land is still very painful. We had no means of survival. We had no land, no education, no livestock, nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Ngasura\u2019s brother and father died shortly afterwards from snakebites. Other relatives also died over the years.</p> <p>\u201cThere are too many to remember,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want one thing before I die. I want to lay my head somewhere, I want somewhere that I can call home.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Maina\u2019s family home was burned down before they were driven off their land.

We know that that is a very important investment for the nation and for the local community. But the historical injustice has to be addressed. And the desire is that there be compensation and that is why they\u2019ve been seeking audience with the British government. We\u2019ve been patient.\u201d</p> <p>There have been numerous attempts to pursue colonial-era injustices through the British courts. In 2013, the UK government agreed to pay out \u00a320m in compensation to more than 5,000 elderly Kenyans who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/18/uncovering-truth-british-empire-caroline-elkins-mau-mau\">tortured and abused</a> during the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s.</p> <p>But a more recent legal claim, raising the cases of a further 40,000 Kenyans who claimed they were variously tortured, mistreated and raped during the suppression of the rebellion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/21/judge-dismissed-kenyans-claims\">failed</a>.

Theaceae trees with their leathery, serrated leaves stretch in every direction. They provide tea to Europeans, making millions for the multinational companies that operate in the region. Yet for 85-year-old Peter Torongei, and thousands like him, there is very little hope. His tin shack sits firmly in the area called \u201cSquatters Land\u201d. Torongei\u2019s ancestors once owned land on these rolling hillsides. But it was reallocated to white settlers, who planted tea. He barely has enough to feed his family and himself. Torongei is from the Kipsigis and Talai clans, who once lived in what are now known as Kericho and Bomet counties \u2013 land known locally as the \u201cWhite Highlands\u201d. They say they were moved by the British army, under instructions from the former colonial administration, from their own rich lands to arid and disease-prone \u201cnative reserves\u201d where malaria was endemic and water scarce \u2013 with no compensation. A land grab that began in the early 20th century accelerated from the 1920s, with people sent to the Gwassi Hills, a run of steep hills located in Suba district on the banks of Lake Victoria, part of the Ruma national park. These hills \u2013 made up of deciduous forests, vast thickets and savanna \u2013 are areas of outstanding natural beauty. But those sent to live there, many of them children at the time, shared a \u201chostile environment not habitable for human beings\u201d, with its lions, reptiles, crocodiles, diseases, starvation and malnutrition.

Torongei, a father of six and grandfather of 10, lives with his wife, Rodah, in a space divided into three makeshift rooms. He has an eighth of an acre with his four sons and their children. The land taken from his father ran to more than 100 acres. The walls are adorned on one side with photographs of their children and grandchildren. On the other is a Manchester United poster. Torongei laughs shyly. \u201cYes, we like,\u201d he says. \u201cNever see \u2026 [but] Manchester good.\u201d Born in exile, Torongei tells how his parents were evicted and walked for 11 days, crossing 150km, to reach banishment in the barren Gwassi Hills with nothing but the clothes on their backs. \u201cI was born there in 1934.

Their testimonies are part of a complaint filed by British and Kenyan lawyers to the UN special rapporteur on the promotion of justice, Fabi\u00e1n Salvioli. Starting with the crown land ordinance of 1902, 36,000 hectares (90,000 acres) of land in Kericho is alleged to have been taken from the Kipsigis and Talai, and given to white European farmers. Lawyers say the UK pursued an intentional policy of violent displacement after realising the land in Kericho County was well suited to cultivating tea. They want the British government to open an investigation into the alleged crimes, arguing the treatment of these Kenyans between 1895 and 1963 amounted to a gross violation of human rights.

But a more recent legal claim, raising the cases of a further 40,000 Kenyans who claimed they were variously tortured, mistreated and raped during the suppression of the rebellion, failed. The high court refused to allow the larger Mau Mau case to proceed because it said the events had taken place too long ago for there to be a fair trial. This raised the question of how far back claims for compensation can be pursued. Personal injury claims are supposed to be brought within three years unless it would be inequitable to uphold such a strict time limit. Following a Guardian request to visit tea plantations, a spokeswoman for Unilever, which sources tea from Kericho for global brands such as Lipton, said the company purchased the plantations in 1987, and \u201cwe therefore cannot comment on historical claims being made against the British government from the colonial era\u201d. Williamson Fine Tea, and James Finlay Ltd, two other multinationals with major tea estates in Kericho, did not reply to requests for comment. For the moment there is frustration. \u201cThe later generations are still bearing the brunt of the suffering. They want a formal apology from the British government. They are ready to take further action if dialogue fails,\u201d says Chepkwony. \u201cIt\u2019s a very painful experience. They know that all the multinational companies are operating from stolen property. And this is a matter that needs to be settled.\u201d",

Clark\u2019s videos about the climate emergency (the subject of his PhD in theoretical atmospheric physics at Exeter) compete for views against those of climate change deniers who profess to be fellow EduTubers. YouTube has heavily promoted its educational content, and last year announced \u00a315m worth of investment in grants for creators providing high-quality output. But social media \u2013 YouTube included \u2013 often fails to identify problematic content. Stefan Molyneux, for instance, is a far-right nationalist YouTuber with nearly a million subscribers who claims that black people are genetically inferior. While PayPal has suspended his account, through which he received donations for his videos and podcast, YouTube is yet to do the same. Likewise, a raft of purportedly educational documentaries peddle conspiracy theories about crucial historical events on YouTube, such as PragerU, which promotes highly conservative educational videos around race and gender under the guise of being educational. For Dotson, the benefits of producing content that can help students understand a subject in more depth or decide which campus to spend three to four years of their life at outweigh the drawbacks. \u201cI like to think I\u2019m helping the people,\u201d he says. He\u2019s also sanguine about the fact his university hasn\u2019t yet approached him to collaborate. \u201cMy goal isn\u2019t to make the university run any more smoothly \u2013 it\u2019s to help the students.\u201d",

Johnson \u2013 who declined to take part in the first ever UK general election climate debate last week \u2013 will meet Trump during his three-day visit for the Nato leaders\u2019 meeting. In a letter to Johnson, the academics said Trump\u2019s \u201cunscientific denial\u201d of the risks of climate change was harming lives, making the world a more dangerous place and threatening the prosperity and safety of future generations. \u201cWe urge you to challenge President Trump about his irresponsible approach to climate change, and seek to persuade him to take strong domestic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to join coordinated international action including the Paris agreement,\u201d they wrote.

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> My husband and I own a flat in London. Our children have recently inherited some money which they wish to invest in something. Between them all they could afford to buy our flat off us if we sold it to them for the price we bought it for five years ago. This would mean we would be selling it to them for about 25% lower than its market value. Can we do this? We cannot afford to just give it to them. What are the pitfalls for them in owning it jointly as siblings? We have tenants in the flat so they would get a modest income from it. <strong>PB</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Provided all your children are over 18, yes, you can sell your flat to them. If they\u2019re not, no, you can\u2019t because a child under 18 can\u2019t own land or property in the UK. But assuming it is a possibility, whether you should go ahead with selling your flat to them at a discount price is quite another matter.</p> <p>Selling your flat to your children for the price you paid for it doesn\u2019t reduce any potential capital gains tax (CGT) bill because, for tax purposes, the gain (or loss) you make on disposal of the flat is taken to be the difference between its market value and the price you paid for it even if you sell for less that market value. The difference between the price your children pay and its true value also counts as a gift for the purposes of inheritance tax. However, if you\u2019re still alive seven years after making the gift, it loses its liability to inheritance tax.</p> <p>If your children are first-time buyers, they should think seriously about not buying your flat off you. Because they are not going to live in the flat, they wouldn\u2019t qualify for exemption from stamp duty land tax (SDLT) for first-time buyers who buy a home of their own costing up to \u00a3500,000 (the first \u00a3300,000 is zero-rated, 5% is charged on the remainder up to \u00a3500,000).</p> <p>If your children already own their own homes, as well as not qualifying for first-time buyer relief, they would also have to pay the higher rate of SDLT \u2013 which is the standard rate plus three percentage points \u2013 on the purchase of your flat.</p> <p>Whatever their current ownership status, they should be aware that they will be liable to CGT when they come to sell your flat (assuming they did buy it). There wouldn\u2019t be a CGT bill on selling a property which they had lived in as their main home.</p> <p>As for the pitfalls of joint ownership as siblings, you are better placed to identify potential problems than I am. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Q My husband and I own a flat in London. Our children have recently inherited some money which they wish to invest in something. Between them all they could afford to buy our flat off us if we sold it to them for the price we bought it for five years ago. This would mean we would be selling it to them for about 25% lower than its market value. Can we do this? We cannot afford to just give it to them. What are the pitfalls for them in owning it jointly as siblings? We have tenants in the flat so they would get a modest income from it. PB A Provided all your children are over 18, yes, you can sell your flat to them. If they\u2019re not, no, you can\u2019t because a child under 18 can\u2019t own land or property in the UK. But assuming it is a possibility, whether you should go ahead with selling your flat to them at a discount price is quite another matter. Selling your flat to your children for the price you paid for it doesn\u2019t reduce any potential capital gains tax (CGT) bill because, for tax purposes, the gain (or loss) you make on disposal of the flat is taken to be the difference between its market value and the price you paid for it even if you sell for less that market value. The difference between the price your children pay and its true value also counts as a gift for the purposes of inheritance tax. However, if you\u2019re still alive seven years after making the gift, it loses its liability to inheritance tax. If your children are first-time buyers, they should think seriously about not buying your flat off you. Because they are not going to live in the flat, they wouldn\u2019t qualify for exemption from stamp duty land tax (SDLT) for first-time buyers who buy a home of their own costing up to \u00a3500,000 (the first \u00a3300,000 is zero-rated, 5% is charged on the remainder up to \u00a3500,000). If your children already own their own homes, as well as not qualifying for first-time buyer relief, they would also have to pay the higher rate of SDLT \u2013 which is the standard rate plus three percentage points \u2013 on the purchase of your flat. Whatever their current ownership status, they should be aware that they will be liable to CGT when they come to sell your flat (assuming they did buy it). There wouldn\u2019t be a CGT bill on selling a property which they had lived in as their main home. As for the pitfalls of joint ownership as siblings, you are better placed to identify potential problems than I am.",

On Monday, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit announced it had agreed to commence an inquiry into the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages (RJIP) program, along with the Australian Research Council\u2019s administration of the national competitive grants program. Labor had written to the audit committee asking it to look into the program\u2019s administration after the auditor general released a scathing report into the Coalition\u2019s handling of the $220m regional jobs scheme. The shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, welcomed the committee\u2019s inquiry, and warned against a repeat of the government\u2019s failings with the administration of a new $200m special drought round to be awarded under the building better regions fund (BBRF). King said the criteria for the new funding round were \u201cso loose he [regional development minister Michael McCormack] can decide eligibility based on his feelings\u201d. \u201cRural and regional Australians living through this extended drought need support from the government, not uncertainty,\u201d King said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see councils and community organisations spending thousands of dollars and countless hours preparing an application only for the minister to arbitrarily rule them ineligible.\u201d King said McCormack needed to urgently clarify the rainfall and socioeconomic benchmarks for grant funding, and reveal how he would deem a location as eligible. In November, the government announced it would direct $200m from the BBRF to create a special drought round for drought-affected councils, providing up to $10m per project in regional local government areas. According to the guidelines, a ministerial panel chaired by McCormack has been established to make funding decisions for the program, and applicants must provide evidence that they are in a drought-affected region. The guidelines say that \u201cin addition to the assessed application and availability of grant funds, the ministerial panel, in consultation with cabinet, then decides which grants to approve\u201d. King said the RJIP process had exposed shortcomings with how grant funds were awarded, with the ministerial panel approving funding for 17% of applications against advice from the department, while overturning 28% of the department\u2019s recommendations. \u201cHard-working organisations missed out to companies that were trading while insolvent, under investigation from Asic and trying to raise matching funds with aqua tokens,\u201d King said. She also criticised the government for refusing to comply with a senate order to produce documents relating to the ministerial panel\u2019s decisions. On Monday, McCormack advised the Senate that he would not comply with the document order, claiming public interest immunity. \u201cThe documents requested if they were publicly released would damage commercial interests, including reputational damage to companies involved in open tender processes,\u201d McCormack said. Guardian Australia has reported a series of projects that received funding under the RJIP scheme that have raised questions about the assessment process, including a $205,000 grant to a dog breeder to build an aquaculture project on the south coast, with the venture to be funded by raising $5m in \u201caqua token\u201d cryptocurrency. A different project in the same electorate received $750,000 while possibly trading while insolvent, and in another instance, a grant in north Queensland was provided to a bus and ferry project that is losing money and is unlikely to happen for two more years. A former Nationals candidate was also a successful grant applicant, receiving $300,000 for a crocodile farm in the marginal seat of Capricornia, while in the Wide Bay Burnett area, the top eight projects recommended for funding based on the department\u2019s merit assessment were all overlooked, while two known political donors to the LNP were successful.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning and welcome to the final full week of the election campaign. Unsurprisingly, the horrific attack at London Bridge has dominated the news over the weekend. This morning the Conservatives stand accused of politicising the deaths of two victims of the attack, after Boris Johnson tried to blame Labour for the release of the terrorist who carried it out. We also have a taste of non-election news from across the country and around the world and you can follow our rolling election news here. What\u2019s going on? Boris Johnson has been accused of trying to create political capital out of the deaths of two people in the London Bridge terror attack. The prime minister was accused of twisting the facts of the London Bridge terror attack in a \u201cdistasteful\u201d attempt to turn it into an election issue. Despite the family of Jack Merritt, one of the victims, calling for the murder not to be exploited for political gain, Johnson sought to push a perceived political advantage on the issue, claiming that \u201ca lefty government\u201d was responsible for Usman Khan being freed. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, accused Johnson of going \u201cstraight from a tragedy to reheating pre-packaged political lines smearing the Labour party\u201d. Meanwhile, Merritt\u2019s father retweeted a post showing the front pages of the Mail and Express, which led on Johnson\u2019s \u201cblitz on freed jihadis\u201d, calling them \u201cvile propaganda\u201d and saying that his son \u201cstood against everything you stand for \u2013 hatred, division, ignorance\u201d. Johnson laid the blame for the attack at Labour\u2019s feet in a lengthy interview on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show yesterday, saying Labour was responsible for the automatic early release scheme under which the attacker was sentenced, though the reality is more complex. We\u2019ve fact-checked some of Johnson\u2019s claims in that interview here and John Crace sketched the exchange. MI5 has begun an inquiry into how a suspect whom they had under \u201cactive investigation\u201d could have launched such an attack and Johnson said there were \u201cprobably about 74\u201d convicted terrorists who had now been freed. Johnson\u2019s Marr interview, which was granted by the BBC despite the broadcaster\u2019s commitment not to allow the prime minister to appear on its flagship political programmes until he had committed to a sit-down interview with Andrew Neil, was one of two significant political television events last night. The other was the ITV leaders\u2019 debate, which featured leaders of all the parties except Labour and the Conservatives, who were represented by MPs. The most dramatic moment of the debate came as leaders attacked Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson for their closeness to Donald Trump. When challenged by Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson over Trump\u2019s comments about sexually assaulting women, Farage said that while the remarks were \u201cwrong\u201d, \u201cmen say dreadful things sometimes\u201d. A breakdown of the winners and losers of that debate is here. At a glance Labour has announced what it is billing as the biggest ever plan to cut rail fares, promising to immediately reduce the price of season tickets by a third. Facebook has banned a Conservative party campaign advert that used footage of the BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg and News at 10 host Huw Edwards, saying it violated the corporation\u2019s intellectual property rights. A combination of long-term cultural shifts and the fallout from the 2016 referendum have disrupted the electoral map in this general election, writes John Harris. Brexit supporters are more likely to live in areas most threatened by the economic impact of automation, according to a new report. The day ahead Boris Johnson will be in the south of England before he heads to a rally in the east of England. Jeremy Corbyn will be in London to talk about rail policies. The Lib Dem justice spokesman, Phillip Lee, will be in London to talk about mental health initiatives. Nigel Farage will campaign in North Wales. Nicola Sturgeon will visit Lockerbie, where she will warn that rural Scotland is among the areas most at risk from a bad Brexit deal. Sinn Fein will launch its manifesto in Londonderry. Ukip will launch its manifesto in London. Best of the rest &gt; Island nations who face inundation from rising sea levels have issued an impassioned plea to the industrialised world ahead of crucial climate crisis negotiations that open in Madrid today. \u201cWe see [these talks] as the last opportunity to take decisive action,\u201d said Janine Felson, deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States. The summit will hear that today\u2019s carbon emissions must be halved to restrain global temperature rises to 1.5C, after which it\u2019s believed low-lying islands and atolls will be inundated. The Paris agreement in 2015 set a 2C limit of heating above pre-industrial levels. You can read our guide to the summit, what\u2019s likely to be achieved and how fossil fuel lobbyists are pushing to water down planned EU rules to set science-based criteria for investment which claims to be environmentally sustainable. &gt; A strike by hundreds of train guards and drivers on South Western Railway will disrupt the UK\u2019s second biggest train operator from this morning. Some 600,000 passenger trips from Surrey, Hampshire and beyond into London Waterloo will be affected with services cut entirely on some routes and bus replacements on others. The strike, scheduled for 27 days (except for election day) is part of a dispute with the RMT union over the role of train crews. Only about half of normal weekday services will run. If you\u2019re affected, we\u2019d like to here from you. &gt; Malta\u2019s embattled PM, Joseph Muscat, has quit over the constitutional and political crisis triggered by the 2017 murder of the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Last night he expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d over the murder but his tone remained defiant: \u201cThis case cannot define everything that our country is,\u201d he said. Thousands had gathered on the streets of the capital ahead of his TV appearance, holding candles, waving Malta\u2019s red and white flag, and singing the national anthem, marking the conclusion of an emotional and angry demonstration. Muscat will stay in office until a new party leader takes over in early January.

The band\u2019s breakup in 2015 devastated fans, but took the pressure off, Payne says. Now he has a debut album launching this week. In One Direction, he admits to being \u201cMr Vanilla \u2013 no one wanted to know a thing\u201d. Then, with the \u201cchain and rapper phase \u2026 I didn\u2019t really know what I was aiming for, but it was actually exactly where we are right now. I just needed to find the right keys to make me feel like the man I wanted to be.\u201d Sport A double century by captain Joe Root gave England a first innings lead of 101 and an outside chance of forcing a win in the second Test in Hamilton overnight. But the Kiwis have reduced that deficit to five with one day to go. Spin-playing specialist Keaton Jennings is being considered for a recall for the tour of Sri Lanka in March. Leicester cut Liverpool\u2019s lead at the top of the Premier League to a mere eight points after their last-gasp 2-1 win over Everton at the King Power, while Manchester United let slip a lead at home to Aston Villa. The result prompted Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to say that his team\u2019s league position of ninth was \u201cnot the biggest concern\u201d. And England boss Gareth Southgate says the favourable draw for next summer\u2019s European Championships is a chance for the team to improve their \u201cappalling\u201d record in the competition. Lewis Hamilton ended his sixth world title season with a win in Abu Dhabi yesterday and hinted he may leave Mercedes for Ferrari. Business The number of insurers withdrawing cover for coal projects has doubled this year, making coal \u2013 the biggest single contributor to climate change \u2013 \u201con the way to becoming uninsurable\u201d, according to a new report. The Unfriend Coal campaign says it hopes that \u201cwithin two to three years it will be so difficult to obtain insurance that most coal projects won\u2019t be able to go forward\u201d. The report says US companies are beginning to take action, leaving Lloyd\u2019s of London and Asian insurers as the \u201clast resort\u201d for fossil fuels. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft have been named in a report by tax transparency campaign group Fair Tax Mark as avoiding tax by shifting revenue and profits through tax havens or low-tax countries, and for also delaying the payment of taxes they do incur. The report singles out Amazon as the worst offender, saying the group paid just $3.4bn (\u00a32.6bn) in tax on its income so far this decade despite achieving revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn. The pound is buying \u20ac1.172 and $1.291. The papers All but one of the front pages leads on the London Bridge attack: \u201cPM accused of exploiting deaths in terror attack\u201d is the Guardian\u2019s splash, next to a large picture of Saskia Jones, who was named as the second victim. The Times has: \u201cSpy chiefs on alert for London Bridge copycats\u201d and the Telegraph leads with, \u201cTerrorists freed early to be sent back to jail\u201d. The Mail\u2019s headline is: \u201cNew blitz on freed jihadists\u201d; the Express\u2019s headline reads, \u201cBoris blitz on freed jihadis begins\u201d; the Sun has \u201cThe angels stolen by pure evil\u201d; and the Mirror splashes with \u201cBetrayed\u201d. Only the FT goes with a different splash, instead leading with \u201cTCI boss calls for fund managers to be fired over emissions failures\u201d.

Amazon\u2019s two UK subsidiaries \u2013 Amazon UK Services and Amazon Web Services UK - had combined tax bills of only \u00a383m over the decade, as the bulk of sales are booked via Luxembourg. Amazon UK Services arm paid \u00a314m in corporation tax last year. Paul Monaghan, chief executive of Fair Tax Mark, said: \u201cOur analysis of the long-run effective tax rate of the Silicon Valley Six over the decade to date has found that there is a significant difference between the cash taxes paid and both the headline rate of tax and, more significantly, the reported current tax provisions. We conclude that the corporation tax paid has been much lower than is commonly understood.\u201d Alex Cobham, chief executive of Tax Justice Network, said: \u201cWhen multinational corporations abuse their tax responsibilities to society, they weaken the supports that our economies need to work well and create wealth. \u201cBy ensuring multinational corporations pay their fair share locally for the wealth created locally by people\u2019s work \u2013 based on an agreed formula and supplemented by a minimum effective tax rate \u2013 governments can strengthen their economies to run smoothly and make a good life possible for everyone.\u201d However, progress towards that goal was damaged last week when 12 small EU countries, including Ireland, blocked a proposed new rule that would have forced multinationals to reveal how much profit they make and how much tax they pay in each of the 28 member states. In a statement Amazon said: \u201cGovernments write the tax laws and Amazon is doing the very thing they encourage companies to do \u2013 paying all taxes due while also investing many billions in creating jobs and infrastructure. Coupled with low margins, this investment will naturally result in a lower cash tax rate.\u201d Facebook, run by Mark Zuckerberg who has a personal fortune of $77bn, has paid just $7.7bn in income taxes this decade, despite making profits of $75.5bn and revenues of $173.1bn, according to the report. The tax paid as a percentage of profit was just 10.2% over the period 2010-18, the lowest of the so-called \u201cSilicon Six\u201d. Facebook said: \u201cWe take our tax obligations seriously and pay what we owe in every market we operate. In 2018 we paid $3.8bn in corporation tax globally and our effective tax rate over the last five years is more than 20%. Under current rules we pay the vast majority of the tax we owe in the US as that is where the bulk of our functions, assets and risks are located. Ultimately these are decisions for governments and we support the OECD process which is looking at new international tax rules for the digital economy.\u201d The report also detailed smaller than expected cash tax payments by Google, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft. All of the companies said they paid the correct amounts of tax and disputed Fair Tax Mark\u2019s figures.",

A map of the parts of the UK likely to be hit by automation fits more closely with the map of leave voters than any other factor, said the Institute for the Future of Work (IFW). Up to 15 million workers are expected to have their employment prospects endangered by automation over the next decade, according to a series of reports that have tried to gauge the impact of new technology in the workplace. In 2015, the Bank of England estimated as many as 15m jobs would need to change or be lost through automation. A report by the consultancy firm PwC found that 10m, or 30%, of jobs in Britain were potentially under threat from breakthroughs in artificial intelligence In some sectors half the jobs could go, it warned. The institute, which was founded last year following a Future of Work commission chaired by the outgoing Labour MP Tom Watson, said a new group it termed the \u201cinvisible outsiders\u201d were governed by a heightened sense of insecurity associated with automation. It said they worked precarious or poor-quality jobs, though not necessarily part of the rising gig economy, and could be working in warehouses or in the manufacturing or security industries. They were more likely to have voted to leave the EU than other groups so far cited as providing the bedrock of the Brexit vote \u2013 the over 65s, women or those who are white and were born in the UK. In a discussion paper \u2013 entitled Automation, Politics and the Future of Work \u2013 the IFOW found a 1% higher probability of automation was associated with a 1.4% greater percentage of leave votes. Boston in Lincolnshire and Mansfield in Nottinghamshire topped the list of places facing automation, along with Harlow in Essex and Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.

Think about your own side, from the Corbyn-supporting left to the liberal remain hardcore, and absences and estrangements out in the country that still seem a long way from receiving any kind of convincing answers. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

But as I progress through Tate Britain\u2019s blockbuster William Blake exhibition on this Saturday afternoon, the sense of hostility from fellow London gallery-goers intensifies. At Blake\u2019s 1793 masterpiece Albion Rose, which measures a scant 25cm by 21cm, a scrum of visitors peer and crane over each other\u2019s heads. In front of Blake\u2019s 1805 The Temptation and Fall of Eve, I sense the unmistakable feeling of elbows on ribs. By the time I reach the room containing his Illuminated Books, I am on the verge of giving up \u2013 and I am not alone. Next to me, two middle-aged women discuss coming back on a weekday, when the exhibition will be less crowded. Perhaps it was to be expected: the exhibition has had rave reviews. But my experience was not anomalous. Venture to many blockbuster exhibitions, particularly on a weekend, and you\u2019ll often be met with overwhelming crowds. Is there a surfeit of public interest in art? Are galleries packing in the crowds to maximise profit? And how best to meet the growing demand for public art without turning museums into amusement parks, complete with heavily managed queues? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pleasant,\u201d remembers Alex Goudie, a 33-year-old civil servant from Liverpool, who went to the Saatchi Gallery\u2019s Tutankhamun exhibition last month.

      "body": "<p>Nearly five years ago, I saw One Direction live. Twice, on consecutive nights \u2013 on the first two dates of their On the Road Again world tour. Once was for work, to review the show. The other was for the sheer, heady, sugar-rush pleasure.</p> <p>I was, I\u2019ll admit, a little on the old side for a Directioner, even then. Most of the 45,000-odd crowd was much younger \u2013 not that that you would necessarily be able to tell from the saucy suggestions on their homemade signs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to draw attention to them,\u201d Liam Payne had said fussily<strong> </strong>on stage.</p> <p>It was an on-brand comment for the then-21-year-old Payne, who, had the harried, slightly anxious energy of a father-of-four at Disneyland. And no wonder: it was clear, even to me, that Zayn Malik had checked out, barely bothering to conceal his rolling eyes. He would be gone within the month, marking the beginning of the end (or \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d) for the biggest boy band in the world.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a point where every day, you didn\u2019t know whether it was going to be the end,\u201d says Payne, sitting in the offices of his PR company in central London. \u201cIt was so touch and go, at every single show. I was slowly losing the plot.\u201d</p> <p>Now 26 and almost totally tattooed, Payne has a new album on which he raps about getting rowdy on Bacardi and being \u201cfree\u201d from 1D. At the same time his very-nearly-naked form is plastered on buses and train stations in a provocative ad campaign for Hugo Boss. </p> <p>Yet Payne is as polite and agreeable as if he were talking to his best friend\u2019s mother. He is tired he says after an energetic early morning music video shoot. \u201cThere was a trampoline involved,\u201d he says, sucking on his silver Juul. \u201cIt was hell \u2013 but it will look great.\u201d</p> <p>Gym beast and sex symbol are relatively new tags. His role as the diplomat of the group was established from the time they were first assembled from five solo applicants on The X Factor in 2010.</p> <p>Payne auditioned when he was just 14, but was told by Simon Cowell to \u201ccome back in two years\u201d. He did \u2013 and, eyes serious beneath his enormous fringe, blew the judges away with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awhsOgmdq6w\" title=\"\">brassy rendition of </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awhsOgmdq6w\" title=\"\">Cry Me a River</a>.</p> <p>Growing up in Wolverhampton, he had been a talented cross-country runner. But a fan of Usher, Justin Timberlake and Chris Brown, he was drawn to singing as \u201cthe thing that made my parents proudest\u201d. His backup plan, had he not got through on X Factor, was to follow his father into an aircraft fitting factory.</p> <p>Once grouped in One Direction it took the five boys, then between 16 and 19, to pull together. \u201cAt the start we couldn\u2019t get past our own egos,\u201d says Payne. There would be fights over who got to sing what part, and even personal style. \u201cEverybody had their own little thing \u2013 it was like having four older brothers.\u201d </p> <p>Payne went on to write songs for the group, contributing to two-thirds of their 2014 album Four (arguably their best) and even earning a production credit on 2015\u2019s Made in the AM. But in the early days he would be the one to sing the opening part because, he was told at the time, he \u201cused to settle everybody\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3acb4f9525790afca43aec889c3c81f3e29cc95d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3acb4f9525790afca43aec889c3c81f3e29cc95d/0_143_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Payne says he was a more experienced performer than the other boys, and a \u201cbit more mature\u201d \u2013 which he puts down to spending more time with his dad than his peers, and being so focused on a career in showbusiness. \u201cI\u2019d lived a different lifestyle from 14 to 16. Most kids try alcohol and experiment \u2013 I never did any of that because I thought there\u2019s a chance that I might make it.\u201d</p> <p>Management took advantage of this, he says, telling him his \u201cvery specific role\u201d in the group was to keep the rest in line. \u201cI was like, that\u2019s great, innit \u2013 because then everyone in the band thinks I\u2019m a dick.\u201d He remembers one of the band\u2019s first hotel stays. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plates being thrown out the window, mattresses being ridden down the stairs, and I\u2019m getting calls from the manager saying: \u2018You need to sort it out\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t lost on the fans. Where Malik and Styles were the heartthrobs, Payne says he was classed as Mr Boring. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at the stadium, and if you get the least screams, it\u2019s like: \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>After a year playing 1D-Dad he gave up and learned to have fun. \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d \u2013 at which point, he notes wryly, the band\u2019s public image became more cheeky and carefree. \u201cAnd the more fun we had, the more successful it got.\u201d</p> <p>He recalls performing to sold-out stadiums night after night, seeing \u201chundreds\u201d of iPhones being thrown onstage in the vain hopes of their being returned with a selfie. \u201cIt\u2019s like the kids just lost their minds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were parts of it that were a bit shit, like there is with anything,\u201d he says, \u201cand there were parts of it that was just euphoria.\u201d</p> <p>He recalls seeing 15,000 fans camped outside his hotel room in Lima, Peru. Security had advised them to stay inside all day, and because \u201cthey were the adults, we thought they were in charge. Then over time we started to figure out that they weren\u2019t, and that\u2019s when we used to run off.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the adrenaline peaks of performing, followed by long troughs of tedium, were akin to a drug addiction, says Payne. He turned to alcohol. \u201cDoing a show to however many thousands of people, then being stuck by yourself in a country where you can\u2019t go out anywhere \u2013 what else are you going to do? The minibar is always there. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac2e4b9fbb57eb7edabb1784337898ad7009f205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac2e4b9fbb57eb7edabb1784337898ad7009f205/0_0_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Direction.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Direction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PictureGroup/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a time, he was also taking an epilepsy drug as a mood stabiliser that he says affected his cognitive functioning under certain lights. Payne says he had been well advised to take it, to counter the \u201cerratic highs and lows\u201d he was experiencing \u2013 \u201cI just needed a little bit of help to keep me stable\u201d \u2013 \u201cbut under certain lights on stage or during interviews, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell them my name\u201d.</p> <p>The day we meet, Payne has made headlines for telling Ant Middleton on the pair\u2019s Sky One show that the loneliness of fame had \u201calmost nearly killed\u201d him. When Middleton asked Payne if he had ever wanted to act on those feelings, Payne said that he had: \u201c100%\u201d.</p> <p>He is not inclined to discuss this today, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a bit dark,\u201d he says, a touch brusquely \u2013 \u201cbut yeah, it was very touch and go at times\u201d. This was both in 1D and afterwards, he clarifies. As One Direction got bigger and bigger, he says, \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t really know how to deal with this\u2019. Once you start, you can\u2019t really press the stop button.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d button, though, was easier \u2013 in mid-2015, four months after Malik\u2019s departure, the band made the decision together. \u201cIt was a little bit dark and twisted towards the end of it,\u201d says Payne, \u201cbut the last few shows were really beautiful moments because the pressure cooker had been let off.</p> <p>\u201cIt was almost like counting down to holiday \u2013 we were going to wake up that Monday morning with no schedule.\u201d Afterwards Payne was in therapy for two years, and took six months off. \u201cIt was difficult at the start, because I didn\u2019t really know anything about myself. It was a bit of a numb feeling.\u201d </p> <p>In early 2016, he started dating Cheryl Cole, 10 years his senior, and one of the X Factor judges to be wowed by his audition. He is vague about whether he thought coverage of the age gap in their relationship was sexist (\u201cFor me it\u2019s like, you love who you love\u201d), though he notes that the online rumour mill is now trying to claim his new girlfriend \u2013 19-year-old model Maya Henry, whose face in close-up is his iPhone wallpaper \u2013 is younger than she is.</p> <p>His son with Cole, Bear, will turn three in March. Payne had always wanted to be a young dad, but says he struggled at first. \u201cI built it up so much in my head. Finding your feet in that relationship between child and father \u2013 it\u2019s difficult.\u201d</p> <p>He contributed by cooking. \u201cCheryl was always really glued to Bear, so for me, I was like: \u2018What\u2019s my role in this? If I cook and look after her, then in turn I\u2019m looking after him\u2019 \u2013 that made sense to me.\u201d</p> <p>The couple publicly confirmed their split in July 2018, but continue to co-parent. Lately Payne\u2019s schedule has taken him away for weeks at a time, which is \u201calways difficult\u201d, especially now Bear is old enough to notice. \u201cBut he\u2019s good at using the phone and FaceTime.\u201d</p> <p>That schedule is about to get busier, with Payne\u2019s debut album as a solo artist finally out this Friday. Laden with chart-friendly trop house, trap and Latin pop influences, LP 1 plays like a water cannon aimed at commercial radio \u2013 there is even a Christmas song.</p> <p>It has been a long lead-up: the first single, Strip That Down, was released nearly two years ago and established Payne as the 1D member most influenced by contemporary hip-hop \u2013 perhaps too much so. A picture he posted to Instagram of himself in February 2018 wearing a chain necklace, flipping the bird and bragging about travelling by private jet was quietly deleted following ridicule.</p> <p>Amid the success of Strip That Down, which was streamed over 1bn times, Payne was also still \u201cstruggling\u201d with alcohol: \u201cI just hid it very well.\u201d He went on to spend an entire year sober \u2013 a necessary if boring step. \u201cMy social life completely plummeted. I always feel like you never get past the awkward first 10 minutes at a party, when everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Do we get up and dance, or do we just sit here?\u2019 I don\u2019t know whether it made me happier, but it was definitely needed.\u201d</p> <p>His more recent stint of self-discipline was to prepare for his nude photo shoot with model Stella Maxwell for Hugo Boss. In the lead-up, he was in the gym between \u201cfive and eight times a week, sometimes twice a day\u201d and eating mostly chicken and vegetables \u2013 with no carbohydrates after 2pm and nothing at all after 8pm. For the last \u201cstripping\u201d phase, he ate nothing but porridge and white fish for a month. \u201cIt was horrible \u2013 but it definitely works.\u201d</p> <p>The shoot had been his idea, inspired by campaigns featuring David Beckham and Mark Wahlberg \u2013 Payne\u2019s role models, whose cross-disciplinary celebrity shapes his own career goals. Last year he auditioned in front of Steven Spielberg for a part in next year\u2019s West Side Story remake, and has been submitting audition tapes irregularly since. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to manage the time in between being a dad, a boyfriend, singer, model and whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Between the trap beats, tighty-whities and tattoos is he attempting to put across a new, more grown-up image? \u201cOh yeah, definitely.\u201d</p> <p>In One Direction, he was \u201cMr Vanilla \u2013 no one wanted to know a thing\u201d. Then, with the \u201cchain and rapper phase \u2026 I didn\u2019t really know what I was aiming for, but it was actually exactly where we are right now. I just needed to find the right keys to make me feel like the man I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>Which is, he jokes, is \u201clike a really English Magic Mike\u201d. Do you like being objectified, I ask? \u201cI think it\u2019s quite funny,\u201d says Payne, clearly delighted. The other day, he says, someone sent him a picture of an old lady walking past an enormous blown-up poster of him in his pants. Not bad for Mr Vanilla, I say. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p><em>Liam Payne\u2019s <a href=\"https://liam-payne.lnk.to/LP1PR\">debut album LP1</a> is out on Friday 6 December.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 January 2020 to remove a reference to Liam Payne \u201cmaking the reserve list for the British Olympics team\u201d.</p>",

He would be gone within the month, marking the beginning of the end (or \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d) for the biggest boy band in the world. \u201cIt was a point where every day, you didn\u2019t know whether it was going to be the end,\u201d says Payne, sitting in the offices of his PR company in central London. \u201cIt was so touch and go, at every single show. I was slowly losing the plot.\u201d Now 26 and almost totally tattooed, Payne has a new album on which he raps about getting rowdy on Bacardi and being \u201cfree\u201d from 1D. At the same time his very-nearly-naked form is plastered on buses and train stations in a provocative ad campaign for Hugo Boss. Yet Payne is as polite and agreeable as if he were talking to his best friend\u2019s mother. He is tired he says after an energetic early morning music video shoot. \u201cThere was a trampoline involved,\u201d he says, sucking on his silver Juul. \u201cIt was hell \u2013 but it will look great.\u201d Gym beast and sex symbol are relatively new tags. His role as the diplomat of the group was established from the time they were first assembled from five solo applicants on The X Factor in 2010. Payne auditioned when he was just 14, but was told by Simon Cowell to \u201ccome back in two years\u201d. He did \u2013 and, eyes serious beneath his enormous fringe, blew the judges away with a brassy rendition of Cry Me a River. Growing up in Wolverhampton, he had been a talented cross-country runner. But a fan of Usher, Justin Timberlake and Chris Brown, he was drawn to singing as \u201cthe thing that made my parents proudest\u201d. His backup plan, had he not got through on X Factor, was to follow his father into an aircraft fitting factory. Once grouped in One Direction it took the five boys, then between 16 and 19, to pull together. \u201cAt the start we couldn\u2019t get past our own egos,\u201d says Payne. There would be fights over who got to sing what part, and even personal style. \u201cEverybody had their own little thing \u2013 it was like having four older brothers.\u201d Payne went on to write songs for the group, contributing to two-thirds of their 2014 album Four (arguably their best) and even earning a production credit on 2015\u2019s Made in the AM. But in the early days he would be the one to sing the opening part because, he was told at the time, he \u201cused to settle everybody\u201d. Payne says he was a more experienced performer than the other boys, and a \u201cbit more mature\u201d \u2013 which he puts down to spending more time with his dad than his peers, and being so focused on a career in showbusiness. \u201cI\u2019d lived a different lifestyle from 14 to 16. Most kids try alcohol and experiment \u2013 I never did any of that because I thought there\u2019s a chance that I might make it.\u201d Management took advantage of this, he says, telling him his \u201cvery specific role\u201d in the group was to keep the rest in line. \u201cI was like, that\u2019s great, innit \u2013 because then everyone in the band thinks I\u2019m a dick.\u201d He remembers one of the band\u2019s first hotel stays. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plates being thrown out the window, mattresses being ridden down the stairs, and I\u2019m getting calls from the manager saying: \u2018You need to sort it out\u2019.\u201d It wasn\u2019t lost on the fans. Where Malik and Styles were the heartthrobs, Payne says he was classed as Mr Boring. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at the stadium, and if you get the least screams, it\u2019s like: \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019\u201d After a year playing 1D-Dad he gave up and learned to have fun. \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u201d \u2013 at which point, he notes wryly, the band\u2019s public image became more cheeky and carefree. \u201cAnd the more fun we had, the more successful it got.\u201d He recalls performing to sold-out stadiums night after night, seeing \u201chundreds\u201d of iPhones being thrown onstage in the vain hopes of their being returned with a selfie. \u201cIt\u2019s like the kids just lost their minds.\u201d \u201cThere were parts of it that were a bit shit, like there is with anything,\u201d he says, \u201cand there were parts of it that was just euphoria.\u201d He recalls seeing 15,000 fans camped outside his hotel room in Lima, Peru. Security had advised them to stay inside all day, and because \u201cthey were the adults, we thought they were in charge. Then over time we started to figure out that they weren\u2019t, and that\u2019s when we used to run off.\u201d Yet the adrenaline peaks of performing, followed by long troughs of tedium, were akin to a drug addiction, says Payne. He turned to alcohol. \u201cDoing a show to however many thousands of people, then being stuck by yourself in a country where you can\u2019t go out anywhere \u2013 what else are you going to do? The minibar is always there. \u201d For a time, he was also taking an epilepsy drug as a mood stabiliser that he says affected his cognitive functioning under certain lights. Payne says he had been well advised to take it, to counter the \u201cerratic highs and lows\u201d he was experiencing \u2013 \u201cI just needed a little bit of help to keep me stable\u201d \u2013 \u201cbut under certain lights on stage or during interviews, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell them my name\u201d. The day we meet, Payne has made headlines for telling Ant Middleton on the pair\u2019s Sky One show that the loneliness of fame had \u201calmost nearly killed\u201d him. When Middleton asked Payne if he had ever wanted to act on those feelings, Payne said that he had: \u201c100%\u201d. He is not inclined to discuss this today, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a bit dark,\u201d he says, a touch brusquely \u2013 \u201cbut yeah, it was very touch and go at times\u201d. This was both in 1D and afterwards, he clarifies. As One Direction got bigger and bigger, he says, \u201cI was like: \u2018I don\u2019t really know how to deal with this\u2019. Once you start, you can\u2019t really press the stop button.\u201d The \u201cindefinite hiatus\u201d button, though, was easier \u2013 in mid-2015, four months after Malik\u2019s departure, the band made the decision together. \u201cIt was a little bit dark and twisted towards the end of it,\u201d says Payne, \u201cbut the last few shows were really beautiful moments because the pressure cooker had been let off. \u201cIt was almost like counting down to holiday \u2013 we were going to wake up that Monday morning with no schedule.\u201d Afterwards Payne was in therapy for two years, and took six months off. \u201cIt was difficult at the start, because I didn\u2019t really know anything about myself. It was a bit of a numb feeling.\u201d In early 2016, he started dating Cheryl Cole, 10 years his senior, and one of the X Factor judges to be wowed by his audition. He is vague about whether he thought coverage of the age gap in their relationship was sexist (\u201cFor me it\u2019s like, you love who you love\u201d), though he notes that the online rumour mill is now trying to claim his new girlfriend \u2013 19-year-old model Maya Henry, whose face in close-up is his iPhone wallpaper \u2013 is younger than she is. His son with Cole, Bear, will turn three in March. Payne had always wanted to be a young dad, but says he struggled at first. \u201cI built it up so much in my head. Finding your feet in that relationship between child and father \u2013 it\u2019s difficult.\u201d He contributed by cooking. \u201cCheryl was always really glued to Bear, so for me, I was like: \u2018What\u2019s my role in this? If I cook and look after her, then in turn I\u2019m looking after him\u2019 \u2013 that made sense to me.\u201d The couple publicly confirmed their split in July 2018, but continue to co-parent. Lately Payne\u2019s schedule has taken him away for weeks at a time, which is \u201calways difficult\u201d, especially now Bear is old enough to notice. \u201cBut he\u2019s good at using the phone and FaceTime.\u201d That schedule is about to get busier, with Payne\u2019s debut album as a solo artist finally out this Friday. Laden with chart-friendly trop house, trap and Latin pop influences, LP 1 plays like a water cannon aimed at commercial radio \u2013 there is even a Christmas song. It has been a long lead-up: the first single, Strip That Down, was released nearly two years ago and established Payne as the 1D member most influenced by contemporary hip-hop \u2013 perhaps too much so. A picture he posted to Instagram of himself in February 2018 wearing a chain necklace, flipping the bird and bragging about travelling by private jet was quietly deleted following ridicule. Amid the success of Strip That Down, which was streamed over 1bn times, Payne was also still \u201cstruggling\u201d with alcohol: \u201cI just hid it very well.\u201d He went on to spend an entire year sober \u2013 a necessary if boring step. \u201cMy social life completely plummeted. I always feel like you never get past the awkward first 10 minutes at a party, when everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Do we get up and dance, or do we just sit here?\u2019 I don\u2019t know whether it made me happier, but it was definitely needed.\u201d His more recent stint of self-discipline was to prepare for his nude photo shoot with model Stella Maxwell for Hugo Boss. In the lead-up, he was in the gym between \u201cfive and eight times a week, sometimes twice a day\u201d and eating mostly chicken and vegetables \u2013 with no carbohydrates after 2pm and nothing at all after 8pm. For the last \u201cstripping\u201d phase, he ate nothing but porridge and white fish for a month. \u201cIt was horrible \u2013 but it definitely works.\u201d The shoot had been his idea, inspired by campaigns featuring David Beckham and Mark Wahlberg \u2013 Payne\u2019s role models, whose cross-disciplinary celebrity shapes his own career goals. Last year he auditioned in front of Steven Spielberg for a part in next year\u2019s West Side Story remake, and has been submitting audition tapes irregularly since. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to manage the time in between being a dad, a boyfriend, singer, model and whatever.\u201d Between the trap beats, tighty-whities and tattoos is he attempting to put across a new, more grown-up image? \u201cOh yeah, definitely.\u201d In One Direction, he was \u201cMr Vanilla \u2013 no one wanted to know a thing\u201d. Then, with the \u201cchain and rapper phase \u2026 I didn\u2019t really know what I was aiming for, but it was actually exactly where we are right now. I just needed to find the right keys to make me feel like the man I wanted to be.\u201d Which is, he jokes, is \u201clike a really English Magic Mike\u201d. Do you like being objectified, I ask? \u201cI think it\u2019s quite funny,\u201d says Payne, clearly delighted. The other day, he says, someone sent him a picture of an old lady walking past an enormous blown-up poster of him in his pants. Not bad for Mr Vanilla, I say. \u201cExactly.\u201d Liam Payne\u2019s debut album LP1 is out on Friday 6 December. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 January 2020 to remove a reference to Liam Payne \u201cmaking the reserve list for the British Olympics team\u201d.",

Anne Haysman lives with her husband and 16-year-old son, Freddie, near Chingford\u2019s smart high street, an area where, she acknowledges, most people are comfortably off. But Freddie is severely autistic, and Haysman has seen his access to specialist short-break care \u2013 giving him somewhere to play safely during weekends and school holidays \u2013 being slashed as government funding for the Labour-led local authority has been <a href=\"https://walthamforest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/budgets-revenue-capital-2019-20.pdf\">cut by \u00a3120m</a><a href=\"https://walthamforest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/budgets-revenue-capital-2019-20.pdf\"> since 2011</a>, even as demand for special needs and disability provision has <a href=\"https://walthamforest.gov.uk/content/leader-council-clare-coghills-letter-gavin-williamson-mp-secretary-state-education-send\">risen by 20%</a>, according to the council.</p> \n<p>The result, she says, is that \u201cfamilies like ours find it\u2019s very hard to have their kids around all day with very little for them to do\u201d. Her son, she says is mischievous and stubborn, taking great pleasure in the things he enjoys like swimming and being outdoors. But as he gets older and physically stronger, she feels less confident taking him on outings by herself, \u201cand so one of the things he ends up doing is spending a lot of time inside watching YouTube videos\u201d.</p> \n<p>Closing a few play centres for children with special needs \u201cmight not seem like a massive thing, but it is all chipping away, making life, which is already difficult, that bit more difficult\u201d. She is angry, she admits, and concerned about what happens when Freddie leaves school at 19. \u201cEveryone tells me that if you think things are bad now, adult social care is much worse.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite some reservations about Corbyn, Haysman will vote Labour, and says that, for her, it feels particularly personal. \u201cI do think so, because if you vote Tory you are voting to make the lives of people who are struggling, people with disabilities, you\u2019re making their lives more difficult.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"221e47ea7293416ad88861c597d69f43d654d416\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/221e47ea7293416ad88861c597d69f43d654d416/0_74_2597_1558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Duncan Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Duncan Smith has been the local MP for 27 years.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Having witnessed a serious assault in the middle of the afternoon earlier this year, Haysman is also concerned about crime and policing \u2013 a theme which, in a Guardian callout to constituents that received more than 200 replies, came up again and again.

      "bodyText": "For three uninterrupted decades, in every election since 1989, Francis Roads has voted Green. Through the final gasp of Thatcherism, the Major years, the hope and disillusion of New Labour and the chilly decade of coalition and Tory austerity, he has stuck to his environmental principles and resisted the urge to vote tactically. Until last month, that is, when at a party meeting in his constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green, Roads was one of a number of members to suggest their candidate stand down to help elect Labour\u2019s candidate. The move \u2013 which was adopted \u2013 did not delight the party\u2019s leadership, but to Roads, a retired teacher and musician, there was no doubt that it was time, at last, to change his vote. Why? \u201cWell, because this seat has now become marginal,\u201d he says, \u201cand I really would like to see the end of Iain Duncan Smith, who I think is a dreadful man.\u201d Roads and his wife, Judith, also a retired teacher and musician, moved to their bay-fronted semi-detached house close to the North Circular ring road that runs through suburban north-east London, in 1971. They are concerned about policing and how long it takes to get a doctor\u2019s appointment, ashamed of the need for food banks and of the fact that homeless people are now common even here. But it is the prospect of Brexit \u2013 which appalls them \u2013 that has driven them to drastic measures. \u201cEven if the worst comes to the worst and we get that dreadful [Boris] Johnson again, if we could at least get Duncan Smith out it would be a Christmas present,\u201d says Judith. Chingford and Woodford Green is not the kind of seat where one might expect dramatic electoral reversals. This has long been deep blue Tory country, the current constituency made up of seats whose previous MPs include Norman Tebbit and Winston Churchill. Duncan Smith has been MP here for 27 years, during which time he has (briefly) led his party, been a key architect of austerity \u2013 most notably the loathed universal credit \u2013 and an outspoken advocate of hard Brexit as a member of the ERG. But since 2010, his majority has been steadily shrinking, and Labour now scents blood. The party\u2019s candidate, Faiza Shaheen, has an army of hundreds of activists and a seductive backstory \u2013 an Oxford-educated economist who grew up in a working class family in the constituency and has vowed she will never stand anywhere else. One profile described her as \u201cBritain\u2019s AOC\u201d \u2013 referencing another young leftwing woman who ousted a longtime incumbent \u2013 and at least one polling research company has identified Duncan Smith as being in \u201cvery serious jeopardy\u201d on 12 December. With Epping Forest and some leafy corners of Essex on its borders, there are certainly parts of the constituency that are extremely comfortable, their streets lined with grand, mid-century villas and big cars. Other areas, however, are much less flashy, and like many suburbs of the capital and other big cities, this is an area in transition, with families and individuals priced out of central London moving in to an area busy with construction \u2013 and bringing their politics with them. Walthamstow, where Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy has a huge majority, is just to the south, and despite Chingford\u2019s ultra-Brexiter MP, the constituency voted by a knife-edge margin for remain in 2016. * * * The effects of austerity, in any event, can touch anyone. Anne Haysman lives with her husband and 16-year-old son, Freddie, near Chingford\u2019s smart high street, an area where, she acknowledges, most people are comfortably off. But Freddie is severely autistic, and Haysman has seen his access to specialist short-break care \u2013 giving him somewhere to play safely during weekends and school holidays \u2013 being slashed as government funding for the Labour-led local authority has been cut by \u00a3120m since 2011, even as demand for special needs and disability provision has risen by 20%, according to the council. The result, she says, is that \u201cfamilies like ours find it\u2019s very hard to have their kids around all day with very little for them to do\u201d. Her son, she says is mischievous and stubborn, taking great pleasure in the things he enjoys like swimming and being outdoors. But as he gets older and physically stronger, she feels less confident taking him on outings by herself, \u201cand so one of the things he ends up doing is spending a lot of time inside watching YouTube videos\u201d. Closing a few play centres for children with special needs \u201cmight not seem like a massive thing, but it is all chipping away, making life, which is already difficult, that bit more difficult\u201d. She is angry, she admits, and concerned about what happens when Freddie leaves school at 19. \u201cEveryone tells me that if you think things are bad now, adult social care is much worse.\u201d Despite some reservations about Corbyn, Haysman will vote Labour, and says that, for her, it feels particularly personal. \u201cI do think so, because if you vote Tory you are voting to make the lives of people who are struggling, people with disabilities, you\u2019re making their lives more difficult.\u201d Having witnessed a serious assault in the middle of the afternoon earlier this year, Haysman is also concerned about crime and policing \u2013 a theme which, in a Guardian callout to constituents that received more than 200 replies, came up again and again. Woodford police station is one of almost 100 that have closed to the public in London since 2012; the number of Metropolitan police officers assigned to the wider Waltham Forest area fell by more than 10% in the two years to 2018. Stories of burglaries and car crime were common from those who contacted the Guardian \u2013 one respondent said casual crime was \u201cevident and even expected\u201d near his home in Woodford. It\u2019s a concern felt keenly by Lee Marcu, whose barber\u2019s and tattoo shop the CutFather sits opposite a large retail estate in Highams Park, to the south of the constituency. Having opened the shop two years ago aged just 24, he would love to see some help for small business owners from the new government. But after being burgled twice in the past year, his biggest concern is crime. Nothing much was taken from the till \u2013 he does not keep his takings in the shop overnight \u2013 but with \u00a31,200 excess on his insurance, it wasn\u2019t worth making a claim to replace his damaged door, locks and, in one case, \u00a3400 worth of products. \u201cI\u2019m just a young business owner trying to make a living. If someone breaks in, you can end up spending thousands, and no one knows about it.\u201d Marcu doesn\u2019t like to blame the police, but who could help? He has begun asking his neighbouring shop owners and even residents if they\u2019d like to chip in to pay for private security, though the logistics of making it happen, he is finding out, are complicated. \u201cI\u2019m not being funny, but I\u2019m here 10 hours a day, six days a week, I\u2019m working, working, working \u2013 and for small business owners like myself to have to go out and create a neighbourhood watch \u2026 I just feel we are having no backing from our [politicians].\u201d He will definitely vote, he says \u2013 \u201cI think everyone has to vote\u201d \u2013 but has no idea how. \u201cI believe everyone has to do their research, but I\u2019ll be honest with you, at the minute I am not happy with whatever I am seeing on the news.\u201d There is no denying, however, that there are some \u2013 perhaps many \u2013 in the constituency, who are broadly content with the direction of travel of the previous government, and would like to see more of the same.

Established in 2016, it was the first rep company at the Everyman in 25 years, and it almost brought the organisation to its knees.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/10/back-to-the-future-liverpool-everymans-new-rep-company-takes-stock-of-first-season\">a successful first season</a>, which won an award for innovation, the decision was taken to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2018/liverpool-everyman-pulls-plug-rep-company-two-years/?login_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestage.co.uk%2Faccounts%2Fusers%2Fsign_up.popup\">pause</a>\u201d the rep programme in late November 2018. That hiatus would become permanent. Less than a month later, the Everyman announced it was <a href=\"https://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/news/liverpool-everyman-drops-out-national-portfolio\">pulling out of the Arts Council\u2019s national portfolio</a> (NPO) for funding \u2013 a huge step for a theatre of the Everyman\u2019s stature and one that was taken because the strain the rep model had put on its finances meant it would not reach obligatory fiscal targets. Then high-profile board members \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46466184\">David Morrissey and Michael Mansfield QC</a> \u2013 left. In September, the executive director, Deborah Aydon, who had been in post for 15 years, <a href=\"https://www.everymanplayhouse.com/deborah-aydon-to-move-on-after-15-years-at-ep\">stepped down</a> as well.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary chain of events, especially at a theatre that three years earlier had won the Stirling prize for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/16/stirling-prize-riba-everyman-theatre-haworth-tompkins\">revered \u00a328m new home</a>, but also had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/apr/27/liverpool-everyman-resident-actors-local-heroes-gemma-bodinetz\">a proud tradition of rep theatre</a>. \u201cWe won the award for innovation [after the first season],\u201d says Bodinetz. \u201cI remember at the time, being so proud of that. But I realise now \u2013 with all honesty \u2013 that I hadn\u2019t quite understood what a massive thing we were doing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dae4801b9cd9c82ae2c48753e97feeb7d5c1f495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae4801b9cd9c82ae2c48753e97feeb7d5c1f495/0_74_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Bodinetz, the artistic director of the Liverpool Everyman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gemma Bodinetz, the artistic director of the Liverpool Everyman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bodinetz and current the Everyman chief executive, Fiona Gibson, say the problems with the rep theatre stemmed from not understanding the cost \u2013 both financial and in terms of time \u2013 that the company would demand. Although they don\u2019t regret it. \u201cI think if money had been a little bit more generous, and we\u2019d given it five years, it would have been a massive success,\u201d says Bodenitz.</p> <p>The rep company wasn\u2019t just seen as a misstep for the Everyman, but as an existential crisis for local theatre at large. If the Everyman \u2013 a theatre that was one of the most respected in Europe, with an <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/liverpool-everyman-theatre-boss-wins-13769736\">award-winning artistic director</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29650118\">a Stirling </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29650118\">prize-winning facility</a> \u2013 could not make this model work, what hope for the rest?</p> <p>One editorial asked whether the Everyman was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2018/lyn-gardner-liverpool-everyman-canary-coal-mine-regional-theatre/\">the canary in the coal mine for regional theatre</a>\u201d. The situation was more dire because it was happening during a period that was the most testing since the end of the 80s, when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/jul/06/whoswhoinbritishtheatre2\">government slashed arts budgets</a> and used the example of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s work as being the type of theatre that could pay for itself and therefore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-long-shadow-theatre\">warranted a place on British stages</a>.</p> <p>Nearly \u00a3400m has been cut from annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/28/councils-say-more-arts-cuts-inevitable-amid-rising-social-care-need\">local authority spending on culture</a> and the arts since 2010, according to research by the County Councils Network. The Arts Council budget, meanwhile, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/02/the-guardian-view-on-culture-funding-time-to-be-more-radical\">reduced by 30% since 2010</a>. In 2015, an Arts Council report showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/13/culture-spending-councils-arts-council-england\">a 17% drop in cultural spending</a> by local councils since austerity began. Bodenitz praises the local council and Arts Council support, but in Liverpool, where there\u2019s been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/liverpool-northern-austerity-tory-cuts-council\">a \u00a3816 per head fall</a> in day-to-day public spending since 2010, there\u2019s an inevitable knock-on effect. \u201cIt is hard,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cBecause people\u2019s \u2018leisure pound\u2019, if I can call it that, could go on so many things. So it\u2019s about making sure that what we do offer what they really want to see.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a substantial funding gap between London theatres and those outside of the capital. Since 2010/11 the Liverpool Everyman has received \u00a330,260,493 from the Arts Council, the Leeds Playhouse has been awarded \u00a322,417,718 and Manchester Royal Exchange \u2013 the only one of three to not have a huge capital investment project in that period \u2013 \u00a322,058,556. Compared to the National Theatre, which between 2018 and 2022 alone will receive \u00a366,800,000, the disparity is clear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ac3c1fa081c770788409b57f8236267b7da5415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ac3c1fa081c770788409b57f8236267b7da5415/0_19_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tessa Parr and Darren Kuppan in Hamlet at Leeds Playhouse.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tessa Parr and Darren Kuppan in Hamlet at Leeds Playhouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Lindsay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the Leeds Playhouse, artistic director James Brining paid close attention to what was happening further down the M62. A former director of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/9086483/Scottish-theatre-sensation-James-Brining-returns-home-to-Leeds-to-run-West-Yorkshire-Playhouse.html\">the Dundee Rep company</a>, he wanted Liverpool\u2019s gamble to pay off. But the Leeds United fan, who would read <a href=\"https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/latest-news/why-leeds-playhouse-s-creative-director-james-brining-carries-shell-collection-everywhere-1-9500016\">TS Eliot and Jane Austen on the Elland Road terraces</a>, felt that it was a case of great idea, but wrong place and time. \u201cIn an ideal world where we have more money, then you\u2019d have a small permanent company that you might do a show with, and they\u2019d go into schools and do work in communities,\u201d says Brining, who has been at Leeds Playhouse for seven years. \u201cIt\u2019s a really wonderful way of working, but in the current climate of British theatre it\u2019s a really difficult thing to pull off.\u201d</p> <p>The Leeds Playhouse has just finished its own multimillion pound makeover.

The Playhouse\u2019s new smaller performance space The Bramall Rock Void is seen as a place to test new writing, rather than having to make the immediate jump up to the larger Courtyard or main Quarry space, which seats 750. Leeds Playhouse\u2019s refurbishment was commissioned for four reasons: to make it more accessible, more sustainable, create the Bramall Rock Void, and generate more income from new bars and cafes.

      "bodyText": "The future of theatre in some of the UK\u2019s biggest cities remains under threat, regional artistic directors have warned, amid funding cuts and an ongoing search for sustainable business models. A year on from the collapse of Liverpool Everyman\u2019s repertory company, the Guardian spoke to the artistic director of that theatre, as well as those at Leeds Playhouse and Manchester Royal Exchange, all of whom are facing the same challenge: what does a contemporary, local theatre look like in 2019? Gemma Bodinetz, the artistic director of the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse theatres, attempted to answer that question with a bold, experimental rep company that harks back to the 70s \u2013 when Jonathan Pryce, Bill Nighy and Julie Walters all came through the Liverpool system. The rep model establishes an in-house acting team, who are embedded in a place and produce bespoke theatre. Established in 2016, it was the first rep company at the Everyman in 25 years, and it almost brought the organisation to its knees. After a successful first season, which won an award for innovation, the decision was taken to \u201cpause\u201d the rep programme in late November 2018. That hiatus would become permanent. Less than a month later, the Everyman announced it was pulling out of the Arts Council\u2019s national portfolio (NPO) for funding \u2013 a huge step for a theatre of the Everyman\u2019s stature and one that was taken because the strain the rep model had put on its finances meant it would not reach obligatory fiscal targets. Then high-profile board members \u2013 David Morrissey and Michael Mansfield QC \u2013 left. In September, the executive director, Deborah Aydon, who had been in post for 15 years, stepped down as well. It was an extraordinary chain of events, especially at a theatre that three years earlier had won the Stirling prize for its revered \u00a328m new home, but also had a proud tradition of rep theatre. \u201cWe won the award for innovation [after the first season],\u201d says Bodinetz. \u201cI remember at the time, being so proud of that. But I realise now \u2013 with all honesty \u2013 that I hadn\u2019t quite understood what a massive thing we were doing.\u201d Bodinetz and current the Everyman chief executive, Fiona Gibson, say the problems with the rep theatre stemmed from not understanding the cost \u2013 both financial and in terms of time \u2013 that the company would demand. Although they don\u2019t regret it. \u201cI think if money had been a little bit more generous, and we\u2019d given it five years, it would have been a massive success,\u201d says Bodenitz. The rep company wasn\u2019t just seen as a misstep for the Everyman, but as an existential crisis for local theatre at large. If the Everyman \u2013 a theatre that was one of the most respected in Europe, with an award-winning artistic director and a Stirling prize-winning facility \u2013 could not make this model work, what hope for the rest? One editorial asked whether the Everyman was \u201cthe canary in the coal mine for regional theatre\u201d. The situation was more dire because it was happening during a period that was the most testing since the end of the 80s, when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government slashed arts budgets and used the example of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s work as being the type of theatre that could pay for itself and therefore warranted a place on British stages. Nearly \u00a3400m has been cut from annual local authority spending on culture and the arts since 2010, according to research by the County Councils Network. The Arts Council budget, meanwhile, has been reduced by 30% since 2010. In 2015, an Arts Council report showed a 17% drop in cultural spending by local councils since austerity began. Bodenitz praises the local council and Arts Council support, but in Liverpool, where there\u2019s been a \u00a3816 per head fall in day-to-day public spending since 2010, there\u2019s an inevitable knock-on effect. \u201cIt is hard,\u201d says Gibson. \u201cBecause people\u2019s \u2018leisure pound\u2019, if I can call it that, could go on so many things. So it\u2019s about making sure that what we do offer what they really want to see.\u201d There\u2019s a substantial funding gap between London theatres and those outside of the capital. Since 2010/11 the Liverpool Everyman has received \u00a330,260,493 from the Arts Council, the Leeds Playhouse has been awarded \u00a322,417,718 and Manchester Royal Exchange \u2013 the only one of three to not have a huge capital investment project in that period \u2013 \u00a322,058,556. Compared to the National Theatre, which between 2018 and 2022 alone will receive \u00a366,800,000, the disparity is clear. At the Leeds Playhouse, artistic director James Brining paid close attention to what was happening further down the M62. A former director of the Dundee Rep company, he wanted Liverpool\u2019s gamble to pay off. But the Leeds United fan, who would read TS Eliot and Jane Austen on the Elland Road terraces, felt that it was a case of great idea, but wrong place and time. \u201cIn an ideal world where we have more money, then you\u2019d have a small permanent company that you might do a show with, and they\u2019d go into schools and do work in communities,\u201d says Brining, who has been at Leeds Playhouse for seven years. \u201cIt\u2019s a really wonderful way of working, but in the current climate of British theatre it\u2019s a really difficult thing to pull off.\u201d The Leeds Playhouse has just finished its own multimillion pound makeover. A \u00a315.8m facelift of its city centre building has been completed and offers a more welcoming appearance to the old West Yorkshire Playhouse location. For Brining, success at the new-look Leeds Playhouse will be measured on more than getting bums on seats. \u201cWe see mission as so much more than what is on our stages,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a civic function, which might sound like an old-fashioned idea or an ancient idea, but that\u2019s where our roots are.\u201d That function includes outreach programmes with refugees, offering rehearsal space to young theatremakers and hosting weekly events for over-65s.

      "bodyText": "All mobile phone users in China registering new SIM cards must submit to facial recognition scans, according to a new rule that went into effect across the country on Sunday. The guidelines, first issued in September, require telecoms companies to deploy \u201cartificial intelligence and other technical methods\u201d to check the identities of people registering SIM cards. All physical stores in the country have had until 1 December to begin implementing the new standards. The measure, described by the ministry of industry and information as a way to \u201cprotect the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace\u201d, makes Chinese mobile phone and internet users easier to track. Already, mobile phone users are required to register SIM cards with their identity cards or passports and many telecoms had begun scanning customers\u2019 faces since last year. Many social media platforms also require users to sign up with their \u201creal-name identities\u201d via their phone numbers. The expansion of the use of facial recognition in China, from middle schools to concert venues and public transport, has begun raising concerns about information security and consent. In November, a professor filed what is believed to be the country\u2019s first lawsuit against the use of facial recognition. Guo Bing, a professor at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University alleged that a safari park in Hangzhou violated the country\u2019s consumer rights protection law by scanning his face and taking his personal data without his consent. China\u2019s education ministry said in September it would \u201ccurb and regulate\u201d the use of facial recognition after parents grew angry when facial recognition software was installed without their knowledge at a university in Nanjing to monitor students\u2019 attendance and focus during class. Experts also caution that China lacks regulation on how facial recognition can be used. More than two dozen Chinese technology companies have begun drafting national standards for the industry. Human rights advocates described the measure as another step toward \u201cdystopian surveillance state\u201d, in which Chinese cities will more closely resemble the Xinjiang region, where citizens are constantly monitored for signs of unrest or dissent. The ministry has said the rule will protect citizens from phone scams and prevent the reselling of SIM cards as part of cybersecurity and antiterrorism campaigns. On the microblog Weibo, many internet users were supportive of the move, with one writing: \u201cAs someone who has had their identity stolen, I feel relieved.\u201d Another said: \u201cEven though this is coming too late, I support it.\u201d But others were not confident the new rule would strengthen information security. One user wrote: \u201cIf privacy laws are not sound \u2026 then you really do not have the right to require more and more personal information from the people. We just want to live in a society where our information is safe. Why is it so difficult?\u201d In response to mobile phone users submitting to face scans, one commentator said: \u201cI will not. My number has already been sold and now my face will be too? Another said: \u201cPlease leave us with some privacy.\u201d \u201cThere is not even a little space for freedom. Everything is controlled. You cannot say what you want or choose what you want,\u201d another said. Lillian Yang contributed additional reporting",

Spicer, who hosts the documentary, drew criticism from sexual assault and family violence survivors and advocates after the ABC failed to blur out the names of some survivors of sexual abuse or harassment before the documentary was posted on its media-only TV publicity site. Advocates argued Spicer should never have allowed the details to be filmed. A portion of one woman\u2019s email to Spicer was filmed by camera crews without the woman\u2019s consent, which was particularly concerning to the woman because her alleged abuser worked in the media. The ABC edited out the stories and details of the women affected before broadcasting the documentary. On Monday, before part two of the documentary was aired on the ABC, lawyer Michael Bradley from Marque Lawyers confirmed three clients had received a letter from Spicer\u2019s lawyers about social media posts in relation to the exposure of the survivors\u2019 details. One client was the woman whose alleged abuser worked in the media. Another was not part of the documentary but is an advocate for assault survivors. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a letter of demand stating my clients have been defaming her and ordering certain social media posts be taken down,\u201d Bradley told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey were pretty disappointed to receive the notices. They have no interest in getting involved in a legal fight.\u201d Spicer\u2019s lawyers also demanded an apology from the women and $1,500 in legal costs from one of the women. Bradley told Guardian Australia the women had removed social media posts but no legal fees had been paid to Spicer, and they had not apologised. After news of Spicer\u2019s letter was published by News Ltd on Monday Spicer told Guardian Australia she had sent the notices to the women in order to avoid taking legal action. \u201cThere are many factual inaccuracies in today\u2019s news.com.au article, including the headline,\u201d she said in a written statement. \u201cNo notice has been issued to any of the women who appear in the documentary. Any legal notices issued on my behalf aimed to correct inaccuracies or misinformation placed in the public domain which were distressing to the survivors who bravely told their stories in Silent No More. These private notices were sent in a genuine attempt to resolve the issue outside of the litigation process.\u201d She did not expand on what the inaccuracies were. When it was first revealed that the ABC had failed to blur the women\u2019s names in the publicity version of documentary, it apologised for the error, saying: \u201cWe removed the program from our media portal as soon as we became aware of the error. \u201cThe welfare of those who have suffered sexual abuse or harassment is of utmost importance to the ABC and we wish to assure them that Silent No More will treat these issues with respect and care while shining a light on the need for positive change in this area.\u201d Spicer said at the time she was \u201cutterly gutted\u201d by the error: \u201cI apologise deeply and unreservedly to those whose names were visible in that initial version of the program.\u201d Spicer was promoting the documentary on Monday, tweeting: \u201cTonight\u2019s episode will feature Mandy, one of the rare survivors who won her case, and dissects the backlash against #metoo.\u201d In November Spicer accepted the Sydney peace prize alongside the US-based founder of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke, for her award-winning investigations into sexual harassment in media workplaces.",

With Christmas and, no doubt, long afternoons of board games coming up, perhaps some OBO\u2019ers might benefit from them.</p> <p>1) The most commonly landed on position is jail. People get sent there routinely, as well as passing it naturally. Since 7 is the most commonly rolled number with two dice, buying orange properties makes the most sense.</p> <p>2) It\u2019s a restricted housing market. Once there are no houses left to buy, people cannot expand there earning capacity. Therefore the optimum strategy is to put 4 houses on everything you own - not hotels, since these return houses to the box (the market) - and dry up supply. Your competition can\u2019t compete.</p> <p>It is truly an evil game. Happy Christmas!\u201d</p> <p>Surely you just buy everything on which you land?

It seemed that New Zealand\u2019s seamers were just hammering away on a middle and leg line to Joe Root, well back of a length, and that on this featherbed of a wicket, this approach was simply feeding paddles and pulls. I know Wagner loves banging it in all day long, but what exactly were they trying to achieve there? It\u2019s not as if they were packing the field on that side to dry us up with leg theory. It made for very odd viewing. I went off up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire with a furrowed brow. Any light to shed?\u201d</p> <p>I guess they were trying to make him antsy by drying up the runs, but it didn\u2019t work.

And no, this isn\u2019t something I think because England are poised to lose it \u2013 like all normal people, I take enormous pleasure in watching the team I support suffer \u2013 but is something I think because the pitches have been as dull as these pitches have been.</p> <p>Of course you want conditions to be different around the world, of course you don\u2019t want every pitch to be green; of course you enjoy slow periods, of course you don\u2019t want matches done in fewer than four days. But you should want every track, however flat, to offer something to the bowlers \u2013 whether pace, bounce or turn \u2013 and you should want every track, however flat, to have some character. </p> <p>But here we are now, perhaps on the cusp of liveliness. England need to make runs as quickly as possible in order to force a win, while New Zealand will want quick wickets to set up a slog then a skittling. Fingers crossed, pals. </p> <p><strong>Play: 10.30am local, 9.30pm GMT</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-01T20:40:39.811Z\">at 8.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Ali Martin\u2019s match report from day four at Seddon Park: So England\u2019s day, Root\u2019s day in particular, but England might have hoped to squeeze another wicket or three from the final session. Shout out to Neil Wagner too. The weather looks like being a pain tomorrow, but do join us for the last day of the series. Thanks for all the messages, time for some shut eye. Good night! Joe Root: \u201cIt might do a little bit more in terms of up and down, a couple of wickets you just never know in the morning but we\u2019ve given ourselves a chance.\u201d (talking about his partnership with Pope)\u201c It was crucial, we knew we needed some platform. It is not Olly\u2019s particular way of playing, so he showed a lot of maturity. We were looking to declare at tea, would have liked another 30-40 runs.\u201d (his own innings)\u201cIt was nice, I felt pretty good all the way through to be honest. I managed to find a good tempo throughout, even though I didn\u2019t scores as freely as I normally would. I\u2019ve felt close for a long time. \u201c 34th over: New Zealand 96-2 ( Williamson 37, Taylor 31) Ross Taylor? He just can\u2019t resist flapping at Stokes, sending him flying perilously close to gully and down to the boundary for four. But he survives and, with a flick, the umpires pocket the bails. 33rd over: New Zealand 91-2 ( Williamson 36, Taylor 27) Time, with the clock arms nudging towards the half hour, for an over of wrist spin. Joe Denly sends down a neat and tidy maiden, almost drawing Taylor into a false shot. Ian forth has a question: Didn\u2019t there used to be little hatches under the grass into which you could place a helmet? Whatever happened to them? Disappeared into the same black hole as 8 track cartridges and DVD players, I presume. You\u2019re right. Where are they? And what is an eight-track cartridge? 32nd over: New Zealand 91-2 ( Williamson 36, Taylor 27) Stokes still causing problems for Ross Taylor, who nearly nudges him to Dom Sibley under the helmet at short leg, before looking awkward in all kinds of ways during the rest of the over. In response to your rhetorical query regarding late England capitulation in a game otherwise dominated by the bat, I offer one word and a number: Adelaide, 2006. worries Brian Withington (I genuinely feared at the time that Flintoff\u2019s declaration was premature.), Never fear Brian, all is under control. 31st over: New Zealand 90-2 ( Williamson 36, Taylor 26) Ooof unlucky! Woakes sends one wide of legstump which Williamson leaves alone, Pope can\u2019t get a hand to either, and it cannons into the helmet. Five runs. The deficit now just 11. 30th over: New Zealand 83-2 ( Williamson 35, Taylor 25) Ross Taylor is hit on the glove as Stokes delivers a short one. Then he ducks into an even shorter one. Then he swipes at another, but doesn\u2019t quite get on top of it. A boundary to finish the over, but I reckon Stokes will be happy with that. Taylor looked frisky and eager for the charge. Jofra Archer goes off the pitch and Matt Parkinson runs enthusiastically on to it, tucking his shirt into his trousers as he goes. 29th over: New Zealand 78-2 ( Williamson 35, Taylor 20) Root gives Chris Woakes a last spell before stumps, a wise choice, he bowled excellently earlier. Williamson eases one through the off side, no power it seems, but what timing, and they run three. The wind must be getting up as we see two men in deck-chairs wrapped up for warmth in their All Blacks towels. 28th over: New Zealand 75-2 ( Williamson 32, Taylor 20) Williamson and Taylor towel down at the end of Stokes\u2019s over. Williamson, I can report, unlike Alastair Cook, does real sweat. Taylor played an ugly swipe-stroke-hook off Stoke\u2019s last ball that could have gone anywhere, but actually went nowhere. The shot of a tired man. 27th over: New Zealand 74-2 ( Williamson 31, Taylor 20) We\u2019re heading into the final half hour. Taylor and Williamson seem pretty secure here, unless England can force an error or the ball suddenly plays tricks, deviating low. Curran tip-toes in, ball angled into Taylor\u2019s toes. A pair of magnificently camp policemen do a round of the ground. 26th over: New Zealand 72-2 ( Williamson 30, Taylor 20) Stokes again; Taylor, bang, four through the off side. These two are inching New Zealand towards parity. 25th over: New Zealand 66-2 ( Williamson 30, Taylor 14) A Curran maiden and this is all a bit sleepy. Morning Tanya, writes Rob.Or afternoon, here in Bali (thought I\u2019d keep it topical and slip in an annoying brag).Just catching up on the last hour\u2019s events and I notice you\u2019ve dubbed His Lord Kaneness the king of watchful waiting.Now I have this stuck in my head: Who should I sue? You\u2019re in Bali, you\u2019re not getting a bean. 24th over: New Zealand 65-2 ( Williamson 30, Taylor 13) Stokes grabs the ball, and immediately makes something happen, striking Williamson right in the guts, tummy button area. Williamson gasps. A maiden. Abhijato Sensarma has been admiring Williamson from afar. \u201cWilliamson blossomed as a public figure during the World Cup. We all knew he was a class batsman, but the mature and witty way in which he handled the press conferences both during and after the event showed what a great man he is. Humility is intrinsic to his behaviour, and he deserves every bit of success he\u2019s got along the way. Here\u2019s a link to a fantastic interview of his at the Oxford Union which everyone - cricket fan or not - should listen to! (Controversial note: I think his beard is better than Kohli\u2019s.) Thanks Abhijato, I\u2019ll watch that later. 23nd over: New Zealand 65-2 ( Williamson 30, Taylor 13) Taylor comes out of his shell to pull Curran dirtily for four. And the sun pops out again. 22nd over: New Zealand 59-2 ( Williamson 30, Taylor 8) Time for some Stuart Broad. Dot-to-dot, bar a scribble where Williamson pulls him square lazily. Zaph Mann is back: Through the medium of Aldred \u201cBrian - of course I know that, it was in the initial days - the first adopters were often boorish boasters. Still relevant - why do a corporate advert with your every message?\u201d Shall we lay this one to rest? 21st over: New Zealand 55-2 ( Williamson 26, Taylor 8) A fat wide from Curran. I got it wrong, by the way, it is Curran Chameleon the Barmy army are singing and singing and singing and singing... At least no-one is trapped on public transport with them, like I was with United and Villa fans yesterday. I wouldn\u2019t object so much if it was more tuneful. Yours, disgusted of Tunbridge Wells. I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s no need for New Zealand to risk it. Surely England couldn\u2019t be bowled out on this pitch in less than a day? Impossible, no? 20th over: New Zealand 49-2 ( Williamson 25, Taylor 4) Archer resumes, after clutching his knee in his last over. Root has his arms folded, but looks pretty happy - it\u2019s been a good match for him. Williamson eases the ball through extra-cover for a couple. Karma Chameleon comes on the PA, and the sun has disappeared. 19th over: New Zealand 45-2 ( Williamson 22, Taylor 3) It\u2019s gone all bromantic out there. Stuart Broad puts his hands on Sam Curran\u2019s shoulders - there must been a good 8 inch height gap - and then Ben Stokes does the same to Jofra Archer. Curran has Williamson ducking again, elegantly, though not quite as elegantly as before. A maiden. 18th over: New Zealand 45-2 ( Williamson 22, Taylor 3) Oh, that\u2019s the best moment of cricket of (my part of) the day: a hot potato from Archer, fired in short, and Williamson bends back further, further, further till he\u2019s on his knees, his back horizontal to the ground, and the ball whisks past his helmet. Honestly, it\u2019s wonderful. That is grade 8 flexibility. Another email! Thank you Ian Forth. Talking of bragging, in the early \u201890s where I worked people still sent out all-agency house notes when they were going on holiday. Most people just said \u201cI\u2019ll be away from the 7th till the 21st\u201d or whatever. Apart from one group of people. They insisted on letting the world know \u201cI will be skiing from the 7th till the 21st\u201d. Then bored you to death with tales of cheese fondue and chalet hi-jinks on their return. A cheese fondue would be nice, right now. 17th over: New Zealand 43-2 ( Williamson 21, Taylor 3) Williamson is perfecting his leave here. Either he\u2019s very, very good at it, or that was a touch risky as Woakes fired one a tooth-comb\u2019s distance away from off-stump. Another excellent over. Filter-coffee leftovers are certainly a good source of protein for plants, taps Ian Copestake so as far as watering a plant with coffee you are literally on good grounds. Boom-boom! Thanks Ian. And that\u2019s DRINKS. 16th over: New Zealand 43-2 ( Williamson 21, Taylor 3) The ball is rubbed repeatedly on Archer\u2019s right thigh. He ambles back, and liquids in. He fires a nasty shot one into Williamson, which Williamson ducks into and it hits him near the elbow, just where the protection ain\u2019t. The commentators want to see more revs on the speedometre. 15th over: New Zealand 42-2 ( Williamson 20, Taylor 3) This: 14th over: New Zealand 41-2 ( Williamson 19, Taylor 3) Another good over, this time from Archer. The ball spits unpredictably off the pitch. Williamson loses temporary control of his mindfulness , then guides him away through, you know, his favourite area, for four. Hi Tanya, writes Brian Withington.. At the risk of disillusioning trend-setting Zaph, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily any bragging involved in the \u2018Sent from my iPhone message\u2019 - I believe it\u2019s a default setting. Talking of default settings, has Kane Williamson always been such a ridiculously good batsman? That\u2019s quite a segue Brian. 13th over: New Zealand 36-2 ( Williamson 14, Taylor 3) Chris Woakes toys with Ross Taylor, sending the cotton reel this way, sending the cotton reel that way. Taylor is tempted. An excellent maiden. 12th over: New Zealand 36-2 ( Williamson 14, Taylor 3) Williamson is up on his toes, trying to deal with Archer, then cramped by one that skids through. Perhaps this pitch is thinking about becoming two-paced, which won\u2019t please the New Zealand batsmen one bit. Ah, more good vibes for Jeet Raval. 11th over: New Zealand 33-2 ( Williamson 14, Taylor 1) Just a single off an on-message Woakes. A messages ping in about Jeet Raval. \u201cNot sure I\u2019m entirely comfortable with the commentators making light of anxiety and mental side of the game, writes Sachin Paul. A couple of overs ago , Ian Smith mentioned how Raval\u2019s scrambled mind was irrelevant and how he had one job and that was to open the batting and to not know that he had hit the ball was shocking/inexcusable. From where I\u2019m sitting , Raval was anchors even before the innings started and is in a bad place mentally and should be left alone else it\u2019ll be a Trott like situation.\u201d 10th over: New Zealand 32-2 ( Williamson 14, Taylor 0) The heavyweights are at the crease. Williamson spoils what would have been a maiden from Archer by speeding him through cover for four. 9th over: New Zealand 28-2 ( Williamson 10) It\u2019s a double change, as Broad is sent down to chew the cud and the bristle-bearded Woakes takes over, with immediate effect. Do cactus plants like cold coffee? I guess I\u2019ll find out. Another good catch by Root and New Zealand are in a bit of a hole here! A bit of extra bounce from Woakes, a bit of width, and Latham obliges with a push forward and an edge. 8th over: New Zealand 28-1 (Latham 18, Williamson 10) It\u2019s Jofra time! Two long sleeves on today. He sends a couple of deliveries down before handing the ball to the umpire with a question mark. It is delivered back with a full stop. The wind ruffles Archer\u2019s trousers. Williamson watches carefully - one squirts through quite low, then he lets the rest past harmlessly. Speed in the 130-135kph bracket. Hah! writes Zaph \u201cI put the \u2018sent from my Commodore in my email signature years ago when I first received \u2018sent from my iPhone\u2019, to take the piss out of the braggers. It started a mini trend - I\u2019ve had replies with \u2018Sent from my Maytag\u201d and \u201cSent from my Commode\u201d 7th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Latham 18, Williamson 8) Stuart Broad has summoned a man in short sleeves carrying a giant iron hammer. He thwacks into the surface to try and even out the footmarks. \u201cMore\u201d roars Broad, and points to the other side of the stumps. Latham flicks him off his pads, head over hands, rather nicely for four. Then Ben Stokes dives full throttle to stop a square drive from Latham. 6th over: New Zealand 18-1 (Latham 10, Williamson 8) There\u2019s a few clouds floating about thoughtfully but the weather should hold for the rest of the day - another 30 or so overs left. A quiet over from Curran, five stolen runs. James Fitzpatrick is still awake, over the Irish sea. \u201cIt is amazing how the moon reflecting off windshields can be mistaken for Jack Frost, and warm cumulus mist for freezing fog, as we bask in mid night Julyesque temperatures. Shorts for me tomorrow. My point. Short one really. Today may be great for Root, but it is a disaster for England long term. He\u2019ll be kept on now simply because of what he can do with the bat, but there is a lot more to being a captain than scoring runs. He is the proverbial summer swallow, always hinting at more, but arriving way too early and with few mates to make a difference. It is a plaster on a gaping wound, will it work, crossing everything you have and hoping, praying, maybe, but in reality England will not win a foreign tour without addressing the thorny issue of Captain, and what to do with Joe. He played great today and yesterday all the same, some batsman. 5th over: New Zealand 13-1 (Latham 6, Williamson 6) Broad is slightly stooped as his runs in, as befits his father of the house status, then straightens up in the crease. Root has two slips and two gullies for Williamson, who is the king of watchful waiting. 4th over: New Zealand 12-1 (Latham 6, Williamson 6) Curran again, five dots, carefully played by Williamson, then he prods him through the covers for a couple. 3rd over: New Zealand 10-1 (Latham 6, Williamson 4) Broad on the money, though Latham brusquely sends one to the cover boundary. An email from Avitaj Mitra: Must say I love Neil Wagner running in to bowl. Me too! He pretty much personifies the word \u201cwholehearted\u201d.About England\u2019s chances to win.. yay or nay in your opinion? My un-educated guess is that the pitch will prevent a last-gasp victory dash. 2nd over: New Zealand 5-1 (Latham 1, Williamson 4) Oh my, the replays seem to show that Raval did get an edge onto his pad. Quite a large one. His confidence is obviously so shot that he didn\u2019t trust himself to judge. My days. Anyway. Williamson angles his bat and sends the ball on its merry familiar route down to the third man boundary. Another bad day at the office for Raval, pushes forward second ball, absolutely plum. No stay of execution from his partner and off he trudges. 1st over: New Zealand 1-0 (Latham 1, Raval 0) I don\u2019t want to sound too rock n roll, but I missed the first few balls of this innings after mislaying my hot water bottle. Settle down in time to see New Zealand go for a ridiculously optimistic single, the ball went to Zak Crawley at midwicket who threw. An inch more accurate and Raval would have been out without needing the help of the third ump. Hello Tanya, writes Zaph Mann. In case you missed the morning Bumble was talking about the game \u201cOwzat!\u201d, I had the as a kid but found 1) there were too many wickets and 2) You couldn\u2019t get away with playing during school classes. I invented a better game - where every letter of the alphabet equalled some occurrence in cricket - i.e.: common vowels (a, e, i) were one run, less frequent letters counted for more runs and infrequent letters brought chances of wickets (depending upon the following letter in the complex version) Advantage - you put the cheat sheet on a bookmark, start \u2018studying\u2019 (going letter by letter) and appear to be taking motes (doing the scorecard). - playable during class\u2026 Zaph, that sounds brilliant. I never really played, but my brothers did and kids do. I\u2019ll pass your message on. But I\u2019m almost more intrigued by the sign off on your email: Sent from my Commodore . I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a commodore since the 1980s when a school friend whose dad worked in computing invited me over to play Mini Munch man. After Daniel oversaw a wicket-less first half of the day, I\u2019ve watched England lose 5-21 in half a session without even moving my lips. A wonderful innings by Root, a solid to good one by Pope. Five wickets for Wagner, carved in sweat and gurning. The players take tea, with England ahead of the game, but the weather dubious for tomorrow. Let\u2019s see what Archer and Broad can cook up with the new ball. Gosh, I\u2019ve just seen the Craig McMillain get-up on Sky that was mentioned earlier - he\u2019s come as Dick van Dyke. Broad misses a straight one, a three ball run-less cameo. The ball after stacking his legs apart and posting Wagner for a huge six over the fence, Archer drags a full slower ball back onto his stumps. Great double bluff by the world\u2019s busiest bowler. 162nd over: England 468-8 (Archer 1, Curran 6) Curran eyes up Southee and slaps him with an old frying pan through the covers for four. They slide through for a couple of singles and the lead edges up to 95. 161st over: England 464-8 (Archer 1, Curran 6) Wagner runs in again. Archer does a bit of housework, brushing flakes of dust away from the crease, before greeting the ball with a defensive prod. Is Pope the answer to England\u2019s middle order prayers? asks OB Jato. I reckon so, starting low down the order and moving up. I saw him scores a brilliant century at Guildford in 2018 against Somerset. Luckily for him, selector Ed Smith was sculling around too. 160th over: England 463-8 (Archer 0, Curran 3) A pause, while England regain some sanity breath. Three singles. Good morning again Tanya Oh Brian Withington, I\u2019ve been waiting for too long. Well Atherton was right on the money and I got my wish for Joe Root to go very big. Been a cracking weekend after West Ham\u2019s improbable win at Chelsea with a third choice debutant keeper, and then my son\u2019s 10 man Worcester team getting through to the last 32 in the FA Vase after extra time - five rounds down, four left to Wembley. (And said son scored his first of the season.) Happy days. Time for Curran to have some fun. Well done Withington junior! 159th over: England 460-8 (Archer 0, Curran 3)Wagner steams in, slightly angled approach from the right of my television. Imagine a stepping stone path, with Wagner pushing stones further and further into the soil with each steaming step. Archer lets his two balls pass safely by. The England lead is 85. Woakes fancies a bit of a swish, half bends the knee, throws the bat and edges behind to Watling. Bish, bash, boosh, England are tumbling away. That was the third wicket to fall for 5 runs, in 12 balls. 158th over: England 459-7 (Woakes 0, Curran 2) We watch Root trudge off, a hint of a smile on his face. As there should be. That has bought him time, if time is what he wants. And the great redemption song comes to an end. Root dances down the wicket and slaps the ball to deep extra cover to give Santner his first wicket of the game. Williamson and others chase after him to shake his hand as he walks off. 157th over: England 457-6 (Root 222, Curran 0) Well played Ollie Pope. Still staggered by the unselfishness of that shot - self-sacrifice might seem a good idea on paper, but it is a very different thing to actually carry out. It was his highest Test score in a partnership of 193 with Root. Pope gives it some welly as, seemingly, instructed. He tries to pull a wide one from Wagner and is caught out in the deep. That was a very unselfish shot, just 25 short of his century. 156th over: England 450-5 (Root 221, Pope 74) Pope and Root scurry between the wickets, pushing here, tipping there. Perhaps they\u2019ll give themselves till tea. Can Pope squeeze the other 26 runs he needs? Meanwhile, Ian Forth throws a scrap down from his statistical bed, \u201cIf Root can get to 228, he\u2019ll have the third highest score for an English test batsman against New Zealand. He\u2019ll struggle to crack the top two though - Hammond and Edrich both scored triple tons.\u201d 155th over: England 445-5 (Root 218, Pope 72) I think there was something in that there water at drinks. First Root slaps the ball straight into Wagner\u2019s leg. Then Pope has a huge slog, baseball style straight down the ground for four, then an upper-cut. Frisky. 154th over: England 437-5 (Root 215, Pope 67) Thanks Daniel for safely guiding Root to his double-century and Pope to fifty, and a big hello to everyone else. Santner sends one gently past Pope\u2019s edge and he gets all-in-a-fix momentarily, but survives. The advertising panel next to the OBO is offering me a facelift in a bottle, which seems a bit harsh - it is 1.51am (GMT) after all. Don\u2019t expect miracles. 153rd over: England 435-5 (Root 214, Pope 66) Wagner returns for another spell of self-flagellation and Root splices a mow that drops just short of the sliding Williamson, who ends up on top of the ball. They run one, and I wonder if we\u2019ll see him get close to a triple century; it\u2019s certainly going for him, because after Pope adds a single, another inside edge takes the ball close to the stumps before Watling parries it just wide of the helmet. They run two, and that was an exceedingly odd over bowled. Right, that\u2019s drinks, and Tanya Aldred is here to coax you through to the end of the day. 152nd over: England 431-5 (Root 211, Pope 65) It\u2019s good of England to put some overs into the NZ bowlers\u2019 legs before they go to Australia later this month. Santner comes back on, and Pope, who\u2019s scoring more easily now, takes one to leg before Root does likewise to long off. 151st over: England 429-5 (Root 210, Pope 64) Here we go! Root gets a leading edge to Henry\u2019s first ball that drops just short of him, then caresses a gorgeous straight six back over the bowler\u2019s heed. Two singles follow, and the lead is now 54, but it\u2019s worth remembering that rain is expected tomorrow afternoon so they\u2019ll be better getting NZ in sooner rather than later, even if it means they need to thrash 80 runs at some point. 150th over: England 421-5 (Root 203, Pope 63) Root\u2019s highest Test score is 254, which he got against Pakistan in 2016; there\u2019s no reason to think he won\u2019t pass that today. He gets two closer by clipping Mitchell\u2019s first ball off his pads then, after a single, Pope murders a wide slower ball for four. He loves that shot square of the wicket, though I\u2019d even have backed myself to give that the treatment, so miserable was it. \u201cPlease wish James Debens the best of the season, with my Holiday Songs XI,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cPringle Bells The Holly and the IVA Richards Once in Rahul Dravid\u2019s City Nagamootoo They Know It\u2019s Christmas?

AND THERE IT IS! CLASS IS PERMANENT! Root defends a corner into the ground, sets off on a boust, and Pope hurls himself to the strikers\u2019 end ... direct hit and he\u2019s gawn, but the throw misses! What an innings this has been! The two batsmen embrace in the middle, then chuckle at the run out that wasn\u2019t between overs. 148th over: England 413-5 (Root 199, Pope 59) Pope thrashes a single to deep cover - he\u2019s picked out the fielders a lot today, but he\u2019s finding the middle of the bat nicely. Root then takes another single off his pads - he\u2019s now one away from some red hot base 10 action; the nervous 190s have been negotiated with ease and speed. Pope then drives two to long off, and Root will have strike at the start of the next over. 147th over: England 409-5 (Root 198, Pope 56) Pope keeps ticking along \u2013 two singles to him from this latest Henry over, Henry having replaced Southee \u2013 and one to Root. 146th over: England 406-5 (Root 197, Pope 54) Mitchell returns and Root, caught on the crease, immediately administers the thick inside edge; for the second time today, the ball only just passes the stumps. the run two, which raises England\u2019s 400, and the next delivery is the 400th he\u2019s faced. He\u2019s getting close to what\u2019d be his third Test double ton, and two more to midwicket take him to 193 before an expert\u2019s dab to the third man fence adds another four. Root is now one of England\u2019s top 10 run scorers, as noted by Michael Meagher. \u201cHe\u2019ll surely finish his career no worse than second on that list,\u201d he says. 145th over: England 398-5 (Root 189, Pope 54) Root cuts behind square and Mitchell parries, so they run two, then he deflects a single to leg. 144th over: England 395-5 (Root 186, Pope 54) In lopes Santner, as threatening as a pair of rubber y-fronts, and England add five more singles. Surely they\u2019ll want 45 minutes or so to have at NZ this evening, so need to get a wriggle on. 143rd over: England 390-5 (Root 183, Pope 52) Bumble is properly talking about Bairstow as a potential England Test opener. I\u2019ve not clue, really I do not \u2013 his mentality and technique seem so ill-suited to that role. Five off this latest Southee over. \u201cA friendly rebuttal from Kolkata,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cood morning to Mr Banerjee! I live in Kolkata myself, and can account for the atmosphere he misses. Cricket is something everyone has some knowledge of in the city. It can be a means of bonding with anyone from a new schoolmate to one\u2019s boss at the office to any random soul you meet in a bus ... The city breathes sports, which people often find as a means of escape, and an opportunity to be a part of something much grander then themselves. The OBO community has been a wonderful place for a cricket fanatic like me too. The warmth in its coverage and correspondence is one of the best things about following the sport. A heartfelt thanks to all involved in it!\u201d 142nd over: England 385-5 (Root 181, Pope 49) Pope gets another run close with a cut to deep point - he likes that shot a lot. Root then nearly feathers a catch to backward point, takes a single to cover, and there it is! Pope bangs a drive to point, it\u2019s fumbled, and he eases through - well batted you mortifyingly young and accomplished individual who already knows joy I will never comprehend. 141st over: England 383-5 (Root 180, Pope 48) But he almost rinses himself, pinned on the crease by Southee and under-edging just past the stumps, before playing four more dots and turning one to midwicket. England are on the charge! 140th over: England 382-5 (Root 180, Pope 47) Santner keeps going \u2013 I wonder if they\u2019ll try getting after him. Root takes one to point and Pope does likewise to cover. I daresay he\u2019ll free his arms if he can nurdle just three more. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no Return of the Mac, Millings!\u201d says James Debens. \u201cThe Saw DRS CWC ChinMusic Factory The Black Cap Crowes Christal Gayle Sweet Scyld O\u2019 Mine Electric Lightmeter Orchestra The Barrington Knights The Jazz Sanga Queens of the Stone Agar Slipknot Cordon C.OldPlay Fine Leg Cannibals Manic Sweep Preachers MCC Hammered 139th over: England 380-5 (Root 179, Pope 46) Southee has the ball and begins with a leg-side sighter, after which Root takes one to cover and the commentators snigger at a bloke minding his own business enjoying an ice cream. Hilarious. \u201cDid you realise when you referred to shmondery it is now the only reference in an English article to the word in Google,\u201d emails Carl Jepson. \u201cThe other five references appear to be in Russian. Was that a bet amongst the OBO team. If so, well played sir.\u201d I daresay I\u2019m the only one of our number interested in such, but I also looked it up to check the spelling and was surprised there was no other reference to it. \u201cBoust\u201d is another word I think exists nowhere but in the OBO \u2013 it means to travel extremely quickly and usually recklessly, but only in very select areas of mid-90s north London. Righto, we\u2019re set to go again... In other choking up news, Kishalay Banerjee emails: \u201cAs a graduate student living in a rented room in Bristol, I have missed watching cricket on television for the last year (except the World Cup, which I caught at the pub). Although arguably, I miss the intense discussions of our small group of cricketing enthusiasts back in Kolkata even more, mostly due to the time difference. The OBO has been my main source of cricketing information this year, and more than the updates, I have especially enjoyed the emails and anecdotes sent in by the other readers. They\u2019ve made me feel that I am connected to the global community of lovers of this beautiful game, even while sitting in a room late at night. Today, I finally came around to adding my two pence to it, and to mention how grateful I am that such a forum exists.\u201d The great Rob Smyth created that community - I like to see it as a kind of online TMS. Sky have just played a long interview with Mark Wood talking us through the World Cup final, which is to say that I am absolutely gone, yet again. I imagine it\u2019ll be available online and, if not, it\u2019s part of some Xmas special or other. Don\u2019t miss it \u2013 he\u2019s a brilliant and compelling talker. And seeing as we were talking about Gordon Greenidge, here\u2019s this. Anyway, lunchtime reading: That was excellent from Root, who moved things along nicely, while Pope will be better for having gutsed that out. He needs just four to get to his maiden Test fifty, but will be fancying something bigger than that. 138th over: England 379-5 (Root 178, Pope 46) When was the last time England batted a session for no wickets lost? Er, yesterday, but over the last couple of years they\u2019ve been bowled out in a session more often, I shouldn\u2019t wonder. Root takes one from Santner\u2019s over, and that\u2019s lunch. 137th over: England 378-5 (Root 177, Pope 46) In comes Mitchell again for what\u2019s probably the penultimate over before lunch, and following a single, England take the lead when Pope cracks four to backward point. Each run is worth double now, except for the fact that it isn\u2019t. \u201cOi Debens! Get off ma turf!\u201d advises Mac Millings. \u201cAll-time 80s and 90s Alternative Bands XI: MS Sebadhoni Neil PJ Harvey Sachin Tendulkarter the Unstoppable Sex Machine Mervana Codeine Jones Boredomsinic Cork Scratch Acid Lohmann The Fall Allott Dwayne Leverocket from the Crypt Fred Trumans Water My Bloody Alf Valentine.\u201d 136th over: England 373-5 (Root 176, Pope 42) On reflection, I feel like I did the word shmondery a disservice \u2013 it generally describes something badly made and/or cheap, rather than just something rubbish; please forgive me. The batsmen take a single each from Santner, and the lead is two. 135th over: England 371-5 (Root 175, Pope 41) In commentary, they\u2019re reminiscing about a catch Don Topley took in the 1984 series England played against West Indies. That\u2019s actually the first series I remember - or, at least I remember Greenidge\u2019s double ton at OT - but YouTube is silent on the grab, so let\u2019s enjoy this one instead. One off the over. 134th over: England 370-5 (Root 175, Pope 40) Another Santner over, two singles from it, and Pope is up to 40 \u2013 a decent effort given he\u2019s not been middling it. \u201cYou might be the final arbiter on this one,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cMy wife occasionally uses the term \u2018no schmutter\u2019 to indicate something of high value, whereas I feel it applies only in the garment industry. Who is correct? Many thanks for marital harmony.\u201d I\u2019m not sure my wife would consider me the final arbiter on anything, but I\u2019d lean towards your wife. Someone who works in the rag trade is said to work in schmutters, and a rag is called a schmutter, but the word can be used to describe anything of substandard - though, myself, I prefer the word shmondery for that. 133rd over: England 368-5 (Root 174, Pope 39) Mitchell returns; would it be better to be called Daryl Mitchell or Mitchell Daryl? Is Daryl Mitchell intended to rhyme? Pope takes a single towards point, then Root flows two to cover and bunts one to square leg. 132nd over: England 364-5 (Root 171, Pope 38) Santner offers Root a little more pace, so he opens the face to steer four through third man; then top edges a slog sweep that lands safely as they run two; the sweeps nicely in front of square for four. That\u2019s ten off the over and the hunnert partnership; have England gone? 131st over: England 354-5 (Root 161, Pope 38) Pope takes one to cover, then Root does likewise. If the scores are roughly level at lunch, then do England thrash to put time back in the match, or bat sensibly to maximise their lead? 130th over: England 352-5 (Root 160, Pope 37) Santner fiddles through another over which yields a single from its final ball, slapped by Pope to point. \u201cSpeaking of Monopoly (which you weren\u2019t, but the commentators were, apparently)\u201c says David Horn, \u201cI once heard a radio interview with an expert who shared his strategy for maximising the chances of winning. With Christmas and, no doubt, long afternoons of board games coming up, perhaps some OBO\u2019ers might benefit from them. 1) The most commonly landed on position is jail. People get sent there routinely, as well as passing it naturally. Since 7 is the most commonly rolled number with two dice, buying orange properties makes the most sense. 2) It\u2019s a restricted housing market. Once there are no houses left to buy, people cannot expand there earning capacity. Therefore the optimum strategy is to put 4 houses on everything you own - not hotels, since these return houses to the box (the market) - and dry up supply. Your competition can\u2019t compete. It is truly an evil game. Happy Christmas!\u201d Surely you just buy everything on which you land? I always preferred Ratrace as it goes. 129th over: England 351-5 (Root 160, Pope 36) Pope takes one to square leg, the only run off the over. We\u2019ve been playing two hours, but have another half-hour to go because of the early start. 128th over: England 350-5 (Root 160, Pope 35) What do New Zealand do now? England have played a few false shots this morning and one or two were close to hitting the stumps, but they\u2019re not exerting much pressure now. One off Santner\u2019s over. 127th over: England 349-5 (Root 160, Pope 34) Nice from Pope, cutting Henry\u2019s fourth ball for four to backward point, after Root nurdles a single to leg. Pope adds one more, and the lead is now down to 26; England should eliminate that before lunch, and can then see what\u2019s what in the afternoon. James Debens is back! \u201cDev, Doosra, Beefy, Mick &amp; Katich; ECB40; The Brian Closetown Massacre; The Botany Bay City Rollers; Peter, Chanderpaul &amp; Mary; Tendulkarsticks; Dravid Bowie and the Spiderlegs From Mitch Marsh; KP and the Sightscreen Band; Fat Freddie\u2019s Dropped; Benaud &amp; The Jets; Brotherhood Of Simon Mann.\u201d 126th over: England 343-5 (Root 159, Pope 29) In commentary, they\u2019re talking about what they liked buying in Monopoly, which tells you all you need to know about how compelling the action isn\u2019t. Luckily, we\u2019ve got this conversation and me detailing this conversation to sustain us; three singles off the over. 125th over: England 340-5 (Root 157, Pope 28) England make up for that fruitful over by taking just three from the next, one dabbed by Root to third man, two flicked by Pope into the leg side. 124th over: England 337-5 (Root 156, Pope 26) After Pope twists to midwicket, Root guides four to fine leg, and three singles follow; that\u2019s more like it. \u201cFish fingers\u201d says Gilad McAteer, which is a chirpse if ever I\u2019ve heard one. \u201cNot your Asda smart price (although i did live off them at uni so no disrespect intended), but Birds Eye over any fancy gastropubs attempt any day. Cheers, whats the score again?\u201d Not sure, but I am sure that we hope it\u2019s chips it\u2019s chips. 123rd over: England 329-5 (Root 150, Pope 24) Root\u2019s 150 came off 335 balls, which is an absolute load by any standard, never mind his. He\u2019s facing when Henry returns, playing out a maiden. 122nd over: England 329-5 (Root 150, Pope 24) Santner, who had just one over earlier, returns; there\u2019s not a whole lot happening for him, and after a single to each batsman, Root works another off his pads that raises his 150. He raises his bat, but in businesslike manner; there\u2019s work yet to do. 121st over: England 326-5 (Root 148, Pope 23) Root flicks to leg for two; are we saying a daddy is 150+? I think I\u2019d go 170+. Anyway, he\u2019s a run closer when he chops to point and calls for two but adds one; Pope then cracks for to backward point, and my days he\u2019s worked hard for that, by far his best shot of the morning. 120th over: England 314-5 (Root 145, Pope 19) Pope takes one, then a shorter one from Mitchell takes tiiiiime to arrive at Root, who sends it away to fine leg for four. A further single follows. \u201cSurely everyone can agree a proper greasy spoon fry up is better than any fancy-dancy bottomless brunch offer. Pound for pound the best meal out there,\u201d emails Chef Pig and Fiddle. I can\u2019t argue with that: no dry plate and beans in a separate container, but yes scope for oozing sauce, yolk and fat. And i\u2019d also add biscuits: though I have an extremely soft spot for Sainos\u2019 Taste the Difference triple chocolates, I\u2019d take a Maryland over any posh cookie, any day. 119th over: England 313-5 (Root 140, Pope 18) Wagner resumes and Root nudges to cover, raising the 50 partnership; Pope then does similarly. So, at what point do England move? I guess that pace of the pitch makes that tricky in any case, but they\u2019ve got two batsmen in and a series to save. 118th over: England 311-5 (Root 139, Pope 17) Mitchell finds a spot of bounce but directs the ball at Root\u2019s pads; he helps it around the corner for one. The gap between the sides is now 64, and that\u2019s drinks. 117th over: England 310-5 (Root 138, Pope 17) Eeesh! Wagner attacks Root from around and Root stretches forward to impart and inside edge that goes into his back foot and misses leg stump by a breath. Next ball, Root dabs down to third man and they run one; that\u2019s it with the scoring for the over. 116th over: England 309-5 (Root 137, Pope 17) Pope reminds himself to watch the ball as he plays out a maiden from Mitchell \u2013the second of the day. \u201cI\u2019m watching the Sky coverage as well as following the OBO - I\u2019m sure plenty of others do this. No? Oh.\u201d begins Matt Emerson. \u201cAnyhoo, Craig McMillan\u2019s getup raised eyebrows here too, not only because of what he was wearing (a flat cap! Indoors!) but because it was so ill-fitting I suspect he\u2019d borrowed them off someone else. On the \u2018sharing bag\u2019 discussion I\u2019ll put a shout in for the M&amp;S giant buttons. Fancy.\u201d Tangentially, there any arena in which cheap stuff is so much better than dear stuff, than chocolate? 115th over: England 309-5 (Root 137, Pope 17) A single to each batsman and Root\u2019s first false shot of the morning, an inside edge of Wagner into his pad. \u201cOf the maligned Bicknell, Ilott, McCague, Caddick, Gooch, Thorpe 1993 attack,\u201d says Ian Forth, \u201chalf of them were still playing test cricket for England in 2003. Fair to say Thorpe was no longer a significant component in the bowling discussions, though. What did he bowl, can you remember?\u201d RMF: right-arm medium, filth. 114th over: England 307-5 (Root 136, Pope 16) Mitchell into the attack with the NZ lead 73, and Root clips a single off his toes to reduce it yet further as in commentary they complain about how many interruptions there\u2019ve been to play, for kit to come on and off and such. Pope then flashes at a wideish one, inside-edging for four - he looks pleased with that. \u201cSorry, but did you say beer and a tab at 14?\u201d asks Peter Salmon. \u201cI can see how that bowling attack might have made anyone reach for the acid, but it still seems a little precocious to me. Or is that just how funky Guardian OBO types have to be?\u201d Only 14 but my mind was older, to paraphrase Mobb Deep and then Lin-Manuel Miranda. But I\u2019m fairly sure that was common behaviour amongst my peers. 113th over: England 302-5 (Root 135, Pope 12) In theory, this is a good test for Pope: can he stay calm and patient when it\u2019s not going for him? Santner comes into the attack, and when Root takes his first ball for one, he has five more at yerman; all are dots, but there\u2019s encouragement for the bowler, when Pope pushes at one with hard hands. \u201cIn our younger days my brother and I played a two dice version of Owzthat,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cYou would initially roll one dice with runs being scored for every number except 5. If a 5 was rolled then two dice were rolled to determine either a dot ball or a method of dismissal. Obviously cheating was rampant and brotherly arguments frequent. We also had a dice football game, the name of which I can\u2019t remember but I recall it being pretty underwhelming...\u201d Time to reup this from the summer. 112th over: England 301-5 (Root 134, Pope 12) It\u2019s not flowing for Pope so far, but he forces one away into the leg side by attempting to drive into the off. Wagner, who\u2019s going around to Root, is driven to backward point for one, as Athers talks about how the best education he could\u2019ve had was at the other end to the aforementioned Gooch, who somehow became extra-brilliant at the end of his career; in pretty much any other sport, you\u2019d have wondered if he was doping. 111th over: England 299-5 (Root 133, Pope 11) Root is in touch now. One from Southee stays low, and he adjusts beautifully to pull four; Athers says he\u2019s in the top four England batsmen he\u2019s seen, along with Gooch, Gower and Pietersen. I can\u2019t argue with that, although the best batting I\u2019ve seen across a series was I Ronald Bell of the eponymous Bell\u2019s Ashes, 2013. One to which we can all look forward: This raises an interesting question: do you become the best team in the world by picking players according to conditions, or by picking players able to succeed in all conditions. 110th over: England 295-5 (Root 129, Pope 11) Pope takes a single to leg, then Root has time to floss his teeth and compose a witty yet pithy tweet while a bouncer from Wagner sits up; he uppercuts for four. A pulled single follows \u2013 there is literally nothing that doesn\u2019t come pulled these days \u2013 and that\u2019s your over. \u201cJerusalem Singers Part II,\u201d says James Debens. \u201cREO Speedgun, Kiss My Chaminda Vaas, Googly Withers and the Bowljobs, The Detroit Spinners, Buddy Hollioake &amp; The Crickets, Never Go Full Eddie Hemmings, The Crazy World Of Ali Brown, Geoff Lemon and The Plastic OBO Band, Khawajagoogoo, The Bonzo Rabada Band.\u201d 109th over: England 289-5 (Root 124, Pope 10) I love the phrase \u201cdaddy hundred\u201d, mainly because it comes from someone you don\u2019t really think of as a phrasemaker, and because it was popularised not by its progenitor, Graham Gooch, but by someone he drummed it into into whom he drummed it, Alastair Cook. Root then proves the original point, if there was such a thing, by opening the face to run Southee down for four. \u201cI rejected Owzthat in favour of a more complex scoring system using two dice,\u201d tweets Martin Connolly. \u201cIn my defence, weekends in the 60s/70s could get rather tedious.\u201d We\u2019re going to need some more detail, please. On both the game and the tediousness of the weekends. 108th over: England 285-5 (Root 120, Pope 10) Right then, here comes Wagner; tangentially, I contend that, of the \u201csharing bag\u201d chocolate genre, Crunchie Rocks are easily the best. Root hauls a pull to fine leg for one, the only run off the over; he looks there for a daddy. 107th over: England 284-5 (Root 119, Pope 10) Craig McMillan is wearing a cardigan, tie and flat cap; no further questions yer honour. Root clips a single off his tootsies, the only run from the over. 106th over: England 283-5 (Root 118, Pope 10) Root takes another single into the covers as Wagner stretches and Pope is beaten again outside off; I\u2019m not really sure what he\u2019s trying to play there, because he\u2019s pushed sown the wrong line at one that he could\u2019ve left. 105th over: England 282-5 (Root 117, Pope 10) Bumble is talking about Owthzat, which tells you all you need to know. Next: kids\u2019 TV, golf, wine. My old fella has an original Owzthat set, which is pretty posh for 50s Cheetham Hill \u2013 most people scraped off the ends of pencils. Maiden. 104th over: England 282-5 (Root 117, Pope 10) A single to each batsman; there\u2019s not a whole lot going on out there. \u201cJust been watching the very wonderful Seven Worlds, One Planet, North America,\u201d says Kim Thonger, \u201cand it strikes me that at the rate polar bears are evolving, to hunt beluga whales instead of their traditional prey, for example, they\u2019ll soon be able to play cricket and frankly I don\u2019t fancy the fragile England batting unit against them. Maybe we should avoid the contest and set up a series against the friendly looking prairie dogs, whose bowling line-up looks far less formidable.\u201d Also, aren\u2019t polar bears actually black not white? I don\u2019t think we can justify playing against a side who so flagrantly flout the dress code. 103rd over: England 280-5 (Root 116, Pope 9) There\u2019s some of that up and downness! Southee fires down a pea-roller that rushes past Root\u2019s bat and just past his off peg; that\u2019s great news for England in its way, if they can fulfil their part of the bargain. Four byes follow, then Root pushes a single to cover and Southee beats Pope, who lazily waves bat at one outside off. \u201cThe sage-faced adults who stand to sing Jerusalem, with actions, need a group name,\u201d says James Debens. \u201cNot The Artichokes, but what? The Ropey Boundaries? The Red Wine Tans?\u201d The Clap? 102nd over: England 275-5 (Root 115, Pope 9) Jack Leach\u2019s health has improved - he\u2019s still in hospital, but should be good to go home with the rest of the team on Wednesday. Pope drags two to leg, the only runs from the over. 101st over: England 273-5 (Root 115, Pope 7) Root feathers Southee away to point for one; Southee has the slips wider than usual, which makes sense against Root. Pope adds a single more. \u201cThe 1989 Ashes series was the last time I had a dry series, as I was only 17 at the time,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cSo I blame English cricket, and in particular Phil Newport and John Stephenson, for the fact that my liver has had to endure thirty years of hurt since then. Never stopped me dreaming though. Come on England!\u201d A mate and I got busted by his grandad having a beer and a tab at Headingley in 1993; we were 14. Australia made 307-3 that day, and England\u2019s, er, attack, was Bicknell, Ilott, Caddick and McCague. And Gooch. And Thorpe. 100th over: England 271-5 (Root 114, Pope 6) Pope chases a wide one and forces it away to backward point for two. A bunch of sage-faced adults stand to sing Jerusalem, with actions. I know. They applaud themselves subsequently. Matt Henry has the ball to finish his over from last evening... Right then, let\u2019s get involved. He seems an exceedingly sound individual. He also says his white-line fever comes from how hard you have to work to get to play international cricket. He doesn\u2019t have the skills the likes of Anderson do, he explains, so has to have a proper engine. He\u2019s currently third in the Test rankings. Neil Wagner tells Athers that however flat a pitch, batting last to save a Test isn\u2019t fun. He says that the pitches in this series aren\u2019t typical of NZ, and that young bowlers need to play on a variety of tracks so that they can do everything, but you learn your craft when you\u2019re not getting help. I really hope we get a good chunk of Ollie Pope today. He looks to have everything necessary to be very good, and it\u2019s just a matter of when he puts it all together. \u201c\u2018...once the scores are round about level, he\u2019ll step on it\u2019\u201d? says Harkran Sumal. \u201cMan alive, sound the hubris klaxon! Looking at what\u2019s to come after these two, I\u2019d take parity, and would be dancing in the streets if offered 400. Steady on!\u201d That\u2019s how I think he\u2019ll play it if he can. Parity doesn\u2019t get England anywhere. He thinks England need to get well past NZ if they can, and the surface is deteriorating so he can see the game speeding up. Root tells Ian Ward that he\u2019s been working hard, \u201cTrying to get rhythm back into my hands, pick them up a bit more, that generally gets my feet going. Little things that don\u2019t look much on the screen make a huge difference,\u201d he says, and also that he was \u201ctrying to be over-perfect\u201d. Ian Smith thinks the pitch is getting a bit up and down, but not quickly enough to help New Zealand today. \u201cYou can play on this for a fortnight and nobody will spin it,\u201d says Bumble. It\u2019d be classic captain-era Root for him to get out early this morning, and he\u2019ll know that. I\u2019d expect him to go carefully to being with, then once the scores are round about level he\u2019ll step on it. \u201cReasons to be cheerful, part one,\u201d says Andrew Chappell. \u201cI have really been enjoying imagining myself on those lovely sunny, grassy banks, in NZ. The grounds are idyllic. Of course, I am stuck in the early winter doldrums here in Montreal at the moment, so in fact, cold November rain in London would look almost as appealing.\u201d I do wonder if the banks are a faux ami \u2013 sitting on grass all day doesn\u2019t sound great. But yes, I could cope. \u201cEvening Daniel, evening everyone,\u201d emails Harkarn Sumal. \u201cI watched the first 90 minutes last night before toddling off to bed. It seemed that New Zealand\u2019s seamers were just hammering away on a middle and leg line to Joe Root, well back of a length, and that on this featherbed of a wicket, this approach was simply feeding paddles and pulls. I know Wagner loves banging it in all day long, but what exactly were they trying to achieve there? It\u2019s not as if they were packing the field on that side to dry us up with leg theory. It made for very odd viewing. I went off up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire with a furrowed brow. Any light to shed?\u201d I guess they were trying to make him antsy by drying up the runs, but it didn\u2019t work. I agree it\u2019s kind of odd though \u2013 tempting him to drive and flash seems a better strategy. A friend of ours and student of this thing of ours, Rob Smyth, suggests that England\u2019s 2000-01 visit to Pakistan was the last time they played a series this dry. I guess that\u2019s been mainly forgotten in the joy of the climax. Reminder: we\u2019ll be starting half an hour earlier this morning, to help compensate for time we\u2019ve lost. We\u2019re all friends here and friends need to be honest with each other, so let\u2019s be honest about this: it\u2019s a long, long time since England played a series as dull as this series has been. And no, this isn\u2019t something I think because England are poised to lose it \u2013 like all normal people, I take enormous pleasure in watching the team I support suffer \u2013 but is something I think because the pitches have been as dull as these pitches have been. Of course you want conditions to be different around the world, of course you don\u2019t want every pitch to be green; of course you enjoy slow periods, of course you don\u2019t want matches done in fewer than four days. But you should want every track, however flat, to offer something to the bowlers \u2013 whether pace, bounce or turn \u2013 and you should want every track, however flat, to have some character. But here we are now, perhaps on the cusp of liveliness. England need to make runs as quickly as possible in order to force a win, while New Zealand will want quick wickets to set up a slog then a skittling. Fingers crossed, pals. Play: 10.30am local, 9.30pm GMT",

His lawyer, J\u00f8rgen Permin, argued in a one-day hearing at the maritime and commercial court in Copenhagen in November that the scheme was a clear case of copyright infringement. \u201cHe acknowledges that whoever purchases one of his works would be at liberty to sell it on or even destroy the work,\u201d Permin said. \u201cBut what he is not obliged to accept is for someone to alter the work and then reintroduce it to the public domain, and particularly not for commercial reasons.\u201d Heidi H\u00f8jmark Helveg, who represented Thorleifsson and Leivsgard, argued that as the project involved destroying rather than altering the work, it was legal under Danish law. \u201cThe pieces will be so small that it will not possible to know in any way which work it is from,\u201d she said. \u201cEach watch will take just 0.04% of the original work.\u201d Permin said this argument failed because the watches would be marketed \u201cspecifically as having Tal R\u2019s painting as background\u201d. If the court imposes an injunction, Tal R would then need to launch a further case to confirm it. If the court instead refuses a ban, Thorleifsson and Leivsgard plan in a fortnight to destroy the painting at a public event they are calling a vernissage, a term more commonly used for a preview of an art exhibition. While the pair\u2019s now discontinued Kanske brand had been a commercial venture, Thorleifsson said that the Letho project had from the start been intended to test the boundaries of art. \u201cIt\u2019s not a commercial project, but we don\u2019t know if it is an artistic project. That has to be determined by others,\u201d he said. Permin said that as far as his client was concerned, it was not. \u201cHe thinks it is a very destructive thing for art, and he doesn\u2019t subscribe to the idea that tearing up his art in this manner would be art itself,\u201d Permin said. \u201cHe really wishes this had never happened.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kim Jong-un\u2019s recent wardrobe choices have sparked speculation that after eight years of paying sartorial homage to his popular grandfather, North Korea\u2019s leader is attempting to craft an image of his own. South Korean media commented on the change after Kim was seen last week wearing a leather trench coat during the test of a multiple rocket launcher. The trench coat was the latest of several indications that he has decided to embrace a more eclectic personal style. He had previously displayed a penchant for horn-rimmed glasses and black Mao suits that appeared to be an attempt to style himself in the image of his grandfather \u2013 and North Korea\u2019s founder - Kim Il-sung, right down to his severe short-back-and-sides hairstyle. Twenty-five years after his death, the older Kim is still revered by North Koreans for what regime propagandists describe as his leading role in ending Japanese colonial rule and founding North Korea in 1948. Days before his dark trench coat made an appearance, Kim Jong-un sported an ivory-coloured version and a blue shirt while giving \u201cfield guidance\u201d at a military base on an island near the maritime border with South Korea. As a young and untested leader when he succeeded his father in December 2011, Kim consolidated his grip on power through several rounds of purges that included the execution of his uncle, while promoting others, such as his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, to positions of power within the ruling party and military. With his position secure, he can now begin to craft a new image that sets him apart from his predecessors, according to Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University. \u201cKim appears to be striving to build his own image and sphere as much as he can,\u201d Kim told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. While some observers attributed Kim\u2019s fashion choices to simple personal preferences, Yonhap speculated that the change in style could herald shifts on the diplomatic front, less than a month before a deadline North Korea has set for the US to break the deadlock over stalled denuclearisation talks.",

      "bodyText": "House prices surged 1.7% across Australia in November, the rapidly reviving market recording the biggest monthly rise since 2003, according new figures. The value of homes rose for the fifth month in a row driven by Sydney and Melbourne, where prices were up 2.7% and 2.2% respectively last month, the research firm CoreLogic said on Monday. The rise was also felt in every other capital city except Darwin in what CoreLogic described as \u201ca broadening in the geographic scope of this upswing\u201d. However, the rise in house prices came ahead of more sobering data on Monday showing an 8% drop in approvals for new home construction, a fall in company profits, continuing slow growth in wages and a fewer jobs being advertised. The improving housing picture shown by CoreLogic\u2019s monthly home value index sent the market into positive annual growth territory for the first time since April 2018, with values 0.1% higher over the past 12 months. Perth saw its first monthly rise for 12 months with prices up 0.4%, while Brisbane edged up 0.8%, Adelaide 0.5%, Hobart 2.3% and Canberra 1.6%. The combined national rise was 1.7%. Tim Lawless, head of CoreLogic Research, said a number of different factors had led to the turnaround in the index after it hit a trough in June, including three rate cuts by the Reserve Bank, a loosening of lending standards by the regulator, and the Coalition\u2019s federal election win in May ending uncertainty about tax policy. But he said there was still a lack of supply, which meant more buyers were chasing too few homes as they raced to make a purchase before prices went too high again. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing advertised stock levels persistently low, creating a sense of urgency in the market as buyer demand picks up,\u201d he said. The best-performing area in Australia in November was Melbourne\u2019s inner east, where prices rose 8%, followed by the city\u2019s inner region at 5% and Sydney\u2019s Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury at 4.3% and Sydney\u2019s inner west at 4.2%. A very busy sales day on Saturday also gave prices in the two big cities a traditional late spring season boost. In Sydney there were 1,131 auctions in the past week, with preliminary results showing a clearance rate of 84.7%, although 353 were unreported, CoreLogic said on Monday. In Melbourne 1,497 properties were listed, producing a clearance rate of 78.3%, with 469 not reported. In Brisbane the rate was 54.8%, Adelaide 78.7%, Perth 50%, Canberra 71.7% and Tasmania 80%.

The question is, how long can such a high pace of capital gains be sustained?\u201d he said. Annualised growth suggested the national index was tracking at 15.3% for the next 12 months while Sydney and Melbourne dwellings were on course for growth in the mid-20% range. \u201cConsidering wages and household income growth remains low, economic conditions are losing momentum and housing affordability is once again worsening, there are likely to be some headwinds in maintaining such a fast recovery,\u201d Lawless said.

Bishop writes of loss and its acceptance, themes with a new and awful currency in the time of environmental collapse. For this is an era in which, to borrow her words, \u201cso many things seem filled with the intent/to be lost\u201d. We\u2019ve just watched koalas, creatures already at risk from deforestation, incinerated in their hundreds (perhaps thousands). We lost millions of other animals at the same time, and the devastation of habitats will doom more in the months ahead, especially since ecosystems that never previously knew fire now burn for weeks. The Australian catastrophe mirrors events elsewhere. In the past 40 years, more than half the world\u2019s wildlife has gone. Rainforests are disappearing at the astonishing rate of 30 football fields a minute. Some estimates place 75% of coral reefs at risk from either local and global stress. As David Wallace-Wells says, most of the carbon we\u2019ve burned has been consumed since the premiere of Seinfeld. In the remarkably brief time bookended between now and a show about nothing, we\u2019ve set in train the destruction of wonders that we barely comprehend.

      "bodyText": "Fossil fuel lobbyists are trying to water down planned EU rules to stop \u201cinvestment greenwashing\u2019 by setting science-based criteria for any investment which lays claim to being environmentally sustainable. A report from lobbyist watchdog InfluenceMap has found that although some investors support the \u201cgreen labelling\u201d rules, 98% of Europe\u2019s 50 largest investors are members of lobby groups trying to weaken the proposals. The new \u201cgreen taxonomy\u201d law would enable the EU to set science-based criteria for what kind of investments can be marketed as \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d. The report found that lobbyists for the oil and gas sector including Eurogas, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), and FuelsEurope have pushed for weaker criteria which would classify gas projects as \u201cgreen\u201d. Burning gas to generate electricity has roughly half the carbon intensity as burning coal, but still emits potent greenhouse gases which are proven to accelerate the climate crisis. FuelsEurope has argued that \u201cno threshold should be put on the amount of fossil fuels used\u201d and IOGP has suggested to EU lawmakers that \u201cany investments in gas related projects should be considered as sustainable\u201d. Ed Collins, the report\u2019s lead author, said \u201cOur research shows how vested interests have risked moving the critical EU taxonomy process away from being science-driven and focused on real-world impacts to one which supports narrow vested interests and the status quo in finance and sustainability.\u201d The findings from InfluenceMap follow a report commissioned by a coalition of green groups earlier this year which found that the five biggest oil and gas companies, and their industry groups, spent at least \u20ac251m (\u00a3217m) lobbying the European Union over climate policies since 2010. The scale of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s lobbying activities triggered calls from 200 organisations to demand a \u201cfirewall\u201d around democratic politics to protect it from the influence of the fossil fuel industry.",

      "body": "<p>Long before Liverpool reached last season\u2019s Champions League final, preparations for a possible showdown in Madrid were being made by Pepijn \u201cPep\u201d Lijnders. The semi-final against Barcelona had not been played but J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s assistant was already contemplating the ideal preparation. He thought about inviting a team who could mimic Ajax\u2019s or Tottenham\u2019s style, to give Liverpool an idea of what they could expect if they overcame Bar\u00e7a.</p> <p>The location was decided. Marbella\u2019s weather was similar to Madrid\u2019s and it would be relatively easy to fly a team there secretly. \u201cI really wanted to organise a game because otherwise it would have been three weeks without any competitive action,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cI wanted us to play a similar team to the opponents we could face in Madrid. The idea was to privately invite a team to train three to four days in the way we wanted them to<strong> </strong>play us in the friendly.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/30/liverpool-brighton-hove-albion-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 11 points clear despite Alisson red as Van Dijk sinks Brighton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lijnders\u2019 efforts proved well worth it after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">overcame a 3-0 deficit</a> to reach the final. \u201cBenfica B came over and everything remained secret,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cWe gave a presentation to their manager about how they had to play. It had to be like Tottenham, with their set pieces, footballing intentions and defensive organisation. We played that game behind closed doors. We even built higher shields so no one could see anything. The match took place exactly one week before the final and we prepared everything like we would do during the day of the final.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool, who defeated Benfica B 3-0, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/tottenham-liverpool-champions-league-final-match-report\" title=\"\">secured the Champions League by beating Spurs 2-0</a>. When watching the buildup to the early goals in both those games there is a recognisable pattern, with Liverpool winning possession on the halfway line and playing a long ball to Sadio Man\u00e9. \u201cIn both moments you could clearly see how we positioned ourselves to be able to dominate the second-ball game and directly searched for Sadio into the free space behind the last line.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CoachDarian/status/1136587085106896896\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Liverpool played Benfica&#39;s B team in Marbella before the Champions League final for specific tactical preparation. <br><br>It worked out well, didn&#39;t it? <a href=\"https://t.co/W4NIHDnABr\">pic.twitter.com/W4NIHDnABr</a></p>&mdash; Darian Wilken (@CoachDarian) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoachDarian/status/1136587085106896896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Lijnders is speaking at the Melwood training ground. Dressed in a club jumper featuring six stars symbolising the European Cup victories he explains how the technical staff work on a daily basis. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen [Klopp] is the leader and face of the team, the one who defines the character and who stimulates everyone. Pete [Peter Krawietz] is responsible for the analysis and prepares everything in regards to videos which are shown to the players. I\u2019m responsible for the training process.</p> <p>\u201cTogether we decide what kind of aspects we want to develop for the team and then I create the exercises. It\u2019s quite simple; it\u2019s just about the continuing stimulation of our mentality to conquer the ball as quick and as high up the pitch as possible. That element comes back in every exercise. We as staff always try to find ways so the players can be more spontaneous and more creative.\u201d</p> <p>The high counterpressing has become the identity of the modern Liverpool. Lijnders works to refine its model and creates exercises which help players master the system. For example, in training a rule can be that a goal counts only when all the players have crossed the halfway line. \u201cPurely to stimulate the team to push up quickly and be ready to counterpress; counterpressing is only possible when you are together at all times. People say Liverpool are good at this or at that but I always say the main thing we are good at is that we are always together.\u201d</p> <p>Lijnders explains there are a lot of formats. \u201cLet\u2019s take the five-v-two rondo, which in fact is a pressing rondo. Our game is about movement and speed, and with only five players those five have to run non-stop. The two guys in the middle are encouraged to make an interception within the first six passes. If they succeed, they can go out both at the same time, otherwise only the player who intervened is allowed to leave the middle. This all stimulates our counterpressing vision where we try to disrupt the buildup of the opponent inside their first few touches.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6843cd71a39caf9145850d8819b955cbca6fc7f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6843cd71a39caf9145850d8819b955cbca6fc7f4/0_248_3344_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pep Lijnders (second left) celebrates the European Cup win over Spurs with Jurgen Klopp and other members of the Liverpool coaching staff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Lijnders (second left) celebrates the European Cup win over Spurs with Jurgen Klopp and other members of the Liverpool coaching staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lijnders explains how they often continue a session with other rondo-esque exercises, such as two teams of three competing against one team of three, until the latter wins the ball and replaces the team who lost the ball. That exercise is about instant transition and not dwelling on disappointment after losing possession.</p> <p>Lijnders argues those drills help shape Liverpool\u2019s identity. \u201cThe players first have to understand the importance of counterpressing to our team. They have to feel it, not with the head, but with the heart. They start the exercise with the idea to keep the ball, but in the event of losing it they have to be directly on top of things.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a team lose the ball in training, you will hear me, J\u00fcrgen or Pete screaming: \u2018Go! Get it back! Don\u2019t stop!\u2019 It\u2019s so loud they\u2019ll even hear that in Manchester, haha. They have to understand why it\u2019s so important. That power and emotion is our game. Because our identity is intensity. That comes back in every drill. And that\u2019s what I like about coaching: that you can stimulate certain common behaviour and create a lot by specific team training. That\u2019s what I live for.\u201d</p> <p>Lijnders is only 36 but has been coaching for years. At 17 he was forced to quit playing after sustaining a serious knee injury. He quickly moved into coaching and after starting at the amateur side SVEB in the Netherlands he moved to PSV as a youth coach. In 2007 he went to Porto to become their academy\u2019s head of individual development and coached the youth team. After a few seasons Manchester United were keen to take him but that failed to materialise when Sir Alex Ferguson retired and Lijnders joined Liverpool in 2014, with responsibility for the Under-15s and Under-16s. A year later he was promoted to the first team<strong> </strong>by Brendan Rodgers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's fantastic. We play two to three times a week, sometimes more often</p> <footer> <cite>Pep Lijnders on his paddle tennis games with J\u00fcrgen Klopp</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lijnders says he is often inspired by the players when creating exercises. \u201cThe five-v-two rondo is a good example. It\u2019s actually called Milly\u2019s rondo now, after I got inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/28/james-milner-liverpool-interview-var-premier-league\" title=\"\">James Milner</a>, because he always intercepted the ball within the first few passes. He was really quick and brought the focus of the rondo to another level. I was like: \u2018How can I come up with a rule that everyone will execute with his kind of intensity?\u2019 So I gave an extra incentive for the two players in the middle if they would intervene within the first six passes. So I told Milly: \u2018This is your idea!\u2019 The other players loved it.\u201d</p> <p>Lijnders strongly believes in the power of role models and says the manager and captains reflect the identity of the club. \u201cThe heart of the team is the heart of the coach. So the character of the coach will become the character of the team in the long term. That\u2019s it. Because there is no stronger weapon than your own example. If I\u2019m a disciplined coach, then I don\u2019t need to discipline the players. Our captains Hendo [Jordan Henderson] and Milly, together with Virgil [van Dijk], are so disciplined, which means the rest of the group doesn\u2019t need to be disciplined. There is a saying from [Theodore] Roosevelt which says: \u2018People don\u2019t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cJ\u00fcrgen does really care about the squad and his staff. Players will understand and absorb more of our philosophy when they feel how much we care about them.\u201d</p> <p>The philosophy is about playing football in its most attacking shape. \u201cWe always focus on ourselves, attack the opponent with \u2013 but especially without \u2013 the ball; a chasing attitude over 95 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b945bac9162411c1a9a537baffb73822bcce872c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b945bac9162411c1a9a537baffb73822bcce872c/0_0_2702_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lijnders has developed training drills to help players match the intensity of James Milner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lijnders has developed training drills to help players match the intensity of James Milner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSo our way of playing is central element in our training sessions. But I also look to details of opponents which can give us an advantage, like spaces they might leave open or other weaknesses which we can exploit.

      "bodyText": "Long before Liverpool reached last season\u2019s Champions League final, preparations for a possible showdown in Madrid were being made by Pepijn \u201cPep\u201d Lijnders. The semi-final against Barcelona had not been played but J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s assistant was already contemplating the ideal preparation. He thought about inviting a team who could mimic Ajax\u2019s or Tottenham\u2019s style, to give Liverpool an idea of what they could expect if they overcame Bar\u00e7a. The location was decided. Marbella\u2019s weather was similar to Madrid\u2019s and it would be relatively easy to fly a team there secretly. \u201cI really wanted to organise a game because otherwise it would have been three weeks without any competitive action,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cI wanted us to play a similar team to the opponents we could face in Madrid. The idea was to privately invite a team to train three to four days in the way we wanted them to play us in the friendly.\u201d Lijnders\u2019 efforts proved well worth it after Liverpool overcame a 3-0 deficit to reach the final. \u201cBenfica B came over and everything remained secret,\u201d Lijnders says. \u201cWe gave a presentation to their manager about how they had to play. It had to be like Tottenham, with their set pieces, footballing intentions and defensive organisation. We played that game behind closed doors. We even built higher shields so no one could see anything. The match took place exactly one week before the final and we prepared everything like we would do during the day of the final.\u201d Liverpool, who defeated Benfica B 3-0, secured the Champions League by beating Spurs 2-0. When watching the buildup to the early goals in both those games there is a recognisable pattern, with Liverpool winning possession on the halfway line and playing a long ball to Sadio Man\u00e9. \u201cIn both moments you could clearly see how we positioned ourselves to be able to dominate the second-ball game and directly searched for Sadio into the free space behind the last line.\u201d Lijnders is speaking at the Melwood training ground. Dressed in a club jumper featuring six stars symbolising the European Cup victories he explains how the technical staff work on a daily basis. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen [Klopp] is the leader and face of the team, the one who defines the character and who stimulates everyone. Pete [Peter Krawietz] is responsible for the analysis and prepares everything in regards to videos which are shown to the players. I\u2019m responsible for the training process. \u201cTogether we decide what kind of aspects we want to develop for the team and then I create the exercises. It\u2019s quite simple; it\u2019s just about the continuing stimulation of our mentality to conquer the ball as quick and as high up the pitch as possible. That element comes back in every exercise. We as staff always try to find ways so the players can be more spontaneous and more creative.\u201d The high counterpressing has become the identity of the modern Liverpool. Lijnders works to refine its model and creates exercises which help players master the system. For example, in training a rule can be that a goal counts only when all the players have crossed the halfway line. \u201cPurely to stimulate the team to push up quickly and be ready to counterpress; counterpressing is only possible when you are together at all times. People say Liverpool are good at this or at that but I always say the main thing we are good at is that we are always together.\u201d Lijnders explains there are a lot of formats. \u201cLet\u2019s take the five-v-two rondo, which in fact is a pressing rondo. Our game is about movement and speed, and with only five players those five have to run non-stop. The two guys in the middle are encouraged to make an interception within the first six passes. If they succeed, they can go out both at the same time, otherwise only the player who intervened is allowed to leave the middle. This all stimulates our counterpressing vision where we try to disrupt the buildup of the opponent inside their first few touches.\u201d Lijnders explains how they often continue a session with other rondo-esque exercises, such as two teams of three competing against one team of three, until the latter wins the ball and replaces the team who lost the ball. That exercise is about instant transition and not dwelling on disappointment after losing possession. Lijnders argues those drills help shape Liverpool\u2019s identity. \u201cThe players first have to understand the importance of counterpressing to our team. They have to feel it, not with the head, but with the heart. They start the exercise with the idea to keep the ball, but in the event of losing it they have to be directly on top of things. \u201cWhen a team lose the ball in training, you will hear me, J\u00fcrgen or Pete screaming: \u2018Go! Get it back! Don\u2019t stop!\u2019 It\u2019s so loud they\u2019ll even hear that in Manchester, haha. They have to understand why it\u2019s so important. That power and emotion is our game. Because our identity is intensity. That comes back in every drill. And that\u2019s what I like about coaching: that you can stimulate certain common behaviour and create a lot by specific team training. That\u2019s what I live for.\u201d Lijnders is only 36 but has been coaching for years. At 17 he was forced to quit playing after sustaining a serious knee injury. He quickly moved into coaching and after starting at the amateur side SVEB in the Netherlands he moved to PSV as a youth coach. In 2007 he went to Porto to become their academy\u2019s head of individual development and coached the youth team. After a few seasons Manchester United were keen to take him but that failed to materialise when Sir Alex Ferguson retired and Lijnders joined Liverpool in 2014, with responsibility for the Under-15s and Under-16s. A year later he was promoted to the first team by Brendan Rodgers. Lijnders says he is often inspired by the players when creating exercises. \u201cThe five-v-two rondo is a good example. It\u2019s actually called Milly\u2019s rondo now, after I got inspired by James Milner, because he always intercepted the ball within the first few passes. He was really quick and brought the focus of the rondo to another level. I was like: \u2018How can I come up with a rule that everyone will execute with his kind of intensity?\u2019 So I gave an extra incentive for the two players in the middle if they would intervene within the first six passes. So I told Milly: \u2018This is your idea!\u2019 The other players loved it.\u201d Lijnders strongly believes in the power of role models and says the manager and captains reflect the identity of the club. \u201cThe heart of the team is the heart of the coach. So the character of the coach will become the character of the team in the long term. That\u2019s it. Because there is no stronger weapon than your own example. If I\u2019m a disciplined coach, then I don\u2019t need to discipline the players. Our captains Hendo [Jordan Henderson] and Milly, together with Virgil [van Dijk], are so disciplined, which means the rest of the group doesn\u2019t need to be disciplined. There is a saying from [Theodore] Roosevelt which says: \u2018People don\u2019t care how much you know, until they know how much you care.\u2019 \u201cJ\u00fcrgen does really care about the squad and his staff. Players will understand and absorb more of our philosophy when they feel how much we care about them.\u201d The philosophy is about playing football in its most attacking shape. \u201cWe always focus on ourselves, attack the opponent with \u2013 but especially without \u2013 the ball; a chasing attitude over 95 minutes. \u201cSo our way of playing is central element in our training sessions. But I also look to details of opponents which can give us an advantage, like spaces they might leave open or other weaknesses which we can exploit. I always try to interweave those elements in our sessions without the players noticing it.\u201d He believes, though, that \u201c75 % of the opponents we\u2019ve played against so far in the Premier League changed something in their formation beforehand\u201d. In his first season at Liverpool Lijnders was occasionally invited to Melwood by Rodgers to talk about counterpressing and Lijnders\u2019 interpretation of 3-4-3.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 14 million voters are living in constituencies that have been held by the same political party since at least the second world war, according to an electoral reform campaign group, which said this illustrated a \u201cbroken\u201d voting system. Highlighting what it says is the inflexibility of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, where single MPs are picked per constituency on a non-proportional basis, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) said the average seat had not changed hands for 42 years. If equivalent predecessor seats are taken into account, some constituencies have not seen a change in party for their MP since the era of the Whigs in the 19th century. Eleven Labour seats and 54 held by the Conservatives have not changed hands in more than a century. At the 2017 election, only 70 seats, or 11% of the total, went to a different party, with this figure in gradual decline. According to a YouGov seat-by-seat projection for the 12 December, 58 seats are due to change hands. This comes despite current voter volatility unprecedented in recent decades. In October, findings from the ongoing British Election Study found that almost half of voters have switched sides since 2010 amid political upheavals such as Brexit. A report this year by the Constitution Society thinktank argued that FPTP does not even reliably carry out the role argued by its supporters of keeping out extreme elements and encouraging moderate, consensual politics. The report said recent elections which saw support for the Conservatives and Labour concentrated into defined geographical areas meant there was less direct competition between them, pushing both parties away from the centre ground, aided by the increasing influence of activist members. The ERS study found that 98 Labour seats have been in the party\u2019s hands since the war, 37% of their 2017 total, with 94 Conservative seats in the same situation, 30% of the constituencies they won at the last election, affecting 13.7m potential voters overall. In total, 10% of current seats, 65, had been held by the same party since 1918 or earlier. The Devon seat of Hugo Swire and its prior equivalent last changed hands in 1835, when the Conservatives took it from the Whigs. The seats occupied by Theresa May and Chris Grayling, Maidenhead and Epsom and Ewell, have been held by the Conservatives since 1874.
