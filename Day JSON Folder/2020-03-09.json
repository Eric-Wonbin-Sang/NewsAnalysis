      "bodyText": "A US appeals court has reinstated a ruling that British rockers Led Zeppelin did not steal part of their song Stairway to Heaven from another band. The San Francisco 11-judge panel affirmed a 2016 judgment that found no proof the classic 1971 Zeppelin song breached the copyright of Taurus, written by Randy Wolfe from a Los Angeles band called Spirit. In 2018 that ruling was overturned by a three-judge panel in San Francisco, which said certain instructions to the district court jury had been \u201cerroneous and prejudicial\u201d, and failed to clarify that the arrangement of elements in the public domain could be considered original. Led Zeppelin took the case to a larger panel whose decision on Monday, based on the 1909 Copyright Act, put the original ruling back in place. Stairway to Heaven is estimated to have grossed $3.4m during the five-year period that was at issue in the earlier civil trial. The Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page \u2013 who was sued along with the group\u2019s singer Robert Plant and another surviving bandmate, John Paul Jones \u2013 testified in 2016 that the chord sequence in question had \u201cbeen around forever\u201d. But Wolfe\u2019s trustee, Michael Skidmore, said the songs had similar chord progressions and Page may have written Stairway to Heaven after hearing Taurus while Led Zeppelin and Spirit toured together. \u201cObviously the court got it wrong,\u201d said the trustee\u2019s lawyer, Francis Malofiy. \u201cThis is a big loss for creators, those who copyright laws are meant to protect.\u201d Malofiy said he may appeal to the US supreme court. Lawyers for Led Zeppelin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The decision in the five-year-old case was a victory for a music industry still combating fallout from a 2015 verdict that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams\u2019 2013 hit Blurred Lines copied Marvin Gaye\u2019s 1977 hit Got To Give It Up. Jurors awarded Gaye\u2019s children $7.4m, which was later reduced to $5.3m.

      "body": "<p>In a time of panic, please don\u2019t forget to be kind.</p> <p>Before you roll your eyes at this worthy statement, know it doesn\u2019t come from a place of virtue. It comes from the mother of Harry, my two-year-old son with cystic fibrosis, a chronic health condition that makes him particularly vulnerable to respiratory viruses.</p> <p>I write this from a place of deep anxiety, stemming from the familiarity I have with the smells of fear and tears accompanying an intensive care unit in a children\u2019s hospital. A year ago, I watched as my son was sedated and put on oxygen because of complications arising from rhinovirus \u2013 the common cold \u2013 combined with two other respiratory viruses. I shudder to think what Covid-19 could do to his already compromised lungs.</p> <p>But I am more worried about the human reaction to the virus in the weeks to come than I am about the actual virus. And the virus is terrifying. I predict we will witness, as we have already started to, the worst of humanity, including people fighting over toilet paper in a supermarket, people hoarding supplies meaning that others miss out, people going to work when they\u2019re sick or letting their kids out of the house when they should be quarantined. Two weeks is a long time to spend at home to limit the spread of the virus, but I am urging people to please abide by the rules, because doing so will protect the vulnerable. Doing so will protect Harry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-symptoms-what-are-they-and-should-i-see-a-doctor\">Coronavirus symptoms: what are they and should I see a doctor?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because of Covid-19\u2019s infancy, we are yet to fully understand how it will affect people with cystic fibrosis, or the many others with compromised immune systems. However, with the death toll rising it is obvious there is cause for serious concern. According to Centers for Disease Control data <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">collated by John Hopkins University</a>, the virus has claimed more than 3400 lives globally, with more than 100,000 cases reported. Reading about the acceleration of cases in Australia in the last week, including the evacuation of Epping Boys High, the words horse and bolted come to mind when talking about containment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"949a59b9431c11f30af643bdedb19e1f21224230\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/949a59b9431c11f30af643bdedb19e1f21224230/0_0_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Killoran's son Harry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sally Killoran\u2019s son Harry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which is why I am urging you to resist your fear-driven greedy impulses and please remain kind. As our leaders scramble to get ahead of the virus, and amidst media and celebrity-endorsed obfuscation around stockpiling goods, it\u2019s up to us as a nation to control how we personally respond. I ask that you do this with compassion.</p> <p>As the mother of Harry, I am begging you to think of the flow-on effect your actions have on the vulnerable. Reports of a man who ignored advice to self-quarantine in Hobart yesterday meant he made the inadvertent \u2013 but preventable \u2013 decision to put many people at risk, and this act may cause the vulnerable to pay the utmost price.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What has Australia come to when a mum can\u2019t buy tissues for her daughter with leukaemia?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I am asking that on the day you waver over whether or not to send your child into public with flu-like symptoms (fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, cough) please think of Harry, whose life could be limited if this virus takes hold of his already fragile lungs. While this new strain of flu has only been seen to have mild symptoms in children, think of how your child could pass it on to their friend\u2019s father who is fighting cancer, or another friend\u2019s mother with a newborn at home, or a child who regularly visits their elderly grandparents in their nursing home. Think of your child\u2019s friend whose baby sister has spinal muscular atrophy, think of the child in hospital fighting acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, or with another autoimmune disease that Covid-19 could decimate.</p> <p>I am asking people to be kind, and not to panic in a time when everyone seems scared, because the ridiculous run on toilet paper last week highlighted the fact people are not thinking of others. And while toilet paper isn\u2019t going to save Harry\u2019s life, other goods like hand sanitiser and face masks could help keep him, and his friends with auto-immune problems, safe.</p> <p>The Department of Health has very clearly said that face masks are not to be used by the healthy. It states: \u201cMasks are not currently recommended for use by healthy members of the public for the prevention of infections like coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "In a time of panic, please don\u2019t forget to be kind. Before you roll your eyes at this worthy statement, know it doesn\u2019t come from a place of virtue. It comes from the mother of Harry, my two-year-old son with cystic fibrosis, a chronic health condition that makes him particularly vulnerable to respiratory viruses. I write this from a place of deep anxiety, stemming from the familiarity I have with the smells of fear and tears accompanying an intensive care unit in a children\u2019s hospital. A year ago, I watched as my son was sedated and put on oxygen because of complications arising from rhinovirus \u2013 the common cold \u2013 combined with two other respiratory viruses. I shudder to think what Covid-19 could do to his already compromised lungs. But I am more worried about the human reaction to the virus in the weeks to come than I am about the actual virus. And the virus is terrifying. I predict we will witness, as we have already started to, the worst of humanity, including people fighting over toilet paper in a supermarket, people hoarding supplies meaning that others miss out, people going to work when they\u2019re sick or letting their kids out of the house when they should be quarantined. Two weeks is a long time to spend at home to limit the spread of the virus, but I am urging people to please abide by the rules, because doing so will protect the vulnerable. Doing so will protect Harry. Because of Covid-19\u2019s infancy, we are yet to fully understand how it will affect people with cystic fibrosis, or the many others with compromised immune systems. However, with the death toll rising it is obvious there is cause for serious concern. According to Centers for Disease Control data collated by John Hopkins University, the virus has claimed more than 3400 lives globally, with more than 100,000 cases reported. Reading about the acceleration of cases in Australia in the last week, including the evacuation of Epping Boys High, the words horse and bolted come to mind when talking about containment. Which is why I am urging you to resist your fear-driven greedy impulses and please remain kind. As our leaders scramble to get ahead of the virus, and amidst media and celebrity-endorsed obfuscation around stockpiling goods, it\u2019s up to us as a nation to control how we personally respond. I ask that you do this with compassion. As the mother of Harry, I am begging you to think of the flow-on effect your actions have on the vulnerable. Reports of a man who ignored advice to self-quarantine in Hobart yesterday meant he made the inadvertent \u2013 but preventable \u2013 decision to put many people at risk, and this act may cause the vulnerable to pay the utmost price. I am asking that on the day you waver over whether or not to send your child into public with flu-like symptoms (fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, cough) please think of Harry, whose life could be limited if this virus takes hold of his already fragile lungs. While this new strain of flu has only been seen to have mild symptoms in children, think of how your child could pass it on to their friend\u2019s father who is fighting cancer, or another friend\u2019s mother with a newborn at home, or a child who regularly visits their elderly grandparents in their nursing home. Think of your child\u2019s friend whose baby sister has spinal muscular atrophy, think of the child in hospital fighting acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, or with another autoimmune disease that Covid-19 could decimate. I am asking people to be kind, and not to panic in a time when everyone seems scared, because the ridiculous run on toilet paper last week highlighted the fact people are not thinking of others. And while toilet paper isn\u2019t going to save Harry\u2019s life, other goods like hand sanitiser and face masks could help keep him, and his friends with auto-immune problems, safe. The Department of Health has very clearly said that face masks are not to be used by the healthy. It states: \u201cMasks are not currently recommended for use by healthy members of the public for the prevention of infections like coronavirus. Instead, face masks should be used by people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms so they can protect others from spreading the virus.\u201d Yet last week I visited at least eight pharmacies and could not buy a face mask for my son to wear when he visits hospital next week for his regular CF clinic. In fact, I have resorted to hassling the kind doctors at the Sydney Children\u2019s Hospital in Randwick to send me face masks so that he can wear them to avoid people coughing on him while he is walking through the hospital. The fact I am wasting the precious time of under-resourced doctors and nurses is appalling, and something I am ashamed of, yet I have been driven to do this because others have hoarded them in case of emergency and I cannot physically buy any in stores. If we all panic, and are governed by fear-driven greed to take more than we need, who is going to protect the most vulnerable? Yesterday I was dismayed when I saw a social media post from the mum of Harper, who has leukaemia, who couldn\u2019t buy any tissues at her local shop. What has Australia come to when a mum can\u2019t buy tissues for her daughter with leukaemia, on her way home from hospital?

It said in a statement: \u201cWe have amended our travel advice to recommend against all but essential travel to Italy. The safety of British nationals is always our number one priority. \u201cThe advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to the Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days.\u201d Italy had initially imposed a quarantine on Sunday on northern regions that are home to 16 million people, where the outbreak began. On Monday evening the PM extended those restrictions on travel and public gatherings to the whole country. Hundreds of British tourists were scrambling to get home from the north of the country on Monday \u2013 a situation that is expected to worsen now that the whole country is locked down. Despite travel restrictions for Italians, planes continued to fly passengers between the country\u2019s locked-down region and the UK. The Foreign Office (FCO) is under pressure from the public and the travel industry to change its advice on Italy from advising against \u201call but essential\u201d travel \u2013 creating ambiguity around whether insurers would pay out on cancelled trips \u2013 to bringing in a total ban. During a press conference on Monday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, defended a lack of screening for those newly arrived in Britain from northern Italy, saying that \u201ctemperature screening in an airport doesn\u2019t really have much effect\u201d. At Manchester airport, posters instructed new arrivals to self-isolate if they flew in from the locked-down region, but there were no checks, said Seana Corr, 27, from Wirral, after disembarking from a flight from Milan. Corr described Milan as a place where \u201ceverything has been cancelled\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are no social gatherings any more. It\u2019s all closed down \u2026 The streets are empty, people are out of work, the shops are empty because people have started stockpiling. Bars and restaurants are closed. There are no guards on the streets and children are playing out in the streets because they are not in school.\u201d Tour operators Inghams and Crystal Ski both said they were working to bring all their customers home from ski resorts in northern Italy, where authorities announced that ski lifts had either been closed or were due to shut on Tuesday. The planned airlift involves a combination of charter flights and scheduled flights, and came as British Airways, Ryanair and easyJet cut the number of flights they operate to and from northern Italy after the lockdown of selected northern provinces. Inghams \u2013 which brought back hotel guests from the locked-down \u201cred zone\u201d of Lombardy on Sunday \u2013 said more than 600 customers would be brought home over the next 48 hours. They include guests from areas that had not been locked down, such as in the Aosta Valley ski region, where lifts closed on Sunday. Inghams was also contacting guests in the Dolomites ahead of lift closures on Tuesday. Angela Hall from Portsmouth, a customer of Crystal Ski, arrived in the Dolomites on Sunday, hours before she heard that authorities would be closing ski lifts. \u201cI had seen on the news before we departed that there was a lockdown in a different region and called Crystal before leaving the UK but they said everything was fine,\u201d she told the Guardian from an airport-bound coach with others on Monday. While she was critical of Crystal Ski for not being as informative as she would have liked, other customers were much angrier at the company, which is owned by TUI. One group said two couples in their number had been contacted on Friday by Inghams to say the company had drawn on Public Health England advice to decide it was no longer safe to bring them to the resort of Selva and would be issuing full refunds. But Meg Evans, who was in the group, said there had been no communication from Crystal Ski and it eventually responded to say it was still awaiting formal guidance from the Foreign Office, even when the couples pointed out that the hotel they were due to stay in had been the subject of a outbreak of coronavirus among a dozen guests. \u201cWe\u2019re really quite angry at how it was handled. Three of our group are GPs and couldn\u2019t possibly risk being out of action at a time when the NHS would need them later on at home,\u201d she said, adding that some of the couples had now paid for a second holiday this week in France. Crystal Ski said it was planning to to get customers back to the UK as soon as possible after restrictions were put in place by local authorities in a number of ski resorts. Refunds would be given for the days of holidays missed out on. The British embassy in Rome, meanwhile, was the focus of sustained lobbying on social media by British people asking the FCO to alter its travel advice on Italy to specifically warn against all travel to certain regions, rather than currently advising against \u201call but essential travel\u201d to a number of selected locked-down areas. Some commenters complained that insurers and airlines were holding off on responding or paying out for cancelled school trips and other visits. Carolyn Spinks, CEO of the UK tour operators to Italy (ABTOI) industry body, said that tour operators felt it would be \u201chelpful if the FCO put its money where its mouth was\u201d by simply warning against all travel to areas affected by coronavirus without any caveats.",

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing mounting pressure to announce a package of emergency measures in Wednesday\u2019s budget designed to support companies and households through the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Business leaders warned that the growing scale of the disruption for the economy amid widespread panic on financial markets meant urgent steps were required to shore up confidence. The Institute of Directors said Sunak needed to announce measures on Wednesday to provide UK companies with extra breathing space to spread out their tax payments.</p> <p>Tej Parikh, chief economist at the IoD, said: \u201cGovernment must be at the ready to take swift action to help cash-strapped businesses bridge this challenging period. The upcoming budget also provides an opportune moment to lower business costs and support investment to amplify the post-outbreak recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Firms facing financial distress should be given more time to pay VAT, payroll taxes and corporate tax, the IoD said, adding that HMRC\u2019s \u201ctime to pay\u201d scheme - which offers firms more generous payment terms \u2013 should be expanded.</p> <p>The Bank of England is expected to be called upon by the Treasury to provide extra support to struggling firms. Andrew Bailey, who replaces Mark Carney as the Bank\u2019s governor on 16 March, said last week that Threadneedle Street was in talks with the chancellor about providing a coordinated package of short-term financing to firms.</p> <p>Economists said this could take the form of government guarantees for commercial banks to provide firms with short-term loans, with any losses being underwritten by the Treasury. The IoD also called on ministers to put pressure on high street banks to provide access to cheap emergency loans.</p> <p>Laura Gardiner, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThere have been lots of examples from the past decade of this. Something like that again could be used, with focus on the firms that would suffer the worst hit.\u201d</p> <p>She said the Bank could issue an emergency rate cut of around 50 basis points, sinking the cost of borrowing back down to the lowest level in its 325-year history at 0.25%.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s biggest commercial bank, NatWest \u2013 which is still majority-owned by the government after RBS collapsed in the financial crisis \u2013 said it would provide \u00a35bn of funding support to small firms. It will also offer loan repayment holidays of up to six months, temporary emergency loans and fee-free borrowing.</p> <p>Barclays is offering its business clients 12-month capital repayment holidays on loans worth more than \u00a325,000, as well as bigger overdrafts and access to a \u00a314bn fund launched last year as part of a three-year commitment to small firms to build resilience during uncertain times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Business confidence in Britain is rapidly evaporating as the disruption to the world economy caused by the coronavirus mounts. About one in five company bosses surveyed by the IoD said the outbreak represented a high or severe threat to their organisation, with a further 40% seeing the risk as moderate.</p> <p>Gardiner said the government could launch a compensation scheme for firms with high statutory sick pay bills, which could be increasingly required if more workers were forced to self-isolate. The government previously had a programme called the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/statutory-payments-manual/spm180200\">percentage threshold scheme</a>\u201d, which provided support to companies struggling with staff absences but was abolished in 2014.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that cuts to VAT \u2013 as deployed to support firms and families in the financial crisis \u2013 would be unsuitable for the chancellor this time around. It said incentives for consumers to spend were unwanted at a time when growing numbers of people might need to stay away from public spaces, shops and restaurants.</p> <p>Gardiner said: \u201cThis is a temporary shock. We need to help firms with acute problems with absences. It\u2019s about getting them through this period rather than permanently changing tax bills.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is facing mounting pressure to announce a package of emergency measures in Wednesday\u2019s budget designed to support companies and households through the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. Business leaders warned that the growing scale of the disruption for the economy amid widespread panic on financial markets meant urgent steps were required to shore up confidence. The Institute of Directors said Sunak needed to announce measures on Wednesday to provide UK companies with extra breathing space to spread out their tax payments. Tej Parikh, chief economist at the IoD, said: \u201cGovernment must be at the ready to take swift action to help cash-strapped businesses bridge this challenging period. The upcoming budget also provides an opportune moment to lower business costs and support investment to amplify the post-outbreak recovery.\u201d Firms facing financial distress should be given more time to pay VAT, payroll taxes and corporate tax, the IoD said, adding that HMRC\u2019s \u201ctime to pay\u201d scheme - which offers firms more generous payment terms \u2013 should be expanded. The Bank of England is expected to be called upon by the Treasury to provide extra support to struggling firms. Andrew Bailey, who replaces Mark Carney as the Bank\u2019s governor on 16 March, said last week that Threadneedle Street was in talks with the chancellor about providing a coordinated package of short-term financing to firms. Economists said this could take the form of government guarantees for commercial banks to provide firms with short-term loans, with any losses being underwritten by the Treasury. The IoD also called on ministers to put pressure on high street banks to provide access to cheap emergency loans. Laura Gardiner, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThere have been lots of examples from the past decade of this. Something like that again could be used, with focus on the firms that would suffer the worst hit.\u201d She said the Bank could issue an emergency rate cut of around 50 basis points, sinking the cost of borrowing back down to the lowest level in its 325-year history at 0.25%. Britain\u2019s biggest commercial bank, NatWest \u2013 which is still majority-owned by the government after RBS collapsed in the financial crisis \u2013 said it would provide \u00a35bn of funding support to small firms. It will also offer loan repayment holidays of up to six months, temporary emergency loans and fee-free borrowing. Barclays is offering its business clients 12-month capital repayment holidays on loans worth more than \u00a325,000, as well as bigger overdrafts and access to a \u00a314bn fund launched last year as part of a three-year commitment to small firms to build resilience during uncertain times. Business confidence in Britain is rapidly evaporating as the disruption to the world economy caused by the coronavirus mounts. About one in five company bosses surveyed by the IoD said the outbreak represented a high or severe threat to their organisation, with a further 40% seeing the risk as moderate. Gardiner said the government could launch a compensation scheme for firms with high statutory sick pay bills, which could be increasingly required if more workers were forced to self-isolate. The government previously had a programme called the \u201cpercentage threshold scheme\u201d, which provided support to companies struggling with staff absences but was abolished in 2014. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that cuts to VAT \u2013 as deployed to support firms and families in the financial crisis \u2013 would be unsuitable for the chancellor this time around. It said incentives for consumers to spend were unwanted at a time when growing numbers of people might need to stay away from public spaces, shops and restaurants. Gardiner said: \u201cThis is a temporary shock. We need to help firms with acute problems with absences. It\u2019s about getting them through this period rather than permanently changing tax bills.\u201d",

With a bit of encouragement from central banks, financial markets quickly regained their poise after the 1987 crash and resumed a long upward climb that only came to an end with the financial crisis of 2007.</p> \n   <p>It won\u2019t be nearly so simple to pull off that trick this time. For the past decade, the underlying fragility of the global economy has been masked by perpetually low interest rates. Cheap money has been the fuel for rocketing asset prices \u2013 shares and bonds in particular \u2013 but has done little to boost investment and historically weak productivity growth....</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-crash-monday-is-the-price-were-paying-for-a-decade-of-cheap-money?CMP=share_btn_tw\">More here</a>:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1237104150128836619\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"The Crash Monday panic marks the moment when a decade of denial finally ended and traders woke up to the fact that the financial markets had been bobbing along on a giant wave of debt\". <br>This is great from my top colleague Larry Elliott:<a href=\"https://t.co/S5uN5Fs92U\">https://t.co/S5uN5Fs92U</a></p>\u2014 Heather Stewart (@GuardianHeather) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianHeather/status/1237104150128836619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 9, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e669cd88f08c2df6d276484\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T19:48:49.536Z\">7.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Wall Street traders have looked particularly stressed, and positively shell-shocked, at times today as the market rout has intensified.</strong></p> \n  <p>Here are a few pictures from the New York stock exchange:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"529330c6451f4e10c076cf1ad4527fca52e5482f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/529330c6451f4e10c076cf1ad4527fca52e5482f/0_0_6207_3823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Floor officials watching the open of the New York stock market today.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Floor officials watching the open of the New York stock market today.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9abd42b551fe858cfabe0fe43eb5a430f7158965\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9abd42b551fe858cfabe0fe43eb5a430f7158965/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 9, 2020.

In good times, when the oil price peaked in late 2018, it was 4.8%. In other words, well more than half of heavily-indebted US energy companies have borrowing costs that are going through the roof. Gulp. </p> \n  <p>In another illustration of how risky the situation is, Standard &amp; Poors says the percentage of oil and gas borrowers with negative outlooks on their credit rating - which gauges their financial strength and is key for borrowing money on reasonable terms - is around 33%, which is well above the long-term average of 19%. </p> \n  <p>Central bankers have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/16/global-economy-faces-19tn-corporate-debt-timebomb-warns-imf\">worrying about the US high yield bond markets</a> for quite a while now already.

      "bodyText": "Finally, today\u2019s wild markets dominate some of Tuesday\u2019s newspapers. Here\u2019s a selection: Good night, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s market rout: Global stock markets post biggest falls since 2008 financial crisis Global stock markets posted their steepest falls since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday after a crash in the oil price amplified concerns about the escalating economic cost of the coronavirus outbreak. Almost \u00a3125bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 in the fifth-worst day in history for the index of leading UK company shares, as it plummeted by 7.7% to finish the day below 6,000 points, its lowest level since straight after the Brexit vote in 2016. Trading on Wall Street was frozen within minutes of the market opening as the system to buy and sell shares failed to keep pace with events. The Dow Jones closed down by more than 2,000 points for the first time ever, a decline of 7.8%. On a day of escalating economic losses as countries scrambled to respond to the outbreak, developments included: The number of deaths in the UK rose from three to five after victims were confirmed in Wolverhampton and St Helier, Jersey. Both were in their 70s and had underlying health conditions. A scramble to bring home hundreds of British tourists from northern Italy was under way, even as planes continued to fly between Britain and the locked-down region. Seven Britons tested positive after flying from London to Vietnam alongside an infected 26-year-old woman who had recently travelled to Milan and Paris. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said the coronavirus outbreak was the nation\u2019s \u201cdarkest hour\u201d. Germany and the Republic of Ireland announced emergency funding packages worth billions of euros, with Berlin declaring that it would do \u201ceverything needed to stabilise the economy and secure jobs\u201d. Here\u2019s confirmation that today\u2019s rout marks the 11th anniversary of the end of the 2008-09 crash: Right! I think it\u2019s time for a recap, as traders on Wall Street catch their breath after a shocking day of selling. World stock markets have suffered their worst day since the global financial crisis of 2008, as fears of a global recession swell. Hundreds of billions of dollars, euros and pounds were wiped off stocks across the world, in an alarming sell-off. A collapse in crude prices, triggered by an oil price war, spooked markets which were already reeling from the coronavirus outbreak. The day began with heavy losses in Asia-Pacific; Australia fell over 7%, while the Nikkei fell over 5%. In London, the FTSE 100 plunged by 7.7% in a slump led by the energy sector. That put the Footsie into a bear market - down over 20% since January. More than \u00a3125bn was wiped off the Footsie today, extending its recent rout, with BP (-19%) and Royal Dutch Shell (-18%) badly hit. Other European markets plunged by around 8%, exceeding their worst losses during the debt crisis. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB tumbled by 11%, after Rome announced plans to quarantine millions of people, as its coronavirus deaths kept rising. Wall Street picked up the selling baton, and promptly found trading briefly suspended after tumbling 7% -- triggering a circuit breaker. Once trading resumed, the main indices resumed their losses -- posting their worst day since 2008 as well. Tech shares, banks and energy companies all suffered badly. Apple fell 7.9%, Chevron lost 15% and JP Morgan declined by 13%, in a day when any risers were very rare, and volatility hit an 11-year high. Saudi Arabia\u2019s threat to boost oil production and cut prices sent Brent crude down to just $34 per barrel tonight, down 23% today. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers, demanded a co-ordinated response to address the impact of Covid-19. Analysts fear that the global economy is heading for very rocky waters due to the coronavirus crisis. Oxford Economics has warned tonight: From an economic perspective, the key issue is not just the number of cases of COVID-19, but the level of disruption to economies from containment measures. Disproportionate action will weaken economic activity and potentially induce panic, increasing the chances of investment and consumer spending being delayed or scrapped. Actions to control the spread of the virus outside China have been larger than we envisaged even a couple of weeks ago. What\u2019s more, additional restrictions are likely to be rolled out in economies that are particularly exposed to the virus, which will offset any temporary boost to demand from panic buying We may see MORE losses in Asia and Europe tomorrow, judging by the overnight futures markets. Here\u2019s Kyle Rodda of IG to set the scene (and perhaps give us nightmares): Panic grips global markets: Trading conditions in global markets can appropriately be described as panicked. Already vulnerable amid the unfolding coronavirus crisis, Saudi Arabia\u2019s pledge to flood global oil markets with extra supply kicked market participants in the guts at precisely the worst possible time. The tumble in global stock markets looks familiar to what\u2019s been experienced the last 3 weeks. But there was a difference to yesterday\u2019s sell-off. Market fundamentals have changed again, and they\u2019ve changed for the worse. Oil\u2019s plunge sparks credit risk: Oil prices were belted on Monday, plunging by as much as 30 per cent, as traders priced-in the impacts of an extra 10 million barrels per day of Saudi oil supply. The drop-in oil prices is raising concerns that highly leveraged oil companies, many of which that dominate the US junk bond market, will fall into a state of unprofitability, and lack the means to meet their debt obligations. This credit risk is rippling through corporate bond markets, and raising the chance of financial contagion.... Another day of losses for ASX200: It\u2019s setting up Australia\u2019s ASX200 for another 273 point fall according to SPI Futures. The move will come following yesterday\u2019s 7.3 per cent loss \u2013 its biggest daily loss since October 2008. The energy sector was the biggest loser, tracking the fall in the price of oil, close the day\u2019s trade 20 per cent lower. The financial sector subtracted the most from the mark in terms of points-lost. It cut 136 point from the index, as investors continue to dump banks in a falling rate environment. A late newsflash: Italy is putting the entire country on lockdown! Our main Coronavirus liveblog reports: All of Italy will be placed under the lockdown conditions thus far imposed upon the so-called \u201cred zone\u201d in the north of the country, the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte has said. The restrictions will include banning all public gatherings and preventing all movement other than for work and emergencies. According to the Reuters news agency, he has said the decision was necessary to protect Italy\u2019s most vulnerable citizens and that the right course of action now is for people to stay at home. Shares in America\u2019s tech giants have slumped today. For so long the darlings of Wall Street, the FANG companies were firmly caught in today\u2019s rout. Shares in Apple plunged 7.9%. Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet each lost more than 6% and Amazon fell 5.3%. According to CNBC, this has wiped over $320bn of value off the stocks (or roughly twice the losses on the FTSE 100 today)/ Today\u2019s sell-off will go down in market history as a real shocker -- along with these days to forget: Newsflash: the US stock market has suffered its worst one-day slump since 2008, and the depths of the last financial crisis. After a frightening day of losses, the main indices have all tumbled by over 7%. The Dow has shed 2,000 points -- almost twice its worst daily points slump, to 23,839 points. That\u2019s a plunge of 7.8%, matching the worst days during the financial crisis over 11 years ago. The S&amp;P 500 also had a truly dreadful day, slumping by 7.6% or 225 points to 2,746. Such a dramatic rout shows that Wall Street is bracing for something Very Nasty -- such as a coronavirus epidemic, a recession, and some serious financial distress among companies and households. Today\u2019s slump isn\u2019t a repeat of Black Monday in 1987. It\u2019s a lot more serious! So argues our economics editor Larry Elliott today: The working week began in the City of London with oil prices down by 30% and the leading barometer of UK shares registering falls of more than 8%, so it didn\u2019t take long for it to be dubbed Crash Monday. To be sure, those with long enough memories would have been able to recall a similar market panic in October 1987, when a wave of selling began in east Asia and rolled inexorably westwards. That, though, is about as far as the comparison goes, because the 2020 Black Monday is a lot more serious than the one 30-odd years ago. With a bit of encouragement from central banks, financial markets quickly regained their poise after the 1987 crash and resumed a long upward climb that only came to an end with the financial crisis of 2007. It won\u2019t be nearly so simple to pull off that trick this time. For the past decade, the underlying fragility of the global economy has been masked by perpetually low interest rates. Cheap money has been the fuel for rocketing asset prices \u2013 shares and bonds in particular \u2013 but has done little to boost investment and historically weak productivity growth.... More here: Wall Street traders have looked particularly stressed, and positively shell-shocked, at times today as the market rout has intensified. Here are a few pictures from the New York stock exchange: The recent gyrations in the US stock, bond and currency markets mean American companies face much tighter financial conditions. As Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg points out, that means some firms will soon struggle to access funding or roll over debts, unless policymakers act. Brazil\u2019s stock market is enduring a terribly day too, as its energy sector is routed. The Bovespa index is down 12%, on course for its worst day since 1998. That was the time when Long Term Capital Management (a \u2018pioneering\u2019 hedge fund) collapsed, sending emerging markets reeling, as Reuter\u2019s Jamie McGeever reminds us: Today\u2019s slump comes 11 years after the US bull market began, almost to the day. Back on 10th March 2009, the S&amp;P 500 stopped its post-Lehman Brothers slide, and jumped by around 6% from 676 points to 719. It then quadrupled in value over the next 11 years -- showing the value of buying at the bottom (good luck this time, folks). But as CNN points out, all bull markets come to an end eventually -- often slain by fiscal tightening, high interest rates or recession (usually linked!). Good news! There\u2019s less than one hour of his dreadful day of stock market trading to go. Bad news! The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average are both down over 7% right now. And this can usually be a volatile time on Wall Street, so hold on tight.... Wall Street\u2019s Fear index, the VIX, has hit its highest level since 2008 today - a clear sign of market panic. And astonishingly, it was initially hard to actually trade the VIX due to the market turmoil. Reuters explains. Trading in options on Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge was impossible in the first minutes of Monday\u2019s session due to a complete absence of prices from the market makers on whom trading depends, a representative of index operator CBOE Global Markets Inc (CBOE.Z) said. CBOE Senior Trade Desk Specialist Ryan Stone told Reuters that VIX options were tradable at 9:51 a.m. ET (1351 GMT) but a lack of liquidity led to a lag of about seven minutes until the first trade, around 9:58 a.m. ET. When activity in options resumed, the VIX surged to its highest level since December 2008. The volatility spike occurred as global stock markets were melting down on fears about the spreading coronavirus and crashing oil prices Capital Economics have predicted that the Federal Reserve will cut US borrowing costs to \u201cnear-zero\u201d within the next couple of months. In a new note, they cite to the continuing slump in stock markets and the global spread of the coronavirus. Last week the Fed unexpectedly cut US rates by 50 basis points (0.5% points) to a range of 1%-1.25%, and holds its next scheduled meeting next week. It\u2019s official: oil has suffered its biggest one-day plunge since the Gulf War in January 1991. US crude has closed at $31.13 per barrel, down over $10 per barrel or 24.6, Marketwatch reports. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other economic officials later on Monday to weigh possible actions to stem the fallout over the coronavirus, an administration official told Reuters. The Trump administration is weighing a number of potential policy steps, including paid sick leave, the official said. Here\u2019s a pithy summary of Wall Street\u2019s day of pain: Larry Summers, former US Treasury secretary, is trying to bang heads together on Bloomberg TV. Summers believes a US recession is now \u201cmore likely than not\u201d. He says the White House needs to produce a co-ordinated response, that involves various parts of the US administration, other governments, and international bodies. It should be comprehensive, Summers continues. It needs to tackle the financial challenges caused by lack of credit, the need to maintain economic demand when pay cheques are being cut back, and shore up investment. However, we are \u201cnot close\u201d to having such a comprehensive, coordinated and coherent plan now, he warns. Data firm Refinitiv have confirmed that FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares has had its fifth worst day since 1987: Ireland\u2019s government has agreed an aid package of some \u20ac3bn to deal with the public health and economic impact of the coronavirus. Ministers have also moved to cancel all St Patrick\u2019s Day Parades in the State cancelled in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. The Irish Times has the details: People affected by coronavirus are to receive sick pay of \u20ac305 per week from their first day of illness under a new initiative announced by the Government. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the existing conditions surrounding the sick payments, such as having a specific number of contributions, would be waived. Payments will also be available to the self-employed. The Taoiseach said emergency legislation to change the existing rules governing sick pay would be introduced in the Dail next week. This measure is estimated to cost \u20ac2.4bn. The decisions were made following a meeting of the new Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 and followed advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team. Back on Wall Street, stocks are sliding again as we enter the last two hours of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 8% again, or around 2,065 points, at 23,798 points. That\u2019s its worst points fall ever, and slightly worst than the Dow\u2019s worst days seen in 2008 after Lehman Brothers. Chemicals firm Dow Inc is now down by 20%, a really brutal slump, followed by oil firm Chevron (-15%), construction machinery maker Caterpillar (-13%) and JP Morgan (-13%). The S&amp;P 500 index is also lurching lower, down 7.5% again today. Some shale oil firms, such as Marathon Oil Corporation and Diamondback Energy, have almost halved in value. Britain\u2019s supermarkets are preparing to shake up their operations to keep the UK supplied with food during a coronavirus epidemic. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The government has agreed to relax restrictions on the hours delivery lorries can operate in built up areas in the latest step to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Top supermarket executives held a conference call with George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs on Monday afternoon. It was the second call in four days, after a weekend of panic buying of essential items such as toilet roll, dried pasta and tinned tomatoes. Eustice said: \u201cBy allowing night time deliveries to our supermarkets and food retailers we can free them up to move their stocks more quickly from their warehouses to their shelves.\u201d \u201cOur retailers have well-established contingency plans in place and are taking all the necessary steps to ensure consumers have the food and supplies they need. I will continue to work closely with them over the coming days and weeks on this.\u201d The teleconference also discussed ways in which infected shoppers could pick up goods ordered online from stores without interacting with staff and the potential relaxation of other regulations such as limits on drivers\u2019 working time in order to aid those in self-isolation. Here\u2019s a clip of Allianz\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian predicting US stocks could fall another 10% from current levels: Today\u2019s tumble is the fifth worst in the City\u2019s recent history, dating back to the Big Bang in 1984 when the FTSE 100 was created. We\u2019ve only suffered bigger losses in 1987, around the Black Monday crash, and in 2008 after Lehman Brothers failed. Oil giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell led the FTSE 100 fallers tonight, tumbling by 19% and 18% respectively in London today. That makes sense, given crude prices still down 20% today after Saudi Arabia launched its oil price war over the weekend, vowing to cut prices and boost output. Other top fallers included cruise firm Carnival, down 15%, and mining companies Glencore (-12%) and BHP Group (-16%). Demand for foreign holidays, iron ore and coal are all being hammered today, by coronavirus recession angst. They all helped to push the FTSE 100 down by 7.7%, or almost 500 points, tonight. In the end there was one solitary riser - precious metals producer Polymetal. It gained 0.5%, after anxious customers pushed the gold price to a seven-year high today. This chart shows how the FTSE 100 has hit the buffers in the last fortnight. Back on 21 February, the index closed at 7404 points. Today\u2019s rout means it has slumped by 19% since. By my maths, that means the FTSE 100 has slumped by over \u00a3360bn since the start of trading two weeks ago. European stock markets are also in bear market territory, having shed a fifth of their value in recent weeks: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has plunged into a bear market, after its worst day in over a decade. The index of leading blue-chip shares has just closed for the night, down 496 points or nearly 7.7% at 5,965 points. That wipes \u00a3124bn off the value of the companies on the FTSE 100, as global recession fears, Covid-19 worries and the shock of an oil price war rattle the City. We\u2019ve not seen such a big daily fall since early October 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the worst financial crisis in decades. It also means the FTSE 100 is more than 20% below its recent peak, of 7674 points, set on 17th January. In City parlance, that means we\u2019re in a Bear Market. Newsflash: European stock markets have closed with heavy losses on all the main indices. The Stoxx 600 index of leading EU shares is provisionally down 7.5%, which would be its worst decline since the 2008 financial crisis. Dealers here on the ETX Capital trading floor are referring to specific stocks in numerical codes, so it\u2019s hard to tell which company\u2019s shares are changing hands, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. But what we do know is that some high rolling investors are clearly ignoring advice by the likes of economist Mohammed El-Erian to stay on the sidelines of the market rout, with one client putting in an order for \u00a32m of US shares. Another trader yells. \u201cAnother million sterling has come in.\u201d Investors will now be rushing to put in final orders ahead of the 4:30pm European market close, but the sales team here is not expecting as much chaos after hours. ETX is expected to drop down to two on-site traders overnight to cover the US close and Asia open, though others can easily hop onto computers from home if needed. A number of trading firms have been testing working from home as part of coronavirus crisis prep. Here\u2019s a video of the Wall Street opening bell - shortly before stocks plunged, triggering a rare (brief) market suspension: Lloyd Blankfein, the former boss of Goldman Sachs, has tweeted that the markets will recover soon. He argues that the financial system is in better shape than in 2008 (when Goldman Sachs was bailed out, along with the rest of the US banking sector) Back in the US, the left leaning Economics Policy Institute has a report out on the impact of Covid 19 this morning. And it shows that the coronavirus could have a very serious effect - including on lower-paid workers. EPI concludes: If it comes it will come fast, It will hit lower-wage workers first and hardest, It will impose even faster and larger costs on state and local governments than recessions normally do. The Guardian have just published a report about the impact low wage workers in the US - where the majority do not have adequate (or any) health insurance and few have sick day pay. As one worker told our reporter. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to miss pay so I have gone to work before several times sick as a dog, masked up so my patients wouldn\u2019t catch what I have,\u201d Here\u2019s EPI\u2019s report. The City has entered its final hour of trading, with the FTSE 100 still down 6.6% at 6032 points, a fall of 430 points today. But amid the rout, one plucky stock has clambered into the list of FTSE risers. Supermarket chain Tesco is now up 0.5%, after agreeing to sell its store networks in Thailand and Malaysia for $10.6bn (\u00a38.2bn). The supermarkets are riding out this crash relatively low, thanks to the surge in stock-piling and full-blown panic buying by anxious consumers. Ulas Akincilar, Head of Trading at the online trading platform, INFINOX, says the oil price war is a big low to America\u2019s oil industry -- although it might mean cheaper gasoline too: \u201cThe triggering of America\u2019s equity market circuit breakers, which halted trading on the major US markets for 15 minutes, brought a brief moment of respite and reflection \u2013 rather than recovery. \u201cUS consumers may be relishing the imminent prospect of $2 a gallon gas, but the country\u2019s huge oil industry has been sucked into the vortex of a global crude price war, the flames of which have been fanned by the coronavirus. \u201cThis is no mere Opec-inspired spat. With Saudi Arabia adopting a \u2018pump or die\u2019 strategy, the market is being flooded with supply just as demand plunges in the face of Covid-19 and its chilling effect on travel and trade. Noted economist Mohamed El-Erian fears that Wall Street will continue to slump in the days ahead. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, told CNBC that this is no time to be buying the dip or selling everything. His advice - stay on the sidelines. \u201cThis is going to be treacherous for a while. I would advise most retail investors to stay on the sidelines, not panic. There will be opportunities but they\u2019re not now.\u201d El-Erian suspects that Wall Street could fall 20% or 30% from February\u2019s record peak before stabilising. As we\u2019re currently 19% down from that high, further heavy losses are possible.... After a brief lull, phones are ringing and traders\u2019 computers are firing off alerts non-stop on the ETX Capital trading floor again. There\u2019s speculation that investors outside of the US may have been caught off guard by the American time change over the weekend and still expected Wall Street to open at 2:30pm London time. It\u2019s hard to believe that many investors would have missed the news of the stock market plunge at 1:30pm, but everyone should be on board now. Regardless, with trade volumes up again, some dealers have had trouble executing orders. Here\u2019s our updated news story on today\u2019s market rout: If the stock market crash isn\u2019t bad enough, the fallout in the US bond markets is perhaps even scarier to contemplate - particularly given a boom in risky borrowing by US oil and gas firms in recent years. Deutsche Bank has just issued a note warning there could be a \u201cMinsky moment\u201d for high-yield American bonds - in a nod to the economist Hyman Minsky\u2019s theory on how markets can crash amid widespread panic following periods of speculative investment. The US subprime collapse of 2008 is regarded as one such moment, so the comparison is ominous to say the least... The bank\u2019s analysts warn that defaults - companies being unable to repay or refinance their debts - are now inevitable, with around $13bn of debts due for repayment before the end of 2021 from the most heavily-indebted oil and gas firms. In a shocking sign of the chaos to come, it says the distress ratio for US oil and gas high yield debt - defined as the proportion of debt trading with a spread of at least 1,000 basis points (in other words, bonds with yields that are more than 1,000 basis points higher than a reference yield such as on a US Treasury bond) - was already 62.3% as of Friday before today\u2019s oil price collapse. To put that in context, it says the distress ratio hit 43.9% in March 2016 when oil prices last crashed. In good times, when the oil price peaked in late 2018, it was 4.8%. In other words, well more than half of heavily-indebted US energy companies have borrowing costs that are going through the roof. Gulp. In another illustration of how risky the situation is, Standard &amp; Poors says the percentage of oil and gas borrowers with negative outlooks on their credit rating - which gauges their financial strength and is key for borrowing money on reasonable terms - is around 33%, which is well above the long-term average of 19%. Central bankers have been worrying about the US high yield bond markets for quite a while now already. This could be the start of something quite dramatic indeed. Bang on cue.... The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 14.5% so far this year. Just last month, the Dow hit a record high of 29,551 points. At just 24,420 right now, it\u2019s 19% down from that peak -- a very bruising slump that has hit US savers badly. Back in January, the US president was trumpeting Wall Street\u2019s performance: Every sector on the S&amp;P 500 index is tumbling this morning. Energy stocks are leading the rout here too, tracking the 20% slump in crude prices. Banks are down too, as traders anticipate a recession - and a possible jump in loan defaults. Bank of America and Citigroup are both down 10%, alongside JP Morgan. Edward Moya of trading firm OANDA says traders are selling despite forecasts that US interest rates could be slashed towards zero soon: Stock markets in freefall and it seems unlikely central banks and governments in the short-term can do anything. Technical selling is getting ugly and even though expectations are high the Fed will take rates to the zero bound, the retail investor will likely want to wait this one out. It seems the collapse with oil prices have added a log to the deflationary fire the Fed will try to extinguish. Virus fears, deflationary risks, and growing stress in the credit markets, means markets will see the Fed launch a new QE program very soon. Eventually investors will start scaling back into stocks, but it seems the technical selling can remain ugly for a couple more days. The longer-term playbook will likely to buy stocks again as markets will move beyond the virus, adjust to lower oil prices, and expect a wrath of global stimulus likely to remain in place over the next year. One trader\u2019s computer on the ETX Capital trading floor in London is firing off notifications that sound like a bomb raid alarm, which is a bit unnerving. \u201cI\u2019m working to sell 100 [stocks]\u201d one trader yells. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bid in,\u201d another says. Another client is looking to sell \u201c50% of everything.\u201d Traders are having to seek out multilingual staff, including those who speak Spanish, to help sort out trades from international clients. Those dealing with institutional clients are trying to push through their trades amid the chaos. Each of the 30 members of the Dow Jones industrial average is falling today - some vertiginously so. Companies particularly exposed to global growth, and travel, are the worst affected. Chemicals giant Dow Inc has plunged by 16%, followed by airline maker Boeing (-12%), oil giant Chevron (-11%),investment bank JP Morgan (-9%) and construction and machinery maker Caterpillar (-8.5%). Today\u2019s rout has pushed America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index of shares to its lowest since June 2019. The Dow (which contains just 30 of America\u2019s biggest, most famous companies) has troughed to its lowest since January 2019. US investors might think they\u2019re getting off lightly -- Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is at its weakest point since 2016 (when a Brexit-weakened pound started driving shares up). Yikes! The Dow Jones industrial average just briefly fell by 2,000 points(!), as the selloff gathers more pace. That (un)comfortably smashes its worst points performance -- the 1,190 point tumble late last month. It means roughly 7.5% has been wiped off the Dow -- the worst day since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008 Trading has resumed on Wall Street... and stocks are continuing to slide. The S&amp;P 500 index is now down 7.3% today (an eye-watering plunge), as the automatic trading halt ends. Investors have caught their breath....and decided that they\u2019re still panicking about a global recession, an oil price war, and the spread of Covid-19 around the world. Meanwhile in London, stocks are sliding deeper into the red... as my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports: \u201cThis is a meltdown, this is an absolute meltdown,\u201d says Michael Baker, who is leading the sales team at spread-betting firm ETX Capital. Traders are hollering across banks of desks, yelling out trades. They\u2019re trying to figure out which stocks are trading in the US after the S&amp;P 500 was briefly halted following its 7% fall a moment ago. You can barely hear anyone over the calls and trading notifications, sounding like alarms across the office. \u201cI can\u2019t buy mate, it\u2019s limit down,\u201d one trader yells. \u201cJust tried to buy the Nasdaq - but I can\u2019t,\u201d another says. Not everyone is being pessimistic, with one trader yelling that at least one high net worth client had put in an order to buy hundreds of US shares. (No word over whether that is a bet that has any chance of paying off, though) This is a \u201clong-term market for investors\u201d, Wall Street chief Stacey Cunningham adds, as she tries to end on a note of reassurance. Stacey Cunningham, head of the NYSE, is on CNBC now talking about circuit breakers. \u201cIt\u2019s a pause to catch our breath and reevaluate,\u201d she says. Newsflash: Trading has been briefly suspended on the New York stock exchange. The 7% plunge on the S&amp;P 500 has triggered automatic circuit breakers, which are designed to prevent a market meltdown. Trading is now on hold for 15 minutes, to let investors catch their breath. But European markets aren\u2019t suspended -- they\u2019re plunging further into the red, with the FTSE 100 now down 8.3% today (its worst rout since 2008). The Wall Street bell was rung by a group of women from Citi. The group knocked elbows rather than shaking hands in a nod to Covid-19 -- before the selloff began.... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has plunged by nearly 7% at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled by 1,758 points -- or almost 7% -- as Wall Street joins the global selloff. That\u2019s the Dow\u2019s biggest points slump ever -- and on track for its worst day in percentage terms since 2008. The S&amp;P 500 index, which is a broader measure of US companies, is also down more than 6%, with oil companies and banks among the biggest fallers. The Wall Street opening bell is about to be rung..... Ahead of what could be a ghastly session on Wall Street, President Donald Trump has defended the US response to the coronavirus: With just minutes before US stock markets open there is a chance we could see \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d put in to action. Circuit breakers pause trading if the markets fall a certain percentage. The first one would be triggered if the S&amp;P 500 drops 7% - which looks easily possible right now. Trading would stop for 15 minutes. The next level is a 13% decline. Gulp. One exchange-traded fund (ETF) is suggesting the S&amp;P 500 could fall 7%, although there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty right now. US technology stocks are expected to plunge at the Wall Street open, with Apple down over 7% in pre-markets trading. Stocks are trembling in London as traders await Wall Street\u2019s verdict. The FTSE 100 is now down 7.6%, or 486 points, at 5967 -- a three-year low -- as another burst of sell orders rattle through trading floors.... Financial research group TS Lombard have predicted that Covid-19 will drag the global economy into a \u201cmajor recession\u201d. It will also forcing stocks into a bear market, they fear (as is already happening in some markets today). In a new note, chief economist Charles Dumas writes: Global spread of the Covid-19 virus looks likely to cause a worldwide recession and bear market in stocks. Nobody knows how serious the disease is likely to be. But The Brookings Institution\u2019s estimates suggest a reasonable likelihood that 10% of the US population will catch the virus, and of those at least 1% will die. As that implies more than 300,000 US deaths, personal fear is rational \u2013 there is more to fear than \u2018fear itself\u2019. Here are the key points from his note: Coronavirus seems likely to cause a major recession and bear market Confined to China, the disease was a supply-side menace, but limited Spread globally, it is far less easily tackled than in authoritarian China US consumers\u2019 major cutbacks could cut Q2 GDP sharply Big Chinese infrastructure-build to focus recovery on manufacturing European crisis most acute in Italy \u2013 could turn into financial crisis US stocks likely to fall to 2500 on the S&amp;P, down 26% from peak Budget airline easyJet says it is cancelling some flights to Italy, following the mass quarantine measures announced by Rome over the weekend. Here\u2019s the statement: Following a decree issued by the Italian authorities implementing further restrictions for anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces in Italy, easyJet in common with a number of other airlines is reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports for the period from now until 3 April 2020. \u201cIn the short-term we will be cancelling a number of flights to and from these destinations on Monday 9 March. We will be advising all affected passengers of the cancellations by email and SMS. Customers on flights scheduled to operate to and from these airports will be given the option of a full refund or to change their flight. \u201cWe expect to continue to reduce the number of flights in and out of Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports in the period up to 3 April and will provide a further update on our schedule in due course. \u201cWhilst these circumstances are outside of our control, we apologise to all affected customers for any inconvenience caused.\u201d Time for a quick markets catch up, as we brace for Wall Street to open (at 9.30am US time, or 1.30pm GMT). Britain\u2019s stock market is suffering one of its worst days in decades, as fears of a global recession and an oil price war hit stocks. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index plunged by 8.5% at the start of trading, and is currently down 7% or 450 points at 60058. Every stock on the index is down, led by BP (-20%). Other top fallers include cruise operator Carnival (-10%) and mining giant Glencore (-11%). Oil stocks are also dragging the smaller FTSE 250 index deep into the red. It\u2019s currently down 5.5%. European shares are also suffering their worst day in years. The Stoxx-600 index is down over 6.5%, with deep losses in Germany (-7.1%) and France (-7.3%). Italy\u2019s market has slumped by 10% after Rome\u2019s government announced plans to quarantine millions of people in the north of the country. As things stand, European markets are going to end the day in Bear Markets -- more than 20% off their recent peaks back in January. Analyst Fawad Razaqzada of Trading Candles explains why the markets are tanking today: Well, first there is coronavirus and the growing worries over the spread and economic risks it poses. Virus cases have topped 109,000 worldwide with the death toll exceeding 3,800. Then you have oil prices crashing, hurting energy stocks and raising concerns over the economic health of the oil producing nations. Crude prices tumbled after Saudi Arabia launched an aggressive price war following Russia\u2019s refusal to agree to new production cuts. With demand falling due to Covid-19 and the already-excessive supply set to get larger, a speedy recovery looks unlikely for crude oil. This is the result - electronic trading boards dripping with red: What started with the biggest oil-price collapse since 1991 is shaping up to be one of the wildest days in years for global markets, says Bloomberg: Panic selling, margin calls, vanishing liquidity and coronavirus work-from-home arrangements were just some of the challenges traders faced as risk assets plunged, currency volatility soared and money flooded into government bonds. They also had to figure out how an oil-price war and rapidly spreading outbreak will affect the global economy, companies and geopolitics. \u201cThe day has been absolutely chaotic,\u201d said Eugene Kang, whose team trades assets including Russian government bonds at NH Investment &amp; Securities Co. from Seoul. \u201cFinancial markets have been caught off guard.\u201d In other developments: The oil price is still being hammered by Saudi Arabia\u2019s new price war, with Brent crude down 22% at $34.91 per barrel, and US crude down almost 24% at $31.40. The US Federal Reserve is trying to pump more liquidity into the system, by boosting its overnight repo operation from $100bn to $150bn. That could help banks get their hands on dollars, if they\u2019re reluctant to lend to each other. Many stock markets in Asia plunged into bear markets today, including Japan and Singapore, following a rout which wiped 7% off Australia\u2019s market. Paul O\u2019Connor, Head of the Multi-Asset Team at Janus Henderson Investors, has stuck his neck out and predicted that today COULD be a good time to buy.... He writes that investor \u2018complacency\u2019 has dramatically turned to \u2018panic\u2019, as the prospects of a global recession rise - triggering an urgent \u201cbroad-based de-risking\u201d. But in such turbulent times, there could be value out there..... Whereas last week, investors were largely focused on trying to evaluate the potential impact of the coronavirus on global growth, they are now worried about scenarios involving self-reinforcing adverse market dynamics. The oil shock has jolted the hitherto-resilient markets for high yield debt and emerging market bonds. The risk now is that investor redemptions will accelerate at a time when market liquidity is already under pressure. Still, the scale of the repricing has been so rapid today that value is already beginning to emerge. Credit markets have gone from being overbought to oversold, overnight. So in conclusion: One thing we do know however is that markets are now in panic mode. While it would be foolish to try to call the bottom in the markets, we would rather be buying in this environment rather than selling. We are gradually rebuilding risk exposures into market weakness. The key word here is gradually..... Savers are nursing losses approaching 10% in their pension schemes since the start of the coronavirus market panic, while holders of share Isas have lost as much as a quarter of all their money in some funds, my colleague Patrick Collinson explains: The stock market rout means someone who had accumulated \u00a3250,000 in their pension scheme at the start of this year will have seen it shrivel to about \u00a3225,000 on Monday. Holders of final salary-style pensions, mostly in the public sector, lose nothing as their payouts are guaranteed. However, further falls in the market will mean these schemes will drop further into deficit, requiring employers (such as local authorities and universities ) to somehow find the cash to top them up. One saving grace is that the vast majority of pension schemes invest less in \u201cequities\u201d (shares) than in the past, so a 5% fall in the market does not equate to a 5% fall in the total value of the fund. The typical pension fund is about 60%-65% in shares, with the rest in government and corporate bonds and property. Wall Street appears to be heading for a very rough session, when trading begins in an hour\u2019s time. The futures contracts for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were all frozen overnight after falling by 5%. So traders are somewhat flying blind right now, although some individual stocks (including banks and oil firms) are down heavily right now. Marketwatch explains: Futures fell their 5% limit in early Asian trade and have traded near there for most of the session. Stocks could see steeper losses when cash trading opens Monday. Initial circuit breakers kick in to temporarily halt trading with a fall of 7%. Trading firms are starting to block small investors from buying US stock futures, over fears they will lose too much money by taking a punt and trying to buy on the dip. \u201cDo not let retail clients buy,\u201d one ETX Capital dealer warned his colleagues on the trading floor. US futures trading has been restricted from falling any lower following a 5% drop in US stock futures overnight from their previous closing price. It triggered a circuit breaker, known as \u201climit down,\u201d which limits derivatives trading linked to major US indexes including the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow. Hundreds of thousands of sales orders are piling up and are expected to drive US futures down even further whenever the limit down restrictions are lifted. So while investors technically can buy futures positions, there is a worry that less sophisticated investors could get into trouble financially due to another expected drop. Another trader admitted. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Gold hit a new seven-year high this morning, amid the mad dash for safe-haven assets. One ounce of bullion jumped to $1,702 for the first time since 2013. It\u2019s also trading at record levels in sterling terms, Adrian Ash, director of research at online precious metals trader BullionVault, says demand for gold has soared since the coronavirus crisis escalated: \u201cOver the last 7 days, trading volumes on BullionVault have jumped 102% from the previous 52-week average, with more than \u00a338.2m of gold, silver and platinum changing hands in total ($49.6m, \u20ac44.1, \u00a55.2bn). \u201cNet of client selling, gold demand has risen 545.3% from the prior 52-week average, totalling 6 large bars last week, each weighing 12.5 kilograms. How low could the markets go? Clem Chambers, CEO of stocks and shares website ADVFN, reckons the London stock market will keep falling in the coming weeks. We could see some bounces along the way, but he predicts the FTSE could hit 5,500 -- down almost another 10% from today\u2019s levels! Chambers says: \u201cIt\u2019s Crash Monday with the already fragile markets in free fall following the unravelling of OPEC Plus and Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war against the backdrop of falling oil demand triggered by the Coronavirus. We will see a few short-lived bounces along the way, but 5500 is the next stop on the FTSE. The Dow and S&amp;P have not crashed yet but when they do it will hammer the FTSE hard, again. It\u2019s difficult to see the FTSE below 5000 but it\u2019s not impossible. This rout is far from over and its aftermath will take more than months to pan out.\u201d America\u2019s central bank is pumping tens of billions of dollars into the markets today, in an attempt to stop the financial system running out of liquidity. The Federal Reserve has boosted its overnight repo operations from $100bn to $150bn. That means there\u2019s an extra $50bn on offer to US banks, who might be worried about lending to rivals in the current climate. A repo operation allows a bank to access dollars, in return for handing over quality collateral such as US government bonds and mortgage securities. Such operations are typically in demand during times of financial stress. Correction: the New York stock exchange will open at 1.30pm UK time today, not 2.30pm. My mistake - I\u2019d forgotten that US clocks moved forward an hour yesterday. So 9.30am New York time will come round sooner. On a trading floor near London\u2019s Liverpool Street Station, the trading floor of spreadbetting firm ETX Capital is buzzing. The firm has called in extra staff to deal with a surge in trades after oil plunged overnight and the European stock markets tumbled this morning. ETX\u2019s usual day team of about two or three traders has more than doubled, and will be bulked up to around 10 in the coming hours as they rev-up for the Wall Street open at 1:30pm UK time (corrected). TV screens are set to Bloomberg and Sky News and banter between traders and dealers is intermittently being drowned out by a chorus of notifications. Phones are ringing, while terminals are bleating out a series of alerts - dings, slide whistles and simulated space gun blasts - signalling further market moves and flurry of new trades requests from clients. Michael Baker, who is leading the sales team, says it will be all-hands-on-deck for at least 24 hours. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this since the financial crisis.\u201d Financial service company Hargreaves Lansdown, which provides ISAs, pensions, and share dealing, says it is \u201cvery busy\u201d this morning. It\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s people looking to sell, or buy, or simply check how much poorer they are today. UK bank NatWest has announced a package of funding support worth \u00a35bn for small businesses struggling to stay afloat as the coronavirus outbreak drags down the economy. Alongside the funding, the majority government-owned bank will offer loan repayment holidays of up to six months, temporary emergency loans and fee-free borrowing. In some respects, this is simply what a bank should always do \u2013 providing funds and flexible repayment terms to customers \u2013 but that NatWest feels the need to announce this package is illustrative of the scale of the stress facing firms. It comes as pressure mounts on the Treasury and the Bank of England to slash interest rates and cut taxes to support families and companies. Clearly the banking system has a role to play as well. The German government says it hopes to avoid any business falling into insolvency as a result of the coronavirus. Spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference in Berlin that: \u201cThe government will do everything to support businesses and workers in this great economic challenge. \u201cOur goal is that ideally no business in Germany will fall into insolvency due to the coronavirus outbreak, and ideally no job will be lost.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). German firms will be suffering badly from the coronavirus chaos, particularly travel firms and manufacturers (whose supply chains have been badly disrupted). So if the economy does fall into recession, a lot of help could be needed. BP\u2019s share price has slumped to its lowest level since 2016 (the last time the oil price cratered). That\u2019s a blow to BP\u2019s army of small shareholders. At just 320p, shares are dropping towards the levels seen after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. Some more bad news for incoming Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey: his leaving do has been scrapped due to coronavirus fears. The party for the outgoing Financial Conduct Authority chief executive was set to take place on Wednesday evening at the RSA House near Charing Cross, just a few days before he\u2019s meant to take up the BoE post on 16 March. TheCityUK, which co-organised the event with the FCA, had been expecting around 170 attendees, including FCA employees, journalists and people from across banking, insurance and professional services industry. The industry lobby group said in an email to attendees that after \u201cconsultation with the FCA, we are cancelling our event with Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA, due to ongoing concerns related to COVID-19.\u201d That could be a relief for Bailey -- last week, MPs blasted the FCA\u2019s \u201cculture and operations\u201d, saying there was an unacceptable \u201cgap\u201d between public expectations and its performance. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, says Saudi Arabia has created a race to the bottom to sell Crude into the market: \u201cSaudi Arabia declared an oil price war this weekend, as OPEC+ departed Vienna on Friday without a deal. It\u2019s still a slight hope that Saudi Arabia is playing this card in an effort to push OPEC+ members back to the negotiation table before the current production cuts expire at the end of March, however Russia is unlikely to bend to such power tactics. \u201cSaudi Arabia basically offered its oil on a fire-sale as it dropped its Official Selling Prices (OSPs) to all regions by $6-8 per barrel - the sharpest decline in Saudi Arabia\u2019s OSPs in decades. Saudi Arabia is undercutting everyone else by a mile, and as such it has created a race to the bottom where everyone must undercut each other in order to be able to sell their crude oil into the market. The oil price is still languishing at its lowest since early 2016, down over 20% today. US crude: down $8.7 at $32.50 per barrel Brent crude: down $9 at $36.15 per barrel This is a particular blow to America\u2019s oil industry. Thousands of jobs could be lost at Houston, Texas, the centre of the US energy industry. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, analyst Amrita Sen of Energy Aspects warned that \u201cHouston is going to suffer so much, they\u2019re already suffering...\u201d Stock markets in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore have all fallen into bear market territory today, amid a wave of selling, Bloomberg reports. Volatility in European stock markets (known as the Fear Index) has hit its highest levels since the eurozone debt crisis back in 2011. Another very worrying sign. The oil price war has triggered turmoil in the currency market too. Russia\u2019s rouble has slumped by over 7% today (an astonishing slump) from 68 roubles to the US dollar to nearly 74. Saudi\u2019s decision to launch an aggressive oil price war - by cutting prices and boosting output - could hurt Russia\u2019s economy badly, taking a massive chunk out of Moscow\u2019s revenues. Optimism among eurozone investors has absolutely crumbled this month, as the coronavirus crisis has raged. The monthly Sentix survey of investor morale, just released, has slumped to -17.1 for March, down from +5.2 in February. That\u2019s the lowest reading since April 2013, when the eurozone debt crisis was raging, and even worse than expected. It shows that many experts expect Europe to slump into recession in 2020 (including Berenberg, as we reported earlier). Sentix chief Manfred Huebner said \u201cinvestors are preparing for a long period of economic weakness\u201d, and urged policymakers to take action quickly. As Sentix puts it: The new coronavirus, which is now spreading significantly across the globe and requires consistent measures to contain it, is plunging the global economy into recession. Never before has such a strong synchronised collapse of the global economy been measurable in our data. The Saudi price war could drive oil prices below $30 a barrel for the first time since the 2016 oil price crash, according to market experts at S&amp;P Global Platts. The price reporting agency said a \u201creasonably aggressive\u201d stance from the Saudis could see the Kingdom raise its production from 9.75 million barrels a day in the first quarter to 10.25 million barrels per day in 2Q. But a \u201cmore aggressive and offensive\u201d stance could see Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil output surge to highs of 11 million barrel a day, enough to drive the oil price into the $20s for the first time since early 2016 if the coronavirus is not contained. Meanwhile Russia is expected to raise its oil production by 300,000 barrels a day within the next three months before US shale oil producers are forced out of the market by lower prices. Shin Kim, at S&amp;P Global Platts, says \u201cAll signs point to Saudi Arabia and Russia wanting to inflict maximum pain. \u201cAt the very least to instigate as fast a response as possible from US shale producers and each other.\u201d The FTSE 100\u2019s early-morning slump is one of the worst in history, reports Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He suspects that investors are moving from the \u201cpanic\u201d stage to the full-blown \u201ccapitulation stage\u201d, as the coronavirus crisis escalates. \u201cThinking about buying in today\u2019s market is only for the brave and there remains considerable uncertainty about the spread of coronavirus and its effect on economies and society. \u201cBy 9am the FTSE was trading 7.1% lower at 6,004 which put the index back to the levels seen before the EU referendum vote in early 2016. \u201cThe index initially fell to 5,899 on Monday, representing an 8.7% decline which is the fourth biggest one-day fall on record. The worst falls were recorded on 19 October 1987 (-10.8%) and 20 October 1987 (-12.2%) during the Black Monday crash, and then on 10 October 2008 (-8.8%) as the global financial crisis unfolded. \u201cVery few stocks escaped the misery. In early trading on Monday funeral services group Dignity was among the stocks in positive territory, perhaps as investors predicted it would see an increase in demand. However, this rally was short lived and its shares quickly started to fall. Today\u2019s market rout comes as the number of Covid-19 infections worldwide bursts over the 110,000 mark. The global death toll is heading towards 4,000 -- including the third death in the UK last night. Our main coronavirus liveblog has all the details: After 90 minutes trading, the London stock market is still reeling from its opening 8.5% crash. But there are signs that the City is catching its breath. The Footsie is still suffering a right old kicking, but has now clambered back over the 6,000 point mark. It\u2019s currently 348 points lower at 6115, a loss of 5.5% today -- which would be its worst since 2008. Oil giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell are the top fallers, both down by 15% right now, tracking the slump in crude prices (currently down 20%). Gavekal Research analyst Tom Holland says Saudi Arabia has triggered today\u2019s market rout by launching an oil price war over the weekend. As he puts it: \u201cIf you ever wondered what would happen if someone lobbed a hand grenade into a bloodbath, now you know. It\u2019s not pretty,\u201d (that\u2019s via the FT). Germany bank Berenberg has forecast that the coronavirus will drag Europe\u2019s economy into recession this year. It has slashed its forecast for European growth, and sees a sharp downturn in Italy and Germany during 2020. It also believes the UK will only grow by 0.9% this year, even if the government boosts spending in Wednesday\u2019s budget. Berenberg\u2019s Holger Schmieding explains: Italy: We now expect GDP to decline by 1.0% instead of 0.3% in Q2. With a downward revision to Q1 GDP from -0.1% to -0.8%, this takes our forecast for the full year 2020 to -1.2% from -0.3%. Eurozone: We now project that GDP will fall by 0.4% qoq in Q1 and 0.5% qoq in Q2 instead of stagnating in Q1 and falling mildly by 0.2% qoq in Q2. For full-year 2020, we look for a contraction of -0.1% instead of growth of 0.5%. Germany: We now look for declines in GDP by 0.2% and 0.6% qoq in Q1 and Q2 instead of falls by just 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. That brings our annual forecast 2020 as a whole to -0.4% instead of 0%. France: We now expect GDP to rise merely by 0.1% instead of 0.2% qoq in Q1 and contract by 0.3% instead of advancing by 0.1% in Q2. For the full year 2020, we now look for growth of just 0.3% instead of 0.8%. UK: We reduce our 2020 call to 0.9% from 1.3% previously after lowering Q1 to 0.3% qoq from 0.4%, Q2 to 0.0% qoq from 0.3% and Q3 to 0.3% from 0.4%. We expect the UK to announce a sizeable fiscal stimulus in response to the virus-related disruptions on 11 March. After a panicky open, the European stock markets are all suffering huge losses as well. The Milan stock market is absolutely tumbling, after Italy\u2019s government sealed off large swathes of its country in an attempt to combat Covid-19. This has dragged the FTSE MIB index of Italian shares down by 10% - a proper crash. The selloff is dragging the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index into a bear market, alongside the FTSE 100. Today\u2019s stock market slump is attracting parallels with the crash of 1987. Neil Wilson of Markets.com writes: This will be remembered as Black Monday. If you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse than the last fortnight, think again. The blood really is running in the streets, it\u2019s utter carnage out there. The astonishing 30% slump in the oil price today (thanks to the Saudi price war), is having a serious impact on equities. That\u2019s because anyone who bet on the oil price going up is suffering massive losses, and may be forced to sell shares to cover them. As Wilson puts it: There\u2019s a risk of losses in oil positions needing to be covered by selling down elsewhere - we\u2019re in a vicious circle. Equity markets are hideous today and these kind of moves are to be afraid of as they can lead to aggressive tightening in credit that can spiral into real financial distress. We don\u2019t know even know what kind of impact the coronavirus will have on the economy yet bond and equity markets are screaming recession. The FTSE 100 is now more than 20% off its recent peak -- which means we\u2019re in Bear Market territory. Back in January, the blue-chip index was trading over 7,600 points -- some 22% higher than this morning\u2019s trough. As you can see, the slump began two weeks ago -- after it became clear that Covid-19 was spreading across the globe, with a spike of cases in Italy. This means the nation\u2019s pension pots, ISAs and other savings will have suffered very severe damage this year. Money is absolutely pouring into government bonds, as investors try to find somewhere safe to put their money. This is forcing prices to stratospheric highs, which pushes the yield (or interest rate) to new lows. The yield on Britain\u2019s two-year government bonds (or gilts) has just fallen below zero. That means the UK government could effectively borrow for free, and simply return the money in 2022. A good sign? Hardly. The yields on US Treasury bonds are also falling again to fresh record lows. It suggests the markets are very pessimistic about growth and inflation prospects, and highly reluctant to own shares this morning. European stock markets are also plunging this morning. The Stoxx 600, which contains Europe\u2019s largest 600 companies, has tumbled by over 6%. As in London, many stocks failed to open at the start of trading -- implying that market-makers were struggling to match buy and sell orders. I think that\u2019s why Italy is only down 2% right now.... This morning\u2019s tumble, below 6,000 points, means the FTSE 100 is languishing at its lowest point since summer 2016. Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to launch an oil price war, and the deepening coronavirus crisis, are a toxic combination for markets. Kyle Rodda of trading firm IG explains: Markets have gone into panic mode, pure and simple. The fall-out between the Russian and Saudis has lead the Saudis to pledge over the weekend that it will flood the global oil market with supply, in order exert their will over oil prices. The plunge in the oil price has raised major credit risks in financial markets, which are already reeling from the expected slowdown in global growth because of the coronavirus. Here are the top fallers on the FTSE 100, as panicky investors ditch stocks. Shares in international equipment rental firm Ashtead is now leading the rout -- its business would be badly hurt by a global recession. There are still no risers. NEWSFLASH: The FTSE 100 index has plunged by over 8.5%, on track for its worst one-day fall since 2008. The index of top blue-chip shares has slumped by around 565 points, or 5895, as trading gets under way. Every stock is in the red, hit by fears of a global recession. Oil giants are leading the rout, with BP down 27% and Royal Dutch Shell losing 20%, following the oil-price war launched by Saudi Arabia over the weekend. This is really unusual - and a bad sign. The London stock market is struggling to match buy and sell orders this morning. Ding ding! European markets are open, triggering a burst of sell orders. The FTSE 100 is being dragged deep into the red.... already shedding 120 points or 2%. But half the index isn\u2019t actually trading yet -- including the banks and the oil giants. This suggests there are going to be BIG losses this morning. Shares in Saudi Aramco, the country\u2019s oil giant, have been suspended after slumping by 10% in early trading. The oil price has suffered an astonishing plunge overnight. Brent crude slumped by 30% at the start of trading, after Saudi Arabia effectively launched an oil price war against competitors such as Russia and the US. After failing to get Russia\u2019s agreement for major supply cuts, Saudi authorities retaliated by slashing export prices and boosting production. This sent Brent crude reeling to just $31 per barrel at one point -- its lowest since 2016 - down from $45 on Friday night. It\u2019s the biggest single fall since the start of the first Gulf war in 1991, and there\u2019s chatter that the price could fall even lower if other players retaliate. Analysts in Australia are reeling from its worst stock market slump since 2008, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: \u201cThere is genuine panic in the price action \u2026\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at the web trading platform Pepperstone in Melbourne. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this for years.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said the market would not bottom out until the US situation was clearer. \u201cWe need a clear sign that the outbreak in the US is contained but we\u2019re not there yet because the number of cases and deaths is still on the rise. We have to see what happens with containment measures there, such as travel restrictions and shutdowns. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Tin hats on! Global stocks markets are facing their worst day since the financial crisis of 2008. The escalating coronavirus crisis, and the eruption of an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, are triggering a massive wave of selling today. Asia-Pacific stock markets have been severely hit already. Fears that Covid-19 will trigger a global recession has sent investors reeling, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei slumping by 5%. Australia\u2019s market has tumbled by a shocking 7%, its worst day since the crisis. European markets are heading for similar losses - Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is being called down 600 points, or over 9%, when the new trading week begins. We\u2019ve not seen such a severe loss since the aftermath of Lehman Brother\u2019 collapse a decade ago. This would plunge European markets into a full-blown bear-market --- wiping 20% off their recent peaks. Trading in US stock market futures has been frozen overnight, after falling 5%: Italy\u2019s decision to quarantine 16 million people has triggered turmoil in the markets, as investors try to assess which other countries will take similar measures -- and its impact on growth. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has already weighed in, warning that the risk of a global recession was rising as the spread of the coronavirus causes a simultaneous supply and demand shock throughout the world economy. As my colleague Martin Farrer writes: Stock markets in Europe and the United States are braced for their biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis after the start of the trading week saw panic selling amid the double threat of a coronavirus-driven global recession and an oil-price war. It follows huge losses on Asian markets on Monday where fears about the worsening worldwide economic slowdown were exacerbated by the shock decision by Saudi Arabia over the weekend to increase oil production in an attempt to drive competitors such as Russia and the US out of the market. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through another dramatic day -- which will also see a new test of eurozone investor confidence: The agenda 9.30am GMT: The Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence: expected to plunge to -12.2, from +5.2",

My wife kept saying, honey, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. You\u2019ve got full cover. Whatever is not available at Mt Isa, we can fly into Brisbane and get it there.\u201d</p> <p>That was three years ago. Of all the men McLoughlin befriended in Leukemia House, none are left. \u201cMost of those guys didn\u2019t have health cover,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were selling their houses, selling their assets. When they died, their family had nothing at all.\u201d</p> <p>Now, McLoughlin tells everyone living out west that they can\u2019t afford to be without private health insurance. \u201cThe further remote you are, the longer you have to wait.\u201d In regional and rural areas, there might only be one doctor, one hospital.

In an unexpected health crisis, we want the option of fast access to the top doctors, the right hospital care and everything we need to recover. Meet three people who are thankful they chose not-for-profit funds, which gave them the best cover when they really needed it. Coverage for the most unexpected discoveries Sergeant Topher McLoughlin had been serving in the police force for almost three decades when an event on duty changed the course of his life. \u201cI got bitten for the umpteenth time by a client and subsequently got a blood test,\u201d he says. What might have been a routine check took a devastating turn. \u201cI sat across from my GP who started to cry. He told me that I had stage-four lymphoma.\u201d In Mt Isa, where McLoughlin was based, the hospital didn\u2019t have the facilities to treat his cancer. He had no choice but to urgently fly 2,000km to Brisbane. \u201cI got into Brisbane and did all the checks, and then came back home and had to tell my wife the prognosis: horrendous,\u201d McLoughlin says. The change was difficult for the whole family, but McLoughlin\u2019s Police Health cover meant he could access the best treatment. \u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019ve gone from having to fight outlaw motorcycle gangs - which is my speciality - to how do you fight your own body? I struggled with that mentally. And then the reality set in that I would have to fly every three weeks. I could really see it was going to be quite expensive.\u201d In an unexpected health crisis, we want the option of fast access to the top doctors, the right hospital care and everything we need to recover. Photograph: Ariel Skelley/Getty Images. For months, McLoughlin lived in Leukemia House, a facility in Brisbane that services patients flying in from western Queensland. \u201cWhen I first started, I would look at our bank account every day and think, how much is this costing? My wife kept saying, honey, you don\u2019t have to worry about it. You\u2019ve got full cover. Whatever is not available at Mt Isa, we can fly into Brisbane and get it there.\u201d That was three years ago. Of all the men McLoughlin befriended in Leukemia House, none are left. \u201cMost of those guys didn\u2019t have health cover,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were selling their houses, selling their assets. When they died, their family had nothing at all.\u201d Now, McLoughlin tells everyone living out west that they can\u2019t afford to be without private health insurance. \u201cThe further remote you are, the longer you have to wait.\u201d In regional and rural areas, there might only be one doctor, one hospital. He says having more choices has been worth every dollar he\u2019s paid. \u201cFor the people who think it\u2019s too expensive, it isn\u2019t. No one says no. It\u2019s that wonderful, safe feeling that someone\u2019s got you covered, and you can lower your guard and say, I really need help.\u201d Real support for the whole family Mel Tinkler\u2019s son, Max, plays VFL football. She says watching him is a battle with her nerves: \u201cI sit and watch football with my heart in my mouth.\u201d To protect him - and the rest of the family - she looked to her industry\u2019s restricted fund, Teachers Health. \u201cI\u2019d heard by word of mouth that it was a good fund, and when I read up and had a look at the literature, I liked that it was for teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were a lot of benefits that were specific to teaching. I needed physio, and the physio rebate was a lot higher than the others. I liked that it was not-for-profit and the money was put back into offering a wider variety of services: it has things like optometry, dentistry and massage therapy. You don\u2019t realise, until you get onto the website and navigate around, how many things you can do.\u201d \u201cWe were able to get Australia\u2019s best doctor for knee surgery ... he was able to operate within a week\u201d - Max was back on the field in no time.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for your company! A big win for Leicester and a really woeful night for Leicester. Take care, and see you soon! Barnes speaks: \u201cA tough period recently but good to get back to winning ways and personally to get back onto the scoresheet it\u2019s great. We were gutted with how the cup game went, we knew both teams would come in wanting to win but it\u2019s good to get a bit of payback for how the cup went and we\u2019re delighted. \u201cThe way [Reina] came out I saw a little gap at the side and took a touch, then you\u2019ve got to it the target. It crept into the middle and going into half-time in front was great. \u201cThis season\u2019s my first full season from start to finish. First half of the season I was disappointed as I hadn\u2019t scored any goals but since then the goals have been flying in and I\u2019m delighted how it is going so far. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a sticky period so for us [this] was very important. We need to kick on, we\u2019re in a good position in the league.\u201d Ed Aarons has filed his match report already, what a pro \u2013 and our team on the desk have put it up already too, top pros all! Albrighton blasts over a great chance to make it five at the death after another lovely move but it doesn\u2019t matter. That was easy, easy, easy for Leicester and I don\u2019t even think they were at their best for three quarters of this game. They did enjoy themselves in the latter stages though, and Villa were just abject. The visitors looked like making this a good game for the first 10 minutes but after that barely managed a meaningful attack and defended horribly. Much more like this and they are going down. 90+1 min: There will be three added minutes to savour here. 89 min: Maddison is next to have a pop. And why not? 87 min: Tielemans fancies a goal from 25 yards, but not tonight. Well maybe tonight. There are still a few minutes left and Villa are in a state. The goal of the game, comfortably. A sweet move down the right ends with Albrighton pulling the ball back intelligently for Barnes, who sidefoots in crisply and clinically from 12 yards. That is Leicester at their best. This, as a disconsolate and rained-upon Smith reflects on the side, is Villa at their worst. 83 min: Leicester quite rightly sense more goals and Maddison has an angled shot blocked for a corner, which he takes and sees flicked behind for another. That one is headed down by Evans but Ndidi can\u2019t get it under control. And that\u2019s it for Ndidi tonight; he\u2019s off and Nampalys Mendy is on. Yep, he\u2019s back and he\u2019s far sharper than this sluggish Villa team. Evans makes a fine challenge on Samatta at one end and then Vardy counters at the other, his initial cutback is blocked by \u2013 I think \u2013 Guilbert \u2013 but no claret shirt reacts and Vardy is onto the loose ball in an instant. A snap shot inside the near post, and three guaranteed points! 79 min: A similar run from Barnes, now, but an inferior delivery that he overhits wildly. Where are Villa, exactly? Guilbert sort-of answers that with a deflected shot straight at Schmeichel \u2013 remember him? \u2013 but ever since the 10th minute or so they have been pretty rotten. 77 min: Barnes surges down the left and fizzes a really dangerous cross over, but Vardy and Albrighton aren\u2019t ready to convert. 76 min: Now a booking for Evans. It\u2019s not been a good game, in my view, this. Very bitty. Tielemans now comes on for Praet. 74 min: Pereira has the physio on despite being the sinner after a hack on Grealish, so we have a lull. Leicester are going to win this without needing to be remotely near their best. 71 min: Praet is booked for fouling Nakamba. Villa, for whom this has become such a non-event, have a free-kick 35 yards out ... but Evans clears and their chances recede yet further into the distance. 69 min: I think I\u2019d still like to hear how exactly that penalty against Mings was upheld by VAR. Not a clear and obvious mistake? It was clearly against his shoulder! 67 min: Villa bring on El Ghazi and Davis for Hourihane and Elmohamady. They need a very rapid uptick now. 65 min: Hourihane barges Maddison in the back and that could easily have been a second penalty there \u2013 the Villa man seemed a bit lucky. Never in doubt. His nine-game drought ends within moments of coming on, and that\u2019ll be enough to seal this one I\u2019m sure. I still think that clearly came off his shoulder, very odd. But here\u2019s Vardy with his first kick of the ball ... Justin slides Barnes down the line and it glances off Mings\u2019 ... eerrrrr ... shoulder, according to the replays. Michael Oliver gave the spot kick for handball immediately, but will VAR strike this off? 60 min: Fortunately for Leicester they can replace Iheanacho with ... Jamie Vardy! He gets a rapturous welcome as he comes on for the final half-hour. 57 min: Ohhhh, the previously quite quiet Maddison plays Iheanacho right in front of goal but the striker makes a *really* poor touch and Villa are let off. That should have been 2-0, again. 55 min: Scruffy stuff on the whole, really, as it was earlier. From Leicester\u2019s perspective, though, every win puts them a big step closer to the holy grail. 52 min: A spot of Villa pressure, now, and Hourihane shoots well over. Better from them though. 49 min: Mings seemed to overstretch when running back to try and salvage that situation, but appears to be alright. Then Evans heads a free-kick not too far off target. 47 min: An early free-kick for Villa is delivered poorly by Hourihane. They need to make these situations count ... but then so does Iheanacho, who is played through on goal after poor defending from Guilbert and sees Reina sort-of redeem himself by saving with a foot! Can Villa turn it all around? Some customary excellence from Jonathan Liew for your delectation: Indeed. Cowans has, for those who may not know, been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease; we send him, his family and his friends, all the strength and positive vibes possible. Hardly a classic here, but Villa have always looked willing to present Leicester with a goal and did so in quite spectacular fashion thanks to Reina\u2019s rush of blood. Leicester probably deserve it because the away defence has been slipshod throughout the half. Villa began fairly well but faded badly and have it all to do. 45+1 min: Targett picks up a knock and takes treatment as we ready ourselves for the interval. 43 min: Hourihane fouls Pereira and is booked. Villa have looked close to a meltdown whenever pressed here but probably didn\u2019t expect one to come from their 37-year-old keeper. Reina is not so wily there! Oh my goodness, this is really bad. Albrighton plays a fairly regulation ball for Barnes to run onto down the left and ... hang on, what the heck is the keeper doing rushing out?! Only he will know what he\u2019s thinking, because it\u2019s an utterly bizarre decision and Barnes is always getting there first. He nips the ball past the veteran and, to be fair, still has a lot to do \u2013 finishing coolly into the empty net from 20 yards, past the covering defenders. I repeat: what was Reina up to? It wasn\u2019t as if Barnes was clean through or anything remotely similar! 37 min: Now an opening for Leicester from open play as Luiz loses the ball to Praet, who plays Barnes in down the left. Barnes tries to measure one across Reina but the keeper is too wily for that and saves low to his left. 36 min: Villa, since those early moments when Hourihane and Samatta lost their bearings, have been absent as an attacking force. 33 min: And another Leicester corner ... and a third big Leicester chance! It goes short again and some way back to Pereira, whose deep cross finds a totally unmarked Iheanacho. He *somehow* heads wide from in front of goal when it seemed easier to score \u2013 that\u2019s the best opportunity yet and Villa look terrible from set-pieces here. 31 min: Something happens, for the first time in a long time, and Leicester win a corner. If they swing it straight in then maybe they\u2019ll have another free header. But instead they work it short and inside to Barnes, who\u2019s actually in quite a good position but checks inside unwisely and the opening goes. Soon they win another flag kick, though, and Maddison puts it straight in. Again Villa defend uncertainly but they scramble it away. 28 min: Villa will of course be pleased for as long as it stays like this; a point would be handy enough given they also have another game in hand on those above. 25 min: If I keep saying it\u2019s not dull, I\u2019m going to convince myself. The game is yet to really flow and Leicester, for all their possession, are yet to create from open play. 22 min: Ok, it\u2019s still not dull but we have definitely hit a scrappy patch ... until Guilbert stops Justin inside the area with an impeccably timed recovery tackle. 20 min: It\u2019s not a dull game so far but quality has lacked. Leicester just exerting a little bit of control of late after that good Villa start. 17 min: Grealish catches Ndidi on the follow-through and ends up in pain, but up he gets after a nervy moment or two for Villa fans. 15 min: A strong run from Justin, which bodes well for him and Leicester, brings a corner. And it brings another free header for a Leicester centre-back! This time it\u2019s Soyuncu running round the back; he really has to score but plants it over! 13 min: Mings is robbed by Iheanacho and then Reina screws one out of play. Villa\u2019s worst enemy may well be themselves. 12 min: It\u2019s been a good opening and, apart from that Leicester flurry just then, Villa have been the more impressive. 10 min: Almost a self-inflicted piece of misery from Villa\u2019s defence, as Engels tries to nod a long pass back to Reina with Iheanacho chasing but gets it all wrong and puts it only just wide of his own post. Then, from the corner, Evans has a free header on the run but allows Reina to parry! Both sides on the offensive so far here! 8 min: Play is pulled back after a Villa move fizzles out, because Ndidi has fouled Samatta to the left of centre. It\u2019s a great position and a fine delivery too from Hourihane, who bends it to the far post and sees Samatta slide in but make a miscue of his own. That, too, was a decent opportunity. 6 min: Chance for Villa! Targett overlaps to the byline after fine work from Grealish and lays one across for Hourihane to convert ... but he miskicks from 10 yards and what a let-off that is for the hosts. 4 min: Grealish goes on his first run into Leicester territory but Albrighton is back very diligently to nip that one in the bud. Suspect he\u2019ll have a bit more of that to do. 2 min: A slow start, with Iheanacho perhaps a bit unlucky to be pulled up for a free-kick when pressing strongly onto Mings. Leicester, left to right, get us cracking on. The teams are coming out ... game time will soon be upon us! There is an awful lot of truth in this. Brendan speaks! \u201c[Vardy] had trained the last few days but we want to make sure he\u2019s fit not just for this game but for the rest of this season. It\u2019s great to have him back, no doubt he\u2019ll play a part. \u201c[James Justin, making his second Premier League start for Leicester at left-back] will be a player who is very important for us in the coming years and I\u2019ve no qualms. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a spell like most teams will do where you don\u2019t pick up the results you want but we haven\u2019t been negative, we\u2019re focused and will do everything we can to get the three points.\u201d So does Dean (Smith)! \u201cWe can\u2019t control other results, what it does is make our players realise it\u2019s not about what other teams do. We\u2019ve got two games in hand on the teams around us, so [need to] win them and that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d \u201cThe Foxes against the Villains at the King Power Stadium sounds like a teaser for a noir novel about palace intrigue. But let\u2019s face it, tonight\u2019s game will probably be low on genuine drama. My money is on Leicester winning 3-1 and Brendan getting back into the Champions League next year,\u201d predicts Justin Kavanagh. Tillykke! For your ears only \u2013 it\u2019s the brand new Football Weekly! No Ben Chilwell for Leicester, you\u2019ll note, due to a hamstring injury. Jamie Vardy missed the defeat at Norwich but is, as trailed, among the subs. Villa look strong but this one is too soon for their talismanic and much-missed midfielder, John McGinn. Leicester: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Justin, Ndidi, Albrighton, Praet, Maddison, Barnes, Iheanacho. Subs: Morgan, Tielemans, Vardy, Ward, Perez, Mendy, Fuchs. Aston Villa: Reina, Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Targett, Douglas Luiz, Nakamba, Hourihane, Elmohamady, Samatta, Grealish. Subs: Taylor, Drinkwater, Konsa, Trezeguet, El Ghazi, Nyland, Davis. Referee: Michael Oliver Leicester couldn\u2019t ... could they? That\u2019s to say \u2013 they couldn\u2019t mess this up, could they? Champions League qualification has seemed pretty much in the bag since Christmas but Brendan Rodgers\u2019 men have been distinctly wobbly of late and, if we stick for now to the idea that it\u2019ll take a top-four place to get there, are beginning to look vulnerable. Manchester United are among those lurking and what they need, after three straight league games without a goal, is a straightforward, old-fashioned home victory to clear their heads. So how about it? Villa won\u2019t be too enamoured with that thought and already have something of an Indian sign over today\u2019s hosts, having dumped them out of the League Cup semis. They are on a stinky run of their own, with three straight top-flight defeats, and badly need points on the board now if they are to claw themselves away from the drop zone. They are only two off safety as things stand though, so if they win this then they will leap to 16th. Otherwise, it\u2019s another week right in the mire. Which is it to be? Stay with us for the next few hours and find out. Emails, tweets, jokes, poems, pithy observations, shopping lists \u2013 anything really \u2013 all appreciated as we go.",

      "bodyText": "Shell is to end its relationship with two of the UK\u2019s leading arts institutions amid growing concern about big oil\u2019s role in the escalating climate crisis. The fossil fuel corporation has confirmed it is not renewing its corporate membership deals with the Southbank Centre and the British Film Institute (BFI) when they come up for renewal later this year. Campaigners say the decision underlines the shrinking \u201csocial licence\u201d of fossil fuel companies in the midst of the climate crisis. It follows similar moves by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), National Theatre and National Galleries Scotland, which have all severed ties with major oil companies in the last year. Chris Garrard, from the campaign group Culture Unstained, said the end of Shell\u2019s involvement with the BFI and the Southbank Centre was a crucial milestone in the campaign. \u201cFrom its HQ on the South Bank, Shell has pursued a business plan that has trampled indigenous people\u2019s rights and pushed the world deeper into climate crisis,\u201d said Garrard. \u201cMeanwhile, it has sponsored its cultural neighbours as part of a cynical attempt to deflect attention from the damage it was causing. But the show is over for Shell.\u201d A spokesperson for Shell said the decision not to renew the contracts had been taken last year and mutually agreed with the Southbank and the BFI. \u201cLast year we decided not to renew annual memberships with the BFI or the Southbank Centre, collectively worth around \u00a320,000, when they expire later this year,\u201d it said. The BFI confirmed it had been Shell\u2019s decision. Harriet Finney, the BFI\u2019s director of external affairs, said the institute was \u201ccommitted to supporting a sustainable future\u201d. \u201cWe are in the process of reviewing the impact of our own activities across all our sites; how we can better support the UK\u2019s screen industries to move towards sustainable practice and how we respond culturally to the climate and ecological emergency.\u201d The Southbank Centre has had a relationship with Shell stretching back to 2006 and lists the company as a partner on its website. A spokesperson said the decision to end the two-year corporate membership had been mutual and declined to comment further. The leading tenor Mark Padmore, who will perform at the Royal Festival Hall in October, said he was delighted with Shell\u2019s decision. \u201cToday, more than ever, we all need to examine our way of life and the implications of our actions, as we respond to the growing climate emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking beautiful music does not excuse us from seeking to understand how our work is funded and asking questions about the kind of unsustainable businesses those partnerships might promote.\u201d Last year, the actor Mark Rylance resigned as an associate artist with the RSC after 30 years over its sponsorship deal with BP, arguing it allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d.

The latest move increases pressure on other arts institutions such as the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery and Science Museum Group, which have all faced criticism over their oil sponsorship deals in the past 18 months.

      "bodyText": "Police are investigating whether the New South Wales police minister, David Elliott, broke the law after he posted photographs online of him firing two prohibited weapons. The photos were posted on Elliott\u2019s official Facebook page in September 2018 to mark the opening of a rifle range at the John Morony correctional centre in Sydney\u2019s north-west. In the images, Elliott, the corrections minister at the time, is shown holding a Heckler &amp; Koch submachine gun and a semi-automatic pistol. The unauthorised possession or use of a prohibited firearm carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Under NSW law, an unlicensed person can legally handle a firearm at a shooting range if they have filled out a declaration answering several safety and historical questions, including whether they have previously been prohibited from holding a firearms licence, been the subject of a firearms prohibition order, or committed a serious offence in the past 10 years. But that declaration does not permit an unlicensed person to handle prohibited weapons, including those Elliott was photographed holding. In a statement, Elliott said he had fired the weapons \u201cunder the strict supervision of the range master\u201d. \u201cI acted in good faith under the assumption that Corrective Services NSW had complied with all of its administrative requirements according to the Firearms Act.\u201d Elliott said he was told that he \u201cand potentially hundreds of individuals\u201d who had used the range were potentially in breach of the act: \u201cI understand potential breaches could date back up to 20 years. \u201cGiven the safety and security of firearms is of the utmost importance to me, I immediately asked the Police Commissioner to investigate the operation of the CSNSW firing range to ensure they comply with the relevant legislation governing the use of firearms within their training establishments. In a statement, a Corrective Services spokesperson said it was \u201ctaking steps to correct a possible administrative error\u201d. \u201cThe matter has been referred to the Firearms Registry for advice.\u201d NSW police confirmed that the police commissioner, Michael Fuller, \u201cwas contacted today by Minister for Police David Elliott in relation to concerns over the conduct of the shooting range at Corrective Services NSW\u201d. A spokeswoman confirmed police were investigating to determine whether the Firearms Act had been breached. \u201cThe matter will now be referred to an appropriate command in order that further inquiries can be conducted with Corrective Services NSW to establish if breaches of the act have occurred previously,\u201d she said. Elliott, now the police and emergency services minister, will face further questioning Tuesday before a budget estimates hearing. \u201cShould be an \u2018engaging\u2019 budget estimates session today as we explore why on earth police minister David Elliott has been sharing photos of himself with a submachine gun in jail,\u201d the Greens MP David Shoebridge said. \u201cThat\u2019s a prohibited weapon by the way and misuse carries a maximum of 14 years in jail.\u201d Shoebridge said the pictures demonstrated a lack of judgment from a minister in charge of law and order. One of the more scandal-prone ministers in the NSW cabinet, Elliott was already expected to face a grilling at estimates over his decision to leave Australia on a European holiday when dozens of bushfires were burning out of control across NSW, claiming lives and property across the state. He refused to cancel his holiday, just days after prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s Hawaiian holiday at a time of national crisis caused widespread furore. Both Morrison and Elliott ultimately cut short their holidays. Elliott was also the subject of a NSW police review after a 17-year-old P-plate driver alleged that the minister had grabbed his arm and chased him through the streets after a minor car accident. When the teenager asked to see his police badge, Elliott allegedly said: \u201cI pay for the badges, I don\u2019t get one.\u201d Elliott denied the allegations and the review found \u201cno further police action\u201d could be taken. And Elliott was also under fire last year for defending police who illegally strip-searched children at music festivals. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve got young children and if I thought the police felt they were at risk of doing something wrong I\u2019d want them strip-searched.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 March 2020 because Michael Fuller is the police commissioner, not police minister as an earlier version misdescribed him.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

The 5.1-day average incubation period is similar to that seen in Sars and Mers. Coronaviruses that cause common colds typically have a three-day symptom-free period after infection. The NHS and other public health authorities around the world have been using a 14-day quarantine or active-monitoring period for individuals who are known to be at high risk of infection due to contact with known cases or travel to a heavily affected area. The latest findings suggest this strikes a good balance between minimising chances of transmission and not causing unnecessary disruption \u2013 particularly as health workers are among those being quarantined. \u201cIt\u2019s very reassuring that by 14 days, while it might not be 100%, it will be close,\u201d said Graham Cooke, professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London.

It later recovered slightly.</p> <p>Oil companies make up about 10% of the UK stock market, while US energy stocks also slumped on the S&amp;P 500. The biggest fallers on the FTSE-100 were BP (down 19.5%) and Shell (down 18%). Seven of the top 10 losers on the FTSE 250 were companies in the oil business, led by Premier Oil (down 57%) and Tullow Oil (down 31%).</p> <p>One analyst said oil businesses, whose investors are already under pressure to sell their fossil fuel stocks because of the climate crisis, would struggle for profits. \u201cListed oil companies operating in this environment are more fragile than at any time in the past 20 years,\u201d said Mark Lacey, head of commodities at investment manager Schroders. \u201cThe current oil price isn\u2019t profitable even for Saudi Arabia.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/08/oil-price-to-plunge-as-much-as-20-as-saudis-vow-to-step-up-production\">International Energy Agency (IEA),</a> the agency established to monitor the security of global oil supplies, said it believed demand for oil would shrink for the first time in a decade owing to impact of the coronavirus. The Paris-based body added that demand could fall even further if countries fail to contain the virus.</p> <h2>Airlines</h2> <p>Airline stocks were hit again on Monday, continuing a trend that has wiped 25% \u2013 or $40bn (\u00a330bn) \u2013 off the value of global airlines in the last month.</p> <p>Shares in carriers including budget carrier easyJet, British Airways owner IAG, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa all fell, in a range of 2%-9%, despite the fact that a lower oil price at least offered the prospect of lower costs.</p> <p>Investors remain focused on the impact of slumping demand and grounded aircraft.

The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index reached its highest level since 2016 in the process, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>Junk bonds, a form of high-risk corporate debt, will be closely watched, particularly because they are so important to the US fracking companies that were hit by Monday\u2019s oil price slump.

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s shock decision to increase crude production from next month, after falling out with Russia over how to deal with the impact of coronavirus on the demand for oil, prompted the price of oil to crash on world markets on Monday. That plunge, together with the lockdown in Italy and what stock market professionals believe is an inadequate response to the coronavirus threat from the US, prompted a worldwide stock market rout on a scale unseen since the global financial crisis of 2008. Oil companies were among the worst affected as investors digested the prospect of severely curtailed profits, while airlines, which have already been hit hard, suffered further falls. The biggest losers on a day of turmoil in the markets included: Oil The prospect of an oil glut triggered the biggest single-day oil price crash in 30 years. The price of crude oil nosedived by as much as 30%, to $33 a barrel, the worst one-day fall in crude since the start of the first Gulf war in 1991. It later recovered slightly. Oil companies make up about 10% of the UK stock market, while US energy stocks also slumped on the S&amp;P 500. The biggest fallers on the FTSE-100 were BP (down 19.5%) and Shell (down 18%). Seven of the top 10 losers on the FTSE 250 were companies in the oil business, led by Premier Oil (down 57%) and Tullow Oil (down 31%). One analyst said oil businesses, whose investors are already under pressure to sell their fossil fuel stocks because of the climate crisis, would struggle for profits. \u201cListed oil companies operating in this environment are more fragile than at any time in the past 20 years,\u201d said Mark Lacey, head of commodities at investment manager Schroders. \u201cThe current oil price isn\u2019t profitable even for Saudi Arabia.\u201d The International Energy Agency (IEA), the agency established to monitor the security of global oil supplies, said it believed demand for oil would shrink for the first time in a decade owing to impact of the coronavirus. The Paris-based body added that demand could fall even further if countries fail to contain the virus. Airlines Airline stocks were hit again on Monday, continuing a trend that has wiped 25% \u2013 or $40bn (\u00a330bn) \u2013 off the value of global airlines in the last month. Shares in carriers including budget carrier easyJet, British Airways owner IAG, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa all fell, in a range of 2%-9%, despite the fact that a lower oil price at least offered the prospect of lower costs. Investors remain focused on the impact of slumping demand and grounded aircraft. On Monday BA, easyJet and Ryanair cancelled dozens more flights to the coronavirus hotspot of northern Italy. Junk bonds An index that measures the risk associated with corporate debt posted its biggest increase since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index reached its highest level since 2016 in the process, according to Bloomberg. Junk bonds, a form of high-risk corporate debt, will be closely watched, particularly because they are so important to the US fracking companies that were hit by Monday\u2019s oil price slump. Shale and fracking businesses are among the biggest issuers of junk debt and concerns are mounting about the impact of defaults if companies are unable to refinance or repay their debts. The International Monetary Fund has been warning for some months that low interest rates have encouraged companies to take on high levels of debt, and could be a potential time bomb in the event of another global recession. Deutsche Bank warned that defaults among US oil and gas companies are inevitable, with around $13bn (\u00a39.9bn) of debts due to be repaid by the end of 2021 from the most heavily indebted fossil fuel firms. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has warned that around 33% of oil and gas firms have negative outlooks on their credit ratings (a measure of their financial strength, which is vital for borrowing money on reasonable terms), which is far higher than the long-term average of 19%. Distressed companies Struggling businesses seeking money to shore up their finances were also hit hard. British carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda, whose rescue fundraising is under way, fell a further 20% to a fresh low of 211p. China is a key market for Aston Martin\u2019s vehicles. Debt-laden shopping centre owner Intu Properties, which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, saw its shares slide a further 2%, closing below 5p. The firm has a valuation of just \u00a367m, while it has debts of \u00a34.7bn. The company had to postpone its emergency refinancing earlier in the month, blaming extreme market conditions. It needs to raise at least \u00a31.3bn from investors in order to secure a recently arranged overdraft facility from its lenders.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 10 March. Top stories Fears of a global recession amid the spread of coronavirus worsened overnight, as stock markets and commodity prices plunged. With the FTSE and the Dow Jones both falling by more than 7%, and crude oil slumping by 30%, markets had their worst day since the global financial crisis in 2008. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that \u201cCrash Monday\u201d is the natural consequence of a fragile economy \u201cmasked by perpetually low interest rates\u201d brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus outbreak. Scott Morrison will warn today that the signs point to a recession worse than the GFC as he launches an appeal for businesses to \u201chold on to your people\u201d, including casual employees, if they succumb to Covid-19. Meanwhile, Italian hospitals have started to report bed shortages as the country recorded its highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period. The head of Italy\u2019s prison system, Francesco Basentini, said a \u201cseries of rebellions\u201d had broken out throughout the country. Six inmates died after they broke into a prison infirmary and overdosed on methadone. The former Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion is under fire after it was revealed that money from a fund for alleviating Indigenous disadvantage was handed out to the mining giant Fortescue Metals. The retail firm Wesfarmers, two NRL clubs, and Catholic and Anglican welfare organisations were also awarded millions of dollars. Scullion approved more than $560m worth of funding before the federal election in 2019. Current Indigenous affairs staff said Scullion had awarded grants to 12 projects the department had advised against and ignored 28 of their recommended projects. These included school nutrition programs for Indigenous children and cadetships in the NSW Legal Aid Commission. The New York attorney general says Prince Andrew will not voluntarily cooperate in the Epstein inquiry. The Manhattan US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said: \u201cContrary to Prince Andrew\u2019s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options.\u201d In a notorious interview with the BBC, the Duke of York denied allegations he had sex with a young woman provided by the disgraced billionaire. Epstein was found dead in his prison cell last year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Australia What are the symptoms of Covid-19 and what do I do if I think I have it? Australian health authorities have provided a stream of continuously updated advice about the coronavirus and it can be confusing to navigate. Calla Wahlquist has distilled some of that advice here to help answer your key questions. The Indian Ocean Dipole, an ocean system that drives extreme weather events, is likely to worsen due to global heating. Scientists studying the phenomenon say Australia could experience future conditions even more extreme than those witnessed during the 2019-20 bushfire season. Six grants totalling $260,000 were approved in the marginal seat of Longman in the month before the general election. The grants included $177,000 for the Bribie Island and Districts Junior Rugby League Club. How will the coronavirus affect my travel plans? Here\u2019s what you need to know if you have a trip planned or are thinking of planning a holiday in Australia or overseas. The world The Swedish actor Max von Sydow, star of The Exorcist, has died aged 90. Sydow\u2019s best-known role was in Ingmar Bergman\u2019s The Seventh Seal, in which he plays chess with Death. Russia has been accused of hiring a network of British politicians and consultants to \u201cgo after the enemies of Putin\u201d. MPs on parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee, who drew up a Russia report suppressed by Boris Johnson, were given the secret evidence by the financier Bill Browder. The world\u2019s biggest pornography website, Pornhub, has been criticised for its lack of vetting of videos. An online petition with more than 350,000 signatures accuses the site of not doing enough to stop rape and revenge porn videos appearing. Donald Trump has tweeted a manipulated video of Joe Biden that appears to show the Democratic presidential hopeful back Trump for re-election. The video is in fact cut to remove the end of Biden\u2019s quote.

      "body": "<p><em>It\u2019s happening</em>. Mateusz Klich plays a delicious back-heel to Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez.<em> It\u2019s definitely happening.</em> Hern\u00e1ndez plays a first-time pass into the space that will shortly be occupied by Jack Harrison. <em>This is not a drill.</em> Harrison takes a look, doesn\u2019t like what he sees, takes a touch, takes another look, crosses. The cross is deep, sailing over a sea of bobbing heads to the far post where Luke Ayling, having sprinted 60 yards from right-back, calmly smashes a volley into the roof of the net. You know, as you do. <em>It\u2019s happening.</em> At this exact moment, the only able-bodied person at Elland Road not on their feet is Marcelo Bielsa. While his substitutes and coaching staff storm the pitch, while grown men scream \u201cWHAT A GOAL! WHAT A GOAL!\u201d, Bielsa remains perched on his bucket, takes a slow, measured sip of his coffee, as blank and expressionless as if this were a film he\u2019s seen before.</p> \n<p>In a way, he has. A few hours after Leeds had beaten Huddersfield 2-0 on Saturday, the club\u2019s social media people put out a video of a recent training session at Thorp Arch, in which Ayling scores a near-perfect replica of that volleyed goal. Perhaps this is the curse of the obsessive: once you\u2019ve seen all the tapes, logged every data point, mapped out every possible occurrence, reality itself must seem like a replay of something that everyone else is watching for the first time.</p> \n<p>Perhaps this is what it will feel like the first time Bielsa takes his place in the dugout as a Premier League manager. Yes, Bielsa in the Premier League: as outlandish at those words look on the page, it\u2019s a probability hardening into reality with every passing week. Gather your loved ones.</p> \n<p>Avoid all non-essential travel. Stock up on toilet roll, hand sanitiser and non-perishable food items. One way or another, it\u2019s going to be emotional.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c8222c0f-918e-4c7f-a09f-901039bc83fc\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Assuming Leeds do make it \u2013 and with a seven-point cushion at the time of writing, it\u2019s a pretty safe bet \u2013 then it\u2019s hard to imagine many other teams who will join the top flight on such a groundswell of goodwill. It\u2019s hard to imagine another manager held in such unanimously high regard by his rivals, who seem genuinely honoured to have shared a technical area with him. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get out-managed, get out-managed by a genius,\u201d gushed Huddersfield\u2019s manager Danny Cowley after their defeat at the weekend. \u201cI\u2019ll be really interested, when Leeds go up, to see how the Premier League copes with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>This wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to turn out. Certainly not when Bielsa turned up at Leeds in 2018: the team who had got through 12 managers in five years, hiring a coach who had never spent a third season at the same club. Cowley had things the right way round: it\u2019s not so much a case of how Bielsa handles the Premier League as how the Premier League handles Bielsa.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b474df7a3f48175e5df51f2a5d1dcaede16fa59d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b474df7a3f48175e5df51f2a5d1dcaede16fa59d/92_4_2550_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luke Ayling spectacularly volleys in Leeds\u2019 opening goal against Huddersfield on Saturday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luke Ayling spectacularly volleys in Leeds\u2019 opening goal against Huddersfield on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Wood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What, exactly, is going to happen when a principled, leftist, no-nonsense ideologue collides with the least principled, most materialistic league on earth?

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s happening. Mateusz Klich plays a delicious back-heel to Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez. It\u2019s definitely happening. Hern\u00e1ndez plays a first-time pass into the space that will shortly be occupied by Jack Harrison. This is not a drill. Harrison takes a look, doesn\u2019t like what he sees, takes a touch, takes another look, crosses. The cross is deep, sailing over a sea of bobbing heads to the far post where Luke Ayling, having sprinted 60 yards from right-back, calmly smashes a volley into the roof of the net. You know, as you do. It\u2019s happening. At this exact moment, the only able-bodied person at Elland Road not on their feet is Marcelo Bielsa. While his substitutes and coaching staff storm the pitch, while grown men scream \u201cWHAT A GOAL! WHAT A GOAL!\u201d, Bielsa remains perched on his bucket, takes a slow, measured sip of his coffee, as blank and expressionless as if this were a film he\u2019s seen before. In a way, he has. A few hours after Leeds had beaten Huddersfield 2-0 on Saturday, the club\u2019s social media people put out a video of a recent training session at Thorp Arch, in which Ayling scores a near-perfect replica of that volleyed goal. Perhaps this is the curse of the obsessive: once you\u2019ve seen all the tapes, logged every data point, mapped out every possible occurrence, reality itself must seem like a replay of something that everyone else is watching for the first time. Perhaps this is what it will feel like the first time Bielsa takes his place in the dugout as a Premier League manager. Yes, Bielsa in the Premier League: as outlandish at those words look on the page, it\u2019s a probability hardening into reality with every passing week. Gather your loved ones. Avoid all non-essential travel. Stock up on toilet roll, hand sanitiser and non-perishable food items. One way or another, it\u2019s going to be emotional. Assuming Leeds do make it \u2013 and with a seven-point cushion at the time of writing, it\u2019s a pretty safe bet \u2013 then it\u2019s hard to imagine many other teams who will join the top flight on such a groundswell of goodwill. It\u2019s hard to imagine another manager held in such unanimously high regard by his rivals, who seem genuinely honoured to have shared a technical area with him. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get out-managed, get out-managed by a genius,\u201d gushed Huddersfield\u2019s manager Danny Cowley after their defeat at the weekend. \u201cI\u2019ll be really interested, when Leeds go up, to see how the Premier League copes with it.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to turn out. Certainly not when Bielsa turned up at Leeds in 2018: the team who had got through 12 managers in five years, hiring a coach who had never spent a third season at the same club. Cowley had things the right way round: it\u2019s not so much a case of how Bielsa handles the Premier League as how the Premier League handles Bielsa. What, exactly, is going to happen when a principled, leftist, no-nonsense ideologue collides with the least principled, most materialistic league on earth? What happens, in short, when you fling this most human of managers into the nonsense machine? Naturally, there\u2019s an element of false opposition to the question. After all, the Premier League is a multiplex, and there are few more box-office managers in the world than Bielsa: a method actor in football\u2019s theatre of the absurd. Whether it\u2019s the frequent sightings of him in the Wetherby branch of Costa, hour-long press conferences where he pours out his tortured soul in front of a sponsored backdrop, or his latest wacky addition to the training ground \u2013 A bobsleigh track! A hydroponic farm! Actual ghosts! \u2013 you sense Bielsa will go down very well indeed in a league ever-hungry for new narratives and new characters, new themes and new memes. Above all, he possesses that rarest of gifts in this saturated, permanently-logged-in game: genuine mystique. Pep Guardiola still had a little of it before he moved to England. Back in the 1990s, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Ruud Gullit certainly did. But in today\u2019s climate of oversharing and overexposure, it\u2019s harder to come by. Bielsa has preserved his by speaking not in Twitter-friendly soundbites or massaged platitudes, but the opposite: the sort of humble, brutal honesty that English football, with its encrusted layers of banter, bluster and bullshit, struggles to process.

      "body": "<p>It was the worst day for share prices since the financial crash of 2008, but Monday\u2019s action felt entirely rational. Financial risks have fundamentally changed for the worse, even over the course of a weekend. And, since aggressive risk-taking has been rewarded for years by free-and-easy central banks, a sudden rush for safety always had the potential to become ugly.</p> <p>Back in the post-Lehman days, one could glimpse a route out of the mess. The banking system would be bailed out by governments to save economies; states\u2019 balance sheets would take the strain. A healthcare crisis caused by the spread of a deadly virus is plainly different and investors are also having to recognise a couple of hard economic and political truths.</p> <p>First, monetary handouts will be of limited use in preventing the arrival of a global recession, if that\u2019s what\u2019s now on the cards, and will do nothing to hasten the arrival of a vaccine. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates only a week ago, an action that already feels like an exercise in singing the wrong words to the wrong tune. Worse, by pressing the emergency button at the first whiff of worry in markets, the Fed advertised policy-makers\u2019 panic.</p> <p>Second, the outbreak of a price war in the oil market has demonstrated a breakdown in international cooperation. In place of the gathering of grown-ups at the G20 summit in 2008, investors now see political tensions, opportunism and, so far, no sign of policy coordination, even within the eurozone.</p> <p>An unpredictable Saudi leader is playing games of brinkmanship with President Putin. Moscow, meanwhile, spies an opportunity to put the debt-laden US shale industry out of business, albeit at a hefty short-term cost to its own budget and currency. And the US president is still pretending he\u2019s an epidemiologist and is tweeting about \u201cfake news\u201d as the Dow Jones opens down 2,000 points.</p> <p>On the plus side, the 20% plunge in the price of Brent holds the promise that recovery from the coronavirus crisis could be swift. A combination of cheap oil, low interest rates and free-spending governments usually reignites growth, and there is no reason to think the formula won\u2019t work again eventually (though let us hope that de-carbonisation measures don\u2019t become a casualty).</p> <p>Yet the dislocations beforehand also matter \u2013 and on that score we wait for the market to spit out its losers in the weeks ahead. Any fund with an oversized bet that the Opec oil cartel would hold a firm line on production will be nursing heavy losses.</p> <p>Over-leveraged companies that were betting their survival on the junk bond market are waking up to radically changed circumstances. Last week\u2019s marginal refinancing proposals will look unfeasibly optimistic in the current climate; as with Flybe last week, governments won\u2019t be able to help all corporate casualties. And the stock market looks essentially closed for fundraising until further notice.</p> <p>Note that banks have not been spared in the sell-off. There\u2019s no reason (so far) to doubt regulators\u2019 assurances that a better-capitalised system can withstand most knocks, including a sudden global recession, but the market can smell loans turning sour rapidly. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group, which has passed all recent stress tests with ease, are down almost 30% since mid-February.</p> <p>The big-picture analysis from Mohamed El-Erian, economic adviser to German insurer Allianz, sounds correct: markets are struggling to find something to cling to. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be messy because we\u2019ve basically lost all our anchors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost the economic anchor with the coronavirus. We\u2019ve lost the policy anchor with people losing confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to turn things around. And over the weekend, we lost a market anchor with Opec\u201d.</p> <p>El-Erian\u2019s advice for private investors, incidentally, is that \u201cthere will be opportunities, but they\u2019re not now\u201d. That also feels roughly right. The stock market was probably too high in the first place, so a 20% fall in global share prices since mid-February needs to be seen in context; it could easily get worse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>It\u2019s win-win for the executive crew</h2> <p>Interesting tweet from Robert Talbut, former chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cDisturbing to hear that already some corporates are asking for their incentives/bonuses to be rebased because of coronavirus!\u201d</p> <p>If this is correct, it would be outrageous since, as Talbut says, the executive crew never asks for higher hurdles when Lady Luck smiles upon them \u2013 Persimmon being the prime exhibit.</p> <p>The whisper, though, has a ring of truth about it.

      "bodyText": "It was the worst day for share prices since the financial crash of 2008, but Monday\u2019s action felt entirely rational. Financial risks have fundamentally changed for the worse, even over the course of a weekend. And, since aggressive risk-taking has been rewarded for years by free-and-easy central banks, a sudden rush for safety always had the potential to become ugly. Back in the post-Lehman days, one could glimpse a route out of the mess. The banking system would be bailed out by governments to save economies; states\u2019 balance sheets would take the strain. A healthcare crisis caused by the spread of a deadly virus is plainly different and investors are also having to recognise a couple of hard economic and political truths. First, monetary handouts will be of limited use in preventing the arrival of a global recession, if that\u2019s what\u2019s now on the cards, and will do nothing to hasten the arrival of a vaccine. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates only a week ago, an action that already feels like an exercise in singing the wrong words to the wrong tune. Worse, by pressing the emergency button at the first whiff of worry in markets, the Fed advertised policy-makers\u2019 panic. Second, the outbreak of a price war in the oil market has demonstrated a breakdown in international cooperation. In place of the gathering of grown-ups at the G20 summit in 2008, investors now see political tensions, opportunism and, so far, no sign of policy coordination, even within the eurozone. An unpredictable Saudi leader is playing games of brinkmanship with President Putin. Moscow, meanwhile, spies an opportunity to put the debt-laden US shale industry out of business, albeit at a hefty short-term cost to its own budget and currency. And the US president is still pretending he\u2019s an epidemiologist and is tweeting about \u201cfake news\u201d as the Dow Jones opens down 2,000 points. On the plus side, the 20% plunge in the price of Brent holds the promise that recovery from the coronavirus crisis could be swift. A combination of cheap oil, low interest rates and free-spending governments usually reignites growth, and there is no reason to think the formula won\u2019t work again eventually (though let us hope that de-carbonisation measures don\u2019t become a casualty). Yet the dislocations beforehand also matter \u2013 and on that score we wait for the market to spit out its losers in the weeks ahead. Any fund with an oversized bet that the Opec oil cartel would hold a firm line on production will be nursing heavy losses. Over-leveraged companies that were betting their survival on the junk bond market are waking up to radically changed circumstances. Last week\u2019s marginal refinancing proposals will look unfeasibly optimistic in the current climate; as with Flybe last week, governments won\u2019t be able to help all corporate casualties. And the stock market looks essentially closed for fundraising until further notice. Note that banks have not been spared in the sell-off. There\u2019s no reason (so far) to doubt regulators\u2019 assurances that a better-capitalised system can withstand most knocks, including a sudden global recession, but the market can smell loans turning sour rapidly. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group, which has passed all recent stress tests with ease, are down almost 30% since mid-February. The big-picture analysis from Mohamed El-Erian, economic adviser to German insurer Allianz, sounds correct: markets are struggling to find something to cling to. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be messy because we\u2019ve basically lost all our anchors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost the economic anchor with the coronavirus. We\u2019ve lost the policy anchor with people losing confidence in the Fed\u2019s ability to turn things around. And over the weekend, we lost a market anchor with Opec\u201d. El-Erian\u2019s advice for private investors, incidentally, is that \u201cthere will be opportunities, but they\u2019re not now\u201d. That also feels roughly right. The stock market was probably too high in the first place, so a 20% fall in global share prices since mid-February needs to be seen in context; it could easily get worse. It\u2019s win-win for the executive crew Interesting tweet from Robert Talbut, former chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cDisturbing to hear that already some corporates are asking for their incentives/bonuses to be rebased because of coronavirus!\u201d If this is correct, it would be outrageous since, as Talbut says, the executive crew never asks for higher hurdles when Lady Luck smiles upon them \u2013 Persimmon being the prime exhibit. The whisper, though, has a ring of truth about it. Never underestimate a boardroom\u2019s ability to plead that prizes must be awarded in all circumstances.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said lots of measures that \u201cseem intuitive turn out to have very little effect\u201d and one of those was screening travellers from high-risk areas at airports. In other developments on Monday: In the Republic of Ireland, all St Patrick\u2019s Day parades, including Dublin\u2019s main celebration that draws about 500,000 revellers each year from all over the world, were cancelled due to the risk of a further coronavirus spread. Cyprus, which was the last EU country to be virus-free, reported its first case. French culture minister Franck Riester contracted the novel coronavirus and is staying in his Paris home but is \u201cdoing fine\u201d, his office said. Vietnam decided to temporarily suspend visa-free travel for citizens from eight European countries \u2013 Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Iran announced another 43 people had died, pushing the death toll to 237 amid 7,161 confirmed cases. The government said it had released 70,000 prisoners because of the coronavirus outbreak. Scores of foreign tourists and Egyptian crew remained quarantined aboard a Nile cruise ship, from which 45 suspected coronavirus cases have been evacuated. The Israeli move was interpreted domestically as a measure to avoid irking Donald Trump.

Following outbreaks in the US, pressure had been building to add it to the list.

Italy\u2019s government has imposed a virtual lockdown across much of its wealthy northern regions at the centre of the contagion in an effort to contain the virus. Its top sports body on Monday called for all sports events to be cancelled until 3 April. Tensions in its overcrowded jails erupted on Monday over new containment measures, with riots in at least two dozen prisons and the deaths of six inmates who broke into an infirmary and overdosed on methadone. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte cited Winston Churchill as evidence that great nations persevere when the going gets tough. \u201cThese days, I have been thinking about the old speeches of Churchill \u2013 it is our darkest hour but we will make it,\u201d Conte told La Repubblica newspaper. In France, the worst affected European country outside Italy, the person in charge of one of the world\u2019s busiest air transport hubs, Paris\u2019s Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports, was among those to be infected. The two Paris airports are among the busiest air hubs in the world, with more than 100 million people passing through every year. The disclosure that Augustin de Romanet had tested positive followed days of rumours in the French media speculating whether Charles de Gaulle airport, Europe\u2019s second busiest, may have been linked to the spread of the virus in France. Officials in France have been warning it is inevitable that the country would have to go to stage three in its epidemic response shortly. Reports suggested that would involve closing schools, putting its health system on an emergency footing, and perhaps even closure of mass transit systems. Meanwhile, in the US, where there have been a rapidly accelerating number of infections, federal and state officials in California were preparing on Monday to receive thousands of people from a cruise ship that has been idling off the coast of San Francisco, with at least 21 people onboard infected with the coronavirus.

Phillips, an anti-racism campaigner who previously chaired the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), has been suspended pending an investigation and could be expelled. None of the Labour leadership candidates have commented on his temporary ban or the investigation. Writing in the Guardian, Lady Warsi, a former Conservative party chair, said: \u201cPhillips\u2019 understanding of race, racism and the barriers to integration has sadly been flawed for many years. \u201cAnti-racism campaigners have over the years become increasingly bemused at his pronouncements, given he was once chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. \u201cBut one thing is clear: Phillips cannot treat Muslims as a homogenised group when it suits him, then later deny they are racialised. Whatever the outcome of Labour\u2019s inquiry into his Islamophobia, there\u2019s no denying he has a case to answer.\u201d Phillips released a copy of the letter announcing his suspension, in which Labour cited prior statements including his reference to UK Muslims being \u201ca nation within a nation\u201d and comments observing how few wore Remembrance Day poppies.

But Naz Shah MP, the shadow minister for women and equalities and vice chair of the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims, said Phillips\u2019 remarks and the subsequent defence of him by some of her colleagues had made her extremely angry. She said those who claimed his suspension was malicious should think carefully about whether they were contributing to real fears felt by Muslims in Britain. \u201cSome of the things he has said on public record would not be acceptable to any minority community,\u201d she said. Referring to his 2016 comment that the centre of gravity of British Muslim opinion was \u201csome distance away from the centre of gravity of everybody else\u2019s\u201d, Shah said: \u201cWhat if we said that about women or another minority community?

Versi told Today his organisation had not made a complaint to Labour, but added: \u201cWhat we can say very clearly is that the statements he has made on a number of different things would not be statements that he would make against other communities.\u201d Phillips, who chaired the EHRC when it launched in 2006, was among 24 public figures who wrote to the Guardian last year to declare their refusal to vote for Labour because of its association with antisemitism. Last week, a dossier of more than 300 allegations of Islamophobia in the Conservative party was submitted to the EHRC by the MCB, increasing pressure on the watchdog to launch a formal investigation. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThe party takes all complaints about Islamophobia extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A former Scottish government official has told a court that Alex Salmond made her feel like she \u201cwas being hunted\u201d as she gave evidence about a charge of attempted rape.</p> <p>The woman, referred to as H, alleges that Salmond stripped her naked before forcing her on to a bed at Bute House, the then first minister\u2019s official residence in Edinburgh, and then pressed his naked body on top of her, pressing her down with his arm.</p> <p>She accused Salmond, who denies the charge of attempted rape, of initially forcing himself on her in a drawing room at the Georgian townhouse on 13 June 2014. She alleges he repeatedly kissed her neck and face, putting his hand under her skirt and shirt, before she managed to flee upstairs to fetch her belongings.</p> <p>She alleges that he was drunk, and laughed off her protests and demands for him to stop. Upstairs in the bedroom, she alleges that after promising he wanted to talk to her to put things right, he began to attack her again and became visibly aroused, before climbing on top of her.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like I was being hunted,\u201d H told the jury at the high court in Edinburgh, visibly distressed. \u201cHe talked to me for a second and then he just full on pounced. It was dark at this point \u2013 he was just like physically all over me, kissing me, just taking my clothes off. It all happened really fast.\u201d</p> <p>She told Alex Prentice QC, for the prosecution, that she had never consented to any of this attention. \u201cI felt like I was in some sort of trance. I was telling him to stop the whole time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The woman gave evidence from behind a screen on the first day of the former Scottish National party leader\u2019s trial on 14 charges including attempted rape and a sexual assault against H. The 65-year-old denies those allegations and 12 other charges of numerous sexual assaults, indecent assaults and intent to rape against nine other women.</p> <p>Salmond sat in the dock flanked by two court security officers and watched H\u2019s testimony on a closed-circuit television screen fixed on the courtroom wall.</p> <p>She told the jury that despite having an arm injury from an earlier accident, she succeeded in pushing Salmond off her and he fell asleep. She said she then retreated to a nearby bathroom, locked the door and curled up under a bed cover in the foetal position, lying there for several hours, and it was close to dawn when she left Bute House by the back door.</p> <p>She felt humiliated and disgusted, she said. \u201cI knew he had other women and I didn\u2019t want to be considered as that. I was really scared.\u201d</p> <p>H told the jury that Salmond had attacked her at Bute House several weeks prior to that incident, after a regular dinner, when the then first minister had been drinking heavily.</p> <p>She said Salmond regularly had late-night political discussions and dinners in the run-up to the September 2014 independence referendum, to plan strategy or entertain supporters and businesspeople.</p> <p>H agreed she could not remember exactly which night the first assault took place, because it had been an extremely stressful time when she was working long hours. She said while they were in the sitting room at Bute House, Salmond presented a bottle of a spirit given to him by a Chinese diplomat and asked her to drink shots with him. <br> She alleges that after asking her to sit on the floor beside her, he began kissing and groping her, pushing his hands under her clothing despite her repeated requests to stop. \u201cI just felt like I had an out-of-body experience. I just remember it was like I froze inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI was embarrassed, and I felt humiliated. [I] didn\u2019t want people to know because I didn\u2019t want to be known as another one of his women.\u201d</p> <p>Salmond, who has pleaded not guilty to every charge, has lodged a defence that says in four of the charges, which involve allegations of sexual assault by two women and intent to rape by a third, he believed the women had given their consent to being kissed and having their hair stroked.</p> <p>The jury was told that Salmond \u201creasonably believed [them] to be consenting throughout\u201d.</p> <p>He has also lodged a defence of alibi to H\u2019s allegations about the first assault in May 2014.

      "bodyText": "A former Scottish government official has told a court that Alex Salmond made her feel like she \u201cwas being hunted\u201d as she gave evidence about a charge of attempted rape. The woman, referred to as H, alleges that Salmond stripped her naked before forcing her on to a bed at Bute House, the then first minister\u2019s official residence in Edinburgh, and then pressed his naked body on top of her, pressing her down with his arm. She accused Salmond, who denies the charge of attempted rape, of initially forcing himself on her in a drawing room at the Georgian townhouse on 13 June 2014. She alleges he repeatedly kissed her neck and face, putting his hand under her skirt and shirt, before she managed to flee upstairs to fetch her belongings. She alleges that he was drunk, and laughed off her protests and demands for him to stop. Upstairs in the bedroom, she alleges that after promising he wanted to talk to her to put things right, he began to attack her again and became visibly aroused, before climbing on top of her. \u201cI felt like I was being hunted,\u201d H told the jury at the high court in Edinburgh, visibly distressed. \u201cHe talked to me for a second and then he just full on pounced. It was dark at this point \u2013 he was just like physically all over me, kissing me, just taking my clothes off. It all happened really fast.\u201d She told Alex Prentice QC, for the prosecution, that she had never consented to any of this attention. \u201cI felt like I was in some sort of trance. I was telling him to stop the whole time,\u201d she said. The woman gave evidence from behind a screen on the first day of the former Scottish National party leader\u2019s trial on 14 charges including attempted rape and a sexual assault against H. The 65-year-old denies those allegations and 12 other charges of numerous sexual assaults, indecent assaults and intent to rape against nine other women. Salmond sat in the dock flanked by two court security officers and watched H\u2019s testimony on a closed-circuit television screen fixed on the courtroom wall. She told the jury that despite having an arm injury from an earlier accident, she succeeded in pushing Salmond off her and he fell asleep. She said she then retreated to a nearby bathroom, locked the door and curled up under a bed cover in the foetal position, lying there for several hours, and it was close to dawn when she left Bute House by the back door. She felt humiliated and disgusted, she said. \u201cI knew he had other women and I didn\u2019t want to be considered as that. I was really scared.\u201d H told the jury that Salmond had attacked her at Bute House several weeks prior to that incident, after a regular dinner, when the then first minister had been drinking heavily. She said Salmond regularly had late-night political discussions and dinners in the run-up to the September 2014 independence referendum, to plan strategy or entertain supporters and businesspeople. H agreed she could not remember exactly which night the first assault took place, because it had been an extremely stressful time when she was working long hours. She said while they were in the sitting room at Bute House, Salmond presented a bottle of a spirit given to him by a Chinese diplomat and asked her to drink shots with him. She alleges that after asking her to sit on the floor beside her, he began kissing and groping her, pushing his hands under her clothing despite her repeated requests to stop. \u201cI just felt like I had an out-of-body experience. I just remember it was like I froze inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI was embarrassed, and I felt humiliated. [I] didn\u2019t want people to know because I didn\u2019t want to be known as another one of his women.\u201d Salmond, who has pleaded not guilty to every charge, has lodged a defence that says in four of the charges, which involve allegations of sexual assault by two women and intent to rape by a third, he believed the women had given their consent to being kissed and having their hair stroked. The jury was told that Salmond \u201creasonably believed [them] to be consenting throughout\u201d. He has also lodged a defence of alibi to H\u2019s allegations about the first assault in May 2014. She was unable to specify the day when the alleged offence took place. Salmond\u2019s legal team has submitted a long list of his diary dates that month, arguing that for most of the month he was not at Bute House during the evening, and was often at his home in Strichen, Aberdeenshire. The woman\u2019s evidence continues on Tuesday. The trial is expected to last at least three weeks.",

      "bodyText": "The government made a last-ditch attempt on Monday to head off a potential Conservative rebellion over the Chinese telecoms provider Huawei, drafting in a security expert to try to reassure anxious MPs. Tories were invited to a meeting in parliament with Dr Ian Levy, the technical director of the National Cyber Security Centre, as party grandees try to amend a telecommunications bill in an effort to ensure the use of Huawei\u2019s equipment in the UK\u2019s 5G broadband network would be phased out by the end of 2022. Comments on a Huawei WhatsApp group that includes 38 Tory MPs are said to have reignited over the weekend as more and more politicians sounded warnings over the government\u2019s decision to permit the firm to operate in the country. Levy\u2019s briefing came 24 hours before the former party leader Iain Duncan Smith and former cabinet ministers Damian Green, Owen Paterson and David Davis will try to amend the telecommunications infrastructure (leasehold property) bill. The Speaker has not yet selected the amendment, but MPs expect names to be added before the bill is put to parliament on Tuesday. The government\u2019s decision to allow Huawei a role in the 5G network could be a significant test for Boris Johnson\u2019s 80-seat majority. If the amendment is selected, there could be up to 40 names attached, a Tory source suggested, including some of the 2019 general election intake. The US president, Donald Trump, has made it known he is deeply unhappy with the UK\u2019s decision to give Huawei a limited role in the UK\u2019s 5G network. Australia and New Zealand, which along with the US, UK and Canada, make up the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership, have banned the company from their telecoms networks over security concerns based on its links to the Chinese government. Asked about the proposed amendment, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told journalists at a briefing on Monday that the government would eventually like to not to use any Huawei technology in the UK telecoms network. \u201cWe are clear-eyed about the challenges posed by Huawei, which is why we are banning them from sensitive and critical parts of the network and setting a strict 35% cap on market share,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will also keep that 35% market cap under review. We want to get to a position where we do not want to have to use a high-risk vendor in our telecoms network.\u201d Duncan Smith has said the UK risks isolating itself if it continues with plans to go forward with Huawei because the government has acknowledged that it is a high-risk vendor. He told the BBC: \u201cI think therefore we need to get the government to look to get the involvement of Huawei not to 35% but to 0%. There is real concern across the floor of the house.\u201d Johnson agreed in January that the firm could be used to provide the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure in noncore parts of the network, but will be barred from sensitive nuclear and military sites.",

Not anymore,\u201d said Arista Gonz\u00e1lez, 40, a law student and coffee shop employee. \u201cWe\u2019ve become used to living in fear.\u201d But many protesters have reserved particular fury for the current president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office in December 2018 on a promise of sweeping change, but has shown little interest in the issue of violence against women. The president, popularly known as Amlo, has attributed femicides to the \u201cneoliberal policies\u201d of previous governments and repeatedly suggested that the women\u2019s protests are part of a rightwing plot against him. On Monday, he repeated the allegation, saying that women were free to protest, but claiming that some \u201cwanted our administration to fail\u201d. \u201cFor a whole year, this government has responded with promises to the people\u2019s demands. But the situation for women has not improved. Women are facing the same kinds of violence as before and the country has become even more militarized. Nothing has changed,\u201d said Alejandra Santamar\u00eda, 28, a law professor. Though some women continued to work in shops, cafes, and restaurants \u2013 often for fear of being docked pay \u2013 far fewer women than usual were riding the subway to work. \u201cThe strike has given us the chance to challenge our labor conditions. The question is whether we\u2019ll be able to keep up the social pressure,\u201d said N\u00e9lida Reyes Guzm\u00e1n, 56, a striking metro worker. Many businesses supported the strike and told their female employees to stay at home, and some women worried that the backing of mainstream politicians and major business had diluted some of its ideological force. But others argued that the such support merely showed the strength of the women\u2019s cause. \u201cWithout us, all of this collapses,\u201d said Paula Le\u00f3n Garc\u00eda, 33, the director of one of the closed branches of BBVA Bancomer, Mexico\u2019s largest bank. Women\u2019s strikes have been held previously in Argentina and Chile, as well as Poland and Spain. But Amneris Chaparro, a researcher at the gender studies center at the National Autonomous University, said Mexico had never before had a major women\u2019s strike \u2013 despite its long tradition of labor and student activism. But the spiraling death toll of women and girls targeted for their gender \u2013 and a horrific recent string of high-profile crimes \u2013 has inspired new passion in the country\u2019s women\u2019s movement. \u201cEvery day we have more evidence that they are killing us specifically for being women,\u201d said Maria de la Luz Estrada, the executive coordinator of the National Citizen Observatory on Femicide. \u201cIf this government wants a transformation of this county, they have to face the problem.\u201d",

He expressed especial frustration that his sister Dylan \u201chas never been contacted to respond to any denial or mischaracterisation of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Woody Allen\u201d. Farrow describes this now infamous allegation of abuse as \u201ccredible\u201d, but it has never actually resulted in any charges. Was Allen ever contacted to respond to Farrow\u2019s statement in his book that his father \u201cpenetrated [Dylan] with a finger\u201d? He has been as consistent with his denials as Dylan has been with her accusation.</p> <p>It is completely understandable that the Farrow family would be upset about Allen\u2019s memoir. This case has caused deep familial trauma and been horrific for those involved. It is less acceptable for outsiders to jump in with kneejerk outrage, expressing misinformed opinions. When the news broke about Allen\u2019s memoir, several dozen Hachette employees walked out in protest. One staff member said: \u201cWe feel strongly about everyone\u2019s right to tell their own story, but we don\u2019t agree with giving Woody Allen a platform with which to tell it that includes distribution, marketing, publicity.\u201d So everyone is allowed to speak, but only under certain conditions. Hachette ran scared and dropped the book.</p> <p>It would have been one thing if Hachette had never agreed to publish Allen\u2019s memoir in the first place. Fair enough; that\u2019s a publisher\u2019s prerogative. But for it to sign him, edit him and then fearfully drop him because some people object is a terrible precedent for a publisher to set. As for the Hachette employees who walked out, it is quite something for people who work in publishing to be against the publication of books. After all, if they really are so convinced of Allen\u2019s guilt, they ought to let him speak. When I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/hollywood-reverence-child-rapist-roman-polanski-convicted-40-years-on-run\" title=\"\">the bewildering support in the movie industry for Roman Polanski</a>, despite being a convicted sex offender, I quoted extensively from his memoir, Roman by Polanski. Those passages, in which he described his attack on 13-year-old Samantha Geimer, were probably the most incriminating details in the piece.</p> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/24/ron-goldman-pursuit-oj-simpson\" title=\"\">when I interviewed the family of Ron Goldman</a>, I referred to OJ Simpson\u2019s book, If I Did It, in which the disgraced former footballer describes murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman. Unlike the Farrow family, the Goldmans decided to publish If I Did It when they were given the manuscript as part of Simpson\u2019s assets. They were sufficiently confident about Simpson\u2019s guilt to know that anything he said would only damage his reputation further, and they were absolutely right.</p> <p>But it is absurd to talk about Allen in the same breath as Polanski, let alone Simpson. Too many people now airily refer to Allen as if he were a serial sex offender, but he was not only never convicted, he was \u2013 despite being investigated \u2013 never even charged. Moreover, unlike Polanski \u2013 and Bill Cosby, and Harvey Weinstein, and R Kelly, and Michael Jackson \u2013 there has never been more than one accusation. One is one too many, but this one allegation was investigated twice and no charges brought. To talk about Allen as though he is a predatory monster who must be shunned from society goes against even the smallest idea of due process.</p> <p>You can argue that Allen is a beneficiary of a system that favours the rich and powerful. But you should still want him to publish his memoir because suppressing words, ideas and even people never works in the long run. Let the guilty damn themselves, if guilty they be, and trust the public to see the truth for themselves.

      "bodyText": "The patient is a 71-year-old, thin and frail after 10 years of chronic neglect, who is about to suffer a severe attack of the coronavirus. How will the weakened body of the NHS cope when the surge of cases sweeps down on it within weeks? Expect this to expose its worst fragilities \u2013 but also its remarkable strengths. Take its pulse and it\u2019s short of 100,000 doctors and nurses, with 17,000 beds lost since 2010. Germany has eight beds per 1,000 people , UK only 2.5. Italy has more than us but is treating intensive care patients in corridors. In the past three years 5,500 UK patients died waiting on trolleys, without the virus. Politicians love hospitals, wrongly hoping photo ops with doctors and nurses will see some of that trust rub off on them. Instead, the contrast rankles. Boris Johnson makes his cabinet sheepishly chant \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d, knowing those are nonsense numbers. It\u2019s always hospitals they choose, not the everyday frontline work of GPs who do 90% of treatments for 7% of NHS funds. They wait to see if the budget will bring anything to ease them through the coming crisis. Dr Krishna Kasaraneni, in Sheffield, had just received his surgery\u2019s supply of personal protection equipment when I called. It\u2019s only enough aprons, gloves and face masks for five days: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if or when they\u2019ll send more.\u201d The Health Service Journal reports rationing as NHS Supply Chain is \u201cmanaging demand\u201d for hand sanitisers and personal protection equipment. GPs are most at risk, never knowing what ailments turn up within their surgeries. \u201cWill I quarantine myself the minute I see a patient with the virus? No, we GPs always keep working until we drop.\u201d If schools close: \u201cWe\u2019re making the practice manager\u2019s office into a creche, to keep working.\u201d When I first visited in 2015 he couldn\u2019t fill doctor vacancies: the health secretary at the time, Jeremy Hunt, promised another 5,000 GPs, but failed. Last year numbers fell by another 1,084. As a member of NHS England\u2019s GP committee, Kasaraneni sees what\u2019s happening. Although numbers in training are rising, other GPs depart, retiring early, exhausted: fewer GPs means the rest are more overworked. Younger ones decamp to higher pay and less stress in Australia or California. In the budget Kasaraneni would \u201ckeep them in the NHS by paying off their student loans\u201d.

We\u2019ve got to keep putting the pressure on. We need to just focus on us, focus on our results. The confidence is so high.\u201d There could, of course, be another dip. But wins against teams such as City, Chelsea, Tottenham and Leicester, the immediate impact of Fernandes, a solid defence, plus the improvement of virtually the whole squad, is evidence of what the manager declared after City were beaten. \u201cIt shows we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d he said.",

France regards British Steel\u2018s operations there as a strategic activity because it supplies the railway company SNCF, and said last week four bidders had expressed interest in buying that unit. Jingye indicated on Monday it still hoped to buy the French operations at Hayange. \u201c[It] is still subject to further negotiations with the relevant authorities in France and is hoped to be concluded separately,\u201d the statement said. The Chinese group said its investment plans included installing an electric arc furnace, which makes products from recycled steel, building a more efficient power plant and launching a new line for steel rebar, a product mainly used in construction.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak: Global death toll nears 4,000 More than 110,000 cases have been recorded worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, which has also counted 3,892 deaths \u2013 an increase of nearly 500 over the weekend. There have been 111,400 cases and more than 62,000 people have recovered, the centre has said. Markets continue to tumble Global markets suffered their worst day since the 2008 crisis, while trading was briefly suspended in New York over coronavirus fears. The S&amp;P 500 index plunged by 7% at the Wall Street open, which triggered automatic circuit-breakers to let investors catch their breath. The FTSE 100 leading index of shares plunged more than 8% in early trading. Fifth coronavirus death confirmed in UK The country\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the House of Commons 319 cases had been confirmed as of Monday morning (GMT) and it was announced that a fourth and a fifth victim had died. UK still trying to contain the outbreak Boris Johnson said the country was still in the \u201ccontain phase of the outbreak\u201d and was not preparing to move to the delay phase \u2013 the third part of the government\u2019s four-part action plan. Spread will become \u2018quite fast\u2019 \u2013 UK government adviser The UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the virus would soon be spreading \u201creally quite fast\u201d and that, within 10 to 14 days, the government would advise people with even minor respiratory tract infections to self-isolate. Germany confirms first death The country had identified 1,153 cases by 2pm (CET), as well as the first death of a person infected with the virus. Germany\u2019s health minister, Jens Spahn, appealed to citizens to travel as little as they could, to work from home when possible, and to contact doctors by telephone in cases where the virus was suspected. WHO warns over lack of protective gear Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the organisation\u2019s health emergencies programme, said the real tragedy and moral dilemma that healthcare workers would face in the coming days if they did not have personal protective equipment would be whether or not to treat a Covid-19 patient at all. The numbers of new deaths and infections continue to fall in China The country reported 22 new deaths, the lowest number of new cases on record. There were 40 new cases nationwide, with most in Hubei. According to the World Health Organization, 80% of cases in China have had a mild or moderate infection. But Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said the mortality in people aged older than 80 who become infected was about 20%. She stressed that the rate was not based on the very latest data. Italy plunges into chaos Deaths increased more than 50% to 366 and government plans to lock down large parts of the north of the country, or about 25% of the population, were leaked to the media on Sunday.",

Colin Rowat Department of economics, University of Birmingham \u2022 The court system in this country is not fit for purpose. This is not a criticism of my fellow professionals, magistrates, judges or the many other people who dedicate their lives to this area of the profession. It is just the reality that faces us day to day. The court service is underresourced and overworked. In addition, more and more people are having to represent themselves. No two family cases are the same, but the stakes are always high when you are dealing with serious allegations of domestic abuse. The law itself has no gender bias. One in four women and one in six men will be a victim of domestic violence in their lifetime, according to Living Without Abuse. A successful outcome in a case where domestic violence has been alleged (by a person of any gender) will rarely garner the attention of the press. Instead of forensically trying to adjudicate on who \u201cbenefits\u201d more from potential bias in the system or directing criticism to the existing court process, which can on occasions feel like you are doing your job with one hand tied behind your back, more focus needs to be placed on what reforms would enable a better outcome for all those who have recourse to the family judicial system.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve actually bought, read and enjoyed several volumes of Don Paterson\u2019s poetry, but his snooty comment about introducing poetry into the workplace sums up a lot that is wrong with modern poetry: \u201cIf it\u2019s not a good poem, then it\u2019s a meaningless activity\u201d (Better or verse? Poetry used to inspire workers, 7 March). He misses the point. The workplace morning meeting is not a university tutorial analysing whether a poem is good. It is a way of getting people to widen their horizons, and \u201cjolt the mind\u201d as a New York Times picture editor is quoted as saying. Paterson\u2019s comment shows why my shelves of modern poetry will be a rarity. Andrew Napier Southampton \u2022 Don Paterson says that only good poems are worth reading to boost workplace productivity because they \u201cremind you that the most powerful use of language is an original combination of words\u201d. I would argue that some of the spoken-word poets Paterson has championed in his role as poetry editor at Picador don\u2019t do much of this. In fact, they do quite a bit of what he accuses some of our conversations, and journalism, of doing: \u201cusing entire phrases as if they were one word\u201d. Tristan Moss York \u2022 The poet laureate, Simon Armitage, attributes the increase in the number of trees around the village of Marsden to natural regeneration and other passive factors (Magnetic fields: Simon Armitage on the pull of Marsden, 7 March). In fact, the area has had an active tree-planting volunteer group since 1964. With the Woodland Trust\u2019s support, Colne Valley Tree Society volunteers are out every Saturday in winter planting native species in and around Marsden and the valley. They plant about 6,000 trees and shrubs a year.

Andrew was a friend of Epstein, the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender whose death in custody while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in New York last year was ruled a suicide. Andrew denies all claims of sexual misconduct relating to the Epstein case but has stepped back from public duties as a result of his connection to it. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the Manhattan US attorney Geoffrey Berman said: \u201cContrary to Prince Andrew\u2019s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options.\u201d In November, Andrew said he was \u201cwilling to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations if required\u201d. Berman made a similar claim in January, which former sex crimes prosecutors told the Guardian was most likely a move designed to win political support for the investigation. Buckingham Palace said then it would not comment and the matter was being dealt with by the prince\u2019s legal team. Contacted on Monday, a Palace spokeswoman said: \u201cThe issue is being dealt with by the Duke of York\u2019s legal team.\u201d Buckingham Palace has consistently refused to reveal any details of Andrew\u2019s legal team but the Duke has reportedly hired Clare Montgomery, a senior barrister at Matrix Chambers, whose clients have included Augusto Pinochet, Chile\u2019s former dictator, and Shrien Dewani, charged with and acquitted of murdering his wife in South Africa. She also prosecuted the Metropolitan police over the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, shot dead in a failed anti-terror operation. Andrew has been accused of having sex with a young woman provided by Epstein, a claim he categorically denies. In a December interview with the BBC, the accuser, Virginia Giuffre, now 35, called Andrew\u2019s denial \u201cBS\u201d. \u201cHe knows what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what happened, and there\u2019s only one of us telling the truth, and I know that\u2019s me.\u201d The Guardian has reported that according to flight logs, Andrew was among nine people on Epstein\u2019s plane for a trip from the US Virgin Islands to Florida in February 1999. A lawsuit filed by the US territory\u2019s attorney general in January cites new evidence that Epstein \u201cheld captive underage girls\u201d there as recently as 2018. Montgomery declined to comment to an inquiry from the Guardian. She is reportedly briefed by Gary Bloxsome, a criminal defence solicitor who has defended British troops against war crime allegations.

He was joined by <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Ministers will within a fortnight advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to stay at home for seven days, Whitty revealed.</strong> He said that the government was not giving out this advice now, because the chances of someone with a fever now having coronavirus are very low, he said. But he said that would change very quickly. Soon the number of infections would rise \u201creally quite fast\u201d, he said. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10 to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for a period of seven days.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This advice is likely to have huge repercussions for workplaces across the country.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson stressed that it was important for the government not to implement its delay and mitigating measures too early. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustn\u2019t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter-productive.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He sounded more defensive on this point than he was when he held a press conference last week, reflecting the fact that the government is starting to face criticism for allegedly being too complacent. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that he was no longer shaking hands.</strong> Last week he was still shaking hands, but he said at today\u2019s Commonwealth Day service he was advised against this. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We were all given an instruction not to shake hands and there\u2019s a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don\u2019t shake somebody\u2019s hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands.</p> \n   <p>So there\u2019s a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands, which is, I think I\u2019m right in saying ... far more important.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty refused to comment on suggestions that 2m people might be hospitalised. </strong>He said figures like this were \u201clargely speculative\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said that from tomorrow the government would start screening everyone arriving at hospital with a respiratory illness for coronavirus.</strong> Until now people have only been screened if they are in intensive care and have coronavirus-type symptoms, he said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said the aim of the measures to be introduced by the government would be to lower the mortality rate of those in the at-risk group by 20 to 30%</strong>. But he said it would be wrong to try to \u201csuppress\u201d the disease completely because it could result in a winter outbreak at a time of maximum pressure for the NHS. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What you can\u2019t do is suppress this thing completely, and what you shouldn\u2019t do is suppress it completely because all that happens then is it pops up again later in the year when the NHS is at a more vulnerable stage in the winter and you end up with another problem.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T18:11:14.216Z\">at 6.11pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e667c738f085f0b8d945198\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T17:29:53.057Z\">5.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is what <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> said at the start of his press conference.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to stress the following things.

In <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08032001.pdf\">his interview with Andrew Marr (pdf)</a> yesterday <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, the new chancellor, was unable to give a very good answer. He said that levelling up was about \u201cspreading opportunity\u201d (something to which almost every government in the democratic age has been committed). When Marr pressed him on this again, and asked how he would measure \u201clevelling up\u201d, Sunak replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You\u2019ll be able to, of course, measure it in the stats of income growth and everything else. You\u2019ll be able to measure it in whether we\u2019re making our investments in infrastructure as we\u2019ve said ... But, as I say, it\u2019s about a feeling that people have that where they happen to be born, where they happen to grow up is not going to be the determinant of how well they do in life. It\u2019s because, wherever they are, we\u2019ve provided them with the opportunities. Whether it\u2019s through education, whether it\u2019s through skills, whether it\u2019s through a better bus connection that gets them to a better job, we\u2019re doing all of that, and that\u2019s meant that their life is better off.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning the<strong> </strong><strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> has published <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14747\">a useful briefing note</a> looking at what \u201clevelling up\u201d could mean in practice. It could mean raising regional investment spending to the level in London, but this would cost a fortune, it says. Ben Zaranko, who wrote the briefing, explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Currently, investment spending per head is higher in London than anywhere else in the country: \u00a31,456 per head in London, versus an average of \u00a3891 in the rest of the UK, and just \u00a3621 per head in the East Midlands.. Transport, which will be of particular importance for productivity growth, is a key driver of differences in spending across the country: at \u00a3653 per head, transport investment is 2.5 times higher in London than the average \u00a3260 per head in the rest of the UK.</p> \n   <p>Rewriting the rules that govern which projects receive funding to place greater weight on regional equity could be one way of rebalancing government investment away from London and the South East, and towards other parts of the country. \u2018Levelling up\u2019 in this respect could come with a hefty price tag: raising transport investment per head across the UK to the current London level would mean spending an extra \u00a319bn per year.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Zaranko says \u201clevelling up\u201d could also be taken to mean ensuring every region in the UK gets the same total spending per head. But this would not benefit the regions that need it most, he says, because it would mean increasing spending in areas like the south east of England that need it less than other regions.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T12:15:28.660Z\">at 12.15pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e662c118f087df56e4c4ef0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T11:51:10.518Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For an alternative view, this is what the Labour MP <strong>Khalid Mahmood</strong> says about Trevor Phillips\u2019s suspension from the party in a foreword to the Policy Exchange report published this morning.

The letter is quite long and detailed, but it accuses Phillips of breaking four specific party rules, all relating to Islamophobia or prejudice against race and religion generally. To justify these allegations, the letter cites numerous alleged offensive passages, which come from five sources:<a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/transcript-tory-conference-islamophobia-fringe-20375360\"> a transcript of a Tory conference fringe event on Islamophobia</a>, an <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2019/05/how-much-do-we-really-have-in-common/\">article for Unherd</a>, a Mail report of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3418620/Muslims-not-like-just-accept-never-integrate-says-former-racial-equalities-chief-Trevor-Phillips.html\">what Phillips said at Policy Exchange event</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/survey-reveals-chasm-between-muslim-values-and-rest-of-uk-d30hl55lk\">report</a> quoting what Phillips said in an article in the Sunday Times, and <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/Race-and-Faith.pdf\">a report (pdf)</a> Phillips wrote for the Civitas thinktank four years ago, called Race and Faith: The Deafening Silence.</p> \n  <p>Some of the alleged offensive remarks are very particular: a reference to Enoch Powell\u2019s Rivers of Blood speech, which Phillips says is taken out of context, and a joke by Phillips about being nominated for \u201cIslamophobe of the year\u201d by an Iranian human rights body. But most of the complaints relate to two sorts of comment that Phillips has been making in recent years.</p> \n  <p>First, Phillips has argued that Muslims see the word differently and that they have not integrated as much as other immigrant communities. Here are two of the quotes in the Labour letter cited as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. The first is about him, and the second is from the Civitas report he wrote.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Muslim communities are not like others in Britain and the country should accept they will never integrate, the former head of the equalities watchdog has claimed. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said it was disrespectful to assume that Muslim communities would change. He told a meeting at the Policy Exchange think tank in Westminster on Monday that Muslims \u2018see the world differently from the rest of us\u2019.</p> \n   <p>At a recent conference of Muslim scholars, I had the privilege of addressing a hundred or so people at a leading British university. Most of the audience were Muslims themselves. The event took place just a few days before Remembrance Sunday. I noted that just three people in the room displayed a poppy, myself, a (white) journalist and one Muslim attendee. Raising the point, I could see the incomprehension on the faces of those without poppies; they weren\u2019t meaning to offend, but as a group, they couldn\u2019t see why they should wear what \u2013 I imagine \u2013 they think of as a symbol of war. The same day, I visited an industrial site \u2013 where many immigrants, mostly African and Eastern Europeans, were working. Poppies were everywhere. The norms in these two places were wholly different. One group had clearly adapted to the mainstream; the other had not.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Second, Phillips has highlighted the involvement of Muslim men in child grooming scandals in England, and in harassment incidents in Germany. Here is one of the relevant quotes cited by Labour in the letter as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. It is from the Civitas report he wrote:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But the most sensitive cause of conflict in recent years has been the collision between majority norms and the behaviours of some Muslim groups. In particular, the exposure of systematic and longstanding abuse by men, mostly of Pakistani Muslim origin in the North of England.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In his response Phillips says the Labour letter came as \u201csomething of a surprise\u201d. He says that he will need more time to respond in detail, he suggests come of the comments have been taken out of context, and he asks why he is being disciplined for comments that in some cases were made several years ago. And he stresses his own background as someone who has confronted Islamphobia. He asks:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Did the disputes committee know of, or consider the specific context of the allegations? For example, did the committee discuss the likelihood that a party member of over a quarter of a century\u2019s standing, who is himself a person of colour, and whose family heritage includes almost a thousand years of adherence to Islam, would either deliberately or accidentally make any statements that are racist or Islamophobic? </p> \n   <p>Were the committee provided with any information as to the commissioning and publication of the Runnymede Trust\u2019s 1997 report on Islamophobia; the Parekh Report of 2000 which called for incitement to racial hatred to be extended to protect Muslims; or the successful efforts by the Commission for Racial Equality to bring about the passage (by the last Labour government) of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, protecting Muslims inter alia from acts of incitement? I was chair of each organisation in the relevant periods and personally commissioned and launched the two reports referred to.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6612ac8f087df56e4c4dfc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T10:01:22.542Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thinktank publishes letter from Labour to Trevor Phillips explaining his suspension</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Policy Exchange, a rightwing thinktank, has this morning published <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/The-Trial-the-strange-case-of-Trevor-Phillips.pdf\">a report (pdf)</a> on the Labour party accusations against Trevor Phillips called The Trial: the strange case of Trevor Phillips.

He says that he is perplexed by the charge that he is guilty of Islamophobia (a term that he says he actually introduced into British politics) and he says his suspension could be evidence of Labour turning into \u201ca brutish, authoritarian cult\u201d. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So what accounts for this extraordinary turn of events? Some will see it as payback by Corbynistas for public criticisms I made of the leadership\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in the party. Another possibility is that it\u2019s an attempt to scare the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which I used to lead and which is investigating Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism. Weaponising Islamophobia to attack political opponents may seem like clever tactics but trying to intimidate a legally independent organisation is pure political gangsterism. Perhaps someone in Labour HQ has been reading up on the Inquisition\u2019s methods; in 1578, one official defined its purpose thus: \u201cThat others may become terrified and weaned away from the evils they would commit.\u201d</p> \n   <p>I accept that I may not share all the views of Labour\u2019s current leader or even of the majority of members. But I have never belonged to any other party and I have stuck by it through thick and thin. If this is how Labour treats its own family, how might it treat its real opponents if it ever gains power again? It would be a tragedy if, at the very moment we most need a robust and effective opposition, our nation had to endure the spectacle of a great party collapsing into a brutish, authoritarian cult.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee to discuss the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech ahead of the budget on Wednesday.</p> \n  <p><em>12.30pm: </em>Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>12.30pm:</em> Executives from Google give evidence to the Lords democracy and digital technologies committee. </p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points from the press conference held by Boris Johnson. He was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Ministers will within a fortnight advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to stay at home for seven days, Whitty revealed. He said that the government was not giving out this advice now, because the chances of someone with a fever now having coronavirus are very low, he said. But he said that would change very quickly. Soon the number of infections would rise \u201creally quite fast\u201d, he said. He went on: We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10 to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for a period of seven days. This advice is likely to have huge repercussions for workplaces across the country. Johnson stressed that it was important for the government not to implement its delay and mitigating measures too early. He said: It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustn\u2019t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter-productive. He sounded more defensive on this point than he was when he held a press conference last week, reflecting the fact that the government is starting to face criticism for allegedly being too complacent. Johnson said that he was no longer shaking hands. Last week he was still shaking hands, but he said at today\u2019s Commonwealth Day service he was advised against this. He explained: We were all given an instruction not to shake hands and there\u2019s a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don\u2019t shake somebody\u2019s hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands. So there\u2019s a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands, which is, I think I\u2019m right in saying ... far more important. Whitty refused to comment on suggestions that 2m people might be hospitalised. He said figures like this were \u201clargely speculative\u201d. Whitty said that from tomorrow the government would start screening everyone arriving at hospital with a respiratory illness for coronavirus. Until now people have only been screened if they are in intensive care and have coronavirus-type symptoms, he said. Vallance said the aim of the measures to be introduced by the government would be to lower the mortality rate of those in the at-risk group by 20 to 30%. But he said it would be wrong to try to \u201csuppress\u201d the disease completely because it could result in a winter outbreak at a time of maximum pressure for the NHS. He said: What you can\u2019t do is suppress this thing completely, and what you shouldn\u2019t do is suppress it completely because all that happens then is it pops up again later in the year when the NHS is at a more vulnerable stage in the winter and you end up with another problem. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is what Boris Johnson said at the start of his press conference. I want to stress the following things. First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak based on the latest scientific and medical advice. Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world and they will continue to have this government\u2019s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the front line. Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particularly the elderly and vulnerable. Finally, while it is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustn\u2019t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter productive, there is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK just as it does in other countries. But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. Johnson is wrapping up now. He says he hopes he has explained why the somewhat counter-intuitive decision not to cancel sporting events etc has been taken. And he says the government will give out more advice later this week. He says other measures will prove necessary. But timing of these measures is crucial. This is a big national challenge, and it will become a bigger one, he says. But he says it is obvious to him that \u201cwe know how to defeat it\u201d. He says he wants to be as transparent as possible. And that\u2019s it. He has finished. I will post a summary soon. Vallance says the government hopes that the measures it is taking will reduce the death rate amongst those most at risk by 20 or 30%. He says it is not possible to suppress the disease completely. And he says that would not be desirable, because that would just lead to the disease popping up again later. Q: Have you stopped shaking hands? Johnson says, at the Commonwealth Day service today, people were advised not to shake hands. Not shaking hands sends out a subliminal message, he says; it tells people that hands may be dirty. But he says washing hands is more important than not shaking hands. Johnson says he is no longer shaking hands. At his press conference last week, he said he was still shaking hands with people. Whitty says, when the government does ask people to stay at home (see 5.04pm) if they have a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection, they will be asked to stay at home for seven days. Q: Are people who are stockpiling being prudent? And are you confident you will be able to keep the shelves stocked? Johnson says it is important for people to behave responsibly and to think of others. He says more advice will be released to the public within the next few days. Johnson urges anyone thinking of stockpiling to \u201cbehave responsibly\u201d and to think of others. Johnson says this will become a much more significant outbreak than it currently is. But it is important to take the necessary steps \u201cat the right time\u201d, he says. Q: Other governments are taking more drastic steps now. Is that due to political pressure? And are you sure we should not be doing the same thing? Johnson says the epidemiology may be different in one country from another. When the government moves into the delay phase, it won\u2019t abandon the contain mode either, he says. Whitty says, as you start in delay phase, most of the things you will do will be things you were doing when you were in the contain phase too. Whitty says, in an average year, about 8,000 people die from flu. He says at the moment the ratio between people with coronavirus and people with other respiratory diseases is very low. But that will change soon, he says. He says coronavirus will soon spread \u201creally quite fast\u201d. Whitty says soon coronavirus will spread \u201creally quite fast\u201d. Whitty says within about 10 to 14 days the government will advise people with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever to self-isolate. But is because by that point the chances of their having coronavirus will be much higher than they are now. UPDATE: Here is some video. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, is speaking now. He says the government is going to start testing all people in intensive care, and all people in hospital with respiratory conditions, for coronavirus. He says the government will soon reach the point where it needs to ask people to change their behaviour. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, is speaking now. He says the government wants to push the peak of the outbreak into the summer. He says a series of actions have been modelled. They will be reviewed through SAGE, the scientific advisory group for emergency. The actions can be modelled for their efficacy, he says. He says it is important to act at the right time. If you tell people now with a sniffle to go into isolation, you will catch a lot of people who do not have coronavirus. Vallance says it is important to introduce measures to delay the spread of coronavirus \u201cat the right time in the right combinations\u201d. Boris Johnson is holding a press conference now. He says Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, received a briefing this morning from Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Johnson says the UK is still \u201cin the contain phase of the outbreak\u201d. But he says the scientists have said \u201ccontainment is extremely unlikely to work on its own.\u201d He says the government is now preparing to move to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of the coronavirus action plan. Earlier the House of Commons and the House of Lords commissions held a joint meeting to discuss coronavirus. Afterwards they released this statement. The commissions of both houses met today to discuss parliament\u2019s response to coronavirus. There are no plans to suspend parliament. We continue to act entirely in line with the advice of Public Health England and the Speakers and political leadership of both houses are keeping the situation under constant review. Back in the Commons the Tory Philip Hollobone asks why the UK is not banning flights from northern Italy. Because there are many Britons there who want to come home, says Hancock. And because the evidence suggests that banning flights does not work. He points out that Italy banned flights from China, and that that did not work. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is (like Rory Stewart) accusing the government of being too complacent about coronavirus. Rory Stewart, the former Tory cabinet minister who is now running as an independent candidate for London mayor, has said that the government should be acting \u201cmuch more aggressively\u201d to contain coronavirus and that schools should be shut now. In a statement he said: The government has made a serious mistake today. They should be acting much more aggressively to contain coronavirus. Schools should be shut now. If the government are not prepared to shut them now, they should - at the very least - state clearly and transparently what their triggers will be for closing schools over the next few days. All medium and large gatherings should be cancelled. All passengers coming from hotspots should be tested and quarantined. There is no excuse for passengers not being tested off a plane from Milan last night. There is no justification for half-hearted measures. The government and the Mayor keep saying they are simply following \u201cscientific advice\u201d. But the scientists are clear that this is now a political decision - on whether the government are prepared to spend very serious sums of money, and take a large economic hit, to maximise protection of the population. China shows both the dangers of acting too slowly - at first - and then the benefits of acting decisively. We should have no regrets about spending money to do the absolute maximum to prevent the spread of this disease. Downing Street said earlier that it thought there was not point testing passengers returning to the UK from Northern Italy because temperature tests on arrival were not effective. (See 1.17pm.) From Politics Home\u2019s Matt Honeycombe-Foster From my colleague Rowena Mason From Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, told Hancock that he thought the public needed to know what the government\u2019s central estimate was of how many people would die from coronavirus. Hancock told Hunt that he would reflect on this, but that there were lots of uncertainties. Yesterday the Sunday Times (paywall) claimed that 100,000 was the government\u2019s central estimate for the death toll. It said: Officials in Whitehall last week began describing a 100,000 figure as the \u201ccentral estimate\u201d of the potential death toll, according to a source involved in the preparations, rather than the previously publicised worst case scenario of 500,000 deaths if 80% of the population were infected ... A second official said the \u201cballpark\u201d figure for expected deaths across all councils was \u201cin the region of 100,000\u201d. That includes those likely to die from seasonal flu, which averaged 17,000 over the past five years. One official who has been involved in the planning said: \u201cThe central estimate of deaths is about 100,000. Everyone has been focusing on the worst case but this is what the experts actually expect to happen. Some of those people would have died of other flus.\u201d The figure is just under half the number of British deaths to Spanish flu in 1918, the worst modern pandemic. Covid-19 has already infected 80,000 people in China, killing more than 3,000 of its population of almost 1.4 billion. Italy, with a 60 million population, has suffered more than 200 deaths from some 5,800 cases. The UK had 209 cases by last night with two deaths. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s response to the urgent question on coronavirus. Hancock said there have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK. The fourth fatality has only just been announced. He said as of this morning there had been 319 cases of coronavirus in the UK. He said the UK would \u201cmake the right choices of which action to pursue at the right moment\u201d. It would be a mistake to act too early, he said: The scientific advice is clear: acting too early creates its own risk. So we will do what is right to keep people safe. Guided by the science, we will act at the right time. He said the number of cases in China and South Korea was still rising, but at a slowing rate. But he said the number of cases in Iran, Italy, Switzerland, France and Germany was growing. In Italy there were 1,492 more cases overnight, and 102 more deaths. He said Public Health England had tested nearly 25,000, and the time taken to carry out tests was being reduced. He said the government was making available an extra \u00a346m to find a vaccine and develop more rapid diagnostic tests. He said the NHS was \u201cwell prepared\u201d, with record numbers of doctors and nurses. He said an extra 700 people had been taken on to help the 111 phone line take calls. He said responding to coronovirus was a \u201cnational effort\u201d and everyone would have to play their part. For members of the public, that meant washing hands and following public health advice. But it could also mean volunteering, he said. He said the government would soon bring forward emergency legislation to help people and services deal with the outbreak. The bill would be \u201ctemporary and proportionate\u201d, he said. He said the government was taking action to help Britons on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California to come home. Hancock says the government will soon bring forward legislation to give the government emergency powers to deal with coronavirus. Hancock says an extra 700 people have been taken on to help on the 111 phone line. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is responding to an urgent question on coronavirus now. He says this morning there were 319 cases in the UK. And now there have been four deaths, he says. The Muslim Council for Britain has put out a formal statement about Trevor Phillips\u2019 suspension from Labour. (See 9.18am.) A spokesperson said: Mr Phillips has made incendiary statements about Muslims that would be unacceptable for any other minority. Many of these sweeping generalisations are unfounded, wildly exaggerated and are familiar tropes taken up by the far right. He has claimed Muslims do not report terrorism, despite the poll he cited showing Muslims report terrorism more than the general public. He likened placing a Christian girl into a foster care with a Muslim family as akin to \u201cchild abuse\u201d; and further propagates the othering of Muslims, claiming Muslims are \u201cnot like us\u201d, \u201csee the world differently\u201d and are a \u201cnation within a nation\u201d. The impact of Mr Phillips claims from a privileged vantage point is dangerous, providing licence to far-right ideologues such as Tommy Robinson who have seized upon these remarks. Mr Phillips would have us believe that he is a martyr for free speech and tolerance. But the fact remains that the deployment of these sweeping generalisations and tropes would not be acceptable for any other community. We are not commenting on the internal processes of the Labour Party, its choices or prioritisation of this case versus others. We expect the Party to follow appropriate process and investigate its members over all allegations of Islamophobia, and all other types of racism. The government is facing a possible revolt by Tory MPs tomorrow because some of them will be backing an amendment to telecoms legislation saying ministers should eliminate all Huawei technology from the UK\u2019s mobile phone networks by the end of 2022. Earlier this year the government announced it would let the Chinese firm supply up to 35% of the new 5G network. Asked about the possible vote (we don\u2019t know yet whether the amendment will be called), the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists at the lobby briefing that the government would eventually like to stop having to use any Huawei technology in its telecoms network. He said: We are clear-eyed about the challenged posed by Huawei, which is why are are banning them from sensitive and critical parts of the network and setting a strict 35% cap on market share. We will also keep that 35% market cap under review. We want to get to a position where we do not want to have to use a high-risk vendor [ie, Huawei] in our telecoms network. And on the subject of the trade talks with the EU, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who is overseeing the \u201cfuture partnership\u201d stage of Brexit, has issued a parliamentary written statement about the first round of the talks that ended on Thursday last week. Here is an excerpt. Discussions in some areas identified a degree of common understanding of the ground that future talks could cover. In other areas, notably fisheries, governance and dispute settlement, and the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d, there were, as expected, significant differences. The next negotiating round will take place on 18-20 March in London. The UK expects to table a number of legal texts, including a draft FTA, beforehand. During a press conference this morning Urusla von der Leyen, the European commission president, said the UK had to make up its mind about what it wanted from the talks on the post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU. She said: We are aware that there are differences in the approach towards what scope should the future agreement have and what are - if I may say so - the rules of the game everybody has to abide to. So it will be important that the United Kingdom makes up its mind; the closer they want to have access to the single market, the more they have to play by the rules that are the rules of the single market. If this is not the UK\u2019s choice, then of course they will be more distant and it will be more difficult for the UK to access the single market. So I think it\u2019s up to the United Kingdom within the negotiations to think about the trade-offs they want to take into account. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the Von der Leyen was wrong to say that the UK had not made up its mind. He said: I think the UK has made up its mind very decisively, and has been very clear about what it wants from its future relationship with the EU. The UK\u2019s position is the one which secured a significant majority for the prime minister in the December general election. (The No 10 spokesman is right to say that the UK has made up its mind. As the government\u2019s own document [pdf] setting out its position in the talks makes clear, it has resolved the \u201chigh alignment/low autonomy v low alignment/high autonomy\u201d dilemma in favour of as much autonomy as possible. \u201cWhatever happens, the government will not negotiate any arrangement in which the UK does not have control of its own laws and political life,\u201d the document says. A more accurate criticism would be that the government has not yet been fully open with business and with the public about what the implications of this decision are.) We\u2019re getting an urgent question on coronavirus at 3.30pm. There is a summary of all the main coronavirus lines from the No 10 lobby briefing here. But the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom sums it all up in a single tweet here. Q: Is the government committed to retaining free school meals for the under 7s? The spokesman says he is not aware of any suggestion that it isn\u2019t. When it is put to him that this has been seen as a budget option, he says he has not seen that, and won\u2019t comment on budget matters. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. Q: Do you think the EU is listening to what the UK wants from the Brexit talks? Ursula von der Leyen said this morning the UK needed to make up its mind what it wants? The spokesman says the UK has been very clear about what it wants. Q: Does the government support the bid by Tory MPs to impose a deadline by which Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G should end? The spokesman says, although the government has set a 35% cap on Huawei\u2019s involvement, it wants to reduce this, so that the UK isn\u2019t reliant on Huawei. Q: Why did the PM say last year he had a plan for social care when it was clear from the letter sent out on Friday that there is no plan? That is a reference to this letter. The spokesman says the government is trying to find a consensus. A significant amount of work has taken place on this, he says. Q: Does the PM have a plan? A significant amount of work has taken place, the spokesman says. Q: This morning Oliver Dowden suggested cabin crew staff were getting training to spot symptoms. But the union that represents them denied this? The spokesman says he thinks staff have been given advice on this. Q: Will people brought back from the Grand Princess have to go into isolation? The spokesman says the passengers themselves will be told first. Q: Didn\u2019t the CMO tell elderly people on Thursday to stay away from public places? The spokesman says he does not have the CMO\u2019s words to hand, but whatever he said would have been sensible, the spokesman says. (The CMO actually said in future older people would be told to avoid public spaces.) Q: Are elderly people being told they do not need to stay at home? The spokesman says the government will be led by the evidence. If there is any further advice, it will be issued. Q: What advice is being issued to them at the moment? To wash their hands thoroughly, says the spokesman. Q: How will the government identify people must vulnerable to the disease? And what about elderly people who may not be online? The spokesman says the government is aware of this. He says advice will be issued in due course. This issue is being \u201cactively worked on\u201d, he says. Q: Are there any plans to test people arriving in the UK for coronavirus? The spokesman says the government has been issuing advice to people returning from specific areas. He says temperature checks on arrival are not effective. He says the government has an evidence-based, clinical approach to this. The spokesman says the government has been very transparent so far in terms of publishing information. That will continue, he says. Q: What did you mean when you said earlier that the virus will spread in a significant way? The spokesman says the number of cases is increasing. We have had the first fatalities in the UK, and it is clear that it is spreading in country. Q: Is there a meeting planned between the government and Premier League broadcasters? The spokesman says DCMS held a meeting with a range of sporting bodies this morning. But he says sporting events are not being cancelled at this point. The spokesman says the environment department will be speaking to supermarket companies about what measures can be taken to ensure supplies to shops. Q: Is the PM worried about the stock market crash? The spokesman says the Bank of England has said it will take all steps necessary to protect the economy. He says the underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. Q: Would the PM urge people to stop panic buying? The spokesman refers to what the PM said yesterday. He says the UK has a \u201cresilient supply change\u201d. The government will work to ensure that remains the case. Q: What do you say to people who will be looking at what is happening in the UK and concluding the government is slow to act? The spokesman says the government has been working on the basis of the best medical and scientific advice. It will continue to do that, he says. Q: Does the PM have a message for people panic buying? The spokesman says the PM commented on this yesterday. He says there was no need for people to do this. Q: Will the local elections be delayed? The spokesman says this is a matter for the Electoral Commission to advise on, but he says he is not aware of any plans for this. The spokesman says the Foreign Office is working intensively with the US authorities on what can be done to bring home the 142 Britons on the Grand Princess cruise ship. Q: Why did it take the Foreign Office so long to update its travel advice after the Italian quarantine decision? The spokesman says the Foreign Office went through its normal decision making progress. Q: Is the government considering stopping flights to the UK from the quarantined areas in Italy? The spokesman says anyone returning to the UK from the quarantined areas of Italy should self-isolate, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. And anyone returning to the UK from other parts of Italy should self-isolate if they develop symptoms. Q: When is the government likely to announce further measures? The spokesman says he does not want to pre-empt what happens. But he expects a SAGE meeting tomorrow, and a further Cobra meeting on Wednesday. Q: Will you be giving out advice aimed at specific age groups? The spokesman says, when the government does issue advice, it will come from the experts. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman is here. He says the PM has been chairing Cobra. The chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser were there. A range of measures to contain and delay the spread of coronavirus were discussed. Later the PM will give a reading at the Commonwealth Day memorial service. Greg Hands, the international trade minister, is visiting New York and Washington. James Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister, is in Algiers. And Wendy Morton, another Foreign Office minister, is in Argentina. The spokesman says Cobra was still going on as he left for the briefing, and so he says a full briefing on what was agreed will come later. But he says at this stage the government is not calling for sporting events to be cancelled. Q: Are we in the contain or delay phase? The spokesman says we are in the contain phase, but it is accepted that the disease will spread at speed. Q: When the CMO advises that we have moved to the delay phase, does he take the decision? Or is it ultimately up to the PM? The spokesman says the PM has been clear that he will be led by the scientific advice. He says it is important that any steps to delay the disease are introduced at the optimum time. He says the government\u2019s plan talks about the need to achieve the greatest possible impact on containing the spread of the disease, while minimising the social cost. Q: Will there be a meeting of SAGE (scientific advisory group for emergencies) today? The spokesman says it is more likely to come tomorrow. Q: Does the government agree with the WHO director who says it is vital to takle the disease aggressively early on? The spokesman says the government believes in following the scientific advice. I\u2019m at 9 Downing Street for the regular morning lobby briefing, which is due to start at 12.30pm. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman will be briefing on normal government business, but also on this morning\u2019s meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, chaired by Boris Johnson, to discuss coronavirus. The embargo on the briefing is normally lifted soon after it starts. One of the main aims of Boris Johnson\u2019s government is to \u201clevel up\u201d Britain and the budget on Wednesday may by the first big chance for the government to show what it actually means (or it would have been, if circumstances had not evolved to mean that it will largely become a coronavirus rescue plan instead). But what does \u201clevelling up\u201d actually mean, and how will anyone be able to tell in 2024 whether it has been accomplished successfully. In his interview with Andrew Marr (pdf) yesterday Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, was unable to give a very good answer. He said that levelling up was about \u201cspreading opportunity\u201d (something to which almost every government in the democratic age has been committed). When Marr pressed him on this again, and asked how he would measure \u201clevelling up\u201d, Sunak replied: You\u2019ll be able to, of course, measure it in the stats of income growth and everything else. You\u2019ll be able to measure it in whether we\u2019re making our investments in infrastructure as we\u2019ve said ... But, as I say, it\u2019s about a feeling that people have that where they happen to be born, where they happen to grow up is not going to be the determinant of how well they do in life. It\u2019s because, wherever they are, we\u2019ve provided them with the opportunities. Whether it\u2019s through education, whether it\u2019s through skills, whether it\u2019s through a better bus connection that gets them to a better job, we\u2019re doing all of that, and that\u2019s meant that their life is better off. This morning the Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a useful briefing note looking at what \u201clevelling up\u201d could mean in practice. It could mean raising regional investment spending to the level in London, but this would cost a fortune, it says. Ben Zaranko, who wrote the briefing, explains: Currently, investment spending per head is higher in London than anywhere else in the country: \u00a31,456 per head in London, versus an average of \u00a3891 in the rest of the UK, and just \u00a3621 per head in the East Midlands.. Transport, which will be of particular importance for productivity growth, is a key driver of differences in spending across the country: at \u00a3653 per head, transport investment is 2.5 times higher in London than the average \u00a3260 per head in the rest of the UK. Rewriting the rules that govern which projects receive funding to place greater weight on regional equity could be one way of rebalancing government investment away from London and the South East, and towards other parts of the country. \u2018Levelling up\u2019 in this respect could come with a hefty price tag: raising transport investment per head across the UK to the current London level would mean spending an extra \u00a319bn per year. Zaranko says \u201clevelling up\u201d could also be taken to mean ensuring every region in the UK gets the same total spending per head. But this would not benefit the regions that need it most, he says, because it would mean increasing spending in areas like the south east of England that need it less than other regions. For an alternative view, this is what the Labour MP Khalid Mahmood says about Trevor Phillips\u2019s suspension from the party in a foreword to the Policy Exchange report published this morning. (See 10.01am and 11.10am.) Mahmood says: It was with no small measure of astonishment that I learnt that my own party, the Labour party, had initiated proceedings against Trevor Phillips on grounds of \u2018racism\u2019 and \u2018Islamophobia\u2019. The charges are so outlandish as to bring disrepute on all involved in making them; and I fear they further add to the sense that we, as a party, have badly lost our way. Mahmood links what has happened to Phillips to his opposition to the definition of Islamophobia drawn up by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on British Muslims. Mahmood, a member of that APPG, says he also thinks its definition of Islamophobia is not fit for purpose. For the record, here is the APPG\u2019s definition. Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness. And these are from Sayeeda Warsi, the former Conservative party chair, who is a longstanding campaigner against Islamophobia in her own party and elsewhere. She does not mention Trevor Phillips by name, but it is fairly obvious that her comments are aimed at him. These are from Miqdaad Versi, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, on the Trevor Phillips\u2019 suspension. The Policy Exchange report (pdf) includes the text of the letter sent to Trevor Phillips by Labour\u2019s governance and legal unit explaining why he has been suspended for alleged Islamophobia. The letter is quite long and detailed, but it accuses Phillips of breaking four specific party rules, all relating to Islamophobia or prejudice against race and religion generally. To justify these allegations, the letter cites numerous alleged offensive passages, which come from five sources: a transcript of a Tory conference fringe event on Islamophobia, an article for Unherd, a Mail report of what Phillips said at Policy Exchange event, a report quoting what Phillips said in an article in the Sunday Times, and a report (pdf) Phillips wrote for the Civitas thinktank four years ago, called Race and Faith: The Deafening Silence. Some of the alleged offensive remarks are very particular: a reference to Enoch Powell\u2019s Rivers of Blood speech, which Phillips says is taken out of context, and a joke by Phillips about being nominated for \u201cIslamophobe of the year\u201d by an Iranian human rights body. But most of the complaints relate to two sorts of comment that Phillips has been making in recent years. First, Phillips has argued that Muslims see the word differently and that they have not integrated as much as other immigrant communities. Here are two of the quotes in the Labour letter cited as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. The first is about him, and the second is from the Civitas report he wrote. Muslim communities are not like others in Britain and the country should accept they will never integrate, the former head of the equalities watchdog has claimed. Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said it was disrespectful to assume that Muslim communities would change. He told a meeting at the Policy Exchange think tank in Westminster on Monday that Muslims \u2018see the world differently from the rest of us\u2019. At a recent conference of Muslim scholars, I had the privilege of addressing a hundred or so people at a leading British university. Most of the audience were Muslims themselves. The event took place just a few days before Remembrance Sunday. I noted that just three people in the room displayed a poppy, myself, a (white) journalist and one Muslim attendee. Raising the point, I could see the incomprehension on the faces of those without poppies; they weren\u2019t meaning to offend, but as a group, they couldn\u2019t see why they should wear what \u2013 I imagine \u2013 they think of as a symbol of war. The same day, I visited an industrial site \u2013 where many immigrants, mostly African and Eastern Europeans, were working. Poppies were everywhere. The norms in these two places were wholly different. One group had clearly adapted to the mainstream; the other had not. Second, Phillips has highlighted the involvement of Muslim men in child grooming scandals in England, and in harassment incidents in Germany. Here is one of the relevant quotes cited by Labour in the letter as evidence of Phillips breaking party rules. It is from the Civitas report he wrote: But the most sensitive cause of conflict in recent years has been the collision between majority norms and the behaviours of some Muslim groups. In particular, the exposure of systematic and longstanding abuse by men, mostly of Pakistani Muslim origin in the North of England. In his response Phillips says the Labour letter came as \u201csomething of a surprise\u201d. He says that he will need more time to respond in detail, he suggests come of the comments have been taken out of context, and he asks why he is being disciplined for comments that in some cases were made several years ago. And he stresses his own background as someone who has confronted Islamphobia. He asks: Did the disputes committee know of, or consider the specific context of the allegations? For example, did the committee discuss the likelihood that a party member of over a quarter of a century\u2019s standing, who is himself a person of colour, and whose family heritage includes almost a thousand years of adherence to Islam, would either deliberately or accidentally make any statements that are racist or Islamophobic? Were the committee provided with any information as to the commissioning and publication of the Runnymede Trust\u2019s 1997 report on Islamophobia; the Parekh Report of 2000 which called for incitement to racial hatred to be extended to protect Muslims; or the successful efforts by the Commission for Racial Equality to bring about the passage (by the last Labour government) of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, protecting Muslims inter alia from acts of incitement? I was chair of each organisation in the relevant periods and personally commissioned and launched the two reports referred to. Policy Exchange, a rightwing thinktank, has this morning published a report (pdf) on the Labour party accusations against Trevor Phillips called The Trial: the strange case of Trevor Phillips. You can get the gist of it from the subtitle, which is \u201cHow the accusation of Islamophobia is used to stifle free speech\u201d. Phillips has said he is not allowed under Labour rules to disclose the exact nature of the charges against him, but miraculously Policy Exchange has managed to get hold a copy of the party\u2019s letter to Phillips explaining why he has been suspended. It is published in the report as an appendix, along with Phillips\u2019 response. I will post a summary soon. Here is Trevor Phillips\u2019 interview with the Today programme where he was asked about comments he has made that triggered the Labour party\u2019s decision to suspend him for alleged Islamophobia. Our write-up of the interview is here. George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard in London, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that if he were delivering the budget on Wednesday, he would focus on providing short-term help for businesses and individuals affected by the coronavirus outbreak. If I was chancellor, and I\u2019m sure Rishi [Sunak] is thinking like this, I don\u2019t want some complicated scheme that is going to be working in six months\u2019 time. I need to use the tools that are available to me right now to help people who are unable to work because their business has shut or they are self-isolating or they have got the virus, and to help those small and medium-sized businesses that will have very limited cash reserves and therefore could go into bankruptcy. It is a short-term help. It is not like we are going to have 10 years of this. Osborne also hinted that he would like to be writing the budget speech himself, because he also used the interview to road test exactly the sort of cheesy metaphor he used to deploy himself when he was chancellor. He said: If I was chancellor of the exchequer, I would make this a Budget for the coronavirus, I would do everything I could to vaccinate the economy against what is going to happen. If we can\u2019t vaccinate people against what is going to happen, I would provide the cash for businesses and individuals that don\u2019t have it at the moment because of the impact of the virus, and try and provide that immunity to the economy going forward. Good morning. On Thursday last week Boris Johnson told ITV that \u201cthe most important message at this stage, as we start to see [coronavirus] spread, is ... as far as possible, it should be business as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d. Journalists who make bold assertions are often taught to include some \u201ccover\u201d in the remarks, some qualification that protects them against the possibility of being 100% wrong, and for Johnson the three words \u201cat this stage\u201d proved very useful. On Thursday morning it may have been, for most people, business as usual. But no one would say that four days later. As ever, Jack Blanchard has a good summary of where we are in his London Playbook briefing. The oil price crashed 30% when markets opened this morning \u2026 as Asian stock markets and US bond yields tumbled dramatically \u2026 after Italy sealed off 16m people from the outside world \u2026 and France banned all large gatherings of people \u2026 and Germany recommended doing the same \u2026 while the number of coronavirus cases in Britain leapt by more than 30% in one day \u2026 and a third Briton died after contracting the virus \u2026 and we now have Tesco rationing the sale of basic groceries \u2026 and it\u2019s still only 7 am on Monday morning. Goodness knows what else this week will bring. We are covering the main coronavirus developments on a special coronavirus outbreak live blog which Frances Perraudin is writing this morning. You can read it here. And Graeme Wearden is covering this morning\u2019s most dramatic development - the stock market has crashed - on his business live blog. I will be covering some Westminster coronavirus developments here, but our lead coverage on this will be on the coronavirus blog, and so I will be looking at other stories too. Of which the most remarkable is - Labour\u2019s decision to suspend Trevor Phillips, a former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, for alleged Islamophobia. My colleagues Peter Walker and Sam Gelder have the story here. Phillips has written about his suspension in an article (paywall) for the Times. He says that he is perplexed by the charge that he is guilty of Islamophobia (a term that he says he actually introduced into British politics) and he says his suspension could be evidence of Labour turning into \u201ca brutish, authoritarian cult\u201d. He says: So what accounts for this extraordinary turn of events? Some will see it as payback by Corbynistas for public criticisms I made of the leadership\u2019s failure to tackle antisemitism in the party. Another possibility is that it\u2019s an attempt to scare the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which I used to lead and which is investigating Labour\u2019s handling of antisemitism. Weaponising Islamophobia to attack political opponents may seem like clever tactics but trying to intimidate a legally independent organisation is pure political gangsterism. Perhaps someone in Labour HQ has been reading up on the Inquisition\u2019s methods; in 1578, one official defined its purpose thus: \u201cThat others may become terrified and weaned away from the evils they would commit.\u201d I accept that I may not share all the views of Labour\u2019s current leader or even of the majority of members. But I have never belonged to any other party and I have stuck by it through thick and thin. If this is how Labour treats its own family, how might it treat its real opponents if it ever gains power again? It would be a tragedy if, at the very moment we most need a robust and effective opposition, our nation had to endure the spectacle of a great party collapsing into a brutish, authoritarian cult. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee to discuss the coronavirus outbreak. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech ahead of the budget on Wednesday. 12.30pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Executives from Google give evidence to the Lords democracy and digital technologies committee. 2.30pm: Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

This week, despite the shadow cast by the coronavirus and much uncertainty in recent days over whether it would happen at all, the attendance over four days should reach 250,000 or more, as it has for the past three years, and there will be huge relief mixed with the jubilation as the grandstand greets the start of the Supreme Novice Hurdle with its traditional, blood-curdling roar.</p> \n<p>For those with no interest in the sport of kings, it is just another race meeting. For devotees of jumping, it is Christmas for grown-ups, the fixture in the calendar that is anticipated like no other, and a large part of its appeal is that the more it grows and changes, the more it stays the same. Despite the huge increase in attendance and the many thousands of city dwellers who will cram on to trains at Paddington this week, Cheltenham remains a celebration of jump racing and its country roots.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/paul-townend-gold-cup-ruby-walsh-willie-mullins-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing-interview\">Paul Townend: 'Every jockey wants to have Ruby Walsh\u2019s success'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The faces change, of course, on both sides of the running rail, but the core audience for the Festival is still essentially the same, and many at the course on Tuesday will remember the bitter disappointment of losing the Festival to foot-and-mouth in 2001. For weeks now, the approach of Covid\u201119 has threatened a similar outcome. The first case in Cheltenham itself was confirmed on Monday. With the government still satisfied that sporting events should continue, however, it is time to hold tight and fire the annual rollercoaster into motion.</p> \n<p>The themes are timeless: Britain versus Ireland, old warriors versus young pretenders, proven champions versus maybes and wannabes. And amid the flashy new-money owners like Michael O\u2019Leary and Rich Ricci, there is still room for someone like Andrew Gemmell, whose Paisley Park could be the shortest-priced favourite of the week when he returns to defend his title in Thursday\u2019s Stayers\u2019 Hurdle.</p> \n<p>After the damning headlines that have swirled around Sheikh Mohammed, the Flat\u2019s leading owner, in recent days, the memory of Paisley Park\u2019s victory last year feels like something of an antidote. The Sheikh, oddly enough, had a winner at that long-ago Festival in 1990, when Kribensis took the Champion Hurdle. That, though, feels like a lifetime ago, and the possible fallout for Flat racing of his current travails will be as far from the racegoers\u2019 minds this week as Doncaster is from Dubai.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19551c5d850fd6bbe0421b15ed1b5c6aa417c873\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19551c5d850fd6bbe0421b15ed1b5c6aa417c873/54_0_3365_2020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Double Grand National winner Tiger Roll and Keith Donoghue easily win the Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase during last year\u2019s Festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double Grand National winner Tiger Roll and Keith Donoghue easily win the Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase during last year\u2019s Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Davies/racingfotos.com/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>They will be more interested in finding out whether Rachael Blackmore can become the first female winner of the trophy for the week\u2019s leading rider, and hopefully transfixed as Altior, Chacun Pour Soi and Defi Du Seuil duel for the Champion Chase on Wednesday, though Altior\u2019s participation remains in the balance. Tiger Roll, the dual Grand National winner, will be in town for the Cross Country Chase the same day, while Frodon and Bryony Frost also return for Ryanair on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Add in one of the most open Gold Cups for years on Friday and the potential for some huge swings in fortune between punters and bookies is obvious, and nor is it entirely certain who the grandees and executives in the corporate boxes will be rooting for. If Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s money is hugely important on the Flat, then the income generated from betting at the Cheltenham Festival is just as significant, both to jumping and, increasingly, racing as a whole.</p> \n<p>As recently as 2013 the top 40 races of the year by turnover at Ladbrokes included 15 of the Festival\u2019s 28 contests. Last year, it was up to 25, and there is little sign that the trend has peaked. While the Grand National at Aintree in April remains the biggest single betting race of the year, the combined might of Cheltenham\u2019s four days far outweighs Aintree\u2019s main event in terms of its significance for racing\u2019s finances.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/08/rachael-blackmore-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing-tips\">Rachael Blackmore set for thrills up the hill on Cheltenham favourites</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Why? Because racing gets a slice of bookmakers\u2019 profits, not their turnover, and a run of winning favourites can put a seven-figure dent in the sport\u2019s income. In January last year, racing was on course to make \u00a389m from its levy on betting profits by the end of March. The eventual figure was \u00a378m, and around half of the \u00a311m hole was thought to result from a golden eight-race run for the punters on the second and third afternoons when seven favourites and a second-favourite \u2013 including Altior, Paisley Park and Frodon \u2013 did the business.</p> \n<p>An even sprinkling of winning favourites over the four days keeps turnover ticking over and interest kindled. An unbroken sequence, though, can pulverise the books, as winnings are played up and nothing returns to the satchels by the end of the day. Instead, it finds its way into the local economy as part of the Festival\u2019s \u00a3100m footprint, as racegoers celebrate winners, drown sorrows and cram a year\u2019s worth of fevered anticipation into just four days.</p> \n<p>All this seemed at risk last week as the creeping shadow of coronavirus prompted fears that sporting events could be cancelled or at least staged behind closed doors. And while the Cheltenham Festival has survived, there is no way to know how the coming weeks will unfold. The Grand National in three weeks\u2019 time, when Tiger Roll is due to go for an unprecedented third consecutive victory, is far from certain to go ahead as planned.</p> \n<p>But that, like so much else for racing fans in Cheltenham Festival week, is for another day. Will the coronavirus be on the minds of racegoers? Of course. Will it affect the attendance? Perhaps. But will it be allowed to get in the way? No chance at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"804a8ded-7dc0-4328-a36f-b539948ec9ce\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Nicky Henderson hopes that Altior can be persuaded to believe in his recovery from lameness as the trainer desperately tries to get his star ready for Wednesday's Queen Mother Champion Chase.

The faces change, of course, on both sides of the running rail, but the core audience for the Festival is still essentially the same, and many at the course on Tuesday will remember the bitter disappointment of losing the Festival to foot-and-mouth in 2001. For weeks now, the approach of Covid\u201119 has threatened a similar outcome. The first case in Cheltenham itself was confirmed on Monday. With the government still satisfied that sporting events should continue, however, it is time to hold tight and fire the annual rollercoaster into motion. The themes are timeless: Britain versus Ireland, old warriors versus young pretenders, proven champions versus maybes and wannabes. And amid the flashy new-money owners like Michael O\u2019Leary and Rich Ricci, there is still room for someone like Andrew Gemmell, whose Paisley Park could be the shortest-priced favourite of the week when he returns to defend his title in Thursday\u2019s Stayers\u2019 Hurdle. After the damning headlines that have swirled around Sheikh Mohammed, the Flat\u2019s leading owner, in recent days, the memory of Paisley Park\u2019s victory last year feels like something of an antidote. The Sheikh, oddly enough, had a winner at that long-ago Festival in 1990, when Kribensis took the Champion Hurdle. That, though, feels like a lifetime ago, and the possible fallout for Flat racing of his current travails will be as far from the racegoers\u2019 minds this week as Doncaster is from Dubai. They will be more interested in finding out whether Rachael Blackmore can become the first female winner of the trophy for the week\u2019s leading rider, and hopefully transfixed as Altior, Chacun Pour Soi and Defi Du Seuil duel for the Champion Chase on Wednesday, though Altior\u2019s participation remains in the balance. Tiger Roll, the dual Grand National winner, will be in town for the Cross Country Chase the same day, while Frodon and Bryony Frost also return for Ryanair on Thursday. Add in one of the most open Gold Cups for years on Friday and the potential for some huge swings in fortune between punters and bookies is obvious, and nor is it entirely certain who the grandees and executives in the corporate boxes will be rooting for. If Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s money is hugely important on the Flat, then the income generated from betting at the Cheltenham Festival is just as significant, both to jumping and, increasingly, racing as a whole. As recently as 2013 the top 40 races of the year by turnover at Ladbrokes included 15 of the Festival\u2019s 28 contests. Last year, it was up to 25, and there is little sign that the trend has peaked. While the Grand National at Aintree in April remains the biggest single betting race of the year, the combined might of Cheltenham\u2019s four days far outweighs Aintree\u2019s main event in terms of its significance for racing\u2019s finances. Why? Because racing gets a slice of bookmakers\u2019 profits, not their turnover, and a run of winning favourites can put a seven-figure dent in the sport\u2019s income. In January last year, racing was on course to make \u00a389m from its levy on betting profits by the end of March. The eventual figure was \u00a378m, and around half of the \u00a311m hole was thought to result from a golden eight-race run for the punters on the second and third afternoons when seven favourites and a second-favourite \u2013 including Altior, Paisley Park and Frodon \u2013 did the business. An even sprinkling of winning favourites over the four days keeps turnover ticking over and interest kindled. An unbroken sequence, though, can pulverise the books, as winnings are played up and nothing returns to the satchels by the end of the day. Instead, it finds its way into the local economy as part of the Festival\u2019s \u00a3100m footprint, as racegoers celebrate winners, drown sorrows and cram a year\u2019s worth of fevered anticipation into just four days. All this seemed at risk last week as the creeping shadow of coronavirus prompted fears that sporting events could be cancelled or at least staged behind closed doors. And while the Cheltenham Festival has survived, there is no way to know how the coming weeks will unfold. The Grand National in three weeks\u2019 time, when Tiger Roll is due to go for an unprecedented third consecutive victory, is far from certain to go ahead as planned. But that, like so much else for racing fans in Cheltenham Festival week, is for another day. Will the coronavirus be on the minds of racegoers? Of course. Will it affect the attendance? Perhaps. But will it be allowed to get in the way? No chance at all.",

      "bodyText": "A British couple on holiday in Vietnam have been told they \u201cleft infections everywhere\u201d over several days after unknowingly contracting coronavirus from a fellow passenger on their flight from Heathrow. Graham Craddock, 68, and his wife, Mary, 69, are in quarantine in Hanoi where conditions have been poor at times, , although the couple praised the no-nonsense response of the Vietnamese authorities. After touching down in Hanoi on 2 March on Vietnam Airlines flight VN54 \u2013 where they sat two rows behind the woman, 26, from Hanoi who was carrying the virus \u2013 the couple visited attractions in the capital before moving on to Sapa in north-west Vietnam. They were contacted on Saturday and told that someone on their flight had tested positive for coronavirus. The Craddocks were taken by ambulance to Lao Cai hospital, where they were placed in what they believed to be an unused wing which was dirty and had no hot water. Graham Craddock told the Guardian: \u201cWe stayed in the room we were given that night even though the toilet only worked with the use of bucket and bailer. I complained to the doctors and the following day we were upgraded to the VIP room. Well at least it had a functioning toilet. The best thing about the hospital wing is that we were alone in it. I am very concerned about picking up infections, not only the virus.\u201d Despite the conditions, Craddock said they preferred to be there than at a busier, better-equipped hospital because they feared infection. But on Monday morning they were forced to move to the Hanoi central hospital for tropical diseases, four hours away. He said: \u201cLast night [Sunday] we were told that we had the virus, although my wife and I do not have symptoms. I asked how can that be? I was told 80% of people carrying the virus do not have symptoms. So it\u2019s like catching a ghost if that\u2019s correct. \u201cBefore we left Lao Cai I had a call from the district foreign office official who said that everywhere we had been we had left people with infection. He emphasised it was not our fault but one of the reasons he wanted us out of the Lao Cai hospital was to accommodate 54 more suspected cases.\u201d The 26-year-old woman from Hanoi had visited London, Milan and Paris, the Vietnamese health ministry said. Vietnam had not had a case for more than three weeks before she tested positive on Thursday and had been praised for its response. On 25 February it announced that all 16 cases in the country had recovered but the number of confirmed cases has now almost doubled to 30, including seven Britons who were on the flight that landed on 2 March. Craddock said the Vietnamese action appeared draconian but was \u201cmuch better than letting it drift\u201d. However, he expressed dismay that the infected woman on his flight was allowed to travel. \u201cWhen we checked in at Heathrow we were asked if we had been near infected people, [or] had we been recently to China, Iran or Italy.

Since the coronavirus crisis gripped the markets, the FTSE 100 has fallen from around 7,400 to 6,000, a drop of 19%.

Your scheme should allow you to view the value of your investments and give you the choice to allocate them to various funds, from zero risk (cash) to high risk (100% equity).

The UK\u2019s most popular competition is determined to keep the show on the road, but increasingly those within football expect some matches to be driven behind closed doors. If that happens, there have been widely reported suggestions that every match would then be shown on TV, breaking a decades-old understanding that Saturday 3pm matches could not be broadcast live. it is understood that those games would only be available on pay-TV, however, through partners Sky and BT Sport. You would need a subscription to watch.</p> <h2>Is it true that older people could be banned from football?</h2> <p>This was one rather unexpected line that was briefed ahead of the meeting, with Crystal Palace\u2019s 72-year-old manager, Roy Hodgson, subsequently wondering what it might mean for him.

About 35,000 migrants have massed at Turkey\u2019s borders with the EU in the last week since Turkey\u2019s president broke a 2016 pact under which Brussels promised to pay \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.3bn) in return for Turkey curbing migration flows. Erdo\u011fan has accused the EU in recent months of a lack of solidarity with his military operations in Syria and claims the true cost of housing refugees in his country has been close to \u20ac40bn. As he greeted Michel, Erdo\u011fan patted his chest with his hand and said \u201ccorona\u201d in the direction of the assembled photographers, in an apparent explanation of the lack of a handshake between the two men. Michel said the two sides had \u201cdifferent opinions on different things, and that is why it is important to have a frank and open dialogue\u201d. Von der Leyen accused Erdo\u011fan of politicising the border to extract concessions from Brussels and insisted that a \u201cfuture-proof\u201d solution should be found to avoid a repeat of the violent scenes. \u201cThe events at the Greek-Turkish border clearly point to politically motivated pressure on the EU\u2019s external border,\u201d she said. \u201cFinding a solution to this situation will require relieving the pressure that is put on the border.\u201d The two sides agreed that the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, would work with his Turkish counterpart on \u201cmapping\u201d the differences on the migration deal.

Since Biden, 77, surged back to lead the Democratic primary, the 73-year-old president and his campaign have relentlessly questioned and mocked the former senator and vice-president\u2019s mental capability.

At that point, efforts will shift away from tracing contacts of known patients and focus on reducing the spike in infections so hospitals are not overwhelmed. The move is intended to save lives by ensuring the sickest patients can still get the care they need.</p> \n<p>On Monday, ministers and experts at an emergency Cobra meeting decided the UK would remain in the contain stage of its coronavirus response for now, and held off imposing \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures, such as banning large gatherings and playing sports events behind closed doors.</p> \n<p>But the rise in infections has prompted some researchers to bring in new working practices as a precaution.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

      "bodyText": "People in Britain who can work from home should be advised to do so to reduce their risk of contracting coronavirus and fuelling the outbreak by spreading it to others, a leading researcher has said. The rising number of infections in the UK made it increasingly likely that the country would see local outbreaks in the coming weeks, with some potentially severe enough to place a strain on the NHS, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Dynamics at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston. \u201cEveryone who can work from home should work from home,\u201d Hanage told the Guardian. \u201cThe most important thing is that even if it won\u2019t protect you entirely, it will delay you getting infected. And if we can \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 we will avoid the worst consequences for healthcare services.\u201d The government\u2019s coronavirus strategy will prioritise \u201cflattening the curve\u201d when it moves from the \u201ccontain\u201d phase of its response to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase. At that point, efforts will shift away from tracing contacts of known patients and focus on reducing the spike in infections so hospitals are not overwhelmed. The move is intended to save lives by ensuring the sickest patients can still get the care they need. On Monday, ministers and experts at an emergency Cobra meeting decided the UK would remain in the contain stage of its coronavirus response for now, and held off imposing \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures, such as banning large gatherings and playing sports events behind closed doors. But the rise in infections has prompted some researchers to bring in new working practices as a precaution. Roy Anderson, a leading epidemiologist at Imperial College London, and former chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence, announced protective measures for his staff on Monday morning. \u201cI have just advised my own research group that we will do our daily research project discussions by Skype, WhatsApp and Microsoft teams, starting this week,\u201d he said. Hanage added that there are \u201cboth selfish and societal benefits\u201d to working from home where possible. \u201cThe selfish ones are obvious: if you don\u2019t leave the house you are less likely to be infected. The societal one is that if you stop yourself being infected you can\u2019t infect anyone else,\u201d he said. However, Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network at the University of Oxford, was more cautious about recommending home working. \u201cThe government and Public Health England are responding to the evidence as it comes to light,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s rapidly evolving and things might change, but right now the response from the government is entirely in line with the evidence.\u201d Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said he expected the government to advise working from home where possible in the next week or two. But he said timing was crucial for it to make a difference: \u201cThere\u2019s a cost to doing this. If you start too soon, you\u2019re not going to have much impact.

      "bodyText": "Indian Ocean surface temperatures that helped drive hot and dry conditions in eastern Australia last year were more clearly influenced by climate change than previously thought and are likely to worsen in future, researchers have found. Scientists studying a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole say their observations suggest Australia could experience future conditions even more extreme than those that elevated the bushfire risk during the 2019-20 fire season. The work, led by the Australian National University and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, used coral records from the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean to examine the occurrence of \u201cextreme positive\u201d Indian Ocean Dipole events over the past millennium. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the difference in temperature between the western and eastern Indian Ocean. When the IOD is in positive mode, warmer waters develop off the Horn of Africa and cooler waters develop off Indonesia. This leads to hotter and drier weather in Australia. An \u201cextreme positive\u201d event is when these conditions are particularly severe. Last year, an extreme positive IOD played a role in bushfires in Australia and floods in Africa. The scientists used fossil and modern coral cores to examine how frequently these events occurred back to 1240. Analysing data from 500 of those years, they found an extreme positive Indian Ocean Dipole like the one Australia experienced in 2019 was rare, occurring just 10 times. Lead author Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University , said four of the extreme positives were in the past 60 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these events becoming more frequent and our climate models suggest that\u2019s a response to human-caused climate change,\u201d she said. The strongest event on the instrumental record occurred in 1997. But using the coral records the researchers were able to find another more extreme case in 1675. Abram said this was one of the most concerning aspects of their findings. \u201cWe expect these events to continue becoming more frequent in future,\u201d she said. \u201cBut one of the worrying aspects of our findings was that the largest events in our observations over recent decades weren\u2019t as extreme as these events can get. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible to have even more extreme events than what we\u2019ve witnessed in recent decades.\u201d The findings, published in Nature, are the largest record developed for the Indian Ocean Dipole. Other research has also suggested that Indian Ocean Dipole events have become more frequent in recent decades. \u201cWhen we have these events we have hot and dry conditions in Australia,\u201d Abram said. \u201cIn 2019 that elevated the bushfire risk in southeastern Australia and then we obviously saw the devastating effects that had over summer.\u201d She said the new research showed countries needed to be aware that \u201crecent decades don\u2019t give us the full range of the risk these events pose\u201d. But stabilising global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions would also stabilise how often we experience these events in future. A co-author of the paper, Matthew England, said the research also found a strong coupling between variability in the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean. While IOD and El Ni\u00f1o events can occur independently of each other, periods of large year-to-year swings in Indian Ocean variability \u201calso had heightened ENSO variability in the Pacific\u201d. \u201cLooking at the tropical oceans in this interconnected way improves our understanding of seasonal to decadal climate variations in regions that profoundly impact Australia,\u201d England said. He said this could help Australia \u201cto be better prepared for future climate risks caused by the Indian Ocean Dipole\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Mostly, these are the worst of times, but for loo roll purveyors and disruptors it will never be better. Sales are up and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-stockpiling-supermarkets-toilet-paper-hand-gel\" title=\"\">supermarket shelves are empty</a> as more and more shoppers stockpile. So we should not be surprised by the rise of reusable toilet roll \u2013 squares of washable textiles that are linked together with plastic poppers and sold on sites such as Etsy.</p> <p>If you are, like me, invested in a sustainable lifestyle, the idea is quite thrilling. Reusable represents the gold standard of eco-engineering. Everything that is made and used has an eco footprint, which includes the energy used to create the thing in the first place. Single-use products are the worst, recycled a close second.</p> <p>Historically, squeamishness has put some products out of the reach of reusable design, but this is changing. The product designer Isabel Aagaard of LastObject claims to have sold more than 125,000 units of a <a href=\"https://lastobject.com/products/lastswab-basic?utm_term=%2Blast%20%2Bobject&amp;utm_campaign=NEW_SEARCH_UK&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=8362736500&amp;hsa_cam=9579089715&amp;hsa_grp=98772157596&amp;hsa_ad=424003969388&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-886389746289&amp;hsa_kw=%2Blast%20%2Bobject&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw0pfzBRCOARIsANi0g0sC6J6ysuQLvZ-71pyZy2NuOnI0yvn0ECYaZinR3y1G5Kl8PfKsW2AaAvBNEALw_wcB\" title=\"\">reusable cotton bud</a> (since March last year). The same company recently brought out a reusable tissue, which people my age still call a handkerchief. Then there are mooncups instead of tampons and, of course, a long tradition in reusable nappies.</p> <p>But are we ready for washable loo roll? The farcical supply chain of toilet roll is certainly ready for disruption: dead-tree paper (or sawdust) is carted across the world, wrapped in plastic and lined up for sale. Even the most ethical versions such as Who Gives a Crap have to be transported (by ship) and delivered to homes in vans. All paper-making is water-intensive, too.</p> <p>The reusable fabric roll kicks all this into touch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/11/the-bottom-line-why-its-time-the-bidet-made-a-comeback\" title=\"\">Bidets and flannels</a> have previously been touted as the most eco route, but the lifecycle analysis (the process of adding up all the energy costs) of using and washing them is contentious. One <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/WR0705_7589_FRP.pdf\" title=\"\">Defra study</a> from 2008 put the dampener on eco nappies, saying they used more energy than disposable ones because parents would typically tumble-dry them. The same may well be true for reusable loo roll \u2013 even if many devotees only use them for number ones. They will undoubtedly need to be washed at a high temperature \u2013 which takes a great a deal of energy. Questions also need to be asked about whether detergents need to be used and do the textiles shed microplastics when washed?</p> <p>Habit and tradition will ultimately decide whether reusable loo roll catches on. The earliest advert I can find on a perforated roll of paper in the UK is in the Lichfield Mercury from 1885. One Frederic Brown (really) guarantees \u201csatisfaction\u201d through the promise of a neat contrivance to replace the standard packet of paper. He cleverly sold a 100-sheet perforated roll with a handsome holder (cost: 2 shillings).</p> <p>What he understood was that if you want to change a habit, you need to sell a whole system. Today\u2019s disruptors shouldn\u2019t just be selling the squares of textile, but also the hamper that can be closed and easily carried to the washing machine. For mass uptake, they probably need to think bigger than the square.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mostly, these are the worst of times, but for loo roll purveyors and disruptors it will never be better. Sales are up and supermarket shelves are empty as more and more shoppers stockpile. So we should not be surprised by the rise of reusable toilet roll \u2013 squares of washable textiles that are linked together with plastic poppers and sold on sites such as Etsy. If you are, like me, invested in a sustainable lifestyle, the idea is quite thrilling. Reusable represents the gold standard of eco-engineering. Everything that is made and used has an eco footprint, which includes the energy used to create the thing in the first place. Single-use products are the worst, recycled a close second. Historically, squeamishness has put some products out of the reach of reusable design, but this is changing. The product designer Isabel Aagaard of LastObject claims to have sold more than 125,000 units of a reusable cotton bud (since March last year). The same company recently brought out a reusable tissue, which people my age still call a handkerchief. Then there are mooncups instead of tampons and, of course, a long tradition in reusable nappies. But are we ready for washable loo roll? The farcical supply chain of toilet roll is certainly ready for disruption: dead-tree paper (or sawdust) is carted across the world, wrapped in plastic and lined up for sale. Even the most ethical versions such as Who Gives a Crap have to be transported (by ship) and delivered to homes in vans. All paper-making is water-intensive, too. The reusable fabric roll kicks all this into touch. Bidets and flannels have previously been touted as the most eco route, but the lifecycle analysis (the process of adding up all the energy costs) of using and washing them is contentious. One Defra study from 2008 put the dampener on eco nappies, saying they used more energy than disposable ones because parents would typically tumble-dry them. The same may well be true for reusable loo roll \u2013 even if many devotees only use them for number ones. They will undoubtedly need to be washed at a high temperature \u2013 which takes a great a deal of energy. Questions also need to be asked about whether detergents need to be used and do the textiles shed microplastics when washed? Habit and tradition will ultimately decide whether reusable loo roll catches on. The earliest advert I can find on a perforated roll of paper in the UK is in the Lichfield Mercury from 1885. One Frederic Brown (really) guarantees \u201csatisfaction\u201d through the promise of a neat contrivance to replace the standard packet of paper. He cleverly sold a 100-sheet perforated roll with a handsome holder (cost: 2 shillings). What he understood was that if you want to change a habit, you need to sell a whole system. Today\u2019s disruptors shouldn\u2019t just be selling the squares of textile, but also the hamper that can be closed and easily carried to the washing machine. For mass uptake, they probably need to think bigger than the square.",

I glance at the screen and notice the familiar list of 30 patients booked in six hours. Sigh.</p> <p>My first patient, a delightful 11-year-old, smiles at me as she asks whether she is well enough to go to school camp next week after recovering from fevers, a dry cough and a runny nose. \u201cIt\u2019s not coronavirus!\u201d she smiles, her mum mirroring.</p> <p>\u201cIt probably isn\u2019t,\u201d I reply, \u201c but soon we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\u201d Her mum asks how I\u2019m coping with it all.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me started. We have been given 100 masks for our patients. I alone see more than 30 a day.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies\">Doctor who had coronavirus demands apology from Victorian health minister over 'inaccuracies'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My next patient is a man in his 50s I haven\u2019t met. \u201cMy daughter thinks I need to start on antidepressants,\u201d he says, before I even get a chance to introduce myself. I steady, have another quick glance at his file and ask him some questions.</p> <p>He answers: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m that bad. My daughter sees you and told me to come talk to you. I\u2019m OK. I just need to get through this.\u201d</p> <p>I start asking more specific questions. He says, \u201cI just work too much, I have no relationship with my wife. I have no time to do my own thing ... The other day a stranger asked how I was and I almost cried.\u201d</p> <p>As his eyes start welling up with tears, I offer some tissues. \u201cYou do sound depressed, and I think you\u2019ve had it for many many years,\u201d I say. \u201cI agree with your daughter that antidepressants will help in your case but we also need to discuss a long-term plan, including a psychologist.\u201d</p> <p>I call my colleague\u2019s room and ask her to see my next patient so I don\u2019t fall too far behind. I know I can\u2019t fully help this man today but I certainly need more than the 10-minute appointment he booked. I turn back to him and assure him that I am here for him.</p> <p>Moments later, I get a frantic knock on my door. It\u2019s my colleague who has just picked up the patient I was meant to see. She\u2019s wearing her N95 mask \u2013 one of only five for each doctor that the government has so diligently provided our practice.</p> <p>My heart sinks. This is it \u2026 my first real foray onto the frontlines of coronavirus. I\u2019ve talked about this moment with colleagues. I\u2019ve tried to read up on it as best as I can. I know where this is going. But do I actually know what I need to do? I am not prepared for this, I think to myself.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a mess. Put on your mask,\u201d she says. \u201cThis should never have gotten past the front door. Public health aren\u2019t picking up their phone! We can\u2019t do this,\u201d she adds. I briefly talk to her patient, a woman in her 30s who has just come back after two weeks in Japan. She has a sniffle. She wants clearance for work because she had this sniffle since before leaving Australia.</p> <p>We decide that she needs a swab and to self-quarantine for 14 days. Not sure if that was the right answer but it sounded reasonable. We quickly send her on towards the nearest private laboratory collection centre that would test for coronavirus \u2013 at least we knew where that was!</p> <p>My colleague panics as the patient leaves. \u201cI\u2019m a diabetic! Will I get it? I didn\u2019t touch her. I wore a mask. How do I clean the room now?\u201d she asks me.</p> <p>I honestly don\u2019t know the correct answer but I have to try. Despite being younger, I am the more senior doctor working today. I decide that we will stop using her room and that she will consult instead in the psychologist\u2019s room. I remind the receptionist of the importance of asking everybody when they walk in whether they have a chance of contracting coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "Saturday 7 March \u2013 8am to 2pm shift Bleary eyed as usual on an 8am Saturday morning start, I stumble into work, sit down at my desk and sip on the coffee my wonderful colleague has left for me. I glance at the screen and notice the familiar list of 30 patients booked in six hours. Sigh. My first patient, a delightful 11-year-old, smiles at me as she asks whether she is well enough to go to school camp next week after recovering from fevers, a dry cough and a runny nose. \u201cIt\u2019s not coronavirus!\u201d she smiles, her mum mirroring. \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t,\u201d I reply, \u201c but soon we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference.\u201d Her mum asks how I\u2019m coping with it all. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started. We have been given 100 masks for our patients. I alone see more than 30 a day.\u201d My next patient is a man in his 50s I haven\u2019t met. \u201cMy daughter thinks I need to start on antidepressants,\u201d he says, before I even get a chance to introduce myself. I steady, have another quick glance at his file and ask him some questions. He answers: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m that bad. My daughter sees you and told me to come talk to you. I\u2019m OK. I just need to get through this.\u201d I start asking more specific questions. He says, \u201cI just work too much, I have no relationship with my wife. I have no time to do my own thing ... The other day a stranger asked how I was and I almost cried.\u201d As his eyes start welling up with tears, I offer some tissues. \u201cYou do sound depressed, and I think you\u2019ve had it for many many years,\u201d I say. \u201cI agree with your daughter that antidepressants will help in your case but we also need to discuss a long-term plan, including a psychologist.\u201d I call my colleague\u2019s room and ask her to see my next patient so I don\u2019t fall too far behind. I know I can\u2019t fully help this man today but I certainly need more than the 10-minute appointment he booked. I turn back to him and assure him that I am here for him. Moments later, I get a frantic knock on my door. It\u2019s my colleague who has just picked up the patient I was meant to see. She\u2019s wearing her N95 mask \u2013 one of only five for each doctor that the government has so diligently provided our practice. My heart sinks. This is it \u2026 my first real foray onto the frontlines of coronavirus. I\u2019ve talked about this moment with colleagues. I\u2019ve tried to read up on it as best as I can. I know where this is going. But do I actually know what I need to do? I am not prepared for this, I think to myself. \u201cThis is a mess. Put on your mask,\u201d she says. \u201cThis should never have gotten past the front door. Public health aren\u2019t picking up their phone! We can\u2019t do this,\u201d she adds. I briefly talk to her patient, a woman in her 30s who has just come back after two weeks in Japan. She has a sniffle. She wants clearance for work because she had this sniffle since before leaving Australia. We decide that she needs a swab and to self-quarantine for 14 days. Not sure if that was the right answer but it sounded reasonable. We quickly send her on towards the nearest private laboratory collection centre that would test for coronavirus \u2013 at least we knew where that was! My colleague panics as the patient leaves. \u201cI\u2019m a diabetic! Will I get it? I didn\u2019t touch her. I wore a mask. How do I clean the room now?\u201d she asks me. I honestly don\u2019t know the correct answer but I have to try. Despite being younger, I am the more senior doctor working today. I decide that we will stop using her room and that she will consult instead in the psychologist\u2019s room. I remind the receptionist of the importance of asking everybody when they walk in whether they have a chance of contracting coronavirus. I ask her to print out some more signs for the front door \u2013 clearly the existing ones weren\u2019t adequate. \u201cHow we clean the room will be for our future selves to figure out,\u201d I think to myself. I let out another sigh, put on a smile before returning to my depressed patient. I finish the consult, promising to see him for a long appointment in the coming few days. He thanks me for taking the time out to listen to him. As I distractedly see my next few patients \u2013 a urinary tract infection, a snotty child (\u201cNo, she does not need antibiotics for her runny nose\u201d) and teaching stretches to two separate patients with muscular back pain \u2013 I try and read up the NSW Health guidelines on how to disinfect the other room.

      "bodyText": "I spent my twenties and thirties traveling to south-east Asia; loving the food, the experiences, the relaxed way of life. When I create salads at home, components that remind me of holidays in Thailand or Vietnam often make their way in, alongside a mishmash of other techniques. For this dish, a simple spicy salad dressing is used to deglaze the pan that the seafood is cooked in. This creates a sticky, caramelised glaze to coat the seafood, which contrasts well with the spritely fresh heat of the vegetable salad. Spicy seafood salad with crispy salmon skin Here I\u2019ve used salmon and tiger prawns but squid, calamari or other firm-fleshed fish would be perfect to include. I\u2019ve also eaten this style of salad with firm tofu or boiled eggs instead of the seafood \u2013 have a play and mix it up as you like to make it work for your family. Prep: 20 mins Cook: 10 mins Serves: 4, plus intentional leftovers To make the glaze and dressing This is meant to be hot! Reduce the number of chillies, dilute with a little water or add some coconut cream blobs to your salad to take out some of the bite, if you need to. 2 large garlic cloves 3-4 small bird\u2019s eye chillies 3 coriander roots, attached to ~2 cm of stalk, well washed to remove sand 2 limes, juiced, include the pith in the sauce ~150ml fish sauce 40g panela or raw sugar or palm sugar Place garlic, chillies and coriander roots in a mortar and pestle or blender and work it until you have a thick paste. Add the lime juice and about equal portions of fish sauce to the mix. Add half the sugar and continue to taste and add more until sweetness is evident on your palate. You need to be able to taste chilli heat, sugar, sour and salt to get the balance right. To make the salad 1 large bunch broccolini, cut into thirds 1 sweetcorn 2 lebanese cucumbers \u00bd punnet cherry tomatoes 1 medium carrot 1 shallot 1 avocado Handful of coriander, stalks and all, torn Handful of parsley, stalks and all, torn Handful of Vietnamese mint or common mint, stalks and all, torn Coconut flakes, lightly toasted 2 fillets salmon, ~600g 12 green prawns, peeled ~500g Coconut oil Steam the broccolini and corn for two minutes to brighten, yet retain the crunch, then allow to cool. Remove the corn from the cob, by slicing the kernels off carefully. Slice the cucumbers into quarters lengthways and then into 5cm long pieces. Cut the cherry tomatoes in halves. Finely slice or mandolin the carrot and shallot. Cut open the avocado, remove the seed and slice into 3cm chunky cubes. Toss together all the vegetables and the herbs, except the avocado. Add a third to half of the dressing, depending on your desire for heat, gently toss and then add the avocado chunks. Plate up the salad onto a shared platter or dish out the components onto individual plates then start to cook the seafood. Heat a large fry pan with the coconut oil on high. Add the salmon fillets, skin side down and cook for 8-10 minutes until the skin is dark and you can see the colour of the fish changing up the side of the fillets. While the salmon is cooking, slice open the prawn tails, along the back, removing the poo tube as you go if necessary, but leaving the tail attached. Turn the salmon fillets over and carefully peel off the crispy skin, then let it rest on some paper towel to firm up into crisps. Add the prawns carefully to the pan, laying them out so the butterflied section is touching the pan. Carefully add the other half of the dressing and allow it to sizzle and reduce, until you have a thick sticky sauce coating the cooked prawns \u2013 this should take a minute or two. Remove the prawns to a plate and turn off the heat under the pan. Allow the salmon to rest in the pan for two minutes before gently breaking it up into 3-5cm pieces. Toss the salmon around in the sticky sauce, add the prawns back in and add a drizzle of extra coconut oil to make it loose and beautifully shiny. Distribute the seafood over the salad, plus any extra glaze. Finally, sprinkle the salad with the toasted coconut flakes and the shards of crispy salmon skin. For later in the week Leftover salad and seafood is screaming to be made into rice paper rolls for lunch the next day. Extra pieces of salmon can be cooked with the same method (with or without the dressing) and used inside an omelette for a quick hearty dinner the following day. Douse it with more dressing once its finished cooking for an extra kick. If the dressing was too spicy for you too use just for this meal, it will keep in the fridge for a week or more, dilute with coconut cream and add to pumpkin soup, use as a dipping sauce for vegetable crudit\u00e9s or mix it through some mashed avo for a quick guacamole-style dip.",

      "bodyText": "Six taxpayer-funded grants were approved in the key marginal seat of Longman through the Department of Social Services in the month before the last federal election, including $177,000 for the Bribie Island and Districts Junior Rugby League Club. The club received funding from the $60m Mutual Understanding, Support, Tolerance, Engagement and Respect (Muster) initiative, one of a number of programs distributing grants on a closed, non-competitive basis, requiring invitations from the department to apply. The Muster initiative, designed to promote community harmony, funded mainly national, state and regional level programs such as education, suicide prevention, cultural and religious programs. While local grants were rare, the key marginal seat of Longman received six. On Tuesday the Senate select committee on sports grants will hear from clubs that missed out on funding under the controversial $100m community sports infrastructure grant (CSIG) program in Adelaide. The inquiry has already uncovered emails in which the offices of former sports minister Bridget McKenzie and Scott Morrison proposed shifting projects between programs to fund Coalition election commitments from other departments\u2019 funds, although none of the clubs that won Muster grants had applied to the CSIG fund. The Muster program was first announced in the December 2018 mid-year economic update and received a $7m top-up in the budget delivered on 2 April, 2019, six weeks out from the 2019 election. On 1 April, four grants were approved in the Labor-held Coalition target seat of Longman: $176,929 for the Bribie Island and Districts Junior Rugby League Club $26,229 for the Burpengary and District Men\u2019s Shed $20,230 for the Bribie Island Community Arts Society; and $12,782 for the Wamuran Branch Little Athletics Centre On 4 April two further grants were approved in the electorate for the Narangba Australian Football Club ($3,956) and the Caboolture Men\u2019s Shed ($19,000). On 22 April the LNP candidate, Terry Young, advertised one of the commitments on his Facebook account, without specifying the source of the funds. According to the GrantsConnect website, the grants were formally announced on 14 and 28 June and 8 July, all after the Coalition\u2019s upset victory on 18 May in which Young won the Labor-held seat of Longman. In his first speech to parliament, Young praised Morrison and the party\u2019s federal campaign director, Andrew Hirst, linking a $500,000 sports grant and a visit from the prime minister to a Caboolture sports club on the eve of the election to his victory by citing the party\u2019s \u201cgreat strategising\u201d. The Bribie Island and Districts Junior Rugby League Club announced its Muster grant on 12 June, thanking Young and state LNP MP Simone Wilson \u201cfor your assistance\u201d: On 23 November, Young announced the Wamuran branch little athletics grant on his Facebook, sporting a novelty cheque: The Muster program was designed to promote shared identity, encourage diverse communities, to \u201cprovide support for immersive programs, especially sports and arts\u201d and \u201cbuild strong, socially cohesive communities\u201d. Although some local level grants were given, the vast majority were for large national, state or regional level programs such as $6.6m to High Resolve for tolerance programs in schools, $4.4m for the Lebanese Muslim Association and $2.4m to Together For Humanity, a multi-faith organisation. A spokeswoman for the social services minister, Anne Ruston, told Guardian Australia that \u201cevery application was assessed by the department of social services\u201d, which provided recommendations to the minister. \u201cThe minister did not fund any organisations that the department recommended against,\u201d she said. \u201cThe projects referenced were approved for funding prior to the caretaker period so had an identified and agreed funding source as opposed to Labor which put forward billions of dollars worth of unfunded promises.\u201d On Tuesday the Senate inquiry will hear evidence from emeritus professor Geoffrey Lindell on his submission that he shares the auditor general\u2019s doubts McKenzie had the legal authority to administer the CSIG sports grants, supporting the view of constitutional expert Anne Twomey. The Adelaide hearing returns the sports rorts affair to the state that kick-started the auditor general\u2019s interest in the program, after failed Liberal Mayo candidate Georgina Downer presented a sports grant to a local community group on a giant novelty cheque emblazoned with her face. Sport Australia remains under pressure to fulfil a Senate order it defied late last week and answer 40 questions on notice about what it knew about the government\u2019s colour-coded spreadsheets, and when, as well as contact it may have had with the prime minister\u2019s office, after ignoring the Friday deadline.

Labor has also asked the attorney general to investigate the former health boss Glenys Beauchamp\u2019s destruction of \u201cpersonal\u201d notebooks, which may have contained \u201cscratching\u201d of the meeting, after the public service commissioner declined to investigate. The national archivist can\u2019t say whether or not the law has been broken, as it is unaware of what might have been in the notebooks.

On Monday 16 March the committee is due to hear from McKenzie and the secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, who found she had failed to declare an interest in one club that received funding.

Indeed, it\u2019s the lynchpin of their case. Pell\u2019s counsel, Bret Walker SC, argues the jury and the court of appeal were so swept away by the cardinal\u2019s accuser \u2013 by his testimony and his demeanour in the witness box \u2013 that they downplayed the evidence in Pell\u2019s favour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/03/george-pells-appeal-glosses-over-evidence-that-supports-conviction-dpp-says\">George Pell's appeal 'glosses over' evidence that supports conviction, DPP says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In lawyer speak: \u201cBelief in a \u2018compelling\u2019 complainant does not, ipso facto, equate to the elimination of reasonable doubt.\u201d</p> <p>When the court assembles on Wednesday, a dozen of the finest legal brains in the land will be debating Pell\u2019s fate at a level of stratospheric complexity.

What matters here are not the squalid accusations but the determined effort of the court to decide once and for all the role of appeals court judges when examining jury verdicts. Five high court judges declared the \u201cultimate question\u201d for an appellate court is whether upon the whole of the evidence it was \u201copen to the jury\u201d to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. For the last 25 years the high court has been hearing arguments about the proper route appellate court judges should follow to decide what verdicts are and are not \u201copen\u201d to juries. Mark Weinberg QC, the dissenting judge on the court of appeal, not only took a harsh view of the credibility of Pell\u2019s accuser \u2013 his honour was definitely not swept away \u2013 but argued that M\u2019s case required him to follow a two-step process.

The judges have yet to write their judgments but they ordered the ex-cop released immediately.

      "bodyText": "If you have a trip planned, or are thinking of planning a holiday, either within Australia or overseas, here\u2019s what you need to know about how to best guard yourself against any issues arising from the spread of Covid-19. I booked a trip last year, am I still going to be covered for travel insurance? It will depend on a number of factors, most notably when you booked the travel. Lisa Kable, communications manager for the Insurance Council of Australia, told Guardian Australia in February that after Dfat made its announcement on 23 January about the risk of travel in relation to coronavirus it became a \u201cknown event\u201d for insurers. \u201cIf people are travelling and bought their travel insurance before it became a known event \u2026 the majority of travel insurance policies should cover people if they contract coronavirus overseas, or if their trips have to be moved around countries or places.\u201d If you bought it after the cut-off date, most travel insurers exclude pandemic, epidemic disease or infectious disease or a known event. The same rules apply if people are already travelling, or have yet to start travelling \u2013 it only matters when the insurance was purchased. Choice\u2019s travel insurance review found less than half of insurers cover cancellation as a result of a pandemic or epidemic, but that\u2019s only the case once it becomes a known event. The same rules apply to both domestic and international travel insurance. While companies like NRMA note that sickness is one of the biggest reasons people make a claim on their insurance, the product disclosure statement says pandemics and epidemics are not covered if you cancel. You can, however, get \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d cover as an add-on to your travel insurance. This allows you to claim up to 75% of your cancellation costs to $10,000 but it must be bought within 48 hours of paying for expensive items such as flights or accommodation. Insurer Cover-More explicitly names Covid-19 as a reason you may wish to purchase this add-on. The cost can vary depending on the insurer, but a quick quote online with one insurer suggests an increase in the price of the insurance by around 50%. If you are worried you\u2019ll die from coronavirus, life insurers in Australia have argued there is nothing in the exclusions to prevent them paying out life insurance in the case of a death from coronavirus. What should I do if I have a trip coming up within Australia? There aren\u2019t yet warnings in Australia about avoiding travel or being out and about in public, save for those who suspect they might have coronavirus, and you can find out what you should do in that situation here. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has not recommended any changes to how people go about their life in Australia at the moment. The biggest factor to consider in domestic travel is the possibility your flight may be cancelled due to a downturn in the number of flight bookings. If it is a heavily travelled route, then it will likely not be a major inconvenience to book a different flight on the same day, but for routes with fewer flights you could end up with significant delays getting to or from your destination. In that case, the airline may have to refund your flight. It is something the Australian consumer watchdog has been keeping a close eye on. What should I do if I have a trip coming up overseas? The best course of action is to first check the travel advice for where you are planning to travel with the federal government. As of 9 March, Dfat says people should not travel to China, Iran or South Korea, and travel bans remain in place for foreign nationals who have travelled through these countries in the last 14 days. Australians can still return, but will be required to self-isolate. Dfat has also warned Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Thailand are at moderate risk for Covid-19. This could change, and more countries could be added to the lists, so it is best to keep an eye on the government advice as you get closer to the travel date. As with domestic flights, it is worth checking in with the airline to ensure you\u2019re not bumped to other flights due to lower bookings and cancellations. What about big conferences? A number of big international conferences like SXSW, Mobile World Congress and various tech conferences have been cancelled over the past two months, and more cancellations are likely. Check your emails and the conference website for updates. A new website, isitcanceledyet.com, is also keeping track. Is there anything I should look for when booking my trip? If you\u2019re not sure whether your trip is going to go ahead, you may be better off booking a fully flexible flight that will allow you to change or cancel the flight and get your money back, and the same for accommodation. When it comes time to travel, check in with the airline to ensure your flight is still going ahead, and the travel advice remains the same for where you\u2019re travelling. Hotels and airlines and other providers are currently offering better cancellation policies than many of the major booking companies due to the downturn in bookings since the crisis started, so best to check the cancellation policy before booking and see if you can get a better offer directly. Several cruise companies such as Regent and Norwegian are now allowing people to cancel bookings as late as 48 hours in advance with 100% refund. Airbnb has also changed its policy on cancellations, now allowing for guests travelling to or from severely impacted areas to cancel without charge, and the same for hosts in, or welcoming guests from, severely impacted areas. People who can\u2019t travel due to travel restrictions or suspected cases of Covid-19 can get a full refunds, hosts won\u2019t incur cancellation fees and it won\u2019t affect their status as a host.",

In Through a Glass Darkly (1961), he was the anguished husband of Harriet Andersson, watching his wife lapsing into insanity, and in Winter Light (1962), he was a man terrified of nuclear annihilation.</p> <p>Von Sydow refused offers of work outside Sweden, even the title role in the first James Bond movie, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/25/my-favourite-bond-film-dr-no\" title=\"\">Dr No (1962)</a>, though two decades later he played the evil genius Blofeld to Sean Connery\u2019s Bond in Never Say Never Again, 1983.

The tall, gaunt and imposing blond Von Sydow, pronounced Suedov, made his mark internationally in 1957 as the disillusioned 14th-century knight Antonius Block, in Bergman\u2019s The Seventh Seal. Returning from the crusades to his plague-stricken country, he finds that he has lost his faith in God and can no longer pray. Suddenly, he is confronted by the personification of Death. Seeking more time on Earth, he challenges Death to a game of chess. Von Sydow\u2019s portrayal of a man in spiritual turmoil demonstrated a maturity beyond his years and was to exemplify his solemn and dignified persona in further Bergman films, even extending to some of his less worthier enterprises.

It\u2019s the same with his work. Every framed tin of Campbell\u2019s soup or colour-saturated portrait of Marilyn Monroe screams Warhol. And most people are familiar with his most famous quote: \u201cIn the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Despite all this, I don\u2019t think people really <em>get</em> Warhol\u2019s work. Or, at least, I don\u2019t. I have no idea what Warhol was trying to say or communicate, with that quote or any of his work. This would be fine, if he wasn\u2019t the most famous contemporary artist on Earth. I\u2019ve even listened to interviews and read articles to get answers, but in them Warhol would infamously shirk or lie whenever pressed about what his work meant. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if you look at a thing long enough,\u201d he once said, \u201cit loses all of its meaning.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be69ba2d17d6288d94768e75a529bf355bfbba9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be69ba2d17d6288d94768e75a529bf355bfbba9a/1104_0_3840_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Maybe I should have diluted it\u2019 \u2026 Oobah with the food that inspired Warhol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Maybe I should have diluted it\u2019 \u2026 Oobah with the food that inspired Warhol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Lewis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am keen to crack this enigma in time for Tate Modern\u2019s blockbuster show, the first major Warhol retrospective at the London gallery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jan/27/arts.highereducation\">in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jan/27/arts.highereducation\">almost 20 years</a>, which opens this week.

Well, you try downing five tins of condensed cream of mushroom soup (I couldn\u2019t get tomato). Warhol said he grew up eating Campbell\u2019s, which inspired his breakthrough piece of work \u2013 that instantly recognisable stack of identically painted canned goods.

We\u2019re ready for Museum Lane in Kensington. Out on the cobbled stones, surrounded by all those beautifully coloured buildings, I assemble the piece: a glass cube on a tall white plinth with a face mask displayed inside. I sign my name in pen and, crouching at a distance, watch as business people pace by without stopping. Some hurrying commuters glance dismissively. Oh Christ, I think, it looks awful: a monstrosity cooked up by a failing art student.</p> <p>Wait! Somebody has stopped. Clutching an umbrella and silhouetted by rainfall, an older man stares down at the face mask. For 10 seconds, he doesn\u2019t move. A phone is unsheathed and a photo is taken.

A period of experimentation began, best defined by his film Sleep, for which Warhol shot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/15/john-giorno-artist-new-york-radical\">his friend and lover John Giorno</a> sleeping for five hours. After screening it, he was embraced by the New York art world, as well as the underground scene.</p> <p>I need my Sleep moment! This means breaking barriers. It means exhibiting intimacy. It means \u2026 livestreaming someone sleeping overnight on my Instagram. OK, but where am I going to find someone willing to do that? I can\u2019t put it to work friends, or post the question online, as the police would be at my door in a shot, asking for hard drives. I need to find a normal person who is as excited by the idea as I am. I open Microsoft Word, write \u201cSLEEPING PERSON NEEDED\u201d in Papyrus (a nice, tasteful typeface) and insert an image of a phone not used since 2004.</p> <p>After printing off a handful of these mini-posters, I tape them up at bus stops, a public toilet and a church community board, where they sit alongside Man With a Van posters. Surely nobody will answer this, will they? But later, a vibration! \u201cI sleep most nights,\u201d the text says. \u201cGood at it, actually. Let\u2019s collab.\u201d</p> <p>Within hours, I\u2019m staring at a silver tent I\u2019ve set up in a friend\u2019s warehouse workspace, my Factory, as Warhol\u2019s HQ was called, wondering who I\u2019m about to sleep near and whether they\u2019re dangerous. When the bell goes, so does my breath. In walks Mafalda, nervously smiling. Mafalda is a young Portuguese woman on a gap year.

I switch on the livestream and she tries to sleep. To begin with, the viewer count lingers in single figures. I doze off but spring awake after 20 minutes to find that more than 100 people are watching. And the figure is increasing. Throughout the night, the trend continues, with comments ranging from gently bleak (particularly a rally of tent puns) to the truly baffling (somebody in Baltimore asking how to gift the sleeping Mafalda money). By the morning, more than 6,000 people have tuned in, actually gripped by live footage of someone sound asleep.</p> <p>I\u2019m ecstatic. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the buzz of success or the thought of being able to monetise circadian rhythms, but I feel Warhol\u2019s spirit cascading through my veins! Maybe it\u2019s only sleep deprivation, though: I had to wake up every hour to restart the livestream.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m itching to move on to the next Warhol phase, which I\u2019m calling Nightlife. Like the artist, I\u2019m going to hit the town with a cast of colourful counterculture characters. We\u2019re going to bring the downtown demimonde into the divine spotlight of uptown. I text everyone I know who still owns a camera and tell them to be in Mayfair at 6pm. There I\u2019ll meet my friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hausofdarkwah/?hl=en\">Darkwah</a> and, followed by this camera-wielding bunch of faux paparazzi, we will walk to Chiltern Firehouse, London\u2019s premiere celebrity hangout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f784a9ed32efd0936849f2803c59cb9a6edb3b5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f784a9ed32efd0936849f2803c59cb9a6edb3b5a/0_131_5234_3142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Night on the town \u2026 Oobah shoots Darkwah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Night on the town \u2026 Oobah shoots Darkwah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Lewis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bursting into the reception area of the dimly lit restaurant, we are stopped by the maitre d\u2019, who tells us to wait.

While I was away, a group of men approached him and asked if they could get a table. Others smirked at his makeup, Vegas gold bespoke suit and chest-exposing blue velour tank top. \u201cThis,\u201d he says, \u201cis why I don\u2019t come to this part of town.\u201d We leave.</p> <p>After the highs of the livestream, this is a dose of depressing reality. I consider Warhol\u2019s legacy and find myself turning that quote over in my mind again. \u201cIn the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\u201d Maybe, instead of unpacking and overthinking this line, I should take it literally: pick a random person in a public place and treat them like a Beatle for 15 minutes.</p> <p>The next afternoon, I hit the South Bank, standing by the river making a fake call to a friend, poised for action. Thirty actors I\u2019ve sourced through a casting website are dotted around me, admiring the view or sipping coffee. A man in his mid-20s, with red-flecked cheeks under a blue beanie, approaches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"964ac0a033297d7ad0d52cf67ba6f426df26a67f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/964ac0a033297d7ad0d52cf67ba6f426df26a67f/903_286_4446_2668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mobbed \u2026 15 minutes of fame for Jasper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mobbed \u2026 15 minutes of fame for Jasper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Lewis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I gasp and point at him. \u201cWhere do I recognise you from?\u201d He stops, looking confused. \u201cI love your work!\u201d I say. \u201cPlease can I have a selfie?\u201d I\u2019m assured I\u2019ve \u201cgot the wrong guy\u201d, but still he politely obliges. Soon, another young guy comes up and asks for the same. \u201cI\u2019m not the right guy!\u201d he yells, before noticing that my band of worshippers are gathering around him. He gulps and accepts. Removing his hat, the young man introduces himself and addresses us. He\u2019s been travelling alone for six months after leaving Poland having become addicted to masturbation. <em>What?</em> This is like a Velvet Underground song! This guy could get his own verse in Lou Reed\u2019s Walk on the Wild Side.</p> <p>We regroup, then move in on a tall, slender man with long hair. \u201cWoah,\u201d one of my actors exclaims. \u201cI love your videos!\u201d The man, an Australian called Jasper, immediately replies: \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody watched them!\u201d My actors begin to arrive one by one, grabbing him by the shoulder, demanding selfies and his autograph, and thanking him for his work. Soon we have a proper mob. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a dream!\u201d cries Jasper jubilantly, instructing his girlfriend with wide eyes: \u201cFilm this!\u201d Passersby begin taking photos of him, too. He\u2019s famous! And his 15 minutes aren\u2019t nearly up.</p> <p>Watching Warhol\u2019s most famous prophecy acted out, I\u2019m fascinated. It took being part of this strange experiment to understand the curious power fame has over the average person, its unique ability to expose something within ourselves that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise have been aware of. The first guy had to tell us the worst thing about himself \u2013 the masturbation \u2013 before he could feel worthy of idolatry. Others accepted it as most of us would, like an overdue package with their name on it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0e4354d76092eddf562750ce1f011322dfca0ecd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4354d76092eddf562750ce1f011322dfca0ecd/54_5_2101_2863/734.jpg\" alt=\"The real Andy Warhol, filming Chelsea Girls in 1967.\" width=\"734\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The real Andy Warhol, in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Santi Visalli Inc./Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What I\u2019ve come to realise \u2013 and love \u2013 is that Warhol democratised art, brought it down to the level of the person in the street, or the supermarket aisle. But to do that, he had to make it less like cherubs and apostles. He had to make it uglier, because that made it more like us, more like contemporary life.</p> <p>\u201cHow would I have reacted to being gently mobbed?\u201d I wondered, as my selfie-taking entourage disappeared off into the afternoon. Maybe I\u2019ll never completely understand Warhol, but there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of: I want to be famous.</p> <p>\u2022 The Andy Warhol retrospective is at <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/andy-warhol\">Tate Modern, London</a>, 12 March to 6 September.

I consider Warhol\u2019s legacy and find myself turning that quote over in my mind again. \u201cIn the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.\u201d Maybe, instead of unpacking and overthinking this line, I should take it literally: pick a random person in a public place and treat them like a Beatle for 15 minutes. The next afternoon, I hit the South Bank, standing by the river making a fake call to a friend, poised for action. Thirty actors I\u2019ve sourced through a casting website are dotted around me, admiring the view or sipping coffee. A man in his mid-20s, with red-flecked cheeks under a blue beanie, approaches. I gasp and point at him. \u201cWhere do I recognise you from?\u201d He stops, looking confused. \u201cI love your work!\u201d I say. \u201cPlease can I have a selfie?\u201d I\u2019m assured I\u2019ve \u201cgot the wrong guy\u201d, but still he politely obliges. Soon, another young guy comes up and asks for the same. \u201cI\u2019m not the right guy!\u201d he yells, before noticing that my band of worshippers are gathering around him. He gulps and accepts. Removing his hat, the young man introduces himself and addresses us. He\u2019s been travelling alone for six months after leaving Poland having become addicted to masturbation. What? This is like a Velvet Underground song! This guy could get his own verse in Lou Reed\u2019s Walk on the Wild Side. We regroup, then move in on a tall, slender man with long hair. \u201cWoah,\u201d one of my actors exclaims. \u201cI love your videos!\u201d The man, an Australian called Jasper, immediately replies: \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody watched them!\u201d My actors begin to arrive one by one, grabbing him by the shoulder, demanding selfies and his autograph, and thanking him for his work. Soon we have a proper mob. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a dream!\u201d cries Jasper jubilantly, instructing his girlfriend with wide eyes: \u201cFilm this!\u201d Passersby begin taking photos of him, too. He\u2019s famous! And his 15 minutes aren\u2019t nearly up. Watching Warhol\u2019s most famous prophecy acted out, I\u2019m fascinated. It took being part of this strange experiment to understand the curious power fame has over the average person, its unique ability to expose something within ourselves that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise have been aware of. The first guy had to tell us the worst thing about himself \u2013 the masturbation \u2013 before he could feel worthy of idolatry. Others accepted it as most of us would, like an overdue package with their name on it. What I\u2019ve come to realise \u2013 and love \u2013 is that Warhol democratised art, brought it down to the level of the person in the street, or the supermarket aisle. But to do that, he had to make it less like cherubs and apostles. He had to make it uglier, because that made it more like us, more like contemporary life. \u201cHow would I have reacted to being gently mobbed?\u201d I wondered, as my selfie-taking entourage disappeared off into the afternoon. Maybe I\u2019ll never completely understand Warhol, but there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m certain of: I want to be famous. \u2022 The Andy Warhol retrospective is at Tate Modern, London, 12 March to 6 September. There is a 2-for-1 ticket offer for Guardian and Observer readers. Visit tate.org.uk/warhol-2020 and use code GUARDIAN241. Tickets must be booked by Wednesday 11 March",

The victims came from 17 countries. Most \u2013 193 people \u2013 were Dutch nationalsOthers were Malaysian, Australian, Indonesian and British.</p> \n<p>\u201cEspecially for next of kin this will be a very painful and emotional period,\u201d Steenhuis said as he opened proceedings by describing how Dutch criminal law treats defendants and victims.</p> \n<p>After a painstaking international investigation, Dutch prosecutors alleged that four men had responsibility for the missile launch: the Russians Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy and Oleg Pulatov, and the Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko. All were senior commanders fighting Ukrainian forces in the Russian-backed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d99c7cf-459a-4415-9e1f-4571eec80646\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Igor Girkin</b></p>\n    <p>A former colonel in Vladimir Putin\u2019s FSB spy agency, Girkin became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/05/russias-valiant-hero-in-ukraine-turns-his-fire-on-vladimir-putin\">the most notorious personality of the war in eastern Ukraine</a>. In April 2014 he led the takeover of the Ukrainian town of Slavyansk and became defence minister in the separatist Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR). According to leaked phone intercepts, Girkin was involved in the cover-up operation to move the Buk missile launcher back to Russia after it shot down MH17. In August 2014 the Kremlin sacked him from command of rebel-held territory. A radical nationalist, he has criticised Putin for failing to carry out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/mh17-criminal-charges-ukraine-russia\">Dutch charges against him</a>, he says: \u201cThe only thing I can say is the rebels did not shoot down the Boeing.\u201d</p>\n    <p><b>Sergey Dubinskiy</b></p>\n    <p>Dubinsky was an undercover officer with Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency. He ran an analogous operation within the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR), called the GRU DNR. Although formally separate from Moscow, the body closely coordinated its effort with the Russian GRU. It is alleged that it was Dubinsky who asked for the Buk missile launcher to be delivered to rebel forces near the city of Snizhne, in the Donetsk region. He personally coordinated the Buk\u2019s arrival on 17 July 2014 when it shot down MH17, according to intercepted phone calls. Prosecutors allege that Dubinsky was involved in the operation to hide the anti-aircraft system and to smuggle it back to Russia. He has previously said he does not believe in the objectivity of the Dutch investigation.</p>\n    <p><b>Oleg Pulatov</b></p>\n    <p>Pulatov was a former solider in the GRU\u2019s special forces <em>spetsnaz</em> unit. He served as Dubinskiy\u2019s No 2 within the GRU DNR. He was previously a lieutenant colonel in Russia\u2019s armed forces. Phone intercepts appear to place Pulatov in eastern Ukraine when MH17 was shot down. Investigators accused him of escorting the Buk missile launcher to the spot where it fired its missile just south of Snizhne. Unlike the other defendants, he is being represented by a defence team. He has not commented on the allegations against him.</p>\n    <p><b>Leonid Kharchenko</b></p>\n    <p>Kharchenko led a military combat unit in the city of Donetsk, a key rebel hub. He was subordinate to the three Russians \u2013 Girkin, Dubinskiy and Pulatov \u2013 and is the only Ukrainian to have been charged so far by the Dutch-led joint investigation team. When MH17 was shot down he was the head of the Krot Reconnaissance Battalion of the GRU DNR\u2019s second department.

      "bodyText": "The trial of three Russians and a Ukrainian accused of murdering 298 people in the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine has begun in the Netherlands. The presiding judge, Hendrik Steenhuis, said \u201cthe loss of so many lives and the manner in which they so abruptly ended is barely conceivable\u201d as he opened the case on Monday at the Schiphol judicial complex, close to the airport from where the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 took off for Kuala Lumpur on 17 July 2014. The aircraft was shot down over the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine by a Buk anti-aircraft missile, killing everyone onboard. The victims came from 17 countries. Most \u2013 193 people \u2013 were Dutch nationalsOthers were Malaysian, Australian, Indonesian and British. \u201cEspecially for next of kin this will be a very painful and emotional period,\u201d Steenhuis said as he opened proceedings by describing how Dutch criminal law treats defendants and victims. After a painstaking international investigation, Dutch prosecutors alleged that four men had responsibility for the missile launch: the Russians Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy and Oleg Pulatov, and the Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko. All were senior commanders fighting Ukrainian forces in the Russian-backed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic. Russia does not allow extradition of its citizens, and none of the men appeared in court on Monday. Pulatov has appointed two Dutch lawyers, who first presented to the court in January. \u201cThey have had but a brief space of time to prepare for this hearing,\u201d Steenhuis said. Nine lawyers have been hired to represent some of the victims and their families They also have the right to speak in court, alongside public prosecutors and the defence. The trial, which will also include testimony from the family of the victims, is expected to last several months. Lawyers will pore over a case file that already stands at 36,000 pages, and many digital pieces of evidence. Forty-nine relatives have said they wish to address the court and 82 will give written statements on how the death of their loved ones has affected their lives. More may decide to give written or oral statements. Liz Mayne has written a statement describing how the death of her son Richard, a 20-year student at Leeds University on his way to Australia, has \u201ccompletely broken\u201d her family. Richard\u2019s father, Simon, said Monday\u2019s court session was the beginning of a process that could last 30 years. He said the political state of Russia a decade in the future was unknowable. \u201cIt is important to establish the facts now. The trial will reveal the chain of command right back to the Kremlin. That may one day become important,\u201d he said. Eighty-four relatives have exercised their right under Dutch law to seek compensation. The prosecutor Ward Ferdinandusse said the four defendants had \u201cnoted with delight\u201d that a plane had been shot down. \u201cWe do not think that these defendants pressed the button that launched the Buk missile,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever we do think that they played a significant coordinating role in the transportation and positioning of the Buk-Telar and its removal back to Russia, making them so closely involved that they can be held responsible under criminal law for the downing of flight MH17.\u201d Ferdinandusse said it was perfectly conceivable the men had intended to shoot down a Ukrainian military jet, but that did not exclude prosecution or entitle them to claim combat immunity because they were not regular military personnel. \u201cWhoever systematically violates humanitarian law cannot invoke it to their benefit in a criminal trial,\u201d he said. Russia has always denied any involvement in the shooting down of the plane. The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, accused Dutch authorities last week of orchestrating a media campaign to compensate for gaps in the evidence and assembling facts to fit a predetermined verdict. The Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT) said in 2016 that it had found irrefutable evidence the Buk missile had been fired from a village under the control of pro-Russia rebels. The court is also expected to hear details of intercepted phone calls that reveal separatist leaders requesting help from senior Kremlin advisers shortly before MH17 was shot down. The opening sessions will not get into these details, but will be devoted to what Steenhuis called \u201cmapping out the current state of play\u201d. In a statement before the opening session, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, described the trial as \u201can important milestone in the efforts to ensure justice for the 298 victims and their families\u201d. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, struck a similar tone, reflecting on a tragedy that caused the death of 298 innocent civilians and calling on Russia to cooperate fully with the investigation.",

It\u2019s part of the artist\u2019s Broken Treaty Quilts, where the artist sews together injustice into an object of comfort. \u201cThis artwork is a way to talk about longer history of how the US has treated native people,\u201d said Rosoff. \u201cWe\u2019re still violating treaty rights, whether it\u2019s the Dakota access pipeline or violating sacred homeland or national monuments, it goes on and on. \u201cThe US government coerced over 370 tribes to sign treaties, native people were forced onto reservations starting in the 1860s so land could be taken, turned into lots, bought and sold, over 90 million acres of native land,\u201d she added. Many of the ancient objects on view from Central and South America offer a window into how communities connected to the natural world, and the supernatural. The exhibit includes a Mayan bowl made of ceramic that dates back to 350 BC, an Aztec sculpture of a jaguar made from volcanic stone and a golden plaque to honor a crocodile deity from Panama. \u201cThey\u2019re viewing these groups as not even existing anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to use these objects as another way of looking at issues affecting Indigenous people today.\u201d Climate in Crisis: Environmental Change in the Indigenous Americas is on show at the Brooklyn Museum until 10 January 2021",

      "body": "<h2>Tim Wheeler, singer, guitarist, songwriter</h2> <p>Mark Hamilton and I both got guitars for Christmas when we were 12. We formed a terrible heavy metal band called Vietnam, and then started Ash with Rick [McMurray} when we were 15. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkSl9GGOFHM\">Girl from Mars</a> in my bedroom at my parents\u2019 house when I was 17.</p> <p>I think there was a bit of Mars hanging over us. I was listening to Pixies, who were sci-fi obsessed. My sister is 18 years older than me and was a David Bowie fan in her teens. Our rehearsal room had been her den, and she\u2019d written Life on Mars in huge letters on the wall. I think I also saw a film called <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101954/\">Girl from Mars</a>, or something, in a TV listing magazine. It was on at 4am so I never watched it, but I made my own story for the song.</p> <p>I\u2019d broken up with my first girlfriend, which was very intense, first love. I\u2019d always been a happy child but for the first time was experiencing teenage angst, which I poured into the song. Aged 17, I was already nostalgic for those happier times. The previous summer, I\u2019d gone on a family holiday to France. We met a bunch of cool kids and hung out on the beach, smoking cigars, which is where the line about \u201cHenri Winterman cigars\u201d comes from.</p> <p>The first demo I did on my own sounds very much like a Teenage Fanclub song, mid tempo and jangly. When we played it as a band, we sped it up and it became more like the Buzzcocks. Live, it got a reaction straight away. After our manager discovered us and we signed to Infectious Records, they put us in the studio to record a mini-album, but specifically instructed us to not record Girl from Mars. They knew it had the potential to be a hit and wanted to hold it back until we\u2019d left school and could promote it properly.</p> <p>We eventually recorded it in Rockfield Studios in Monmouth with producer <a href=\"https://www.hannahmanagement.co.uk/portfolio_page/owen-morris/\">Owen Morris</a> when he had a break from working on <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-verves-a-northern-soul-20-years-on-a-knife-twisting-snapshot-of-a-band-on-the-brink-767197\">the Verve\u2019s A Northern Soul</a>. But the label and management thought we hadn\u2019t got it quite right, so we went back in to finish it with <a href=\"https://www.soundonsound.com/people/phil-thornalley-torn\">Phil Thornalley</a>, who\u2019d been in the Cure and produced Torn for Natalie Imbruglia. I was finishing my A-levels when I first heard Girl from Mars on the radio. Then two days later we were playing Glastonbury. It\u2019s been on the setlist for every gig we\u2019ve done ever since. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d let us out of venues if we didn\u2019t play it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkSl9GGOFHM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FkSl9GGOFHM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Rick McMurray, drummer</h2> <p>I\u2019d seen Tim and Mark playing in Vietnam at school. The singer walked off stage during the gig, so Tim had to take over on vocals. I was the year above Tim and we got talking during the school play, and he suggested I go round for a jam. By the second rehearsal, they\u2019d kicked the other guys out of the group so it was just Tim, Mark and me. Then everything just snowballed.</p> <p>We were full of energy, teenage hormones, and the excitement of being in a band. When we first went into the studio, getting a successful take meant just getting to the end of the song without anyone stopping. By the time we did Girl from Mars, we\u2019d probably recorded 10 or 12 songs, but that one took us to another level. It was very catchy and commercial.</p> <p>Recording with Owen Morris was bonkers. When we did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QawmH3hOkl8\">Angel Interceptor</a> I had my first ecstasy experience. You can hear me at the end hollering: \u201cWhooo! Yeah, we\u2019ve got it!\u201d For Girl from Mars, the day started in the pub and then Owen went: \u201cRight, let\u2019s go to a charity shop and get some women\u2019s clothes!\u201d We thought: \u201cThis is what bands do.\u201d And we definitely got on board with the idea, which was kind of fun. It was like we were wearing our grannies\u2019 clothes. It certainly broke the anxiety of being a young band in the studio.</p> <p>We did a really iconic video with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/nov/25/peter-sleazy-christopherson\">\u2018Sleazy\u2019 Christopherson</a> from Throbbing Gristle, on a freezing cold beach in Camber Sands in East Sussex, but then they made us do <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8hJXLW6kKk\">another one</a> for the US MTV, which I have no recollection of whatsoever. Tim did a live vocal on Top of the Pops. I put lino on my drums to quieten them, and was playing very slightly out of time. Our parents had always warned us that very few bands get signed and only a fraction of those ever make it, so watching us on Top of the Pops must have been quite a moment for them.</p> <p>\u2022 Teenage Wildlife: 25 Years of Ash is out now on BMG. The band are <a href=\"https://ash-official.com/\">touring the UK</a> from 17-27 March. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Tim Wheeler, singer, guitarist, songwriter Mark Hamilton and I both got guitars for Christmas when we were 12. We formed a terrible heavy metal band called Vietnam, and then started Ash with Rick [McMurray} when we were 15. I wrote Girl from Mars in my bedroom at my parents\u2019 house when I was 17. I think there was a bit of Mars hanging over us. I was listening to Pixies, who were sci-fi obsessed. My sister is 18 years older than me and was a David Bowie fan in her teens. Our rehearsal room had been her den, and she\u2019d written Life on Mars in huge letters on the wall. I think I also saw a film called Girl from Mars, or something, in a TV listing magazine. It was on at 4am so I never watched it, but I made my own story for the song. I\u2019d broken up with my first girlfriend, which was very intense, first love. I\u2019d always been a happy child but for the first time was experiencing teenage angst, which I poured into the song. Aged 17, I was already nostalgic for those happier times. The previous summer, I\u2019d gone on a family holiday to France. We met a bunch of cool kids and hung out on the beach, smoking cigars, which is where the line about \u201cHenri Winterman cigars\u201d comes from. The first demo I did on my own sounds very much like a Teenage Fanclub song, mid tempo and jangly. When we played it as a band, we sped it up and it became more like the Buzzcocks. Live, it got a reaction straight away. After our manager discovered us and we signed to Infectious Records, they put us in the studio to record a mini-album, but specifically instructed us to not record Girl from Mars. They knew it had the potential to be a hit and wanted to hold it back until we\u2019d left school and could promote it properly. We eventually recorded it in Rockfield Studios in Monmouth with producer Owen Morris when he had a break from working on the Verve\u2019s A Northern Soul. But the label and management thought we hadn\u2019t got it quite right, so we went back in to finish it with Phil Thornalley, who\u2019d been in the Cure and produced Torn for Natalie Imbruglia. I was finishing my A-levels when I first heard Girl from Mars on the radio. Then two days later we were playing Glastonbury. It\u2019s been on the setlist for every gig we\u2019ve done ever since. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d let us out of venues if we didn\u2019t play it. Rick McMurray, drummer I\u2019d seen Tim and Mark playing in Vietnam at school. The singer walked off stage during the gig, so Tim had to take over on vocals. I was the year above Tim and we got talking during the school play, and he suggested I go round for a jam. By the second rehearsal, they\u2019d kicked the other guys out of the group so it was just Tim, Mark and me. Then everything just snowballed. We were full of energy, teenage hormones, and the excitement of being in a band. When we first went into the studio, getting a successful take meant just getting to the end of the song without anyone stopping. By the time we did Girl from Mars, we\u2019d probably recorded 10 or 12 songs, but that one took us to another level. It was very catchy and commercial. Recording with Owen Morris was bonkers. When we did Angel Interceptor I had my first ecstasy experience. You can hear me at the end hollering: \u201cWhooo! Yeah, we\u2019ve got it!\u201d For Girl from Mars, the day started in the pub and then Owen went: \u201cRight, let\u2019s go to a charity shop and get some women\u2019s clothes!\u201d We thought: \u201cThis is what bands do.\u201d And we definitely got on board with the idea, which was kind of fun. It was like we were wearing our grannies\u2019 clothes. It certainly broke the anxiety of being a young band in the studio. We did a really iconic video with \u2018Sleazy\u2019 Christopherson from Throbbing Gristle, on a freezing cold beach in Camber Sands in East Sussex, but then they made us do another one for the US MTV, which I have no recollection of whatsoever. Tim did a live vocal on Top of the Pops. I put lino on my drums to quieten them, and was playing very slightly out of time. Our parents had always warned us that very few bands get signed and only a fraction of those ever make it, so watching us on Top of the Pops must have been quite a moment for them. \u2022 Teenage Wildlife: 25 Years of Ash is out now on BMG. The band are touring the UK from 17-27 March.",

      "bodyText": "Blasts have been reported in Kabul as Afghanistan\u2019s two leading presidential candidates held separate swearing-in ceremonies after both claimed to have won last year\u2019s elections. The incumbent Ashraf Ghani took his oath of office at the country\u2019s presidential palace in Kabul in a ceremony on Monday attended by foreign diplomats including the US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. At about the same time, Ghani\u2019s rival Abdullah Abdullah was holding his own inauguration ceremony despite negotiations late into the night on Sunday in an attempt to find a compromise between the rivals. Television stations in the country broadcast the two ceremonies side by side. A spokesman for the president\u2019s office said nobody was hurt in the explosions on Monday. It was not immediately clear where they had taken place. Islamic State claimed responsibility. As the blasts were heard during Ghani\u2019s ceremony, he opened his jacket and showed his shirt to the crowd. \u201cThis is not a shield, it\u2019s just clothes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is sacrificed to the Afghan people. The head [of the country] is ready to sacrifice for Afghanistan.\u201d Fears of Taliban attacks, as well as widespread disillusionment contributed to a record-low turnout of Afghans for the elections on 28 September, with Ghani, 70, declared the winner with 50.62% of the vote in February. But amid a voting process marred by incomplete voter lists, issues with a biometric identification system aimed at curbing fraud and reports of hostile election workers, Abdullah rejected the result and said he would form his own government. Abdullah, 59, said during his ceremony that if he accepted Ghani\u2019s purported victory it would \u201cbe the end of democracy in Afghanistan\u201d and called for renewed talks to break the impasse. Kai Eide, a former UN special representative in the country, tweeted: \u201cTerribly sad and dangerous. Two parallel ceremonies. This simply cannot continue. Strong unity is required, not destructive rivalries.\u201d Afghanistan\u2019s election commission in February said it counted 1.82m votes and discarded nearly 1m. There are about 9.6 million registered voters in the country. The dispute threatens to leave the internationally recognised Afghan government weak and divided after the signing last week of a US agreement with the Taliban that aims to facilitate the withdrawal of most foreign troops from the country. The Kabul government was shut out of the negotiations by the Taliban, which says it will hold separate talks with its representatives. Analysts said the political dispute is likely to delay the start of the intra-Afghan talks. Abdullah and Ghani competed against each other in presidential elections in 2014 with similar disputed results. The disagreement led to the creation of a \u201cchief executive\u201d position for Abdullah, an extra-constitutional advisory role aimed at warding off instability.

This cosmopolitan port of Greeks, Syrians, Italians, Jews and Arabs, a truly diverse place where there is very little homogeny. Cavafy haunts the narrative ...</p> </blockquote> <p>Fear is the Key has been a fine introduction to Alistair MacLean for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10840870\">beerbart</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I must say I was very impressed particularly with the way he structured the plot and kept the key twist from becoming too obvious until the last 30 pages. I was also surprised by the dialogue which contained more than a few Chandler-esque similes that actually came off.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kaaron Warren\u2019s most recent novella Into Bones Like Oil, \u201ca really interesting take on the ghost story\u201d, has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dora is grieving after a tragedy for which she blames herself. In an attempt to come to terms with her depression she checks into the Angelsea, a dilapidated, dirty and cramped rooming house in a nameless waterfront town. Warren creates a lot in less than 100 pages. She sets a dreamlike and bleak scene with a creeping sense of dread \u2026 There\u2019s a frustration though, a rare one these days, and that it\u2019s too short, Dora\u2019s character feels under-explored, and it\u2019s difficult to identify and understand her situation. I remain convinced the novella is the best form for ghost stories though \u2026 Warren is one to watch.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2238842\">FrogC</a> is reading Joan Wyndham\u2019s Love Lessons:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The diary of a teenage girl in Chelsea during the early years of the second world war. She is very funny and observant, a natural diarist like Pepys and Kilvert, who always finds something interesting to say about everything that happens to her. Brought up by a devout Catholic mother and the mother\u2019s even more devout woman companion, she nevertheless manages to have a fair degree of independence at an early age, and decides, though not very seriously, to become an artist. She rents a studio and takes lessons from Henry Moore, but it\u2019s mostly an excuse for the other lessons of the title: a series of flirtations, and one more committed relationship, with other bohemians and would-be artists, while the bombs drop all around them.</p> <p>Joan\u2019s exploration of sex, at once bold and innocent, is delightful. A wonderfully entertaining book, which was not published till the 1980s, followed by two sequels. I can\u2019t help wondering if it influenced Helen Fielding\u2019s Bridget Jones books, eg, Joan\u2019s habit of writing things like: \u201cI am v. worried about Rupert.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Toffee by Sarah Crossan \u201cis a YA novel which is stunningly good,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13340763\">storm46</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Allison, 16, has run away from home because of continued abuse and violence by her father. She ends up living secretly with Marla who has dementia. Sounds depressing? Well, it isn\u2019t, ultimately. The book is set out like poetry in very short sections, sometimes just a few lines. (I would quote but I have already passed the book on.) It is lyrical while at the same time dealing with serious issues but wears its seriousness lightly and with humour. Really impressive, touching, moving, full of heart.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI have just finished Verily Anderson\u2019s autobiographical Spam Tomorrow,\u201d writes <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16037784\">dihuet</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It includes a memoir of life in London during the Blitz, from the viewpoint of the mother of a young family - often amusing and light-hearted but also grim at times.

Certainly a well-written record of the details of a young woman\u2019s life, getting married and starting a family in wartime. I had never read anything quite like it and was fascinated.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2565880\">RickLondon </a>has finished Will Carver\u2019s Nothing Important Happened Today:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a very original novel, somewhere in between crime and dystopian fiction.

      "body": "<p>Who hasn\u2019t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention \u2013 whether it\u2019s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.</p> <p>Driver distraction is a major cause of road traffic accidents. According to the UK\u2019s Department for Transport, driver or rider error or reaction (failing to look properly, loss of control and poor manoeuvring) was cited as a contributory factor in <a href=\"https://www.racfoundation.org/motoring-faqs/safety\" rel=\"nofollow\">63% of fatalities in reported road accidents in 2018</a>.</p> <p>This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it\u2019s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it\u2019s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/safe-is-the-new-bold/2020/jan/31/back-to-the-future-why-are-we-opting-for-nostalgic-pop-culture\">Back to the future: why are we opting for nostalgic pop culture?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. \u201cADAS has been a step change,\u201d says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University\u2019s Transport Safety Research Centre. \u201cThere was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.\u201d</p> <p>Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its \u201csecond pair of eyes\u201d, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.</p> <p>Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Pre-collision braking</strong>, which flashes a warning on the dashboard and sounds an alert to make the driver aware of a potential collision, automatically hitting the brakes if you don\u2019t take evasive action.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Pre-collision throttle management</strong>, which warns you if you accidentally select drive instead of reverse, when parked facing an obstacle.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Adaptive cruise control</strong>, which allows you to set vehicle speed and distance from the vehicle in front.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lane departure and sway warning</strong>, which notifies you if you leave a lane without indicating.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lane keep assist</strong>, which gently steers you back into your lane if you don\u2019t correct.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Lead vehicle start alert</strong>, which warns you if the car ahead moves off and you don\u2019t.</p></li> </ul> <p>In two 2018 pan-European safety-focused surveys of European Subaru drivers with EyeSight-equipped models (a total of 3,440 owners), 31% said EyeSight had already prevented accidents and 94% said they felt safer when driving thanks to the technology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7d543453b39b7fc86f52cfa9bd440c0221568e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7d543453b39b7fc86f52cfa9bd440c0221568e7/0_0_1143_960/1000.png\" alt=\"Quote: \"It's about cars that can take control when you have lost it\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"840\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As with all the company\u2019s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.</p> <p>EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared \u201cBest in Class 2019 in the Small Off-road/MPV Class\u201d.</p> <p>Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver\u2019s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru\u2019s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it \u201cthe most advanced of its kind\u201d. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.</p> <p>Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.</p> <p>The efficacy of these kinds of active safety systems across the car industry is backed up by research from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which estimates that ADAS systems helped to drive down the number of road accidents in the UK by <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/uk-road-accidents-down-10-past-five-years-thanks-new-safety-tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">10% over a five year period</a>.</p> <p>While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation \u2013 like the law banning handling a mobile phone \u2013 can only go so far.</p> <p>\u201cDistraction can be seen as the inherent demand of the task and [also] the motivation to engage with it. Car manufacturers can deal with the first but not the second, which is the property of the individual,\u201d explains Prof Gary Burnett, chair of transport human factors, Human Factors Research Group at Nottingham University. \u201cYou can\u2019t eliminate distraction completely but moderating behaviour through sensible design has to be a sensible way forward. It\u2019s about minimising it by exploiting further technological refinements in the shape of features like effective heads-up displays and efficient voice recognition and activation systems. There will always be distraction in a car, there are always external demands on the driver and it\u2019s impossible to eliminate them until cars are wholly autonomous.\u201d</p> <p>Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/27/all-new-uk-cars-to-have-speed-limiters-by-2022-under-eu-plans\">new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law</a> and are likely to be adopted in the UK \u2013 specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed \u201cVision Zero\u201d, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.</p> <p>But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,\u201d admits Morris. \u201cHowever it\u2019s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Safety matters<br></strong>Your world matters to us.

Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention \u2013 whether it\u2019s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts. Driver distraction is a major cause of road traffic accidents. According to the UK\u2019s Department for Transport, driver or rider error or reaction (failing to look properly, loss of control and poor manoeuvring) was cited as a contributory factor in 63% of fatalities in reported road accidents in 2018. This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it\u2019s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it\u2019s about cars that can take control when you have lost it. The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. \u201cADAS has been a step change,\u201d says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University\u2019s Transport Safety Research Centre. \u201cThere was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.\u201d Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its \u201csecond pair of eyes\u201d, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians. Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS: Pre-collision braking, which flashes a warning on the dashboard and sounds an alert to make the driver aware of a potential collision, automatically hitting the brakes if you don\u2019t take evasive action. Pre-collision throttle management, which warns you if you accidentally select drive instead of reverse, when parked facing an obstacle. Adaptive cruise control, which allows you to set vehicle speed and distance from the vehicle in front. Lane departure and sway warning, which notifies you if you leave a lane without indicating. Lane keep assist, which gently steers you back into your lane if you don\u2019t correct. Lead vehicle start alert, which warns you if the car ahead moves off and you don\u2019t. In two 2018 pan-European safety-focused surveys of European Subaru drivers with EyeSight-equipped models (a total of 3,440 owners), 31% said EyeSight had already prevented accidents and 94% said they felt safer when driving thanks to the technology. As with all the company\u2019s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly. EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared \u201cBest in Class 2019 in the Small Off-road/MPV Class\u201d. Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver\u2019s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru\u2019s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it \u201cthe most advanced of its kind\u201d. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems. Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision. The efficacy of these kinds of active safety systems across the car industry is backed up by research from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which estimates that ADAS systems helped to drive down the number of road accidents in the UK by 10% over a five year period. While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation \u2013 like the law banning handling a mobile phone \u2013 can only go so far. \u201cDistraction can be seen as the inherent demand of the task and [also] the motivation to engage with it. Car manufacturers can deal with the first but not the second, which is the property of the individual,\u201d explains Prof Gary Burnett, chair of transport human factors, Human Factors Research Group at Nottingham University. \u201cYou can\u2019t eliminate distraction completely but moderating behaviour through sensible design has to be a sensible way forward. It\u2019s about minimising it by exploiting further technological refinements in the shape of features like effective heads-up displays and efficient voice recognition and activation systems. There will always be distraction in a car, there are always external demands on the driver and it\u2019s impossible to eliminate them until cars are wholly autonomous.\u201d Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK \u2013 specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed \u201cVision Zero\u201d, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries. But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology? \u201cIt\u2019s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,\u201d admits Morris. \u201cHowever it\u2019s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.\u201d Safety matters Your world matters to us. It\u2019s why we build every Subaru with you in mind, offering the very best protection for you and your family with our award-winning safety credentials. See what sets Subaru apart at subaru.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s something brilliantly bonkers about Betis, the football club that melodrama makes its own, and Sunday night was them distilled into 90 minutes. Or maybe even in just the two seconds it took for manager Joan Francesc Ferrer \u2013 aka Rubi \u2013 to watch another rescue start to unfold, living out another life on the edge. Standing alongside the pitch five minutes before half-time, he appealed for one penalty, appealed for another and only stopped because he then got something even better. Suddenly, the ball was tearing through the air, through his protests and into the net, noise engulfing everyone. Fifty metres away Sidnei was clambering on to the advertising boards at the south end, helped up and held there by Marc Bartra, Emerson and Joaqu\u00edn, arms wide. Betis were 1-0 up against Real Madrid and 51,521 fans were going mad.</p> \n<p>It had all happened so fast that Rubi never had time to lower his arms. Instead, they remained outstretched, the accelerated emotional journey played out in hand signals. As the ball went into the box, there had been the hint of a handball, Rubi\u2019s arms shooting skywards. Then it had dropped and Sergio Ramos had gone after it, bundling Nabil Fekir to the floor, Rubi opening his palms. On the grass Fekir appealed too, Ramos on top of him, but the referee didn\u2019t even have time to give it. The ball ran free, momentarily Thibaut Courtois straightened and Casemiro slowed, and before any of them could react Sidnei had smashed it into the net, Fekir still appealing when the place erupted. Rubi\u2019s palms closing into a claw as everyone leapt from the bench. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/09/paulo-dybala-dazzles-empty-stands-coronavirus-fans-stay-home-juventus-internazionale-serie-a\">Dybala dazzles before empty stands as coronavirus forces fans to stay home | Nicky Bandini</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was silly and it had only just started. Madrid arrived in Seville off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/01/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">the cl\u00e1sico victory</a>, favourites to win the league, and knowing a win would put them top. Betis came having not won in six against Valencia, Mallorca, Legan\u00e9s, Barcelona, Eibar and Getafe, just five points from the relegation zone, and with the fans were calling for the board to resign. As for Rubi, he was on the edge of the abyss, the sporting director not exactly offering a resounding vote of confidence. \u201cNo one is irreplaceable,\u201d Alexis Trujillo had insisted. \u201cAnd if what happens happens, we\u2019ll have no problem re-evaluating the manager\u2019s position\u201d.</p> \n<p>Rubi had been here before. In October, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/oct/31/nabil-fekir-rubi-and-a-picture-that-sums-up-sport-real-betis-celta-vigo-la-liga-sid-lowe\">90th minute goal summed up sport</a> and rescued him against Celta after four games without a win. In November, a 93rd-minute goal from Sergio Canales saw them defeat Valencia, pulling him back from the edge once more. And now, they were leading against Madrid. An hour later, they had beaten Zinedine Zidane\u2019s team 2-1, Karim Benzema equalising Sidnei\u2019s thunderous shot just before half time only for Cristian Tello to race clear and score the winner on 82, securing a victory they desperately needed \u2013 and at a time they most needed it, with their manager on edge and the Seville derby next week. \u201cA shot of adrenaline,\u201d Rubi called it. He had been revived again.</p> \n<p>In the buildup to this game, one paper had described Rubi as escaping certain death twice before, as if he was \u201cJames Bond\u201d. Madrid left that laser there creeping towards its crotch when they could have just pulled a trigger. Betis\u2019s apparent nervousness had not been seized upon by a team seemingly complacent, too sure of its superiority. But Ramos\u2019s judgment at full time \u2013 the \u201cresult is fair\u201d \u2013 was not just about Madrid; it was about Betis too. \u201cWe lacked energy, play, possession, aggression, a bit of everything,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said. \u201cThis was our worst game this season.\u201d For Betis, it was one of the best, nervy to start with but breathless and brilliant at times. Nervy at the end too, fans desperately whistling for the referee to blow the final whistle, watching Vinicius shoot over on 93:51 and Benzema flash a shot just wide on 94:47 and ending the night exhausted, their hearts still racing. \u201cThis is the best night since I have been here,\u201d Rubi said at the end. \u201cFootball has not always been fair to us, but we deserved this.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98036f5979c50806c6f4923e6b0f7e17d94d2bc0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98036f5979c50806c6f4923e6b0f7e17d94d2bc0/482_438_3946_2368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Real Madrid\u2019s Karim Benzema sees the ball evade him after a tussle with Real Betis\u2019 Emerson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real Madrid\u2019s Karim Benzema sees the ball evade him after a tussle with Real Betis\u2019 Emerson.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Morenatti/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He was right. When Sidnei scored that absurd opener, Fekir had already drawn one superb save from Courtois, while Bartra had headed over from five yards. Madrid had only drawn level because Sidnei had connected almost as well with Marcelo as he had with the ball, sending the Brazilian into the air and gifting Madrid a penalty from which Benzema levelled. By the end, they had racked up 14 shots. The only surprise was that they had scored just two of them. Well, that and the fact that it did not slip through their hands at the death. They had been on edge to the last, but they had got through \u2013 a reminder of why they shouldn\u2019t be so far down the table and also why they are. \u201cWith so many creative players, it\u2019s not easy for them to focus on other aspects,\u201d Rubi had admitted.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s something brilliantly bonkers about Betis, the football club that melodrama makes its own, and Sunday night was them distilled into 90 minutes. Or maybe even in just the two seconds it took for manager Joan Francesc Ferrer \u2013 aka Rubi \u2013 to watch another rescue start to unfold, living out another life on the edge. Standing alongside the pitch five minutes before half-time, he appealed for one penalty, appealed for another and only stopped because he then got something even better. Suddenly, the ball was tearing through the air, through his protests and into the net, noise engulfing everyone. Fifty metres away Sidnei was clambering on to the advertising boards at the south end, helped up and held there by Marc Bartra, Emerson and Joaqu\u00edn, arms wide. Betis were 1-0 up against Real Madrid and 51,521 fans were going mad. It had all happened so fast that Rubi never had time to lower his arms. Instead, they remained outstretched, the accelerated emotional journey played out in hand signals. As the ball went into the box, there had been the hint of a handball, Rubi\u2019s arms shooting skywards. Then it had dropped and Sergio Ramos had gone after it, bundling Nabil Fekir to the floor, Rubi opening his palms. On the grass Fekir appealed too, Ramos on top of him, but the referee didn\u2019t even have time to give it. The ball ran free, momentarily Thibaut Courtois straightened and Casemiro slowed, and before any of them could react Sidnei had smashed it into the net, Fekir still appealing when the place erupted. Rubi\u2019s palms closing into a claw as everyone leapt from the bench. This was silly and it had only just started. Madrid arrived in Seville off the cl\u00e1sico victory, favourites to win the league, and knowing a win would put them top. Betis came having not won in six against Valencia, Mallorca, Legan\u00e9s, Barcelona, Eibar and Getafe, just five points from the relegation zone, and with the fans were calling for the board to resign. As for Rubi, he was on the edge of the abyss, the sporting director not exactly offering a resounding vote of confidence. \u201cNo one is irreplaceable,\u201d Alexis Trujillo had insisted. \u201cAnd if what happens happens, we\u2019ll have no problem re-evaluating the manager\u2019s position\u201d. Rubi had been here before. In October, a 90th minute goal summed up sport and rescued him against Celta after four games without a win. In November, a 93rd-minute goal from Sergio Canales saw them defeat Valencia, pulling him back from the edge once more. And now, they were leading against Madrid. An hour later, they had beaten Zinedine Zidane\u2019s team 2-1, Karim Benzema equalising Sidnei\u2019s thunderous shot just before half time only for Cristian Tello to race clear and score the winner on 82, securing a victory they desperately needed \u2013 and at a time they most needed it, with their manager on edge and the Seville derby next week. \u201cA shot of adrenaline,\u201d Rubi called it. He had been revived again. In the buildup to this game, one paper had described Rubi as escaping certain death twice before, as if he was \u201cJames Bond\u201d. Madrid left that laser there creeping towards its crotch when they could have just pulled a trigger. Betis\u2019s apparent nervousness had not been seized upon by a team seemingly complacent, too sure of its superiority. But Ramos\u2019s judgment at full time \u2013 the \u201cresult is fair\u201d \u2013 was not just about Madrid; it was about Betis too. \u201cWe lacked energy, play, possession, aggression, a bit of everything,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said. \u201cThis was our worst game this season.\u201d For Betis, it was one of the best, nervy to start with but breathless and brilliant at times. Nervy at the end too, fans desperately whistling for the referee to blow the final whistle, watching Vinicius shoot over on 93:51 and Benzema flash a shot just wide on 94:47 and ending the night exhausted, their hearts still racing. \u201cThis is the best night since I have been here,\u201d Rubi said at the end. \u201cFootball has not always been fair to us, but we deserved this.\u201d He was right. When Sidnei scored that absurd opener, Fekir had already drawn one superb save from Courtois, while Bartra had headed over from five yards. Madrid had only drawn level because Sidnei had connected almost as well with Marcelo as he had with the ball, sending the Brazilian into the air and gifting Madrid a penalty from which Benzema levelled. By the end, they had racked up 14 shots. The only surprise was that they had scored just two of them. Well, that and the fact that it did not slip through their hands at the death. They had been on edge to the last, but they had got through \u2013 a reminder of why they shouldn\u2019t be so far down the table and also why they are. \u201cWith so many creative players, it\u2019s not easy for them to focus on other aspects,\u201d Rubi had admitted. It is easier for it to be fun, though, as Sunday proved. This is the club where, while it might be a myth and while every team is special and every fan\u2019s feelings deep, emotion is embraced and externalised most \u2013 for better and worse, \u2019til death do us part. Or \u2019til it doesn\u2019t: one fan famously kept taking his dad long after he passed away, going to the ground weekly with a milk carton full of ashes. It\u2019s the place where they like to think funny goes with the football and fun definitely does, where it feels right that their captain is Joaqu\u00edn, the cheeky scamp with a glint in his eye and magic in his boots, playing better than he ever has before at 38. Here, Joaqu\u00edn, who became the player with the third most appearances in the entire history of La Liga, went around the goalkeeper and inexplicably missed. Fekir took Madrid to bits, much as he had done to Barcelona, his passing and running mind-bending at times. One run past \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o was impossibly brilliant and ended, 60 or 70 yards later, with a Andr\u00e9s Guardado volley that spun just past the crossbar.

Of course the virus hasn\u2019t struck everywhere in the same way \u2013 or not yet \u2013 so the responses are bound to vary. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person to be less than impressed by how weak and distant EU institutions feel at this moment.</p> <p>Sure, their powers may be limited in terms of a collective public health policy, but when I last looked at the European commission\u2019s website it was hard to find an easy-to-grasp, up-to-date and pragmatic description of the measures taken in each of the member states. Surely that kind of overall picture would be useful.</p> <p>At the same time, there\u2019s a strange sense of togetherness, as if we were experiencing a new need to connect in an era of looming lockdowns, and it\u2019s happening on a continental scale, not just within the EU. People of different nationalities and different cities, from Copenhagen to Zagreb, from Kyiv to Amsterdam, are asking each other, online and off, about the situation in their patch, how people are coping, what\u2019s to be expected.</p> <p>A friend living in Sweden told me people had been in denial there before more than 200 cases of coronavirus were detected. It\u2019s possible much of the continent is still in denial, in particular the most eastern parts. Indeed how credible is it that Russia should be virtually spared (only a dozen or so cases officially reported) when its contacts with China are so vast? It\u2019s probable we will soon be reflecting obsessively on the differences between our national health services. Will the continent\u2019s east-west rift get worse when it becomes even more obvious how badly some central European hospitals have suffered from the brain drain of doctors and the resulting lack of resources?</p> <p>To be sure, there is much confusion \u2013 and the difficulty of finding comprehensive, easily accessible, reliable information about the situation across the entire continent, not just in one\u2019s own country, bodes ill for how we might collectively tackle this pandemic. Far-right and other conspiracy theory networks are already busy spreading their nonsense.</p> <p>Coronavirus has created a moment of reckoning for Europeans. It is bringing a new awareness of how we live: the centrality of our public squares and spaces; the vitality of cafe life; and how highly urbanised we are as a continent. It also brings a new awareness of the principles of free movement of people, our endless forums, cultural gatherings and festivals, our crisscrossing of students, workers, creators, and of course, how we traditionally greet each other, including in many countries by kissing repeatedly on the cheek.</p> <p>This awareness has nothing to do with EU treaties or the single market (again, coronavirus cares little for EU membership). We\u2019re discovering how precious it is to have the freedom to meet without worrying about anything, the lightness of being that comes from connecting across all our diversity, and the sheer usefulness of knowing more about how each other\u2019s societies work.</p> <p>But most of all, it\u2019s reminding us of the centrality of the individual. Because fighting coronavirus is, at the end of the day, about the gestures each of us chooses to follow or not \u2013 the precautions we are individually responsible for. Across a continent where group identity and nationally closeted mindsets have taken such a toll, we find ourselves, not unlike many of the characters in Camus\u2019s novel (now back in the bestsellers list, apparently), having to embrace anew the absolute, insurpassable, irreplaceable value of the individual. We\u2019ve stopped shaking hands, but perhaps we\u2019re rediscovering something important we had lost touch with.</p> <p>\u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de is a Guardian columnist<br></p> <p><br></p>",

Of course the virus hasn\u2019t struck everywhere in the same way \u2013 or not yet \u2013 so the responses are bound to vary. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only person to be less than impressed by how weak and distant EU institutions feel at this moment. Sure, their powers may be limited in terms of a collective public health policy, but when I last looked at the European commission\u2019s website it was hard to find an easy-to-grasp, up-to-date and pragmatic description of the measures taken in each of the member states. Surely that kind of overall picture would be useful. At the same time, there\u2019s a strange sense of togetherness, as if we were experiencing a new need to connect in an era of looming lockdowns, and it\u2019s happening on a continental scale, not just within the EU. People of different nationalities and different cities, from Copenhagen to Zagreb, from Kyiv to Amsterdam, are asking each other, online and off, about the situation in their patch, how people are coping, what\u2019s to be expected. A friend living in Sweden told me people had been in denial there before more than 200 cases of coronavirus were detected. It\u2019s possible much of the continent is still in denial, in particular the most eastern parts. Indeed how credible is it that Russia should be virtually spared (only a dozen or so cases officially reported) when its contacts with China are so vast? It\u2019s probable we will soon be reflecting obsessively on the differences between our national health services. Will the continent\u2019s east-west rift get worse when it becomes even more obvious how badly some central European hospitals have suffered from the brain drain of doctors and the resulting lack of resources? To be sure, there is much confusion \u2013 and the difficulty of finding comprehensive, easily accessible, reliable information about the situation across the entire continent, not just in one\u2019s own country, bodes ill for how we might collectively tackle this pandemic. Far-right and other conspiracy theory networks are already busy spreading their nonsense. Coronavirus has created a moment of reckoning for Europeans. It is bringing a new awareness of how we live: the centrality of our public squares and spaces; the vitality of cafe life; and how highly urbanised we are as a continent. It also brings a new awareness of the principles of free movement of people, our endless forums, cultural gatherings and festivals, our crisscrossing of students, workers, creators, and of course, how we traditionally greet each other, including in many countries by kissing repeatedly on the cheek. This awareness has nothing to do with EU treaties or the single market (again, coronavirus cares little for EU membership). We\u2019re discovering how precious it is to have the freedom to meet without worrying about anything, the lightness of being that comes from connecting across all our diversity, and the sheer usefulness of knowing more about how each other\u2019s societies work. But most of all, it\u2019s reminding us of the centrality of the individual. Because fighting coronavirus is, at the end of the day, about the gestures each of us chooses to follow or not \u2013 the precautions we are individually responsible for. Across a continent where group identity and nationally closeted mindsets have taken such a toll, we find ourselves, not unlike many of the characters in Camus\u2019s novel (now back in the bestsellers list, apparently), having to embrace anew the absolute, insurpassable, irreplaceable value of the individual. We\u2019ve stopped shaking hands, but perhaps we\u2019re rediscovering something important we had lost touch with. \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de is a Guardian columnist",

Disney came to Trinidad and Tobago in search of talent just as Charles was graduating from high school and presented the opportunity for her to play a character she had long admired from her youth.</p> <p>\u201cI remember seeing Heather Headley perform Shadowland on David Letterman. She did it so amazingly and it really pulled on my heartstrings,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe way she portrayed Nala \u2013 from the music written, the way her pride of lionesses were fading away and stepping into the background as she was being blessed \u2013 it gives me chills whenever I think about it and perform it every night.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I wanted to do as a performer is connect with people on an emotional level and that certainly did it for me,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I thought if I could play Nala, that would be a dream come true.\u201d</p> <p>Charles joined The Lion King musical in 2016, taking on the role of Nala \u2013 a rambunctious cub who grows into a courageous, loyal lioness living under tyranny and journeying far from home to find food and prosperity for the Pridelands.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I love about Nala is the fact that she\u2019s a huntress and it\u2019s really empowering thinking of a female character as that kind of role model,\u201d says Charles.</p> <p>\u201cAlso, when I play Nala in the second act, she finds Simba in the wilderness and initially he almost rejects her, but Nala doesn\u2019t let that faze her.</p> <p>\u201cShe left her home on a mission to find some kind of saving grace for her pride because that\u2019s what she cared about and, as a woman in a foreign country, it\u2019s really empowering to recognise that in her and to be able to play that.\u201d</p> <p>The emotional and physical weight of the role is something Charles appreciates more as she takes it on each night, but the process of becoming one of the lead actors of this large-scale production goes far beyond taking to the stage at the Lyceum Theatre.</p> <p>\u201cA typical day for me usually consists of hitting the gym, doing different strength and flexibility workouts, plyometrics, or taking dance classes,\u201d says Charles. \u201cI then go to vocal lessons to improve my technique.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c445e69e96ce2a5bba9120d7dea9e41305143b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c445e69e96ce2a5bba9120d7dea9e41305143b6/0_0_5500_3667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the Scenes.

However, Charles does have a slight advantage that provides her with more preparation time.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great about my character is that she starts in the second act, as Nala is initially portrayed as a young cub and a different actor.

      "bodyText": "As a young child living in Trinidad and Tobago, Janique Charles\u2019s first memory of The Lion King was watching the 1994 animated movie on VHS. In the company of her aunt and little cousin, she became entranced by the visuals, storytelling and music, which has become instantly recognisable and a worldwide cultural phenomenon. \u201cI remember seeing this and thinking it\u2019s really painful watching Simba cry for the death of his dad,\u201d she recalls. \u201cEspecially with the music carrying the weight of it all. It\u2019s just very emotional and that scene has stuck with me ever since.\u201d As an avid lover of everything from Pocahontas to The Little Mermaid, this bright-eyed Trinidadian girl was awestruck by the world of Disney that unravelled before her, meshing songs, storytelling and even dance into one \u2013 something the Caribbean talent connected to as she grew older and fell in love with theatre. \u201cI took part in a school production of West Side Story and from then on, I thought this is definitely for me. \u201cI really fell in love with performing, singing, drama \u2013 songwriting as well,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough my mother wanted me to go down the more typical route in terms of academics, I was very passionate about it, so that\u2019s what brought me here today.\u201d Despite her mother\u2019s dreams of Charles attending the University of the West Indies, fate seemingly intervened. Disney came to Trinidad and Tobago in search of talent just as Charles was graduating from high school and presented the opportunity for her to play a character she had long admired from her youth. \u201cI remember seeing Heather Headley perform Shadowland on David Letterman. She did it so amazingly and it really pulled on my heartstrings,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way she portrayed Nala \u2013 from the music written, the way her pride of lionesses were fading away and stepping into the background as she was being blessed \u2013 it gives me chills whenever I think about it and perform it every night. \u201cWhat I wanted to do as a performer is connect with people on an emotional level and that certainly did it for me,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I thought if I could play Nala, that would be a dream come true.\u201d Charles joined The Lion King musical in 2016, taking on the role of Nala \u2013 a rambunctious cub who grows into a courageous, loyal lioness living under tyranny and journeying far from home to find food and prosperity for the Pridelands. \u201cWhat I love about Nala is the fact that she\u2019s a huntress and it\u2019s really empowering thinking of a female character as that kind of role model,\u201d says Charles. \u201cAlso, when I play Nala in the second act, she finds Simba in the wilderness and initially he almost rejects her, but Nala doesn\u2019t let that faze her. \u201cShe left her home on a mission to find some kind of saving grace for her pride because that\u2019s what she cared about and, as a woman in a foreign country, it\u2019s really empowering to recognise that in her and to be able to play that.\u201d The emotional and physical weight of the role is something Charles appreciates more as she takes it on each night, but the process of becoming one of the lead actors of this large-scale production goes far beyond taking to the stage at the Lyceum Theatre. \u201cA typical day for me usually consists of hitting the gym, doing different strength and flexibility workouts, plyometrics, or taking dance classes,\u201d says Charles. \u201cI then go to vocal lessons to improve my technique.\u201d As they prepare for the show ahead, the cast enter the Lyceum Theatre to do vocal warm-ups. \u201cAll the singers, dancers and principal actors gather around the piano to prepare ourselves vocally for the show. Then we\u2019ll have a physical warm-up, and people go off and do different things that\u2019ll help their bodies.\u201d Many actors will gather on the stage of the 2,100-seated theatre preparing physically and mentally for showtime. However, Charles does have a slight advantage that provides her with more preparation time. \u201cWhat\u2019s great about my character is that she starts in the second act, as Nala is initially portrayed as a young cub and a different actor. So during the first act, I\u2019m doing more of a warm-up for myself.\u201d As the show gets underway, Charles heads to the makeup room to transform into Nala, a process that takes around 40 minutes. This is followed by donning the iconic costume, including the notable mask that is placed above her head \u2013 the final element before she hits the stage. \u201cI still get nervous sometimes, but I\u2019ve definitely calmed down,\u201d she says. While this process is repeated night after night, Charles\u2019s highly active lifestyle makes room for variety. She writes music, does gymnastics classes and is also part of a group called Global Shapers, a network of young people driving dialogue and action to tackle social issues in the UK. Charles\u2019s personal beliefs, as someone who celebrates inclusivity, reflect those of The Lion King family \u2013 a production that features creatives of various nationalities and races \u2013 speaking to its intergenerational and diverse audience. \u201cOver the 20 years that The Lion King has been in London, loads of different people see it and continue to see it and I think it\u2019s because the essence of the story is the loss of a king, a father, a leader \u2013 a theme that people can relate to regardless of how old you are,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I think people relate to is the humanness of the show that just reminds us of where we\u2019ve come from and the things we\u2019ve experienced.\u201d The beauty and tragedy of The Lion King does ring true to many as a story of loss, guilt and self-discovery. Beyond the tantalising musical performances, enthralling stage design and intricate puppetry, the \u201ccircle of life\u201d is at its core and is reflected in a cast that has birthed new talent \u2013 taking them to new heights, as well as those who at one point or another moved on to new things. \u201cFor our 20th anniversary, we had some of the alumni come to see the show,\u201d says Charles. \u201cWhen we had a little afterparty, everyone\u2019s names were imprinted on this huge board. It was really beautiful to see people who have come through \u2013 and we\u2019ve loved and lost so many over the years but those people stay in our hearts,\u201d she says. \u201cYour name really does live on when you are in this company and that covers loads of different ethnicities, ages and backgrounds. It just connects us all so it\u2019s a really beautiful feeling.\u201d The Lion King is at the Lyceum Theatre, London, and on a nationwide tour. Learn more about the show at thelionking.co.uk",

Apparently, breeds that produce brown eggs are typically more aggressive to one another, so they are debeaked via an infrared amputation process that is thought to be very painful. White hens, by contrast, are quite civil, so there is less cruelty involved in the intensive harvesting of their issue.</p> <p>It feels a tiny bit as though farmers are repackaging their cruel beak-ectomies as the consumer\u2019s responsibility. It also, at the risk of being overemotional, sounds as though aggressiveness may not be innate to the brown-egg layers. It could just be the conditions they have to live in, on a busy production line, that may make them aggressive to the point of homicide and (apparently) cannibalism.</p> <p>Richard Jackson, the vice-president of the British Veterinary Poultry Association, has said: \u201cIt would be too much of a generalisation to say white-feathered hens are always docile.\u201d To put that a less diplomatic way, let\u2019s see how docile they are when it is their job to produce 11bn eggs a year, as opposed to the 45m white-egg layers lay.</p> <p>Nevertheless, this overwhelming preference of the British shopper is interesting. White eggs are actually quite hard to sell into supermarkets, so strongly do people lean towards brown, and get off-loaded instead into processors. The history of brown-egg dominance is dispiriting: nationally, we preferred white eggs until the 70s, when we switched to brown, believing them to be more natural, rustic and, crucially, healthier. This coincided almost exactly with the concept of brown bread as the health-food option, which was true, the Chorleywood process of speeding up fermentation and overprocessing white bread having been invented in 1965. So, en masse, we concluded that brown things were healthier than white things, a nonsensical position we have cleaved to.</p> <p>Studies have shown that chickens are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170110-despite-what-you-might-think-chickens-are-not-stupid\" title=\"\">highly intelligent</a>: they can count and have self-awareness. This on its own is enough reason to stop chopping their beaks off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers have been urged to reject brown eggs in favour of white eggs. Apparently, breeds that produce brown eggs are typically more aggressive to one another, so they are debeaked via an infrared amputation process that is thought to be very painful. White hens, by contrast, are quite civil, so there is less cruelty involved in the intensive harvesting of their issue. It feels a tiny bit as though farmers are repackaging their cruel beak-ectomies as the consumer\u2019s responsibility. It also, at the risk of being overemotional, sounds as though aggressiveness may not be innate to the brown-egg layers. It could just be the conditions they have to live in, on a busy production line, that may make them aggressive to the point of homicide and (apparently) cannibalism. Richard Jackson, the vice-president of the British Veterinary Poultry Association, has said: \u201cIt would be too much of a generalisation to say white-feathered hens are always docile.\u201d To put that a less diplomatic way, let\u2019s see how docile they are when it is their job to produce 11bn eggs a year, as opposed to the 45m white-egg layers lay. Nevertheless, this overwhelming preference of the British shopper is interesting. White eggs are actually quite hard to sell into supermarkets, so strongly do people lean towards brown, and get off-loaded instead into processors. The history of brown-egg dominance is dispiriting: nationally, we preferred white eggs until the 70s, when we switched to brown, believing them to be more natural, rustic and, crucially, healthier. This coincided almost exactly with the concept of brown bread as the health-food option, which was true, the Chorleywood process of speeding up fermentation and overprocessing white bread having been invented in 1965. So, en masse, we concluded that brown things were healthier than white things, a nonsensical position we have cleaved to. Studies have shown that chickens are highly intelligent: they can count and have self-awareness. This on its own is enough reason to stop chopping their beaks off.",

The news came amid reports of increasing nervousness among congressmen and women, most of whom travel regularly between Washington and their districts and many of whom are over the age of 50. Coronavirus is most dangerous to older sufferers and those with underlying health problems. \u201cMembers are very nervous,\u201d NBC News quoted a \u201csenior Democratic leadership aide\u201d as saying. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern that members could bring it home.\u201d The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the virus is mainly spread from person to person, in contact within about 6ft. Transmission may occur when \u201crespiratory droplets\u201d produced in coughs or sneezes land in the mouths or noses of nearby people. At least 21 people have died in the US and there have been more than 500 confirmed cases. According to the World Health Organization, there have been around 106,000 cases around the world, most in China, and around 3,500 deaths. Cruz said he had come into contact with the individual at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), at a conference center outside Washington DC. \u201cLast night, I was informed that 10 days ago at CPAC I briefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for Covid-19,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThat interaction consisted of a brief conversation and a handshake.\u201d Cruz said he was not experiencing symptoms and felt \u201cfine and healthy\u201d, adding that medical authorities had told him the odds of transmission \u201cwere extremely low\u201d. He will self-quarantine in his home until 14 days have passed since the interaction at CPAC. On Monday, the Capitol\u2019s attending physician\u2019s office said \u201cseveral\u201d members of Congress had had contact with the person but \u201cremain in good health\u201d. In a note to lawmakers, the office said the ill individual had recalled \u201cspecific names of people he had contact with during\u201d CPAC. \u201cSeveral of these individuals, members of the Congress, were identified and were contacted on the evening of 7 March,\u201d the note said. Their symptoms were reviewed and the individuals were considered to be at \u201clow risk\u201d, the statement said. It said all the lawmakers the physician\u2019s office was monitoring \u201cremain in good health\u201d. The Republican representative Paul Gosar announced that he and three members of his senior staff were under self-quarantine after coming in contact with the person who has what the Arizona rightwinger chose to call \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, after the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak. Gosar tweeted that he and his staff were showing no symptoms but were \u201cbeing proactive and cautious\u201d. The person who attended CPAC, whose name has not been released, is quarantined and under the care of medical professionals in New Jersey. The CPAC schedule listed three other senators and 12 House members who were scheduled to speak. They included the No 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana; No 3, Liz Cheney of Wyoming; and the congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, whom Donald Trump recently named White House chief of staff.

Nonetheless, Cheney did not attend a party gathering in Maryland over the weekend, after deciding \u201cto limit participation in non-essential gatherings\u201d. Also on the CPAC schedule was the transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, who is married to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. David Popp, spokesman for McConnell, said on Sunday evening no changes had been made in the chamber\u2019s schedule. McConnell had spoken with Cruz, Popp said. The Senate had a vote scheduled on Monday evening and planned to be in session this week. Congress is set for a one-week recess the week of 16 March. The American Conservative Union (ACU), the group that organizes CPAC, said in a statement the infected attendee had had no direct contact with Trump, who gave a speech at the conference, or Mike Pence, who was also in attendance. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the ACU, said he had had contact with the individual early in the conference. Later, Schlapp greeted the president, Pence and several administration officials. A picture shows Schlapp and Trump shaking hands. Schlapp told the Washington Post he regularly used hand sanitizer during the conference and had not shown symptoms. Experts say hand sanitizers with less than 60% alcohol do not prevent coronavirus transmission. Asked on Saturday if he was concerned that coronavirus would reach the White House, Trump said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not. We\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As coronavirus infections around the world rise, the number of new cases in China has plummeted dramatically, prompting some observers to look to Beijing for lessons.</p> \n<p>In recent days, the number of daily new cases in China has gone from almost 2,000 less than three weeks ago to under 100. On Monday, China\u2019s national health commission reported 40 new cases, its lowest daily since authorities began tracking the outbreak in January. According to the official figures, new infections in the rest of China, outside of Hubei province which has been hardest hit, have almost completely stopped.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s response to the virus has included strict social distancing, more than a month of city-wide lockdowns of Wuhan and surrounding areas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">extensive public monitoring of citizens</a>, as well as various methods of punishment and rewards to encourage adherence to such measures.</p> \n<p>The efforts have been praised by the World Health Organization, which concluded in a report last month that China\u2019s \u201cbold approach\u201d had \u201cchanged the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic\u201d. It added: \u201cIn the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/interactive-coronavirus-tracker\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Experts say that the single biggest contributing factor to China\u2019s containment of the virus has been the aggressive use of quarantines. In Wuhan, authorities converted stadiums and other facilities into mass quarantine centres and built more than a dozen temporary hospitals to house patients with less severe symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cUntil this year, the argument favoured those against such measures on the basis that it would cause too many other negative impacts to the affected society and economy,\u201d said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor focusing on health security at City University of Hong Kong. \u201cWhat we have seen in China does not fully counter those arguments but it does call for more nuance in the way we approach future outbreaks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Political analysts say that China\u2019s top leaders are likely to use any successful containment of the outbreak to trumpet its top-down system, which has become increasingly authoritarian under its president, Xi Jinping.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-map-cases-how-covid-19-is-spreading\">Coronavirus map: how Covid-19 is spreading across the world</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, some Chinese citizens believe that the same system that allowed for aggressive quarantining and mass surveillance was at fault, especially during the early stages of the outbreak, because it discouraged transparency and a speedy response at the regional level. Critics say that often over-the-top measures \u2013 exemplified in videos circulating online of citizens being tied to a pole or publicly humiliated for violating prevention measures \u2013 could have been avoided if the government had acted more quickly and been more transparent.</p> \n<p>Public health experts also caution that it is not the more draconian aspects of China\u2019s approach that deserve emulating. Bruce Aylward, who led a fact-finding mission to China last month, expressed caution over the release of the laudatory WHO report, saying most countries were not ready \u201cin mindset and materially\u201d to implement the same kind of measures used by China.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. <b>Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.</p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Aylward and the WHO said China\u2019s most effective measures were \u201cextremely proactive surveillance\u201d to detect cases, extensive testing and immediate isolation of patients, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts and an \u201cexceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance\u201d of such measures.</p> \n<p>Critics also doubt the reliability of official data from a government that has suppressed information about the virus, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">punishing those who attempted to warn others</a> about the mysterious Sars-like disease as early as December. Officials did not move to contain the virus until late January, weeks after it had first been detected.</p> \n<p>Chinese officials themselves are also wary of announcing victory too soon, especially as people return to work and provinces prepare to re-open schools. Chen Yixin, deputy head of the central government\u2019s steering committee on handling the outbreak, said on Sunday: \u201cWe cannot be blindly optimistic. We must stay vigilant.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As coronavirus infections around the world rise, the number of new cases in China has plummeted dramatically, prompting some observers to look to Beijing for lessons. In recent days, the number of daily new cases in China has gone from almost 2,000 less than three weeks ago to under 100. On Monday, China\u2019s national health commission reported 40 new cases, its lowest daily since authorities began tracking the outbreak in January. According to the official figures, new infections in the rest of China, outside of Hubei province which has been hardest hit, have almost completely stopped. China\u2019s response to the virus has included strict social distancing, more than a month of city-wide lockdowns of Wuhan and surrounding areas, extensive public monitoring of citizens, as well as various methods of punishment and rewards to encourage adherence to such measures. The efforts have been praised by the World Health Organization, which concluded in a report last month that China\u2019s \u201cbold approach\u201d had \u201cchanged the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic\u201d. It added: \u201cIn the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.\u201d Experts say that the single biggest contributing factor to China\u2019s containment of the virus has been the aggressive use of quarantines. In Wuhan, authorities converted stadiums and other facilities into mass quarantine centres and built more than a dozen temporary hospitals to house patients with less severe symptoms. \u201cUntil this year, the argument favoured those against such measures on the basis that it would cause too many other negative impacts to the affected society and economy,\u201d said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor focusing on health security at City University of Hong Kong. \u201cWhat we have seen in China does not fully counter those arguments but it does call for more nuance in the way we approach future outbreaks.\u201d Political analysts say that China\u2019s top leaders are likely to use any successful containment of the outbreak to trumpet its top-down system, which has become increasingly authoritarian under its president, Xi Jinping. However, some Chinese citizens believe that the same system that allowed for aggressive quarantining and mass surveillance was at fault, especially during the early stages of the outbreak, because it discouraged transparency and a speedy response at the regional level. Critics say that often over-the-top measures \u2013 exemplified in videos circulating online of citizens being tied to a pole or publicly humiliated for violating prevention measures \u2013 could have been avoided if the government had acted more quickly and been more transparent. Public health experts also caution that it is not the more draconian aspects of China\u2019s approach that deserve emulating. Bruce Aylward, who led a fact-finding mission to China last month, expressed caution over the release of the laudatory WHO report, saying most countries were not ready \u201cin mindset and materially\u201d to implement the same kind of measures used by China. Aylward and the WHO said China\u2019s most effective measures were \u201cextremely proactive surveillance\u201d to detect cases, extensive testing and immediate isolation of patients, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts and an \u201cexceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance\u201d of such measures. Critics also doubt the reliability of official data from a government that has suppressed information about the virus, including punishing those who attempted to warn others about the mysterious Sars-like disease as early as December. Officials did not move to contain the virus until late January, weeks after it had first been detected. Chinese officials themselves are also wary of announcing victory too soon, especially as people return to work and provinces prepare to re-open schools. Chen Yixin, deputy head of the central government\u2019s steering committee on handling the outbreak, said on Sunday: \u201cWe cannot be blindly optimistic. We must stay vigilant.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil price war has wiped billions of pounds from the market value of the industry\u2019s biggest companies after oil markets recorded one of the biggest price slumps in history. The decision of the world\u2019s largest oil-producing nation to increase its production even as the coronavirus outbreak stalls global oil demand triggered a 30% drop in oil prices on Monday morning. The oil price shock caused the UK oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and BP to lose more than \u00a332bn from their combined market value within minutes of the London Stock Exchange opening. The pair led the FTSE 100 to its sharpest fall since the global financial crisis in 2008 as the index tumbled by 8.3% amid deepening fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus. It was down 6.8% at noon. In early trade, Shell lost a fifth of its market value, while BP\u2019s shares plummeted by 27%, after the global benchmark oil price recorded its deepest fall since the Gulf war in 1991. Industry experts fear that a prolonged oil price war could force companies to rethink their dividends and spell bankruptcy for smaller commodity trading houses. By mid-morning, BP, which was valued at \u00a379.5bn on Friday, was worth \u00a363.6bn after its share price fell by about 20% to 322p a share. The value of Shell\u2019s London-listed shares fell by more than 13% to about \u00a313 a share, effectively wiping \u00a316.8bn from the company, which is now worth \u00a3108bn. On the FTSE 250, shares in Premier Oil plunged 51%, while Tullow Oil was down 26%. Oil companies face an uncertain year after the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, which has wiped out oil growth forecasts for the year and may cause oil demand to contract. Analysts at Redburn warned that a six-month price war could take a major toll on oil company earnings, potentially bringing an end to dividends in favour of paying investors in company shares instead. Shell and the US oil giant ExxonMobil are considered the most exposed to the market crash because they have high breakeven oil prices. Exxon requires oil prices of about $74 a barrel to cover its costs while Shell needs $65 a barrel to break even, the analysts said. BP is relatively stronger, thanks to a $53-a-barrel breakeven oil price. The impact of the coronavirus caused oil prices to tumble to a one-year low of below $50 a barrel last week, from almost $69 at the beginning of the year. However, Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to launch a price war against its oil rivals by ramping up oil production caused prices to collapse to $33 a barrel this morning. The Saudi price war could drive oil prices below $30 a barrel for the first time since the 2016 oil price crash, according to market experts at S&amp;P Global Platts. The Opec oil cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, had hoped to avert an oil market crash by cutting back oil production in line with falling demand. But talks collapsed on Friday after Russia refused to hold back its production.

I went to be supportive.\u201d It turns out it wasn\u2019t the only meeting her friend had in mind. \u201cShe told me I was about to meet a beautiful man and that I should give him a chance, despite his age.\u201d</p> <p>She was introduced to Brendan and sparks flew immediately. \u201cI had no idea there was a 20-year age difference when we started talking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019d dated older women before, so it wasn\u2019t something I would have noticed.\u201d Overwhelmed by the chemistry between them, Kate took a step back. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to start anything new and he was so much younger than me.\u201d</p> <p>Brendan watched her hobble away. \u201cOur mutual friend said I should chase her and I joked that it wouldn\u2019t be hard to catch her.\u201d</p> <p>For the next few months, they continued with their lives. Kate was based in Brooklyn and working as a writer of literary fiction, while Brendan spent the winter alone in a farmhouse in New Hampshire, writing poetry and planning his next career steps.

However, Kate still wasn\u2019t prepared to take him seriously, due to the age gap. \u201cI was wary of words like \u2018cougar\u2019 being thrown around if we dated.

The couple married in September 2016, after Kate\u2019s divorce came through. \u201cIt took a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cWe joke that we met two weeks after I split with my ex and married two weeks after the papers were signed.\u201d</p> <p>Kate loves her husband\u2019s intelligence and sense of humour. \u201cEven when I think he\u2019s dead wrong, he turns out to be right,\u201d she says. \u201cI love everything about him.

Mental health, the cost of healthcare, pollution and the climate crisis also featured heavily among workers surveyed in December, before the bushfire season hit its peak. \u201cAnecdotally, and obviously in the media and other areas, climate change, long-term planning, listening to experts \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of things that I think the horrific summer that we\u2019ve had have highlighted in the minds of society in general,\u201d Cannon-Brookes said. \u201cPeople in society [whose] house was confronted by a bushfire emergency, they\u2019re people that work in businesses. Businesses are collections of people; business leaders are people.\u201d In the US, workers were most concerned with the cost of healthcare, the highest in the developed world at almost 17% of gross domestic product. Access to healthcare, mental health and poverty were among US workers\u2019 top concerns, pushing environmental issues \u2013 including pollution and global heating \u2013 down the table. Cannon-Brookes has been outspoken calling for companies to take positions on economic and social issues. Grok Ventures, his and wife Annie\u2019s private investment vehicle, has supported shareholder resolutions put forward by the activist group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, designed to put pressure on BHP to quit the Minerals Council. Cannon-Brookes said other business leaders often told him they agreed with his positions on social and environmental issues but felt they could never go public. \u201cIf we could remove some of the hesitation, the fear, some of the sense that this is going to be a negative thing for one\u2019s business or one\u2019s personal position, I think we\u2019ll have better conversations as a whole,\u201d he said. He slammed commentators who have called for business leaders to abandon social activism in favour of a narrower focus on generating returns for shareholders. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the people who are theoretically commenting on returns to shareholders understand how returns to shareholders work,\u201d he said. \u201cThose returns are generated by the employees at some level in whatever business you are. \u201cAttracting and retaining fantastic people is a non-trivial exercise in business nowadays. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge correlation if you look at corporate social responsibility between profitable, sustainable businesses and those who care about their corporate social responsibility. \u201cOne of businesses\u2019 goals is to stay in business, and to be a sustainable business you need to have fantastic people and take longer-term sustainable positions on a lot of issues.\u201d He said the survey showed employees wanted their business leaders \u201cnot to hide in the corner when it comes to important issues for society at large\u201d. PwC surveyed 1,300 Australian and 2,500 US workers across age groups and industries. A partner at PwC, Diane Rutter, said the research showed the risk of inaction for employers was high. \u201cThere is a vocal younger cohort or generation coming through the workplace that are personally engaged and quite vocal around societal issues, and their expectations of workplaces are equally high,\u201d she said. Employers who thought they could ignore the data should also be aware there was a reward for taking action. \u201cThere\u2019s a large portion of employees that agree that businesses known for speaking out on issues important to them are much more attractive as future employers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see that is significantly higher for Generation Z \u2013 so again, that generation coming through.\u201d",

Despite being champion jockey in Ireland for the first time in 2011, Townend remained behind Walsh in the Mullins yard for years.

Just the 59 winners.\u201d</p> <p>Townend joined Mullins soon after he lost his mum. Walsh was already reeling off Cheltenham winners for Mullins, so was he in awe of both men? \u201cVery much so. Everyone, when they get their licence, wants to ride for Willie \u2013 and every jockey wants to have Ruby\u2019s success. Ruby was so good to me. He was also tough enough for me, growing up. Ruby isn\u2019t afraid to hide his opinion, and he\u2019d let you know in a stern way if you were wrong. But if he didn\u2019t have any interest in you, he wouldn\u2019t say it. All the horses in the yard were new to me, and it was a different way of riding. Ruby could translate what Willie was trying to say a bit easier, because he spoke the jockey\u2019s language. But they both warrant so much respect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"387d6a6e5ec726061a6f4e824ab2d3fc742141d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/387d6a6e5ec726061a6f4e824ab2d3fc742141d9/0_142_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Townend shows his elation after winning the Gold Cup on Al Boum Photo at the 2019 Cheltenham Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Townend shows his elation after winning the Gold Cup on Al Boum Photo at the 2019 Cheltenham Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Herbert/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As engaging as he is throughout this interview, Townend has the grit to deal with the pressure of replacing Walsh. The way in which he overcame his mum\u2019s death from cancer revealed much about his character. \u201cMy mum died around the Christmas before I left home. I began working at Willie\u2019s yard that next September and it helped take my mind off things. We\u2019d come to a deal, Mum and me, that I\u2019d get the exams out of the way and look at being a jockey [at 16]. Right up to the end she\u2019d go pony racing with us. That summer before she died she was pretty sick but she\u2019d still make the pilgrimage down to west Kerry every week with us. She was there when I won the Dingle Derby \u2013 even though she was quite sick. She and my dad were very open with us and we were old enough to understand what was going on. It was a tough time for all of us but it probably egged me on even more to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>You invariably learn most about the character of a person in adversity. Punchestown in 2018 could have ruined Townend because his error on Al Boum Photo was a calamity. \u201cIf the earth had opened up and swallowed me I\u2019d have been happy. But Ruby was huge. I put my phone in a cupboard, so no one could get through to me. But he had my girlfriend Anna\u2019s number and was checking up through her. I actually spoke to him a couple of times at the course and he rang me on the way home. I then spoke to him at home twice that night. He was a big support. That\u2019s the kind of great people we have in racing. They\u2019re human beings first and racing\u2019s a huge family that way. They stand behind their own.\u201d</p> <p>It was still a terrible ordeal for Townend. \u201cI just survived the night with Anna. It was just us two in the house and she comforted me as best she could. I suppose going back to Ruby and Willie the next morning was the best way because they started to slag me about it. At least they weren\u2019t tiptoeing around you, and talking about you behind your back. They took the piss out of me to my face \u2013 especially Ruby.

      "body": "<p>Last week, I pushed myself to go on the first date I have had in a year. I wasn\u2019t bounding with enthusiasm, at the age of 41, but hope is hard to shake. \u201cBe open to the universe and the universe will throw something back,\u201d a friend advised.</p> <p>In this case, it flung back a guy who lied on his dating profile about his age, used a photo that looked 15 years out of date and told me a bizarre story about how he had done time on a chicken farm because the prisons in his native country were too full \u2013 all, and this was the really confusing bit, for a crime he did not commit.</p> <p>I may have laughed a little about the experience with my friends \u2013 direct access to fresh eggs could be a bonus, after all \u2013 but it didn\u2019t stop me from shedding a tear outside Zara afterwards at what my dating life had become.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t been all bad, of course, I have had lovely experiences, too. One man I met fairly recently was thoroughly decent, honest and a good laugh \u2013 but, sadly, there was no \u201cclick\u201d. But women in their 40s are likely to have run the gauntlet of hope, heart-sinks and uncertainty that are part of the dating trajectory, from traditional meet-ups to the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/02/newly-single-a-beginners-guide-to-the-best-dating-apps\" title=\"\">the planet of the apps</a>.</p> <p>My process of natural deselection is trawling hundreds of profiles that pass in a blur of torso selfies, confusing group photos and grinning men in their 50s holding out large fish (this choice of profile picture is <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/why-dating-apps-are-full-of-guys-with-fish-photos.html\" title=\"\">one of the many mysteries of online dating</a>).

Women tend to be more selective, as well as more invested in their own profile,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Dr Graff, whose research interests include the psychology of online dating, explains why the hours of swiping feel draining. \u201cOnline dating is like relationship shopping; it\u2019s the eBay of the dating world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the paradox of choice is that the more you have, the less likely you are to be satisfied.\u201d In other words, while apps offer the illusion of choice, the reality for women in their 40s feels different.</p> <p>For a start, fewer men in that bracket are looking for women of a similar age, compared with younger men. Graff agrees that men in their 40s are more likely to want a partner in their 30s or 20s. \u201cOlder men will look for younger women for their reproductive viability,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But Graff has not quite razed my optimism to the ground. He thinks online dating is still the most effective way for women in their 40s to find a partner, because people in their 40s tend to be more confident, discerning and instinctive.</p> <p>That is true for 49-year-old Helen James, an author and single mum from London who has been dating for almost a decade, starting when her son was four. \u201cWhen my ex left, I became a single mum who was occasionally a single woman,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to shoehorn dating in between mothering.

      "bodyText": "Last week, I pushed myself to go on the first date I have had in a year. I wasn\u2019t bounding with enthusiasm, at the age of 41, but hope is hard to shake. \u201cBe open to the universe and the universe will throw something back,\u201d a friend advised. In this case, it flung back a guy who lied on his dating profile about his age, used a photo that looked 15 years out of date and told me a bizarre story about how he had done time on a chicken farm because the prisons in his native country were too full \u2013 all, and this was the really confusing bit, for a crime he did not commit. I may have laughed a little about the experience with my friends \u2013 direct access to fresh eggs could be a bonus, after all \u2013 but it didn\u2019t stop me from shedding a tear outside Zara afterwards at what my dating life had become. It hasn\u2019t been all bad, of course, I have had lovely experiences, too. One man I met fairly recently was thoroughly decent, honest and a good laugh \u2013 but, sadly, there was no \u201cclick\u201d. But women in their 40s are likely to have run the gauntlet of hope, heart-sinks and uncertainty that are part of the dating trajectory, from traditional meet-ups to the rise of the planet of the apps. My process of natural deselection is trawling hundreds of profiles that pass in a blur of torso selfies, confusing group photos and grinning men in their 50s holding out large fish (this choice of profile picture is one of the many mysteries of online dating). I don\u2019t know whether to feel flattered or fatigued by the hundreds of swipe-rights on my profile. So, I speak to Dr Martin Graff, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of South Wales, who confirms my fears that it is just a numbers game after all. \u201cMen are trying to maximise their chances by swiping on as many matches as possible. Women tend to be more selective, as well as more invested in their own profile,\u201d he says. Dr Graff, whose research interests include the psychology of online dating, explains why the hours of swiping feel draining. \u201cOnline dating is like relationship shopping; it\u2019s the eBay of the dating world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the paradox of choice is that the more you have, the less likely you are to be satisfied.\u201d In other words, while apps offer the illusion of choice, the reality for women in their 40s feels different. For a start, fewer men in that bracket are looking for women of a similar age, compared with younger men. Graff agrees that men in their 40s are more likely to want a partner in their 30s or 20s. \u201cOlder men will look for younger women for their reproductive viability,\u201d he says. But Graff has not quite razed my optimism to the ground. He thinks online dating is still the most effective way for women in their 40s to find a partner, because people in their 40s tend to be more confident, discerning and instinctive. That is true for 49-year-old Helen James, an author and single mum from London who has been dating for almost a decade, starting when her son was four. \u201cWhen my ex left, I became a single mum who was occasionally a single woman,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to shoehorn dating in between mothering. Early on, I realised that the traditional methods of meeting in a bar or at an event weren\u2019t open to me. So, I turned to online dating.\u201d Helen has attracted men her own age, as well as men more than 10 years younger. She prefers meeting men similar in age, but over the past nine years her attitude has changed significantly in other ways. \u201cAt the beginning, I was so stressed and so anxious to build a family that I might have attracted a \u2018rescuer\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cAs time has gone by, my son and I have become a tight-knit team.

      "bodyText": "Brian Armstrong, who has died aged 86 of prostate cancer, joined British commercial television in its early days and went on to produce some of its most famous programmes, from Coronation Street to World in Action. He was fortunate in learning his craft with the Manchester-based rebel in the ITV system, Granada Television, which sought to provide an alternative voice on the national channel. While a producer-director (1967-69) of the current affairs programme World in Action, he covered the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, smuggling film out in car door panels, having survived what he thought would be his final moments, when he was stopped by a Russian soldier. \u201cAs I moved, he followed my head with his rifle,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cThen, for no apparent reason, he lowered it and turned away. I\u2019ll never know why.\u201d Planning for a possible report to camera on a satellite link back to Manchester, he had decided he should look \u201csincere\u201d and borrowed from Granada\u2019s wardrobe department a jacket to twin with his Burton\u2019s tie. In the book Granada Television: The First Generation, he wrote: \u201cI had been in the middle of mayhem for three days \u2013 sullen gunfire on the horizon, the squeal of heavy caterpillar treads on tarmac, tanks outside the hotel window, Kalashnikovs in nervous hands \u2013 when the phone rang in my hotel room.

Investigators have long suspected that the heist, the biggest since the second world war, was carried out with accomplices working inside the museum. According to prosecutors, the suspects include two security guards who were on duty in the early hours of the morning on 25 November, when the theft took place. Investigators say they did not \u201creact adequately\u201d when it became clear there had been a break in, and did nothing to prevent the theft.

A fourth security guard whose flat has been searched by police is suspected by prosecutors of meddling with the alarm system.

Elsewhere, many events have been cancelled and a handful of schools shut.</p> <p>With more than 500 cases in the US and the numbers rising, the question is: what measures will the US government take and will the country see widespread shutdowns?</p> <p>\u201cYou should absolutely have the expectation that at some point coming up, this will be necessary,\u201d Dr William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd have a plan for how you are going to do it, how you are going to look after the most vulnerable in the community, and how you are going to do it without turning your entire city and community upside down and inside out.\u201d</p> <p>As of Monday morning, at least<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/18oVRrHj3c183mHmq3m89_163yuYltLNlOmPerQ18E8w/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#\">500 people</a> have tested positive for coronavirus in the US and 21 had died. So far, 80% of patients experience a mild form of the illness, which can include a fever and pneumonia, and many of these cases require little to no medical intervention. But that has raised concerns it could spread to vulnerable groups because infected people assume they just have a bad cold.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an intensely serious situation. However, there\u2019s a lot you can do to reduce the risk to yourself and others,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cYour risk of getting it, per day, is actually quite low. So people should not panic but they should prepare.\u201d</p> <p>The top advice to prevent the spread of coronavirus is regular hand washing, changing to fresh clothes at home, coughing and sneezing into the crook of the arm, not shaking hands and avoiding touching the face.</p> <h2>Are schools going to close?</h2> <p>Steps have been taken in places such as Washington state and New York City. Some schools there have closed down after parents or students tested positive for coronavirus.</p> <p>Globally, however, nearly 300 million children are out of school because of the coronavirus, according to Unesco. Italy, where at least 366<strong> </strong>people have died, has ordered the closure of all schools and universities in the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/italy-orders-closure-of-schools-and-universities-due-to-coronavirus?CMP=share_btn_tw\">until 15 March</a>.</p> <p>There are many unknowns about the role of children.

      "bodyText": "The time it took the coronavirus to go from the edges of US concerns to people in stores emptying shelves of hand sanitizer was roughly a week. In response to outbreaks, Italy has shut down its schools and quarantined 16 million people. China has blocked off whole cities. In the US, cruise ships have been blocked from docking, hard-hit King county in Washington state has advised workers to stay home and older and sick people to stay indoors. Elsewhere, many events have been cancelled and a handful of schools shut. With more than 500 cases in the US and the numbers rising, the question is: what measures will the US government take and will the country see widespread shutdowns? \u201cYou should absolutely have the expectation that at some point coming up, this will be necessary,\u201d Dr William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, told the Guardian. \u201cAnd have a plan for how you are going to do it, how you are going to look after the most vulnerable in the community, and how you are going to do it without turning your entire city and community upside down and inside out.\u201d As of Monday morning, at least 500 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the US and 21 had died. So far, 80% of patients experience a mild form of the illness, which can include a fever and pneumonia, and many of these cases require little to no medical intervention. But that has raised concerns it could spread to vulnerable groups because infected people assume they just have a bad cold. \u201cThis is an intensely serious situation. However, there\u2019s a lot you can do to reduce the risk to yourself and others,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cYour risk of getting it, per day, is actually quite low. So people should not panic but they should prepare.\u201d The top advice to prevent the spread of coronavirus is regular hand washing, changing to fresh clothes at home, coughing and sneezing into the crook of the arm, not shaking hands and avoiding touching the face. Are schools going to close? Steps have been taken in places such as Washington state and New York City. Some schools there have closed down after parents or students tested positive for coronavirus. Globally, however, nearly 300 million children are out of school because of the coronavirus, according to Unesco. Italy, where at least 366 people have died, has ordered the closure of all schools and universities in the country until 15 March. There are many unknowns about the role of children. At first, they appeared to not get the virus. Further investigation showed that it was because they have mild symptoms when infected and early research focused on the most dangerous cases. Now, the question is how much of a role children are playing in spreading the disease, if any. \u201cIf you don\u2019t close schools, you might run the risk having viral fountains in the middle of your community,\u201d Hanage said. Bioethicist Kelly Hills said school closures could lead some parents to form unofficial daycares with a few parents as supervisors of a group of kids while the others work. This could create a similar disease fountain as in school, just possibly without the education. The 29.7 million US children who rely on free or low-cost lunch at school could also suffer. \u201cToo many people in America live paycheck to paycheck for this [school closures] to really be something that is an easy answer,\u201d said Hills. She does expect more school closures in the near future and anticipated sports competitions, professional or amateur, to be cancelled or played in empty stadiums. In China, government officials went as far as to lock down the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected in December, in a practice known as cordon sanitaire. This concept dates back to the medieval ages, and while there is evidence it slowed the spread of coronavirus, public health experts said it was best for the US to avoid it. When more extreme measures are taken, particularly if they are poorly communicated, it can breed fear, stigmatization and violence. It can also create distrust in the government, media and healthcare institutions. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, tweeted: \u201cRather than playing cordon sanitaire whack-a-mole with communities across the country, I\u2019d like to see these resources go toward engaging the public on how to stop virus spread. Incentivizing employers to allow telecommuting. Providing safety nets to vulnerable people.\u201d If shutting down cities is not the answer, what is? China was also successful at making testing widely available and free, something the US has failed to do. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially prevented labs from developing their own tests, then sent out faulty kits and had strict guidelines for who should be tested. Once these issues were addressed, more than a hundred cases were identified in a few days. Even more coronavirus cases could be identified if local and federal government manage to address the expense of coronavirus testing in the US. California and Washington on Thursday ordered insurers to pay for the kits and some are starting to do it voluntarily, though hidden costs are a hallmark of the US healthcare system and it\u2019s not guaranteed treatment would be covered. In China, if someone was being treated for coronavirus and their insurance couldn\u2019t cover everything, the government would cover the rest, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The country was also able to move 50% of its medical care online, the WHO said. Mike Pence, who is overseeing the US response to coronavirus, said last week the country could test one million people by the end of the week. Within 24 hours, the vice-president admitted it was not actually possible. Hanage said without rigorous testing, it is difficult for local governments to determine how far they should go in closing schools and public gatherings. \u201cThe difficult situation remains that the lack of testing means we are still fumbling in the dark,\u201d he said. How to protect the most vulnerable One certainty with coronavirus is that the elderly and people with underlying conditions such as diabetes or heart and lung issues are the most vulnerable. The death rate for people 80 or over in China, in the government\u2019s study of more than 72,000 cases, was 14.8%. And because so many cases are mild, and people are capable of spreading it very early in infection, the most vulnerable and their loved ones are searching for answers about what extra precautions they should take. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC under Barack Obama, told reporters this week he had advised his 90-year-old mother to cut down on her active social schedule, which includes three book clubs, because of the specific risks facing her age group. But Dr Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said it is difficult to offer concrete advice on how long these populations should avoid crowds and public gatherings because of how much is still unknown about coronavirus. Pandemic or not, it is always wise for people to stay home if they have a fever, for the safety of themselves and others. \u201cI really think the key here is isolation,\u201d Nuzzo said. \u201cAnd making it so people do possibly over-isolate themselves. They\u2019re not quite sure if they are coming down, but you know they might be sick so they are just going to stay home until they see how their symptoms pan out \u2013 certainly if they develop a fever, absolutely stay home.\u201d And if you aren\u2019t yet at the stage, and are wondering if you\u2019ll soon be working from home or dealing with a local school closure, do not underestimate the power of washing your hands.",

      "bodyText": "Savers are nursing losses approaching 10% in their pension schemes since the start of the coronavirus market panic, while holders of share Isas have lost as much as a quarter of all their money in some funds. The stock market rout means someone who had accumulated \u00a3250,000 in their pension scheme at the start of this year will have seen it shrivel to about \u00a3225,000 on Monday. Holders of final salary-style pensions, mostly in the public sector, lose nothing as their payouts are guaranteed. However, further falls in the market will mean these schemes will drop further into deficit, requiring employers (such as local authorities and universities ) to somehow find the cash to top them up. One saving grace is that the vast majority of pension schemes invest less in equities than in the past, so a 5% fall in the market does not equate to a 5% fall in the total value of the fund. The typical pension fund is about 60%-65% in shares, with the rest in government and corporate bonds, and property. The value of the government bond portion has actually gone up during the crisis. When you see stories saying government bonds have gone negative (as did a lot of UK government bonds on Monday) it is not negative for your pension.

But if a bust-up over fishing rights were to derail negotiations over a trade deal between Britain and the EU, it could quickly spell trouble for Euro-Baltic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf there is no trade deal we get whacked with tariffs and paperwork, so the herring stinks to the heavens by the time it arrives and the whole business becomes unaffordable,\u201d Richter said. \u201cHerring is a very sensitive fish. You can\u2019t afford to transport it from auction to auction. If you want a good product, you need the shortest routes possible.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e8da2331a97b40cd4ec5889e117529994bd40f7c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8da2331a97b40cd4ec5889e117529994bd40f7c/9_60_6172_3703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Herring is processed at the Euro-Baltic factory in Sassnitz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Herring is processed at the Euro-Baltic factory in Sassnitz.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Such fears are shared in Berlin\u2019s seats of power. The German government believes the explosive debate around fishing, which makes up only 0.1% of the UK\u2019s economy and 0.02% of Germany\u2019s, has the potential to sour the tone of more important negotiations, such as over trade, security cooperations and financial services.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the negotiations get bogged down on fishing, which is not crucial economically but highly symbolic and emotive, it becomes harder to have a more sober debate further down the line,\u201d said a German official familiar with the talks.</p> \n<p>Part of the problem is that fish, and herring in particular, is not just a highly symbolic subject for Britain, but also for the woman at the top of Germany\u2019s government. The Euro-Baltic plant lies in Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen \u2013 Vorpommern-Greifswald I, which has since 1990 been the constituency of Angela Merkel.</p> \n<p>What locals here call \u201cthe silver of the sea\u201d has been a key industry in the region for centuries. Some of the small herring-fishing villages on R\u00fcgen\u2019s northernmost tip date back to the 12th century, and the industry blossomed again during the time of the German Democratic Republic, when East Germany\u2019s socialist regime invested heavily in expanding ocean fishing.</p> \n<p>Franz Plaep, 82, a retired trawler captain, remembers the 1950s as the island\u2019s \u201cgolden era\u201d, when Sassnitz harbour was home to 200 vessels that sailed as far as Africa or New York, and fishermen had one of the few profession in the one-party state that knew no borders.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a98b795-e636-4e75-b443-22e9e6429f26\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/this-is-europe\">This is Europe</a> is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all.

But then neither are we. <br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fishing industry on R\u00fcgen collapsed with the same speed as many of East Germany\u2019s other state-run industries.</p> \n<p>In Sassnitz harbour, one company still sells soused, pickled or smoked herring its cutters catch off the island\u2019s coast as a local delicacy in a company-owned shop, but only a small share of the fleet\u2019s catch is exported off the island. A group of fishermen in R\u00fcgen\u2019s north-west are hoping to turn tinned herring into a luxury product in the way the Portuguese have managed with sardines, though the scale of their enterprise is even more limited.</p> \n<p>In the seaside bar where Franz Plaep and his former colleagues meet every morning from 8 til 9 for a coffee, there is a famous photograph on the wall that shows a young Angela Merkel talking to local fishermen in a hut in the village of Lobbe. The photo was taken in 1990, when she was 36 years old. The fisherman\u2019s hut has since shut down, like many others; of about 2,000 fishing businesses that existed on the island in 1990, barely 100 remain.</p> \n<p>When Dutch multinational Parlevliet &amp; Van der Plas (P&amp;P) built the Euro-Baltic processing plant in 2003, it became a crucial crutch for a regional economy in structural decline. With 140 full-time employees and 80 seasonal contract workers, it is one of the biggest employers on the island.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bf68b4aa0b37d4a34bc8da0954da692e7dc6535\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bf68b4aa0b37d4a34bc8da0954da692e7dc6535/0_77_6553_3932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Herring for sale at a deli store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Herring for sale at a deli store.

Catchment quotas for the Baltic sea, set by Brussels on the advice of maritime scientists, have shrunk dramatically in recent years, down 65% from last year, to 1,700 tonnes. In 2003, fishermen were still allowed to fish 35,000 tones of herring out of the Baltic. The reasons behind the decline of stocks are unclear, with speculative fingers pointed at global warming, noisy sub-aquatic building works around the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and a growing population of hungry seals.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe quota may go up again, of course,\u201d said Uwe Richter. \u201cBut when you are at such a low level it may take longer than we can afford to wait.\u201d Processing different fish instead, such as anchovies or red mullet, is not an option \u2013 the high-tech machinery inside the plant is tailored towards slender herring. For now, the viability of his business is reliant on access to British waters. \u201cWithout them, we run the risk that the plant will be at a standstill for long periods.\u201d</p> \n<p>Merkel appears to be aware of their plight. In Germany\u2019s federalised political system, delegates are not expected to parade local issues into the business of the Bundestag in the way they are in Westminster. But in her role as environment minister under Helmut Kohl and later as chancellor, Merkel has frequently visited fishermen on the shores of the Baltic Sea, most recently in 2015, when she christened \u201cMark\u201d, one of the large trawlers in Euro-Baltic\u2019s fleet that could from next year be barred from British waters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07cb9b455676c38798dec494edcd2174fef10f23\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07cb9b455676c38798dec494edcd2174fef10f23/0_0_6102_3661/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crates of fish at the Euro-Baltic plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crates of fish at the Euro-Baltic plant.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Jungeblodt/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The threat posed to the local fishing industry by Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, people on the island say, has been on the chancellor\u2019s mind since the UK voted to leave. Her chief of staff visited Euro-Baltic as soon as Brexit negotiations started in earnest, and in the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/politik/inland/download-koalitionsvertrag-quelle-spd-100-downloadFile.pdf\">coalition treaty</a> between Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic party, the word \u201cBrexit\u201d appears only once \u2013 under the chapter heading \u201cFishing, Angling and Aquaculture\u201d.</p> \n<p>If there\u2019s still hope in Sassnitz, it\u2019s because there is an expectation that the Brits will come to recognise the absurdity of the situation. One of the quirks of European cuisine is that both Germany and Britain\u2019s culinary habits are not matched to the maritime fauna at its disposal. Herring plays a minor role on British menus, and the cod used for fish and chips is largely caught in waters off Scandinavia. In Germany, meanwhile, herring remains one of the three most popular types of fish on the menu.</p> \n<p>If British fishermen want to sell the fish in their seas, they will not only need some form of easy access to EU markets, but also trawlers of the size and processing infrastructure of the scale provided by Euro-Baltic.</p> \n<p>Britain could try to build its own processing capacity, perhaps even buying out large Dutch companies such as P&amp;P or Cornelis Vrolijk that dominate the trade, suggests Rodney Forster, a marine scientist at the University of Hull department.</p> \n<p>\u201cCould the UK build factory freezer trawlers and processing facilities, and find markets for a large-scale pelagic fishery? Or more likely, could the UK simply buy out P&amp;P and re-flag some of its vessels as UK, and move processing to the UK? Could Grimsby be expanded as a fish processing base?\u201d Financially, that seems possible, he adds. \u201cBut would Britain perform such a volte face in industrial policy for such a small sector of the economy? I would be surprised.\u201d</p> \n<p>For now, Uwe Richter reckons, a no-deal Brexit would be bad news for both herring handlers in the Baltic and the North Sea. \u201cOur worst-case scenario is also the worst-case scenario for British fishermen.\u201d</p>",

But if a bust-up over fishing rights were to derail negotiations over a trade deal between Britain and the EU, it could quickly spell trouble for Euro-Baltic. \u201cIf there is no trade deal we get whacked with tariffs and paperwork, so the herring stinks to the heavens by the time it arrives and the whole business becomes unaffordable,\u201d Richter said. \u201cHerring is a very sensitive fish. You can\u2019t afford to transport it from auction to auction. If you want a good product, you need the shortest routes possible.\u201d Such fears are shared in Berlin\u2019s seats of power. The German government believes the explosive debate around fishing, which makes up only 0.1% of the UK\u2019s economy and 0.02% of Germany\u2019s, has the potential to sour the tone of more important negotiations, such as over trade, security cooperations and financial services. \u201cIf the negotiations get bogged down on fishing, which is not crucial economically but highly symbolic and emotive, it becomes harder to have a more sober debate further down the line,\u201d said a German official familiar with the talks. Part of the problem is that fish, and herring in particular, is not just a highly symbolic subject for Britain, but also for the woman at the top of Germany\u2019s government. The Euro-Baltic plant lies in Vorpommern-R\u00fcgen \u2013 Vorpommern-Greifswald I, which has since 1990 been the constituency of Angela Merkel. What locals here call \u201cthe silver of the sea\u201d has been a key industry in the region for centuries. Some of the small herring-fishing villages on R\u00fcgen\u2019s northernmost tip date back to the 12th century, and the industry blossomed again during the time of the German Democratic Republic, when East Germany\u2019s socialist regime invested heavily in expanding ocean fishing. Franz Plaep, 82, a retired trawler captain, remembers the 1950s as the island\u2019s \u201cgolden era\u201d, when Sassnitz harbour was home to 200 vessels that sailed as far as Africa or New York, and fishermen had one of the few profession in the one-party state that knew no borders. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fishing industry on R\u00fcgen collapsed with the same speed as many of East Germany\u2019s other state-run industries. In Sassnitz harbour, one company still sells soused, pickled or smoked herring its cutters catch off the island\u2019s coast as a local delicacy in a company-owned shop, but only a small share of the fleet\u2019s catch is exported off the island. A group of fishermen in R\u00fcgen\u2019s north-west are hoping to turn tinned herring into a luxury product in the way the Portuguese have managed with sardines, though the scale of their enterprise is even more limited. In the seaside bar where Franz Plaep and his former colleagues meet every morning from 8 til 9 for a coffee, there is a famous photograph on the wall that shows a young Angela Merkel talking to local fishermen in a hut in the village of Lobbe. The photo was taken in 1990, when she was 36 years old. The fisherman\u2019s hut has since shut down, like many others; of about 2,000 fishing businesses that existed on the island in 1990, barely 100 remain. When Dutch multinational Parlevliet &amp; Van der Plas (P&amp;P) built the Euro-Baltic processing plant in 2003, it became a crucial crutch for a regional economy in structural decline. With 140 full-time employees and 80 seasonal contract workers, it is one of the biggest employers on the island. Local authorities had managed to entice P&amp;P to the island with EU grants and by helping to procure scientific permits to reclaim the plot of land from the sea on which the plant now sits. In 2020, however, Brexit is one of two developments threatening to kick the last legs from under R\u00fcgen\u2019s remaining fishing industry. Catchment quotas for the Baltic sea, set by Brussels on the advice of maritime scientists, have shrunk dramatically in recent years, down 65% from last year, to 1,700 tonnes. In 2003, fishermen were still allowed to fish 35,000 tones of herring out of the Baltic. The reasons behind the decline of stocks are unclear, with speculative fingers pointed at global warming, noisy sub-aquatic building works around the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and a growing population of hungry seals. \u201cThe quota may go up again, of course,\u201d said Uwe Richter. \u201cBut when you are at such a low level it may take longer than we can afford to wait.\u201d Processing different fish instead, such as anchovies or red mullet, is not an option \u2013 the high-tech machinery inside the plant is tailored towards slender herring. For now, the viability of his business is reliant on access to British waters. \u201cWithout them, we run the risk that the plant will be at a standstill for long periods.\u201d Merkel appears to be aware of their plight. In Germany\u2019s federalised political system, delegates are not expected to parade local issues into the business of the Bundestag in the way they are in Westminster. But in her role as environment minister under Helmut Kohl and later as chancellor, Merkel has frequently visited fishermen on the shores of the Baltic Sea, most recently in 2015, when she christened \u201cMark\u201d, one of the large trawlers in Euro-Baltic\u2019s fleet that could from next year be barred from British waters. The threat posed to the local fishing industry by Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, people on the island say, has been on the chancellor\u2019s mind since the UK voted to leave. Her chief of staff visited Euro-Baltic as soon as Brexit negotiations started in earnest, and in the 2017 coalition treaty between Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic party, the word \u201cBrexit\u201d appears only once \u2013 under the chapter heading \u201cFishing, Angling and Aquaculture\u201d. If there\u2019s still hope in Sassnitz, it\u2019s because there is an expectation that the Brits will come to recognise the absurdity of the situation. One of the quirks of European cuisine is that both Germany and Britain\u2019s culinary habits are not matched to the maritime fauna at its disposal. Herring plays a minor role on British menus, and the cod used for fish and chips is largely caught in waters off Scandinavia. In Germany, meanwhile, herring remains one of the three most popular types of fish on the menu. If British fishermen want to sell the fish in their seas, they will not only need some form of easy access to EU markets, but also trawlers of the size and processing infrastructure of the scale provided by Euro-Baltic. Britain could try to build its own processing capacity, perhaps even buying out large Dutch companies such as P&amp;P or Cornelis Vrolijk that dominate the trade, suggests Rodney Forster, a marine scientist at the University of Hull department. \u201cCould the UK build factory freezer trawlers and processing facilities, and find markets for a large-scale pelagic fishery? Or more likely, could the UK simply buy out P&amp;P and re-flag some of its vessels as UK, and move processing to the UK? Could Grimsby be expanded as a fish processing base?\u201d Financially, that seems possible, he adds. \u201cBut would Britain perform such a volte face in industrial policy for such a small sector of the economy? I would be surprised.\u201d For now, Uwe Richter reckons, a no-deal Brexit would be bad news for both herring handlers in the Baltic and the North Sea. \u201cOur worst-case scenario is also the worst-case scenario for British fishermen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ilkay G\u00fcndogan believes Bruno Fernandes went down far too easily to win the free-kick that led to Manchester United\u2019s opening goal in Sunday\u2019s derby, the Germany midfielder saying he did not touch the Portuguese. The incident happened 30 minutes into the match at Old Trafford, which United won 2-0, when Fernandes went down as G\u00fcndogan challenged him. Mike Dean, the referee, awarded a foul and Fernandes subsequently chipped the ball to Anthony Martial, who volleyed home. G\u00fcndogan said: \u201cThere was frustration about the free-kick before the goal \u2013 it was not at all a foul. I just touched the ball and he [Fernandes] goes on the floor, shouting. I don\u2019t even know if the referee saw it or just had a feeling that it was a foul. \u201cThat was very disappointing for me, to be honest, because I was involved in the action and conceding the goal straight afterwards hurt very much. We tried hard after conceding the first one but it just wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Ederson allowed Martial\u2019s volley to squirm in and City\u2019s goalkeeper later compounded the error by throwing the ball into space for Scott McTominay to run on to for the midfielder\u2019s 40-yard injury-time second for United. G\u00fcndogan said: \u201cHe\u2019s angry, disappointed and frustrated, but it\u2019s always about how you [react]. He has all of our support and I\u2019m sure he will do much better in the next games.\u201d The City full-back Oleksandr Zinchenko, though, felt that the team have to take responsibility for Martial\u2019s goal. \u201cEveryone was complaining about that free-kick, but it can happen to everyone. The referee is the boss on the pitch and will decide \u2013 so if he decides it\u2019s a free-kick we have to accept it, and we have to pay attention on set-pieces. We cannot concede this type of goal because we have been working hard on that. We have to pay more attention.\u201d Luke Shaw, meanwhile, has said that Fernandes\u2019s willingness to gamble will drive United on to great heights.

      "bodyText": "Two police forces referred members of their own staff to a government programme designed to steer vulnerable individuals away from committing acts of terrorism, inspectors have revealed. The revelation comes after a 21-year-old frontline Metropolitan police officer was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a banned rightwing terror group. \u201cInsider\u201d threats posed by staff vulnerable to radicalisation are overlooked by the majority of forces, according to a report by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS). The report also called into question the omission of the Ministry of Defence police (MDP) from the list of public sector bodies subject to the Prevent statutory duty, which legally compels workers to refer concerns about extremism to the programme. The MDP is a civilian force that provides armed and unarmed security at sites around the country such as the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, housing estates for military personnel and training areas. Overall, the inspectorate found that forces were meeting their Prevent duty with \u201cmany positive aspects of the Prevent work police forces do\u201d. Few police officers interviewed by inspectors recognised that colleagues may be vulnerable to radicalisation because of the influence of a partner or close family member, the report said. \u201cOnly one force had arrangements in place acknowledging that members of staff vulnerable to radicalisation might need safeguarding,\u201d it said. \u201cThe remainder would rely on existing counter-corruption or misconduct policies and monitoring by supervisors. Only two forces gave examples of having used a recognised Prevent referral approach to deal with a staff member who was vulnerable to extremism. The vulnerability of staff generally was not referred to in forces\u2019 Prevent training, the report said. \u201cBut it is a real threat. Few staff we interviewed had considered the possibility that their colleagues could be vulnerable to radicalisation.\u201d The constable arrested on 5 March on suspicion of membership of a proscribed organisation reportedly has alleged links to National Action, a neo-Nazi group. The constable was released on police bail until a date in late March pending further inquiries. Last year, the Guardian revealed that a suspected far-right sympathiser was feared to be at large in the Met, after managing to scrawl, undetected, a swastika in a secure area of a police station. The culprit has not been caught and the discovery shocked minority ethnic staff and other employees. The swastika was found in February 2019, drawn on an inside wall at Edmonton police station in Enfield, north London, in an area only accessible to officers and staff. Inspectors said the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence should review the MDP\u2019s omission from schedule 6 to the Counter-terrorism and Security Act 2015. Schedule 6 lists public sector organisations and individuals subject to the Prevent statutory duty. \u201cMinistry of Defence police interviewees couldn\u2019t understand why their force hadn\u2019t been listed in schedule 6,\u201d the report said. \u201cAt the time of the inspection, Ministry of Defence police were drafting a Prevent policy and standard operating procedure, as they believe they should feature in this legislation. \u2018\u201cBecause of this, and similarities between this force and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (and, to a lesser extent, British Transport Police), we believe the Prevent duty should apply.\u201d The report comes with the independent review of Prevent, a commitment to which was written into legislation, mired in crisis. The review\u2019s former chair, Lord Carlile, was forced to step down in December over allegations regarding his lack of impartiality and the government is yet to appoint a replacement. The total number of referrals to Prevent in the year to March 2019 was 5,738, the most recent available statistics show. However, only 10% went on to receive specialist support through what is known as the \u201cChannel\u201d process. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for Prevent, Chief Constable Simon Cole, said: \u201cPrevent is the only strategy that will succeed in reducing the terrorism threat in the long-term \u2013 and we must do more to champion its work and improve trust in our communities. \u201cAs this report highlights, the police service can and will make improvements to the way we carry out our Prevent duties, and as the NPCC lead I will ensure every single one of the recommendations made by the HMICFRS will be met.\u201d",

He did not stop to contemplate the quiet as he cushioned Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s cross-field pass on his instep and cut inside Ashley Young. Dybala was not dazzled by the banks of white seats before him as he exchanged a one-two with Aaron Ramsey, wrongfooted Young for a second time and slipped an outside-of-the-boot finish beyond Samir Handanovic in the Internazionale goal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/european-roundup-juventus-inter-serie-a-real-madrid-betis-bayern\">European roundup: Dybala sends Juve top with behind-closed-doors win over Inter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was a strike worthy of winning one of Serie A\u2019s most keenly anticipated matches in years. A Derby d\u2019Italia that pitted Juventus and Inter against one another as genuine title rivals for the first time in almost two decades. A game that had already been postponed once and now, after a week of chaos and confusion, was finally taking place behind closed doors.</p> \n<p>As late as Sunday lunchtime, it was not clear whether this game \u2013 or any other in the Italian top-flight \u2013 would go ahead. After the previous week\u2019s string of cancellations, Serie A was supposed to resume at 12.30pm on Sunday with Parma hosting SPAL. Instead, after completing their warmups and gathering in the tunnel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/parma-v-spal-serie-a-match-delayed-amid-more-caronavirus-concern\">players were sent back to the changing rooms</a>.</p> \n<p>All domestic sporting activity at all levels in Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/all-sport-italy-suspended-until-3-april-coronavirus-serie-a\">has now been suspended until 3 April</a> at the earliest, the Italian national Olympic committee (CONI) announced on Monday, but this was not the case at the weekend. Kick-off had been thrown into limbo after Italy\u2019s sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, suggested that Italy\u2019s professional football leagues ought to be suspended while the nation works to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Damiano Tommasi, the president of the Italian Footballers\u2019 Association, had written to him, as well as the prime minister and the heads of the sport\u2019s various governing bodies, requesting a halt.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe situation is grave and serious,\u201d read a statement from Tommasi on the Footballers\u2019 Association website. \u201cWe have already had cases of contagion in professional teams, greater attention is required. We cannot play football in this country, when players are not supposed to be touching each other.\u201d Three players on the Serie C team Pianese tested positive for Coronavirus last month and on Sunday another case was confirmed at Reggiana, who play in the tier below. Tommasi was responding in part to these cases but also to a government decree enacted in the small hours of Sunday morning, which placed the entire region of Lombardy into quarantine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c8222c0f-918e-4c7f-a09f-901039bc83fc\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond the headline measure of banning all but essential travel in or out of the region, the law closed down swimming pools and gyms, and stated that restaurants could only stay open (for limited hours) if able to guarantee at least one metre of space between each customer. If people were being told not to touch each other, asked Tommasi, how could it make sense for football to continue? Spadafora higlighted the same issue during an interview on Rai\u2019s 90\u00ba minuto, observing how Goran Pandev had been hugged by his teammates after scoring against Milan: \u201ca terrible example\u201d. He also delivered a scathing assessment of the Serie A president Paolo Dal Pino, accusing him of shirking his responsibilities.</p> \n<p>Football\u2019s handling of this crisis has left a lot to be desired, though Spadafora has hardly been consistent himself. He introduced legislation requiring games to be played behind closed doors just three days before. If he felt at the time that they ought to be cancelled altogether, why not specify as much, instead of holding discussions with broadcasters about getting them played free-to-air?</p> \n<p>An emergency meeting of the Italian Football Federation has been called for Tuesday. Although it is impossible to say anything with certainty in the current climate, a complete suspension of professional leagues \u2013 as has already happened in Switzerland \u2013 is at least a strong possibility. What that would mean for the eventual completion of this season is anyone\u2019s guess. With Euro 2020 looming and the virus continuing to spread across the continent, Italy is unlikely to face such conundrums alone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5c40924498c1d02113dd48413369eb8ce6117cef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c40924498c1d02113dd48413369eb8ce6117cef/640_520_2860_1716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paulo Dybala celebrates in front of empty stands at the Allianz Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paulo Dybala celebrates in front of empty stands at the Allianz Stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Pinca/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Players are more aware of this than anyone. It made for a bizarre Sunday, with games that felt more like training sessions surrounded by unnecessary pomp. Even without fans present, clubs followed the same routines as they would for any other matchday. Teams still lined up for the Serie A anthem before kick-off. Stewards still took up their positions in each stand.</p> \n<p>Most surreal might have been the music. AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck still boomed out before kick-off at Juventus\u2019s Allianz Stadium, as it does before every game. In Udine, goal celebration music was mistakenly played after Stefano Okaka thumped a header over the bar.</p> \n<p>Despite it all, the Derby d\u2019Italia still felt different. Although not the occasion that it would have been, there was still an edge here that had been missing elsewhere. Inter assaulted Juventus early with an atypical high press. The <em>Bianconeri</em>, after 11 days off, played with the sort of pace and commitment that seemed to have deserted them during their previous outing: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/26/lyon-juventus-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\">a dismal 1-0 defeat in Lyon</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"81e5a882-74b9-4113-9119-1108a68aeb94\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Juventus 2-0 Internazionale, Milan 1-2 Genoa, Parma 0-1 SPAL, Sampdoria 2-1 Hellas Verona, Udinese 0-0 Fiorentina</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Maurizio Sarri\u2019s decision to drop Miralem Pjanic, drafting Bentancur into the centre of midfield and deploying Ramsey in a box-to-box role on the right, felt decisive. After mixed performances in a No 10 role, Ramsey had asked for this opportunity to start deeper, telling his manager that he felt more able to make the line-breaking runs that the team wants from him when he can see more of the pitch ahead.</p> \n<p>Ramsey scored the opener, reacting fastest to a loose ball on the edge of the six-yard box. His was the assist on Dybala\u2019s goal, too. After a frustrating, injury-disrupted, first season in Turin, this feels like a moment for the Welshman to press on and really make his mark. Or it would, at least, if not for the uncertainty about whether the rest of this season will even go ahead.</p> \n<p>For now, Juventus are back on top of the table, one point ahead of Lazio but nine clear of Inter. The <em>Nerazzurri</em> have a game in hand, but have lost their last three domestic games. Defeat felt like a hammer blow to their title ambitions.</p> \n<p>Antonio Conte, returning for the first time to face the club that he led to three consecutive titles, was measured in his post-game comments, arguing nobody should be surprised that a team built over many years would hold the edge over his Inter side, whose personnel has been overhauled since his arrival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Both he and Sarri were asked about football\u2019s handling of the coronavirus.

Keeping one\u2019s concentration up is not simple. I hope that decisions will be taken that safeguard everyone, without distinctions.\u201d That much, frankly, ought to be a minimum standard.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

      "bodyText": "Paulo Dybala did not require an audience. The Juventus forward was not thinking about the empty stand behind him as he accelerated down the right wing at the Allianz Stadium. He did not stop to contemplate the quiet as he cushioned Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s cross-field pass on his instep and cut inside Ashley Young. Dybala was not dazzled by the banks of white seats before him as he exchanged a one-two with Aaron Ramsey, wrongfooted Young for a second time and slipped an outside-of-the-boot finish beyond Samir Handanovic in the Internazionale goal. It was a strike worthy of winning one of Serie A\u2019s most keenly anticipated matches in years. A Derby d\u2019Italia that pitted Juventus and Inter against one another as genuine title rivals for the first time in almost two decades. A game that had already been postponed once and now, after a week of chaos and confusion, was finally taking place behind closed doors. As late as Sunday lunchtime, it was not clear whether this game \u2013 or any other in the Italian top-flight \u2013 would go ahead. After the previous week\u2019s string of cancellations, Serie A was supposed to resume at 12.30pm on Sunday with Parma hosting SPAL. Instead, after completing their warmups and gathering in the tunnel, players were sent back to the changing rooms. All domestic sporting activity at all levels in Italy has now been suspended until 3 April at the earliest, the Italian national Olympic committee (CONI) announced on Monday, but this was not the case at the weekend. Kick-off had been thrown into limbo after Italy\u2019s sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, suggested that Italy\u2019s professional football leagues ought to be suspended while the nation works to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Damiano Tommasi, the president of the Italian Footballers\u2019 Association, had written to him, as well as the prime minister and the heads of the sport\u2019s various governing bodies, requesting a halt. \u201cThe situation is grave and serious,\u201d read a statement from Tommasi on the Footballers\u2019 Association website. \u201cWe have already had cases of contagion in professional teams, greater attention is required. We cannot play football in this country, when players are not supposed to be touching each other.\u201d Three players on the Serie C team Pianese tested positive for Coronavirus last month and on Sunday another case was confirmed at Reggiana, who play in the tier below. Tommasi was responding in part to these cases but also to a government decree enacted in the small hours of Sunday morning, which placed the entire region of Lombardy into quarantine. Beyond the headline measure of banning all but essential travel in or out of the region, the law closed down swimming pools and gyms, and stated that restaurants could only stay open (for limited hours) if able to guarantee at least one metre of space between each customer. If people were being told not to touch each other, asked Tommasi, how could it make sense for football to continue? Spadafora higlighted the same issue during an interview on Rai\u2019s 90\u00ba minuto, observing how Goran Pandev had been hugged by his teammates after scoring against Milan: \u201ca terrible example\u201d. He also delivered a scathing assessment of the Serie A president Paolo Dal Pino, accusing him of shirking his responsibilities. Football\u2019s handling of this crisis has left a lot to be desired, though Spadafora has hardly been consistent himself. He introduced legislation requiring games to be played behind closed doors just three days before. If he felt at the time that they ought to be cancelled altogether, why not specify as much, instead of holding discussions with broadcasters about getting them played free-to-air? An emergency meeting of the Italian Football Federation has been called for Tuesday. Although it is impossible to say anything with certainty in the current climate, a complete suspension of professional leagues \u2013 as has already happened in Switzerland \u2013 is at least a strong possibility. What that would mean for the eventual completion of this season is anyone\u2019s guess. With Euro 2020 looming and the virus continuing to spread across the continent, Italy is unlikely to face such conundrums alone. Players are more aware of this than anyone. It made for a bizarre Sunday, with games that felt more like training sessions surrounded by unnecessary pomp. Even without fans present, clubs followed the same routines as they would for any other matchday. Teams still lined up for the Serie A anthem before kick-off. Stewards still took up their positions in each stand. Most surreal might have been the music. AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck still boomed out before kick-off at Juventus\u2019s Allianz Stadium, as it does before every game. In Udine, goal celebration music was mistakenly played after Stefano Okaka thumped a header over the bar. Despite it all, the Derby d\u2019Italia still felt different. Although not the occasion that it would have been, there was still an edge here that had been missing elsewhere. Inter assaulted Juventus early with an atypical high press. The Bianconeri, after 11 days off, played with the sort of pace and commitment that seemed to have deserted them during their previous outing: a dismal 1-0 defeat in Lyon. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s decision to drop Miralem Pjanic, drafting Bentancur into the centre of midfield and deploying Ramsey in a box-to-box role on the right, felt decisive. After mixed performances in a No 10 role, Ramsey had asked for this opportunity to start deeper, telling his manager that he felt more able to make the line-breaking runs that the team wants from him when he can see more of the pitch ahead. Ramsey scored the opener, reacting fastest to a loose ball on the edge of the six-yard box. His was the assist on Dybala\u2019s goal, too. After a frustrating, injury-disrupted, first season in Turin, this feels like a moment for the Welshman to press on and really make his mark. Or it would, at least, if not for the uncertainty about whether the rest of this season will even go ahead. For now, Juventus are back on top of the table, one point ahead of Lazio but nine clear of Inter. The Nerazzurri have a game in hand, but have lost their last three domestic games. Defeat felt like a hammer blow to their title ambitions. Antonio Conte, returning for the first time to face the club that he led to three consecutive titles, was measured in his post-game comments, arguing nobody should be surprised that a team built over many years would hold the edge over his Inter side, whose personnel has been overhauled since his arrival. Both he and Sarri were asked about football\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. Where the Juventus manager suggested that he didn\u2019t know enough to offer an opinion, Conte acknowledged concerns. \u201cWe are all human beings, we all have a family,\u201d he said. \u201cAt times I would like to raise my voice, but I stop myself. Keeping one\u2019s concentration up is not simple. I hope that decisions will be taken that safeguard everyone, without distinctions.\u201d That much, frankly, ought to be a minimum standard.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Saudis spark oil price slump with vow to step up production The FTSE 100 share index followed huge losses in the Asian and European markets on Monday by plunging 8.5% as trading opened, putting the London Stock Exchange on track for its worst one-day fall since 2008. That\u2019s because the coronavirus panic already afflicting the global markets has been compounded by a 27% slump in the price of oil, after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, said it would step up production beginning next month. Barrelling downward. The decision by the Saudi state oil producer Aramco came in response to Russia\u2019s refusal to join an Opec plan to cut oil supplies; it represents an attempt by the Saudis to drive rivals such as Russia and the US out of the shale oil market. Shale firms have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months. Leaked coronavirus quarantine plans spark chaos in Italy Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose from 233 to 366 on Sunday, a rise of more than 50% in 24 hours. The country was then plunged into further chaos by a leak to the media of plans to quarantine more than 16 million people across its worst-affected northern regions. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has cordoned off the oil-rich municipality of Qatif, home to 500,000 people, mostly Shia Muslims. Many of the 230 confirmed coronavirus cases in the Gulf region had recently returned from religious pilgrimages to Shia-majority Iran. China containment. The number of new Covid-19 deaths has continued to fall in China, with 22 reported on Sunday \u2013 the country\u2019s lowest toll since the start of the crisis. Low-wage workers. A lack of proper medical benefits and paid sick leave will leave millions of low-wage workers in the US vulnerable to the disease or its financial side-effects, as Michael Sainato reports. Bernie Sanders tries to slow the Biden surge in Michigan Bernie Sanders has asked for the backing of Elizabeth Warren and her progressive supporters, after Warren dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week, leaving the Vermont senator as the sole standard-bearer for the party\u2019s left wing. Sanders has sharpened his attacks against the new frontrunner, Joe Biden, in hopes of an upset at the Michigan primary on Tuesday. But Biden, for his part, warned against a primary \u201cbloodbath\u201d before the general election. Kamala Harris. The California senator \u2013 whose own presidential campaign\u2019s biggest moment was arguably a debate-stage attack on Biden \u2013 endorsed the former vice-president on Sunday. Emissions fall as electricity producers shift to cleaner sources Carbon emissions from the global electricity system fell by 2% in 2019, the steepest drop in three decades, according to a report by the climate thinktank Ember. But while some of that decline can be attributed to countries turning from coal to cleaner energy sources, the report says there were also one-off factors at play last year, including mild winters. \u201cProgress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,\u201d the report says. Coal plants. Coal generation in the US and Europe has halved since 2007 and, overall, power from coal plants fell by 3% last year. But China\u2019s reliance on coal plants rose again: the country now accounts for half the world\u2019s total coal generation. Cheat sheet The Hong Kong authorities have arrested 17 people and seized \u201csignificant quantities of homemade explosives\u201d in connection to an alleged campaign to force the government to close its borders with China to halt the spread of the coronavirus. North Korea has fired three unidentified projectiles into the sea off its eastern coast, the second missile test in two weeks. Female asylum seekers staged a protest at the Turkish border demanding to be let into the EU on Sunday, just one of multiple worldwide demonstrations organised to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Alabama lawmakers will consider a bill that would lift the state\u2019s ban on yoga in public schools. The ban was introduced in 1993 following complaints from parents that the practice endorsed a \u201cnon-Christian belief system\u201d. Must-reads Alison Brie: \u2018I\u2019ve been inspired by all the women around me.\u2019 In her new movie Horse Girl, the star of Community, Glow and Mad Men draws on her grandmother\u2019s traumatic story for a tale of mental illness \u2013 and aliens. Her mother was \u201cshaken\u201d by the film, she tells Aaron Hicklin, \u201cbut she doesn\u2019t seem upset with me about it.\u201d Will China\u2019s Covid-19 monitoring become the new normal? From upgraded facial recognition tech to hotlines for reporting those who may be infected, Chinese citizens are facing a new level of government intrusion amid the coronavirus crisis. Experts say it has given Beijing a perfect excuse to accelerate its mass surveillance program, as Lily Kuo reports. Trump\u2019s businesses rake in millions from 2020 campaign The pro-Trump Super Pac America First Action has spent a total of more than $540,000 on events at the president\u2019s own Washington DC hotel since 2017. The figures highlight just how the president and his allies are using Trump properties to woo big donors before the 2020 election, writes Peter Stone. Why we\u2019re addicted to mean online gossip about women Katy Kelleher used to spend a lot of time reading snarky, even sadistic online comments about other women\u2019s lives, particularly those who were outwardly successful and rather privileged. Until, she says, she realised it was making her anxious and unhappy. Opinion The overbearing control of China\u2019s communist system has been undermining social trust for decades, says the artist and activist Ai Weiwei. By the time the coronavirus emerged, people\u2019s immune system against lies had simply broken down. Questions about a virus \u2013 what happened and why? \u2013 should be empirical questions that have determinable answers. But not in China, where the problem is not even lack of knowledge so much as lack of a system in which knowledge is possible. Sport Manchester United have secured their first Premier League double over Manchester City for a decade, with a 2-0 derby win over their crosstown rivals on Sunday, which inspired jubilant scenes of a sort rarely seen at Old Trafford in recent years. The Indian Wells tennis tournament in California, which was set to begin on Monday, has been cancelled due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, its organisers have announced.

      "body": "<p>Given the gift of time travel, you\u2019d have to drop in on the early collaborations of Merce Cunningham and John Cage. Their out-there experimentations refashioned what dance looked like and how it related to music (in short: it didn\u2019t), much to the bafflement of 1940s and 50s America. It was out with dance as a medium to express stories and feelings. Instead, \u201cthe dance is the whole visual experience,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cWe don\u2019t interpret \u2013 we present, we do.\u201d</p> <p>In lieu of time travel, we have Alla Kovgan\u2019s 3D film, Cunningham, tracing the choreographer\u2019s life and work from the 40s to the 70s, from early solos and the somewhat ad-hoc formation of his company until the first generation of its dancers moved on (the company closed in 2011, two years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/27/obituary-merce-cunningham\">Cunningham\u2019s death</a>).</p> <p>Kovgan imaginatively presents a treasure trove of archive, skilfully weaving story, dance, image and mood. Each clip is a portal back to this time of intensely fertile creativity, with extracts from Cage\u2019s scores and cameos from Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Morton Feldman and David Tudor.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyDLOnXGDmE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VyDLOnXGDmE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The real treat is seeing the young Cunningham dance: wild and weightless, with silent bounce and flight but also a grounded, vivid presence. Here was a man who simply had to dance. His movement is freer and weirder than the measured geometries we know from his later company work. As Cage plink-plonks on his <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/how-composer-john-cage-transformed-piano-with-help-some-household-objects-180973206/\">prepared piano</a>, it\u2019s no wonder those early audiences scratched their heads. Some people look to art for pleasure, beauty and order in a difficult world, Cage tells us (tongue perhaps slightly in cheek), but his aim was to make art so bewildering that it\u2019s a pleasure to return to everyday life.</p> <p>We see the perplexed faces of the dancers, in black-and-white footage from the rehearsal studio, wondering what they\u2019re doing, and why. But they were up for the adventure, nine of them touring the US in a cramped VW camper van, missionaries for modern dance in middle America.

      "bodyText": "Given the gift of time travel, you\u2019d have to drop in on the early collaborations of Merce Cunningham and John Cage. Their out-there experimentations refashioned what dance looked like and how it related to music (in short: it didn\u2019t), much to the bafflement of 1940s and 50s America. It was out with dance as a medium to express stories and feelings. Instead, \u201cthe dance is the whole visual experience,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cWe don\u2019t interpret \u2013 we present, we do.\u201d In lieu of time travel, we have Alla Kovgan\u2019s 3D film, Cunningham, tracing the choreographer\u2019s life and work from the 40s to the 70s, from early solos and the somewhat ad-hoc formation of his company until the first generation of its dancers moved on (the company closed in 2011, two years after Cunningham\u2019s death). Kovgan imaginatively presents a treasure trove of archive, skilfully weaving story, dance, image and mood. Each clip is a portal back to this time of intensely fertile creativity, with extracts from Cage\u2019s scores and cameos from Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Morton Feldman and David Tudor. The real treat is seeing the young Cunningham dance: wild and weightless, with silent bounce and flight but also a grounded, vivid presence. Here was a man who simply had to dance. His movement is freer and weirder than the measured geometries we know from his later company work. As Cage plink-plonks on his prepared piano, it\u2019s no wonder those early audiences scratched their heads. Some people look to art for pleasure, beauty and order in a difficult world, Cage tells us (tongue perhaps slightly in cheek), but his aim was to make art so bewildering that it\u2019s a pleasure to return to everyday life. We see the perplexed faces of the dancers, in black-and-white footage from the rehearsal studio, wondering what they\u2019re doing, and why. But they were up for the adventure, nine of them touring the US in a cramped VW camper van, missionaries for modern dance in middle America. At a gas station in Ohio the dancers all piled out of the van and started stretching. \u201cAre you comedians?\u201d the attendant asked. \u201cNo,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cWe\u2019re from New York.\u201d In 1964 they went to Europe. In conservative Paris, eggs and tomatoes were thrown on stage. But in London they were triumphant. \u201cThe voice of today,\u201d said the Manchester Guardian. Alongside archive gems, former dancer Jennifer Goggans has staged sequences from Cunningham works, danced in ballrooms, rooftops, parks and studios and filmed in 3D by Kovgan \u2013 there\u2019s some similarity to Wim Wender\u2019s excellent Pina Bausch film, embedding dance in the landscape and moving the viewer among the performers.

She is also known as Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Alice Moore Dunbar Nelson, and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alice-Dunbar-Nelson\">Alice Ruth Dunbar Nelson.</a></p> <p>She was born Alice Ruth Moore in 1875 in New Orleans: her African-American mother, a former slave, worked as a seamstress and her Creole father was a seaman. American biographers describe the family as \u201cmiddle class\u201d: British terminology would probably prefer \u201cskilled working class\u201d. Not impoverished, but a long way from privilege, the Moores would no doubt have encouraged belief in a strong work-ethic in their children.</p> <p>Dunbar Nelson attended <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_University\">Straight University</a> and initially became a teacher. Her literary achievements were many and varied and included poetry, short stories, essays and journalism, the latter being the medium most suited to her later political activism. She was married three times, the first time to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/16/poem-of-the-week-the-corn-stalk-fiddle-by-paul-laurence-dunbar\">the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar</a>.</p> <p>Her debut publication, a miscellany of poems and stories, <a href=\"http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/louisiana_anthology/texts/dunbar/dunbar--violets.html\">Violets and Other Tales</a>, appeared when she was only 20. The Idler comes from that collection. The sympathetic portrait reveals the young writer\u2019s independence of class- or faith-bound moral judgments \u2013 and a bold though unobtrusive use of metrical variation to express character and action.</p> <p>A simple, sensuous, dreamy type of working man, the protagonist has no \u201cmission\u201d beyond an easy, happy life. The first quatrain introduces him vividly, evoking his pace, leisurely and a little weary, with the repeated \u201cl\u201d sound of \u201cidle lingerer\u201d and \u201ca little longer\u201d and the stretched vowels and slow consonants of \u201cyawns away\u201d. The latter is an interesting phrase: adding \u201caway\u201d to a verb usually implies repeated action (we \u201ctap away\u201d at our keyboards, for example) but here there\u2019s also the suggestion of a larger movement, so we can picture the man walking off as he repeatedly yawns. The details about the nature of the load he carries are important. It\u2019s stuff that will undergo industrial processing of some kind. But \u201cash\u201d and \u201cclay\u201d might also suggest death, and a certain calm fatalism in the man\u2019s character. This idea will be developed later.</p> <p>In the second stanza, he\u2019s described as \u201cinfantile at the last\u201d (the description applicable to him rather than the face he greets). The word infantile may be read as neutrally descriptive or, more compellingly, as a judgment someone other than the speaker would make. The goal-directed \u201cbusy throng\u201d reminds the poet, ominously, of a quick-marching army. But the innocent idler singles out from that unseeing, mechanical throng a familiar human face, and greets him or her with unforced pleasure.</p> <p>Small changes to the established iambic pentameter first occur in the third stanza. The first line (\u201cHis mission? Well, there is but one\u201d) drops from five to four beats, suggesting brisk dismissal of the whole notion of a mission. Or perhaps, after the abrupt question, \u201cHis mission?\u201d, the reader is asked to pause for a silent beat, a thought before the reply, heralded by the colloquial \u201cWell \u2026\u201d The reply itself is emphatically phrased, possibly amused in tone: \u201cAnd if it is a mission he knows it, nay.\u201d An extra beat in \u201cTo be a happy idler, to lounge and sun\u201d once more slows us down and lets us stretch ourselves like \u2013 well \u2013 happy idlers when the working day is done.</p> <p>In the fourth stanza, the fatalism of the idler as he calmly meets his death translates as superior spiritual wisdom, perhaps, but it hints also at the harshness of the man\u2019s life. We\u2019re asked to include silence in the pulse of the last line, the dashes marking the points at which to pause, and share the slow smile, the sensation of release.</p> <p>He\u2019s an unworldly person: so, in the description of him as \u201cthis poor mothling of that flame, the world\u201d, the term \u201cworld\u201d is initially surprising. This world can\u2019t be identified entirely with that earlier one that \u201cmarched\u201d past him \u201cand scorned his slowness\u201d. Rather, it\u2019s the bodily, instinctive world of the senses. The lovely word \u201cmothling\u201d suggests a soft, blind blundering movement: the flame feels gentle, seductive, its violence incomprehensible. This is a world of warmth and light registered on the skin, not the world of the go-getter, the maker of the \u201cdesperate deal\u201d.</p> <p>Those social sinners, the idle poor, would have been scolded in conventional, didactic poems of the time. Dunbar Nelson\u2019s speaker instead directs her challenge to \u201cyou\u201d, the imagined reader, or even herself \u2013 the struggler for empowerment and radical social change (\u201cdesperate deals\u201d need not be only financial). The moral angle in the poem is finally pragmatic. The gentle mothlings and the driven workers will become \u201cashes\u201d or \u201cclay\u201d, and there\u2019s no more suggestion of ensuing redemption for the idler than there is of punishment.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Note: I\u2019ve kept the punctuation common to all the texts I\u2019ve read: suspiciously semi-colon-heavy, it\u2019s probably not the poet\u2019s original.

No matter if the world has marched along, And scorned his slowness as it quickly passed; No matter, if amid the busy throng, He greets some face, infantile at the last. His mission? Well, there is but one, And if it is a mission he knows it, nay, To be a happy idler, to lounge and sun, And dreaming, pass his long-drawn days away. So dreams he on, his happy life to pass Content, without ambitions painful sighs, Until the sands run down into the glass; He smiles \u2013 content \u2013 unmoved and dies. And yet, with all the pity that you feel For this poor mothling of that flame, the world; Are you the better for your desperate deal, When you, like him, into infinitude are hurled? This week, we are revisiting the Harlem Renaissance poets with an early work by Alice Dunbar Nelson, a writer who went on to play an important part in the movement in the 1920s and 30s.

Her literary achievements were many and varied and included poetry, short stories, essays and journalism, the latter being the medium most suited to her later political activism.

They started well, imposed themselves up front and showed the kind of defensive appetite, in the face of a physical Welsh challenge, that distinguishes the best teams. If this was the last Twickenham hurrah for George Kruis and his long-time lineout guru Steve Borthwick, they went out in style; Tom Curry, Courtney Lawes, Maro Itoje, Kyle Sinckler, Ben Youngs and George Ford all had good games and the absence of Billy and Mako Vunipola was barely noticed.

They are playing with more daring and ambition, prepared to indulge in risky off-loads, but have retained elements of the Warren Gatland era, not least their ability to finish matches strongly. Their main problem is that by opening up they have opened up themselves. Mistakes have led to opposition tries, as again happened at Twickenham when George North\u2019s knock-on after Ross Moriarty had secured a turnover led to England\u2019s opener, and a team that conceded 65 points and seven tries in winning the title last year has leaked 84 and 10 in four matches this year. Their erstwhile defence coach Shaun Edwards said that conceding fewer than 20 points in a match enhanced the chance of victory: 19 was the most they shipped in last year\u2019s championship but the whitewashing of Italy was followed by opposition totals of 24, 27 and 33, which is why Wales have not defended their title. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/07/welsh-flair-falls-short-in-the-face-of-englands-ferocity-despite-late-surge\" title=\"\">Michael Aylwin: Welsh flair falls short in the face of England\u2019s ferocity</a></em></p> <h2><strong>3) Defeat of France hands momentum to Scotland</strong></h2> <p>Under pressure after a traumatic World Cup and the dispute which has deprived Scotland of their key playmaker Finn Russell, Gregor Townsend has bought himself time with an accomplished victory over France.

      "body": "<p>Growing up, \u201cfaggot\u201d was the one word I never wanted to be called. I could stand sissy, punk and even homo. But \u201cfaggot\u201d felt like a scarlet letter I would never be able to remove once someone pinned it on me. As a black, still-figuring-it-out queer kid at a conservative Texas middle school, I quickly surmised this social truth: being a fag meant being a punchline and a punching bag.</p> <p>So I lowered my voice two decibels, made sure not to talk with my hands, and wore subdued, muted colors. My focus was on not being found out. Just make it through high school, I told myself, and then I could be my faggiest self and not worry about being whipped with the slur.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Ianamoonlight/status/1220754109407682560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"cy\" dir=\"ltr\">period <a href=\"https://t.co/YvqBF4zBqQ\">pic.twitter.com/YvqBF4zBqQ</a></p>&mdash; .

Toxic thinking overflows in the gay community, where there\u2019s an outsized idolization of rugged masculinity that research shows has serious <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2902177/\">harmful effects on the queer male psyche</a>. We end up policing each other\u2019s queerness through exclusion, and the word \u201cfag\u201d is frequently used to build those borders. As a Crossfit-loving guy once put it in his Grindr profile, \u201cNo femm fags pls.\u201d</p> <p>Recently, though, something strange has begun to happen in my relationship with the word. Scrolling through social media late last year, I discovered gay men delivering a host of tongue-in-cheek, self-depreciating jokes about it. \u201cMy Spotify wrapped: You\u2019re a depressed f*ggot aren\u2019t you,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parvxti/status/1071233363246116865\">tweeted</a> someone who might have been listening to too much Ariana Grande. A low-res clip from 2009 of Tyra Banks exclaiming \u201cGet the fag off the TV. I\u2019m not watching that!\u201d was being posted in response to peak-gay things, such as a fan asking the alt-pop star Charli XCX to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlackGirlAcid/status/1188903683943215117\">sign their douche</a>. After a character on the Comedy Central cable show The Other Two delivered the immortal line \u201cI\u2019m gagging for you, faggot!\u201d, the outrageous phrase became a shockingly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mce1201/status/1221596690660110339\">popular meme</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TomZohar/status/1113857177255432193\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI am GAGGING for you, faggot\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/cHpPL8xYzQ\">pic.twitter.com/cHpPL8xYzQ</a></p>&mdash; Tom Zohar (@TomZohar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomZohar/status/1113857177255432193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Once I saw these playful uses of the word, I started to notice other ones everywhere. In New York, the event organizer Ladyfag\u2019s parties had become synonymous with a trendy night out. The alt-queer magazine Cakeboy promoted \u201cdisruptive faggotry\u201d. My gay male friends began throwing the word around to signal their camaraderie. It became clear to me that something larger was happening in cosmopolitan LGBTQ+ communities: queer men were reclaiming faggot.</p> <p>\u201cFor a person to use a word that once scared them and inhabit its power, what it really says is: \u2018I\u2019m not scared of you anymore <em>or</em> this word,\u2019\u201d says the queer sex advice columnist Dan Savage, who in the 1990s began each of his columns with the salutation \u201cHey Faggot\u201d to great controversy. This gives the word a powerful political dimension. \u201c\u2018Faggot\u2019 is the ultimate \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the hetero establishment,\u201d Alexander Cheves recently <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/2017/8/02/21-words-queer-community-has-reclaimed-and-some-we-havent#media-gallery-media-1\">wrote for the LGBTQ+ magazine Advocate</a>. \u201cA term used by queer men who celebrate their sex.\u201d Saying fag often makes straight people uncomfortable, allowing queer people to take up space that was previously denied them. It also serves as a reminder that queer people are still a persecuted minority \u2013 a fact that gets lost amid a growing commodification of queer culture, with the rainbow-decked Converse sneakers sold during Pride Month or bevy of queer faces in Taylor Swift\u2019s You Need to Calm Down video.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/14/im-a-faggot-felix-maritaud-on-reclaiming-a-term-of-abuse-and-his-friendship-with-beatrice-dalle\">'I'm a faggot': F\u00e9lix Maritaud on reclaiming a term of abuse \u2013 and his friendship with B\u00e9atrice Dalle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, we\u2019re in a moment when feminized male queerness \u2013 aka what stereotypically gets labeled as \u201cfaggotry\u201d \u2013 has found greater acceptance and representation in popular culture.

      "bodyText": "Growing up, \u201cfaggot\u201d was the one word I never wanted to be called. I could stand sissy, punk and even homo. But \u201cfaggot\u201d felt like a scarlet letter I would never be able to remove once someone pinned it on me. As a black, still-figuring-it-out queer kid at a conservative Texas middle school, I quickly surmised this social truth: being a fag meant being a punchline and a punching bag. So I lowered my voice two decibels, made sure not to talk with my hands, and wore subdued, muted colors. My focus was on not being found out. Just make it through high school, I told myself, and then I could be my faggiest self and not worry about being whipped with the slur. But the work I put in to avoid being labeled a fag continued long after I came out of the closet, because I found that even gay men use the word as a verbal punch. Toxic thinking overflows in the gay community, where there\u2019s an outsized idolization of rugged masculinity that research shows has serious harmful effects on the queer male psyche. We end up policing each other\u2019s queerness through exclusion, and the word \u201cfag\u201d is frequently used to build those borders. As a Crossfit-loving guy once put it in his Grindr profile, \u201cNo femm fags pls.\u201d Recently, though, something strange has begun to happen in my relationship with the word. Scrolling through social media late last year, I discovered gay men delivering a host of tongue-in-cheek, self-depreciating jokes about it. \u201cMy Spotify wrapped: You\u2019re a depressed f*ggot aren\u2019t you,\u201d tweeted someone who might have been listening to too much Ariana Grande. A low-res clip from 2009 of Tyra Banks exclaiming \u201cGet the fag off the TV. I\u2019m not watching that!\u201d was being posted in response to peak-gay things, such as a fan asking the alt-pop star Charli XCX to sign their douche. After a character on the Comedy Central cable show The Other Two delivered the immortal line \u201cI\u2019m gagging for you, faggot!\u201d, the outrageous phrase became a shockingly popular meme. Once I saw these playful uses of the word, I started to notice other ones everywhere. In New York, the event organizer Ladyfag\u2019s parties had become synonymous with a trendy night out. The alt-queer magazine Cakeboy promoted \u201cdisruptive faggotry\u201d. My gay male friends began throwing the word around to signal their camaraderie. It became clear to me that something larger was happening in cosmopolitan LGBTQ+ communities: queer men were reclaiming faggot. \u201cFor a person to use a word that once scared them and inhabit its power, what it really says is: \u2018I\u2019m not scared of you anymore or this word,\u2019\u201d says the queer sex advice columnist Dan Savage, who in the 1990s began each of his columns with the salutation \u201cHey Faggot\u201d to great controversy. This gives the word a powerful political dimension. \u201c\u2018Faggot\u2019 is the ultimate \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the hetero establishment,\u201d Alexander Cheves recently wrote for the LGBTQ+ magazine Advocate. \u201cA term used by queer men who celebrate their sex.\u201d Saying fag often makes straight people uncomfortable, allowing queer people to take up space that was previously denied them. It also serves as a reminder that queer people are still a persecuted minority \u2013 a fact that gets lost amid a growing commodification of queer culture, with the rainbow-decked Converse sneakers sold during Pride Month or bevy of queer faces in Taylor Swift\u2019s You Need to Calm Down video. In fact, we\u2019re in a moment when feminized male queerness \u2013 aka what stereotypically gets labeled as \u201cfaggotry\u201d \u2013 has found greater acceptance and representation in popular culture. The South African-born Australian pop singer Troye Sivan is prancing around in couture dresses in his music videos, Lil Nas X blurs traditional gender lines with his show-stopping red-carpet looks, and the \u201cball\u201d culture of maximalist drag pageants is glamorized in Pose, FX\u2019s show about the 1990s voguing movement. In 2020, at last, it has become more acceptable to lean into queer forms of self-expression. But \u201cfaggot\u201d still feels subversive, even when queerness no longer does. One of the main sources of this subversive power is queer male sexuality. Savage says that the word has long been popular behind closed doors: \u201cIf someone is saying fag, they\u2019re probably saying it to someone they\u2019re fucking.\u201d The word is an important element in kink culture, which commonly includes sadomasochistic behavior such as bullying during sex. \u201cGay men have a terror that we associate with our early sexual awakenings \u2013 it felt like our bodies were betraying us when we were younger,\u201d Savage explained. \u201cYou see gay men try to put themselves back in that state of fear and dread: the link between sexual response and fear is strong.\u201d Despite its power, or maybe because of it, for a long time I wasn\u2019t sure that I could reclaim the word faggot. It got caught in my throat every time I tried to say it; I hated how clunky and ugly the syllables sound and what they used to represent. As a black queer male, I can blare out the n-word in casual conversation with another black person way easier than I can \u201cfaggot\u201d during a conversation with a queer guy. That\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve heard the n-word rapped \u2013 in multiple forms and contexts \u2013 for years. The more I heard the word, the less fearful of it I became. (The popularity of the -ga version versus the -er makes a world of difference. Fag has not received a lighter, more colloquial edit.) There\u2019s still an alarm that sounds off in my brain whenever I hear \u201cfaggot\u201d. For all my ducking and diving of the slur, I have been called it before.

Polarising as our current world may be, this project documents the unity and togetherness of LGBTQ+ people from around the world, who have made, and are making, new lives and communities of their own across the continent. These people are the opposite of victims, and they use their strength to move their lives forward, redefining the term \u201cGayropa\u201d as they do so. Bella, from Turkey, identifies as a transgender woman and is currently claiming asylum in Stockholm, Sweden. After her initial asylum request was denied, she went on hunger strike Many of those photographed have also faced discrimination in exile: xenophobia and racism from host societies (including the LGBTQ+ community), and homophobia and transphobia from fellow asylum seekers and the local population. Some steer clear of others from their own countries, as they find themselves fighting similar issues to the ones they thought they had left behind. Originally from Raqqa, Syria, Hamoudi was forcibly outed as gay at the age of 13, when he was caught having sex with a male friend. He actively protested against the Syrian regime and Islamic State and faced physical and psychological torture. Since moving to Berlin, Hamoudi has worked in the cultural sector and most recently with an organisation helping to rebuild civil society in Raqqa Faris, 35, from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, identifies as non-binary and now lives in Austria, where they were granted political asylum. Faris works at \u2018Queer Base\u2019 in Vienna\u2019s gay-friendly district According to the Refugee Council, a leading UK charity, refugees are five times more likely to have mental health support needs than the average British population, and 61% of asylum seekers experience serious mental distress.

For individuals coming to realise their sexuality or gender identity in hostile environments, the pressure can push them to breaking point. Khusen and Komil are from Dushanbe, Tajikistan.

This, coupled with the challenges of being an asylum seeker in a new country \u2013 having to learn a new language, adapting to a new society, finding a community \u2013 means a need for increased mental health support.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 11pm outside Electrowerkz and a gathering of London\u2019s Arabic community \u2013 young and old \u2013 are coming together tonight to belly dance and throw shapes to the music they grew up with or are currently fixated on. Gone are the days where the only place you could listen to Arabic music in London was Edgware Road and shisha cafes \u2013 Hishek Bishek brings people of all demographics to dance.</p> <p>It is one of London\u2019s only nights dedicated to playing Middle Eastern and Arabic tunes \u2013 from Morocco to Lebanon \u2013 where bubblegum pop meets the eclectic and cutting-edge. Resident DJ Super Mike, equipped with laptop, mixer and turntable, is in for a marathon five-hour set, playing everything from well-known independent acts such as 47Soul to Lebanese singer Nancy Ajram, which he describes as having \u201ctaken the Arabic music world by storm. Her songs are known to every generation from the early 2000s onwards.\u201d Tonight is no exception, with Ajram\u2019s 2018 hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOP9PYLICK8\">Badna Nwalee El Jaw</a>, getting people singing at the top of their lungs in little circles of friends.</p> <p>It\u2019s a little slow to get going, but the club bangers are in full effect for those in early: popular Egyptian singer Amr Diab gets the first of many airings throughout the night, including his 1996 smash Nour Al Ain. But by 1am, the queue stretches down Islington\u2019s City Road and it\u2019s one in, one out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLJA-srM_yM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KLJA-srM_yM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Promoted by Marsm, this is the 17th Hishek Bishek, which began at the student bar of Soas, run by students for students who came to London from all over the Arab world. \u201cIt started off paying homage to singers from the 70s, 80s and 90s, and listening to what\u2019s new on the underground scenes in the Arab world,\u201d Marsm\u2019s Christina Hazboun explains. \u201cIt now brings together so many people of all backgrounds, whether they\u2019re English, Greek, French or Brazilian. You\u2019ll find people of all nationalities at this party.\u201d</p> <p>Why so many other non-Arab nationalities? \u201cArabic culture is hip, but most of all, it is accessible. The atmosphere is open, the people are really friendly, the music is varied and it appeals to people with wide tastes. People identify with the different genres despite the language and style of the songs being Arabic \u2013 they can absorb it.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest crowd reactions are for the 90s pop songs and the hi-tempo Egyptian street songs in the mahraganat style from Egypt, plus foot-stomping dabke from the Levantine region also played at a frenetic, deft rhythmic beat.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 11pm outside Electrowerkz and a gathering of London\u2019s Arabic community \u2013 young and old \u2013 are coming together tonight to belly dance and throw shapes to the music they grew up with or are currently fixated on. Gone are the days where the only place you could listen to Arabic music in London was Edgware Road and shisha cafes \u2013 Hishek Bishek brings people of all demographics to dance. It is one of London\u2019s only nights dedicated to playing Middle Eastern and Arabic tunes \u2013 from Morocco to Lebanon \u2013 where bubblegum pop meets the eclectic and cutting-edge. Resident DJ Super Mike, equipped with laptop, mixer and turntable, is in for a marathon five-hour set, playing everything from well-known independent acts such as 47Soul to Lebanese singer Nancy Ajram, which he describes as having \u201ctaken the Arabic music world by storm. Her songs are known to every generation from the early 2000s onwards.\u201d Tonight is no exception, with Ajram\u2019s 2018 hit, Badna Nwalee El Jaw, getting people singing at the top of their lungs in little circles of friends. It\u2019s a little slow to get going, but the club bangers are in full effect for those in early: popular Egyptian singer Amr Diab gets the first of many airings throughout the night, including his 1996 smash Nour Al Ain. But by 1am, the queue stretches down Islington\u2019s City Road and it\u2019s one in, one out. Promoted by Marsm, this is the 17th Hishek Bishek, which began at the student bar of Soas, run by students for students who came to London from all over the Arab world. \u201cIt started off paying homage to singers from the 70s, 80s and 90s, and listening to what\u2019s new on the underground scenes in the Arab world,\u201d Marsm\u2019s Christina Hazboun explains. \u201cIt now brings together so many people of all backgrounds, whether they\u2019re English, Greek, French or Brazilian. You\u2019ll find people of all nationalities at this party.\u201d Why so many other non-Arab nationalities? \u201cArabic culture is hip, but most of all, it is accessible. The atmosphere is open, the people are really friendly, the music is varied and it appeals to people with wide tastes. People identify with the different genres despite the language and style of the songs being Arabic \u2013 they can absorb it.\u201d The biggest crowd reactions are for the 90s pop songs and the hi-tempo Egyptian street songs in the mahraganat style from Egypt, plus foot-stomping dabke from the Levantine region also played at a frenetic, deft rhythmic beat. The dabke songs have people holding hands in small groups and stomping their feet to the rhythm, while the Egyptian mahraganat tracks have people moving as though it were a hip-hop night. Ahmed, 26, from Cairo arrived in London as a student and said that despite their large numbers, Arabs can feel a little underrepresented in London: \u201cHishek Bishek fills a gap \u2013 I feel like relative to how many of us there seem to be in London, we don\u2019t get decent representation, especially with nights like this.\u201d About two-thirds of attendees are from the Arab diaspora, with different accents and dialects being spoken \u2013 Egyptian and Palestinian being the most heard from conversations \u2013 but the rest are native Brits and Europeans. A guy called Johnny heard via word of mouth and knew nothing about Arabic music, which is precisely why he came. \u201cThe dancing here is much better!\u201d he enthuses. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some incredible dance moves out there both in terms of group and individual stuff.

But throughout there\u2019s a real spirit of Arab togetherness, a tough feat in London with communities spread out across the city. Hazboun says there is now a core of regulars: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen certain people for a while, you know that you\u2019ll see them here. There\u2019s no one else in London doing this, despite the large Arabic community here.\u201d The biggest lesson of tonight is that there\u2019s now a place for Arab nightlife in London.

      "body": "<p>On the night of 12 February, a group backing Donald Trump\u2019s re-election hosted a glitzy gala for large donors at the Trump International hotel that featured the president. The Super Pac, dubbed America First Action, is no stranger to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/trump-international-hotel-washington-dc-foreign-governments\">Trump\u2019s Washington DC hotel</a>.</p> <p>The Super Pac, which has raised almost $48m since 2017, has spent over $540,000 to host events at Trump\u2019s hotel, making it a top source of campaign revenues for the hotel and the Trump family business, according to public data and 1100 Pennsylvania, which tracks Trump hotel events.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in mid-December, some mega-donors rented pricey rooms at the hotel for a two-day event hosted by Trump Victory, a fundraising committee for the president\u2019s 2020 campaign, which also drew Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence. The hotel also seems to have capitalized with high rates: the cheapest rooms on Saturday 14 December during the two-day meeting went for a whopping $6,719 compared with the usual rate of $500, according to the watchdog group Crew.</p> <p>Such lavish spending by pro-Trump political committees and their wealthy donors at his hotel highlights how the president, and his Republican allies in Congress, are using the hotel and other Trump properties to woo big donors as the 2020 money chase heats up.</p> <p>Thus Trump\u2019s aggressive fundraising gives a nice boost to his real estate empire \u2013 which he never divested from \u2013 according to campaign watchdogs and public records.

      "bodyText": "On the night of 12 February, a group backing Donald Trump\u2019s re-election hosted a glitzy gala for large donors at the Trump International hotel that featured the president. The Super Pac, dubbed America First Action, is no stranger to Trump\u2019s Washington DC hotel. The Super Pac, which has raised almost $48m since 2017, has spent over $540,000 to host events at Trump\u2019s hotel, making it a top source of campaign revenues for the hotel and the Trump family business, according to public data and 1100 Pennsylvania, which tracks Trump hotel events. Meanwhile, in mid-December, some mega-donors rented pricey rooms at the hotel for a two-day event hosted by Trump Victory, a fundraising committee for the president\u2019s 2020 campaign, which also drew Trump and the vice-president, Mike Pence. The hotel also seems to have capitalized with high rates: the cheapest rooms on Saturday 14 December during the two-day meeting went for a whopping $6,719 compared with the usual rate of $500, according to the watchdog group Crew. Such lavish spending by pro-Trump political committees and their wealthy donors at his hotel highlights how the president, and his Republican allies in Congress, are using the hotel and other Trump properties to woo big donors as the 2020 money chase heats up. Thus Trump\u2019s aggressive fundraising gives a nice boost to his real estate empire \u2013 which he never divested from \u2013 according to campaign watchdogs and public records. Trump\u2019s businesses are literally making money off the 2020 campaign. Nor is it the first time. According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP), Trump-allied political committees and the Republican party have spent a whopping $18.1m at Trump properties since he launched his 2016 campaign. Republican candidates, elected officials and Pacs have ponied up another $1.2m in the same period. Donald J Trump for President leads the pack, having spent a total of $14.5m since he began his 2016 campaign, with the Republican National Committee in second place at $1.8m and Trump Victory ranking third at $1.6m, Center data shows. \u201cThe Trump era has given birth to a whole new level of political access and influence in Washington,\u201d said Robert Maguire, the research director at Crew. \u201cWealthy donors and special interests get access to powerful people in President Trump\u2019s orbit, including Trump himself, and in return, the donors not only boost Trump\u2019s campaign, but enrich him personally by spending money at properties he still profits from.\u201d The hefty campaign spending at the Trump hotel and other properties has yielded good dividends. Trump and the RNC have teamed up periodically to hold major fundraisers at the hotel. One early joint fundraiser in 2017 reportedly pulled in $10m, and in May 2019, soon after Trump formally launched his re-election campaign, a joint event brought in about $6m.

      "bodyText": "Australia is heading for a recession in the first half of this year, leading economists have forecast, as the continuing impact of the coronavirus outbreak saw the stock market endure its worst day since the global financial crisis. Around $140bn was wiped from the value of shares as the ASX200 lost 7.33%, shedding 455 points to 5,760 points. The Australian dollar was also caught up in the selloff and was trading as low as 63.98 US cents. Oil stocks plunged and the price of oil fell by more than a fifth after Saudi Arabia slashed its official selling price and announced it would raise production. On some forecasts, retail petrol could be as low as $1 a litre in Australia soon. The bloodletting on financial markets prompted both Westpac and Bloomberg Economics to forecast that Australia\u2019s economy will contract for two successive quarters for the first time since 1991. The economy will shrink 0.6% in the first two quarters, Westpac said, while Bloomberg saw a contraction of 0.7%. The outbreak continued to impact beyond the financial world. Two schools in Sydney were closed on Monday after three students tested positive, and further school closures are expected. In Melbourne, after controversy over a GP who continued to see patients while unwell, Victoria\u2019s health minister said health professionals must stay home if they are sick, insisting they be \u201calive to the risks\u201d of community transmission. \u201cThis is a public health emergency of an unprecedented nature that our nation and that the entire global community is facing,\u201d Jenny Mikakos said. Confirmed cases of Covid-19, mainly among people who have travelled overseas, continue to grow across the country. New South Wales now has 46 confirmed cases, including the three schoolchildren, Queensland and Victoria 15 each. There are now 91 cases across Australia, with three deaths. Globally, more than 100,000 people have been infected across 94 countries, with 3,800 deaths. The vast majority of infections and deaths remain in mainland China, though Italy, South Korea and Iran all have more than 6,000 infections. Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg is set to unveil a fiscal stimulus package in coming days. The package, once flagged as \u201cmodest\u201d but now billed as \u201csubstantial\u201d, could run to $10bn and is expected to focus on supporting business cash flows over periods of shutdown or supply chain instability. \u201cThis is a health crisis with a significant economic impact,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cThere will be disruptions to supply chains. We\u2019ve already seen it. There will be a hit on some sectors of our economy in particular. And we\u2019ve already seen that. There are some 95,000 Chinese students that would otherwise be starting their semester that are unlikely to get here. And, of course, the number of tourists has dropped dramatically. \u201cSo these are the economic impacts that the Australian government, with our fiscal response, with the work of the Reserve Bank, is designed to continue to provide confidence to the Australian community.\u201d Frydenberg told reporters market volatility was \u201cnot uncommon at a time like this\u201d, noting there had been a steep drop in the oil price in recent weeks. He said he called the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman, Rod Sims, on Monday morning to make sure the regulator would see that consumers benefited from the lower oil price, which has fallen by 47% since early January. \u201cI wanted to re-emphasise to the ACCC the importance of holding the oil retailers to account and ensuring Australians get the benefit from lower oil prices.\u201d Announcing his recession forecast on Monday, Westpac chief economist Bill Evans added the caveat that his calculations were based on the government not doing anything to stimulate the economy. So Frydenberg\u2019s expected package could force a rethink, Evans said. \u201cWestpac has revised its growth forecasts for the Australian economy in 2020 to take into account the expected impact from the coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers are based on a \u2018no fiscal stimulus package\u2019 basis. The government is set to announce its policy response later in the week and it will be necessary to adjust the numbers according to our assessment of the impact of the policies.\u201d If businesses are forced to close by a widespread coronavirus outbreak, the ACTU has raised concerns over Australia\u2019s 3.3 million casual workers who are not entitled to paid sick leave. \u201cOne in three workers have no paid sick leave. Governments have allowed this casualisation to happen. It needs to be reversed,\u201d ACTU president Sally McManus said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people with the virus or people with symptoms going to work, but they are going to have to choose between paying the bills and feeding themselves or going to work.\u201d McManus said casual employees should be offered paid leave if they are forced to self-isolate, with employers compensated later. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has revised its global macro outlook and its baseline growth forecasts for all G20 economies, slashing Australia\u2019s projected growth by more than a quarter. Moody\u2019s had projected Australia\u2019s economy to grow at 1.8% for the quarter; on an \u201cextended and prolonged slump\u201d, that figure is now forecast to be 1.3%. Simultaneous global supply and demand side shocks will slow economic activity across the first half of the year. \u201cGlobal recession risks have risen. The full extent of the economic costs will be unclear for some time. Fear of contagion will dampen consumer and business activity. The longer it takes for households and businesses to resume normal activity, the greater the economic impact,\u201d Moody\u2019s March 2020 global macro outlook argued. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said Australia was not at a \u201ctipping point\u201d with the virus, and that there remained only one confirmed case of human-to-human transmission occurring in Australia. The Australian government\u2019s Healthdirect hotline \u2013 1800 022 222 \u2013 crashed through an overload on Monday, and the Coronavirus Health Information Line \u2013 1800 020 080 \u2013was experiencing significant delays.",

No, seriously. In, to our knowledge, the first ever instance of this happening, Sherry was <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/7/21168226/rupaul-drag-race-disqualifies-sherry-pie-catfishing-sexual-harassment\">officially disqualified</a> and disregarded from this season after allegations of some fairly extreme catfishing. There was talk that she might be edited out altogether, but she clearly hasn\u2019t been. Of course, Drag Race is filmed well in advance, so it\u2019s not like they were able to boot her off the show. On Friday, VH1 and World Of Wonder released a statement saying; \u201cIn light of recent developments and Sherry Pie\u2019s statement, Sherry Pie has been disqualified from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Out of respect for the hard work of the other queens, VH1 will air the season as planned.

She makes an, admittedly, quite niche reference to something Fergie said after she sang the national anthem in 2018. Unsurprisingly, the other girls don\u2019t get it. We\u2019re on Jan\u2019s side with this - Fergie is a true chanteuse and poet of our times, and anyone who isn\u2019t aware of every single thing she\u2019s ever done needs to open the fridge and have a good think.</p> <p>Fifth in and looking STUNNING, it\u2019s Milwaukee\u2019s Jaida Essence Hall. She says she\u2019s \u201chere to slay the competition\u201d. How original. That said, this is our favourite entrance look of the whole season so far, with the possible exception of Gigi\u2019s harlots of the high seas look last week. Ahoy.</p> <p>Aiden Zhane follows up, in a look that\u2019s striking, original and current. She says \u201cthere isn\u2019t really a drag queen out there that you can compare me to.\u201d Well Aiden, for your information, you\u2019re not <em>that</em> original and there are actually several drag queens out there that we can compare you to. We just can\u2019t think of any right now.</p> <h2>Minichallenge</h2> <p>Again, the queens are tasked to model spring and fall looks. It was a bit discombobulating last week, but now we get it. It lets the judges and audiences get accustomed to the queens and their aesthetics. One of Drag Race\u2019s flaws is that, while the joy is in the hectricity (is that a word?) sometimes it\u2019s a bit <em>too</em> hectic and you have issues remembering who\u2019s who. This new format puts a bit of a stopper on that.</p> <p>Jan seems to be wearing Courtney Act\u2019s face. Jaida looks incredible again. At one point, RuPaul says \u201cpunch my titties\u201d for no reason, and everyone laughs hysterically. Both of Rock M. Sakura\u2019s looks are, as we would put it here in jolly old England, camp dear! \u201cTV has raised and shaped me into the person I am today,\u201d she says. We relate.</p> <h2>Naomi Forgot-My-Smalls</h2> <p>Everyone\u2019s de-dragging and Dahlia \u201cforgot\u201d to wear underwear. The thing about \u201cforgetting\u201d your underwear, is that it makes people fancy you and gets you extra airtime. We see you Dahlia. Also it totally worked, we really fancy Dahlia.

There\u2019s scope for chair-throwing and anything with chair-throwing is a-ok with me. If you want proof, just watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCLxJd1d84s\">The Pussycat Dolls\u2019 \u201cButtons\u201d music video</a>. Everyone\u2019s talking about Fosse but no-one seems to actually know who or what Fosse is. Inevitably, the queens are soon fighting.</p> <h2>Sissy that walk</h2> <p>Ross Matthews is here being exhausting as usual, plus the always gorgeous Michelle Visage and, in a stroke of producing genius, guest judges Thandie Newton and Robyn! Thandie\u2019s bringing strong overexcited mom energy and we love it. She looks ecstatic to be there and comes armed with the best quips. Robyn\u2019s keeping that Swedish cool as always, a breezy blow dry and the hint of a smile. Hi, Robyn.</p> <p>The runway category is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulle_(netting)\">\u201ctulle\u201d</a> (not tool as I originally thought, which explains the surprising lack of hammers). Dahlia Sin\u2019s 80s look is 10/10 stunning. Jan looks great too in a space-age construction getup.</p> <h2>Lipsync for your LIFE</h2> <p>Jaida Essence Hall and the queen that shall not be named are in the top two, lipsyncing to the best pop song ever made (don\u2019t @ us, we don\u2019t have Twitter) Robyn\u2019s Call Your Girlfriend. Jaida is SMOULDERING as she languorously removes her bracelet. Goosebumps. And she scoops the five thousand dooooollar prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/trixiemtteIs/status/1236230767522598913\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">jaida essence hall really performed a lip sync by herself on the premier of rupaul\u2019s drag race s12 that\u2019s my girl <a href=\"https://t.co/Tp09BCXdos\">pic.twitter.com/Tp09BCXdos</a></p>&mdash; \ud835\udcbd (@trixiemtteIs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trixiemtteIs/status/1236230767522598913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Shadiest moment</strong><em> </em>Last week\u2019s queens all saying \u201cmeh\u201d in unison.

Meet the Queens Again \u2026 WHAT. IS. HAPPENING. Rock M. Sakura hurricanes into the work room, screeches something unintelligible, then sort of half collapses half throws herself on the floor and starts rotating. She\u2019s dressed head-to-toe in shimmering pink and white Japanese-inspired finery. \u201cIs it cultural appropriation?\u201d she cackles \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d Crikey. Dahlia Sin\u2019s next, and she\u2019s here to take your man. She\u2019s giving Britney Spears circa 2001 \u2026 if Britney Spears had clip on earrings and a huge chest tattoo of what could be either the illuminati sign or a Toblerone. \u201cHope ya saved room for dessert, \u2018cuz I brought pie!\u201d It\u2019s Sherry Pie, but no need to remember that \u2013 she\u2019s already been disqualified. No, seriously. In, to our knowledge, the first ever instance of this happening, Sherry was officially disqualified and disregarded from this season after allegations of some fairly extreme catfishing. There was talk that she might be edited out altogether, but she clearly hasn\u2019t been. Of course, Drag Race is filmed well in advance, so it\u2019s not like they were able to boot her off the show. On Friday, VH1 and World Of Wonder released a statement saying; \u201cIn light of recent developments and Sherry Pie\u2019s statement, Sherry Pie has been disqualified from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Out of respect for the hard work of the other queens, VH1 will air the season as planned. Sherry will not appear in the grand finale scheduled to be filmed later this spring.\u201d Next, clad in sequin sportswear, it\u2019s Jan! She makes an, admittedly, quite niche reference to something Fergie said after she sang the national anthem in 2018. Unsurprisingly, the other girls don\u2019t get it. We\u2019re on Jan\u2019s side with this - Fergie is a true chanteuse and poet of our times, and anyone who isn\u2019t aware of every single thing she\u2019s ever done needs to open the fridge and have a good think. Fifth in and looking STUNNING, it\u2019s Milwaukee\u2019s Jaida Essence Hall. She says she\u2019s \u201chere to slay the competition\u201d. How original. That said, this is our favourite entrance look of the whole season so far, with the possible exception of Gigi\u2019s harlots of the high seas look last week. Ahoy. Aiden Zhane follows up, in a look that\u2019s striking, original and current. She says \u201cthere isn\u2019t really a drag queen out there that you can compare me to.\u201d Well Aiden, for your information, you\u2019re not that original and there are actually several drag queens out there that we can compare you to. We just can\u2019t think of any right now. Minichallenge Again, the queens are tasked to model spring and fall looks. It was a bit discombobulating last week, but now we get it. It lets the judges and audiences get accustomed to the queens and their aesthetics. One of Drag Race\u2019s flaws is that, while the joy is in the hectricity (is that a word?) sometimes it\u2019s a bit too hectic and you have issues remembering who\u2019s who. This new format puts a bit of a stopper on that. Jan seems to be wearing Courtney Act\u2019s face. Jaida looks incredible again. At one point, RuPaul says \u201cpunch my titties\u201d for no reason, and everyone laughs hysterically. Both of Rock M. Sakura\u2019s looks are, as we would put it here in jolly old England, camp dear! \u201cTV has raised and shaped me into the person I am today,\u201d she says. We relate. Naomi Forgot-My-Smalls Everyone\u2019s de-dragging and Dahlia \u201cforgot\u201d to wear underwear. The thing about \u201cforgetting\u201d your underwear, is that it makes people fancy you and gets you extra airtime. We see you Dahlia. Also it totally worked, we really fancy Dahlia. What\u2019s her Instagram handle? Maxichallenge This week they\u2019re teaming up to do a jazz number \u2013 this is a good idea. There\u2019s scope for chair-throwing and anything with chair-throwing is a-ok with me. If you want proof, just watch The Pussycat Dolls\u2019 \u201cButtons\u201d music video. Everyone\u2019s talking about Fosse but no-one seems to actually know who or what Fosse is. Inevitably, the queens are soon fighting. Sissy that walk Ross Matthews is here being exhausting as usual, plus the always gorgeous Michelle Visage and, in a stroke of producing genius, guest judges Thandie Newton and Robyn! Thandie\u2019s bringing strong overexcited mom energy and we love it. She looks ecstatic to be there and comes armed with the best quips. Robyn\u2019s keeping that Swedish cool as always, a breezy blow dry and the hint of a smile. Hi, Robyn. The runway category is \u201ctulle\u201d (not tool as I originally thought, which explains the surprising lack of hammers). Dahlia Sin\u2019s 80s look is 10/10 stunning. Jan looks great too in a space-age construction getup. Lipsync for your LIFE Jaida Essence Hall and the queen that shall not be named are in the top two, lipsyncing to the best pop song ever made (don\u2019t @ us, we don\u2019t have Twitter) Robyn\u2019s Call Your Girlfriend. Jaida is SMOULDERING as she languorously removes her bracelet. Goosebumps. And she scoops the five thousand dooooollar prize. Notes and observations Shadiest moment Last week\u2019s queens all saying \u201cmeh\u201d in unison. A unison \u201cmeh\u201d is always a winner. Catchphrase watch \u201cI\u2019m frightened but fascinated\u201d. Patent it, market it, shove it on a t-shirt, take our money. Animal print hunt Tepidly tame at only TWO garments this week \u2013 Thandie\u2019s giraffe-print outfit and Jan\u2019s crocodile skin fall look. And we\u2019re being generous because crocodile skin doesn\u2019t really count as animal print. Just between us squirlfriends We said it last week cast and we\u2019ll say it again \u2013 the absence of trans contestants is all too noticeable. This week\u2019s episode was, it\u2019s probably fair to say, quite a lot weaker than last week\u2019s. A couple of great stand-out stars though, and the dynamics will inevitably shift when the two casts are thrown together. So on to week three, when the fun will really begin. Start. Your. Engines.",

The word in Italy is that Stefano Pioli is also ready to try to lure Arsenal striker <strong>Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang</strong> to Milan, by leaving a trail of breadcrumbs between the Emirates and San Siro. Still struggling to nail down a first-team place at Manchester City, <strong>John Stones</strong> could renew acquaintances with his club\u2019s former assistant manager Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, whose considerably more slapstick approach to defending might be more suited to a man of his talents. Arteta is also believed to be harbouring notions of reintegrating Armenian midfielder <strong>Henrikh Mkhitaryan</strong> into the Arsenal squad once his loan spell at Roma concludes.</p> <p><strong>Borna Barisic</strong> has caught the eye playing at left-back for Rangers this season and will leave Ibrox during the summer according to his agent. With more than three years left on his contract, the Croatian is valued at \u00a322m and has been heavily linked with a move to Tottenham. \u201cRangers won\u2019t be able to keep Borna after the season he\u2019s had, even though he\u2019s just signed a new contract,\u201d said Ives Cakarun. \u201cBorna\u2019s priority right now is Rangers, who have made significant progress this season under the management of Steven Gerrard.\u201d The 27-year-old has also got antennae twitching in Italy, where both Roma and Milan are eyeing his situation with interest.</p> <p>Having lit up the league with his occasionally chaotic but often effective performances on the wing for Newcastle, <strong>Allan Saint-Maximin</strong> is wanted by Everton. Newcastle, who paid \u00a316.5m to bring the Frenchman to St James\u2019 Park from Nice last summer, could realistically hope to double their money for a player that is also wanted by Crystal Palace. With <strong>Wilfried Zaha</strong> expected to leave Selhurst Park this summer for pastures unspecified but more glamorous, Roy Hodgson is in the market for a replacement for his team\u2019s most important player.</p> <p>And finally, Rumour Mill staple <strong>Timo Werner</strong> remains a long-term target for Liverpool, with German newspaper Bild reporting the Premier League champions elect may sign him this summer and then loan him back to the Bundesliga outfit for one more season before bringing him to Merseyside.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 11 March 2020.

      "bodyText": "Following the latest in a long line of excellent displays for Sheffield United against Norwich City on Saturday, on-loan goalkeeper Dean Henderson is reported to have been telling teammates that his parent club, Manchester United, have guaranteed him first-team football football next season although not necessarily as a replacement for David de Gea. If the Spaniard remains at Old Trafford and stays fit and in decent form, Henderson may remain at Bramall Lane, although reports in today\u2019s press suggest Chelsea would like to bring the 22-year-old to Stamford Bridge. With Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s future under Frank Lampard shrouded in uncertainty, Chelsea are also reported to be interested in Barcelona\u2019s Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, should the German agitate for a move away from the Camp Nou. Tottenham central defender Jan Vertonghen will be a free agent in the summer and Inter are ready to make him an offer he\u2019ll find difficult to refuse. The word in Italy is that Stefano Pioli is also ready to try to lure Arsenal striker Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang to Milan, by leaving a trail of breadcrumbs between the Emirates and San Siro. Still struggling to nail down a first-team place at Manchester City, John Stones could renew acquaintances with his club\u2019s former assistant manager Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, whose considerably more slapstick approach to defending might be more suited to a man of his talents. Arteta is also believed to be harbouring notions of reintegrating Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan into the Arsenal squad once his loan spell at Roma concludes. Borna Barisic has caught the eye playing at left-back for Rangers this season and will leave Ibrox during the summer according to his agent. With more than three years left on his contract, the Croatian is valued at \u00a322m and has been heavily linked with a move to Tottenham. \u201cRangers won\u2019t be able to keep Borna after the season he\u2019s had, even though he\u2019s just signed a new contract,\u201d said Ives Cakarun. \u201cBorna\u2019s priority right now is Rangers, who have made significant progress this season under the management of Steven Gerrard.\u201d The 27-year-old has also got antennae twitching in Italy, where both Roma and Milan are eyeing his situation with interest. Having lit up the league with his occasionally chaotic but often effective performances on the wing for Newcastle, Allan Saint-Maximin is wanted by Everton. Newcastle, who paid \u00a316.5m to bring the Frenchman to St James\u2019 Park from Nice last summer, could realistically hope to double their money for a player that is also wanted by Crystal Palace. With Wilfried Zaha expected to leave Selhurst Park this summer for pastures unspecified but more glamorous, Roy Hodgson is in the market for a replacement for his team\u2019s most important player. And finally, Rumour Mill staple Timo Werner remains a long-term target for Liverpool, with German newspaper Bild reporting the Premier League champions elect may sign him this summer and then loan him back to the Bundesliga outfit for one more season before bringing him to Merseyside. \u2022 This article was corrected on 11 March 2020. An earlier version stated that Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen is Dutch rather than German, and suggested that Roberto Mancini, not Stefano Pioli, is the current manager of Milan.",

He has been working tirelessly to get younger people into the movement, going into pupil referral units to teach students about the climate emergency. \u201cThey are so engaged,\u201d Scott says. \u201cIt gives you so much hope for the future.\u201d</p> <p>The 16-year-old Londoner Jessica Ahmed says she used to think: \u201cClimate change doesn\u2019t affect me. It\u2019s not an African-person problem.\u201d But she became an activist after attending the May 2019 school climate strikes. \u201cI\u2019ve never fallen behind with school,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I\u2019m more on track than most people who don\u2019t go on the strikes.\u201d She now organises for the UK Student Climate Network, mobilising her classmates. \u201cIt sucks that we have to miss school,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we need to make our voices heard because it\u2019s us that are going to be the most affected by climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Like Ahmed, the Manchester-based pupil Lillia Adetero, aged 10,<strong> </strong>has been striking from school, attending the Fridays for Future protests since January 2019.

I was out every day, delivering thousands of leaflets for 10 hours at a time.\u201d</p> <p>Fatima Ibrahim, 27, from London, is a codirector of the Green New Deal UK, which lobbies for the British government to put the climate crisis at the heart of the economic system, rather than seeing it as a stand-alone issue. \u201cWe have an economic system that isn\u2019t working for the climate,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need a system-wide change.\u201d Her activism is cutting through: the Green New Deal was included in the 2019 Labour and Green manifestos.</p> <p>Many BAME activists feel a connection to the cause because they have family members in the vulnerable global south. Ibrahim is of Somalian heritage; her parents moved to the UK from Canada when she was nine. Climate activism has been her life\u2019s work. \u201cI was that crazy nine-year-old who watched Newsnight,\u201d she says. \u201cComing from a refugee family made me aware of everything that was going on in the world.

Pedro (aged 32), Olivier Giroud (33) and Willian (31) have all been out in the cold at times this season, but their professionalism has never dipped. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cThat is football, whether you\u2019re four months from the end of your contract or out of the team for a month.\u201d <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/08/chelsea-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea 4-0 Everton</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cf164b7fb1e2953021e04bcca4b602f28d82d3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cf164b7fb1e2953021e04bcca4b602f28d82d3a/0_170_4902_2943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willian celebrates scoring for Chelsea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willian celebrates scoring for Chelsea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6) Ayew being served by Hodgson\u2019s faith</h2> <p>Tim Sherwood described Jordan Ayew as \u201cperfectly suited to the Premier League\u201d when he brought him to Aston Villa from France. It\u2019s only taken five years but Sherwood\u2019s perspicacity has been proven once more. Ayew, now 28, scored his second consecutive winner for Crystal Palace on Saturday, a right-footed pearler bent beyond Ben Foster to seal a 1-0 victory over Watford. It was his eighth league goal this season, the same total the Ghanaian managed in the previous two seasons combined and just one fewer than in his two years at Villa. \u201cHe\u2019s got stronger, but we saw signs of that player in him last year when he wasn\u2019t succeeding quite so well\u201d, says Roy Hodgson now. Hodgson knows Ayew\u2019s athleticism is a key quality, as is his persistence. That he is now also proving decisive in front of goal makes him a valuable asset. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford</a></em></p> <h2>7) Milner offers a timely reminder of his class</h2> <p>The celebration that greeted James Milner\u2019s spectacular goalline clearance from Ryan Fraser on Saturday was not far short of Anfield\u2019s reaction to Mohamed Salah\u2019s and Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s goals against Bournemouth. In terms of restoring momentum ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Champions League meeting with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Milner\u2019s contribution was again invaluable. The veteran\u2019s return to fitness, along with that of Jordan Henderson, who resumed training on Sunday after a hamstring injury, is as well-timed as the clearance was for J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like if we spoke just about what he\u2019s doing off the pitch, but on Saturday he showed why he\u2019s so important on it,\u201d the Liverpool manager said of Milner, who filled in for Andy Robertson at left-back. \u201cWhy would we extend the contract of a 34-year-old by two years if he\u2019s not incredibly important to everything that we do?\u201d <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/liverpool-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth</a></em></p> <h2>8) Is Henderson England\u2019s best keeper?</h2> <p>Dean Henderson showed off razor-sharp reactions to make an incredible, victory-preserving double-save and is surely now a credible challenger to Jordan Pickford as England goalkeeper. The Manchester United loanee has kept 10 clean sheets in the Premier League and is a key reason why Chris Wilder\u2019s side are seventh. \u201cI\u2019m certain Deano will be England\u2019s No 1 soon; I know he wants to be,\u201d said Billy Sharp, scorer of the winning goal and, at 34, in possession of pretty good reflexes himself. Sharp hopes Henderson\u2019s loan will be extended next season. \u201cDeano\u2019s not going to lie, he wants to be Manchester United\u2019s first choice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if that can\u2019t happen yet, he wants to play here.\u201d And possibly in Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re giving it our best shot,\u201d said Sharp. \u201cThe lads are relishing and embracing it. Why shouldn\u2019t we dream? That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do.\u201d <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/sheffield-united-norwich-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c211697b1928b94b0a5804a60d799293e536061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c211697b1928b94b0a5804a60d799293e536061/0_44_2671_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dean Henderson, left, battles to keep the ball out in Sheffield United\u2019s win over Norwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Henderson, left, battles to keep the ball out in Sheffield United\u2019s win over Norwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Saint-Maximin\u2019s star continues to rise</h2> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever youse wanna write,\u201d said Steve Bruce, indifferent as a journalist suggested there are shades of Adama Traor\u00e9 about Allan Saint-Maximin following the jet-heeled Newcastle winger\u2019s latest star turn. It took Traor\u00e9 time to tap into his talent at Wolves after underwhelming spells at Aston Villa and Middlesbrough and, as much as Saint-Maximin remains a rough diamond, it is difficult to escape the sense that the sky\u2019s the limit for the 22-year-old. His progress at Newcastle has been a slow-burner but Saint-Maximin\u2019s searing pace is proving increasingly difficult for defences to combat. Bruce acknowledged Saint-Maximin offers an X-factor sorely lacking at St James\u2019 Park in recent years. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen him, I suggest you buy a ticket to come and watch him.\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/southampton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Southampton 0-1 Newcastle</a></em></p> <h2>10) Stalemate shows Seagulls\u2019 grit</h2> <p>After dominating Crystal Palace last week but failing to put them away, Brighton responded with one of their most defensively solid performances of the season. Their goalless draw with Wolves marked their first clean sheet since December and Graham Potter was quick to underline the credit he felt his team deserved for allowing top opposition only one shot on target throughout. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come and park the bus or sit back,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe tried to play, so it was a really positive performance away from home.\u201d He was not wrong, but with a tough run of games to come, still no wins in 2020 and the relegation zone calling Brighton\u2019s name, his team needs even better performances in order to survive. <strong>Tumaini

It\u2019s only taken five years but Sherwood\u2019s perspicacity has been proven once more. Ayew, now 28, scored his second consecutive winner for Crystal Palace on Saturday, a right-footed pearler bent beyond Ben Foster to seal a 1-0 victory over Watford. It was his eighth league goal this season, the same total the Ghanaian managed in the previous two seasons combined and just one fewer than in his two years at Villa. \u201cHe\u2019s got stronger, but we saw signs of that player in him last year when he wasn\u2019t succeeding quite so well\u201d, says Roy Hodgson now. Hodgson knows Ayew\u2019s athleticism is a key quality, as is his persistence. That he is now also proving decisive in front of goal makes him a valuable asset. Paul MacInnes \u2022 Match report: Crystal Palace 1-0 Watford 7) Milner offers a timely reminder of his class The celebration that greeted James Milner\u2019s spectacular goalline clearance from Ryan Fraser on Saturday was not far short of Anfield\u2019s reaction to Mohamed Salah\u2019s and Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s goals against Bournemouth. In terms of restoring momentum ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Champions League meeting with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Milner\u2019s contribution was again invaluable. The veteran\u2019s return to fitness, along with that of Jordan Henderson, who resumed training on Sunday after a hamstring injury, is as well-timed as the clearance was for J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t like if we spoke just about what he\u2019s doing off the pitch, but on Saturday he showed why he\u2019s so important on it,\u201d the Liverpool manager said of Milner, who filled in for Andy Robertson at left-back. \u201cWhy would we extend the contract of a 34-year-old by two years if he\u2019s not incredibly important to everything that we do?\u201d Andy Hunter \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 2-1 Bournemouth 8) Is Henderson England\u2019s best keeper? Dean Henderson showed off razor-sharp reactions to make an incredible, victory-preserving double-save and is surely now a credible challenger to Jordan Pickford as England goalkeeper. The Manchester United loanee has kept 10 clean sheets in the Premier League and is a key reason why Chris Wilder\u2019s side are seventh. \u201cI\u2019m certain Deano will be England\u2019s No 1 soon; I know he wants to be,\u201d said Billy Sharp, scorer of the winning goal and, at 34, in possession of pretty good reflexes himself. Sharp hopes Henderson\u2019s loan will be extended next season. \u201cDeano\u2019s not going to lie, he wants to be Manchester United\u2019s first choice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if that can\u2019t happen yet, he wants to play here.\u201d And possibly in Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re giving it our best shot,\u201d said Sharp. \u201cThe lads are relishing and embracing it. Why shouldn\u2019t we dream? That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do.\u201d Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 1-0 Norwich 9) Saint-Maximin\u2019s star continues to rise \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever youse wanna write,\u201d said Steve Bruce, indifferent as a journalist suggested there are shades of Adama Traor\u00e9 about Allan Saint-Maximin following the jet-heeled Newcastle winger\u2019s latest star turn. It took Traor\u00e9 time to tap into his talent at Wolves after underwhelming spells at Aston Villa and Middlesbrough and, as much as Saint-Maximin remains a rough diamond, it is difficult to escape the sense that the sky\u2019s the limit for the 22-year-old. His progress at Newcastle has been a slow-burner but Saint-Maximin\u2019s searing pace is proving increasingly difficult for defences to combat. Bruce acknowledged Saint-Maximin offers an X-factor sorely lacking at St James\u2019 Park in recent years. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen him, I suggest you buy a ticket to come and watch him.\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Southampton 0-1 Newcastle 10) Stalemate shows Seagulls\u2019 grit After dominating Crystal Palace last week but failing to put them away, Brighton responded with one of their most defensively solid performances of the season. Their goalless draw with Wolves marked their first clean sheet since December and Graham Potter was quick to underline the credit he felt his team deserved for allowing top opposition only one shot on target throughout. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come and park the bus or sit back,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe tried to play, so it was a really positive performance away from home.\u201d He was not wrong, but with a tough run of games to come, still no wins in 2020 and the relegation zone calling Brighton\u2019s name, his team needs even better performances in order to survive.

I\u2019m reading about the women on this season for The Bachelor. Some commenters rip apart their fashion choices, others discuss the contestants\u2019 faces, debating endlessly about whether this woman had fillers, that woman had Botox. I\u2019m breastfeeding my baby (it\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m up this late) and while she eats, I\u2019m feeding myself a steady stream of second-hand bile, anger and jealousy.</p> <p>For months, this is how I entertained myself. In the dark, by the light of my phone, I watched as mobs of anonymous users picked at various women, dissecting their choices and their appearances, all under the guise of enlightened \u201csnark\u201d. They tended to alight on certain types of women, people who were outwardly successful and rather privileged. Affluent, white, blond female writers or influencers, such as <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html\">Caroline Calloway</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/scaachikoul/kathleen-hale-goodreads-catfish-crazy-stalker\">Kathleen Hale</a> or (once, way back when) <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2020/02/emily-gould-gawker-shame.html\">Emily Gould</a>.

Sometimes they made interesting points about the expectations that are placed upon women living in 21st-century America. But more often, they were just mean. And I found it all so compelling.</p> <p>Until one day I didn\u2019t. I realized that I was hiking my shoulders up around my neck and clenching the muscles in my back for extended periods of time, forming anxiety-born knots under the skin. I realized that the strange slightly ill feeling in my stomach corresponded with how much time I was spending lurking online. I realized that I had been sharpening my internal claws, thinking meaner and meaner thoughts about the people on my screens and in my life. So just like that, I stopped.</p> <p>But even after I stopped looking, I kept wondering: why did I <em>like</em> this? What made me want to know so much about notorious Instagram influencer Caroline Calloway in the first place? Why was I so invested in how Bachelor contestant Victoria Fuller conducted her sex life?

The Redditors on SmolBeanSnark (a subreddit devoted to hating Calloway) meet up in real life, create crafts inspired by their snarking hobby and, most importantly, spend hours upon hours updating each other on every aspect of Calloway\u2019s life. There is a podcast devoted to Calloway, and so many Twitter accounts. She responds to their comments often on her Instagram account, which is her primary mode of art-making. In a way, her art has become all about her \u201chaters\u201d. They\u2019re existing in this symbiotic, toxic cycle, similar to the cycle of attention that propels US politics. In the age of the internet, almost anything can be entertainment, if you chose to consume it that way.</p> <p>In the 18th century, there was an activity called <em>br\u00fbler les chats,</em> or \u201ccat-burning\u201d. People would enclose live animals in a net or a barrel and throw the whole writhing, screaming container onto a bonfire. They would feel joy at witnessing animals\u2019 pain. Sometimes, they would just burn one cat, and sometimes they would burn dozens. The practice was most common in Belgium and France, but it happened elsewhere, too. According to the Scottish anthropologist James Frazer, Louis XIV <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=3pIa_MgG38MC&amp;pg=PA1532&amp;lpg=PA1532&amp;dq=james+frazer+louis+xiv+burning+cats&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5mLdqcoP8B&amp;sig=ACfU3U0GpucAlpfE41qfyrTLqHyViZTpMA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRkse-9vnnAhUXmXIEHZvDBlUQ6AEwCXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20frazer%20louis%20xiv%20burning%20cats&amp;f=false\">even participated</a> in one ceremony. \u201cCrowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand,\u201d the stylish ruler strode up to the pile of sticks, lit it aflame, and \u201cdanced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards\u201d. Everyone had a grand time, Frazer seems to suggest, save for the poor cats. (A town in Belgium still hosts an annual <em>Kattenstoet,</em> or Festival of the Cats, and while they no longer throw live cats from the town tower, they do have a neutered version where they defenestrate stuffed cats.)</p> <p>Back then, there was a single word for the many elated states that result from pain-watching and horror-witnessing. They called it schadenfreude. According to historian Tiffany Watt Smith, author of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39088528-schadenfreude\">Schadenfreude: The Joy of Another\u2019s Misfortunate</a><em>,</em> this word has no corollary in English (possibly because we don\u2019t want to admit how often we feel it), but it can be most closely translated as either \u201cdamaged joy\u201d or \u201charm-joy\u201d. In a 2018 interview with Science Friday, Watt Smith explains that this word originally covered all sorts of pleasure gained from witnessing misfortune. \u201cWhat happens in the 19th century is that this new term sadism comes in and schadenfreude gets all the fun silly stuff and sadism gets the most serious brutal delight,\u201d says Watt Smith. She argues that we\u2019re living in an age of schadenfreude, thanks in part to the increased role the internet plays in all our lives.</p> <p>For Watt Smith, this isn\u2019t necessarily a negative thing. Emotions \u201call tumble together in a big mess\u201d, so we\u2019re capable of feeling both a little happy about someone\u2019s pain, and genuine empathy at once. It\u2019s not an either/or equation. According to this telling, schadenfreude is a relatively harmless, totally human emotion. It\u2019s the dark corollary to the joy you feel from a like on your photo, a positive comment on your account. While these bits of online affirmation are addicting, so too are the online takedowns, the clapbacks, the snark.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I enjoyed watching the mess because it wasn\u2019t happening to me, and because these women seemed, frankly, kind of mean themselves.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At first, I believed my interest in observing the niche drama of online figures had to do with schadenfreude. I enjoyed watching the mess because it wasn\u2019t happening to me, and because these women seemed, frankly, kind of mean themselves. They were willing to admit to their own unkind actions, which seemed to bring out the unkindness in others. It wasn\u2019t harmful, I thought, to watch this cycle. I wasn\u2019t being mean to anyone! It was even beneficial, from an evolutionary standpoint. I was learning what not to do. I wouldn\u2019t be problematic; I\u2019d never get canceled. And didn\u2019t they sort of deserve to feel bad for being mean girls?</p> <p>But I think that\u2019s letting myself off the hook. If I\u2019m honest with myself, I think the phenomenon is closer to sadism than schadenfreude.

It reminds me of the right wingwacko people I had to deal with when I covered politics.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Lorenz\u2019s life has been impacted by online hate and her experience has showed her how pervasive it is across the spectrum. In 2017, Lorenz was assaulted while covering the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. \u201cWhen I got punched in Charlottesville, the guy who attacked me wasn\u2019t a rightwing extremist,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a leftwing protester who is really anti-media.

They\u2019re emotions we\u2019re capable of thinking about and calibrating, unlike the more primal responses of fear or disgust.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 3am and I\u2019m on Reddit. I\u2019m reading a thread of comments that number in the thousands, scrolling through missive after missive, unpopular opinions, all. I\u2019m reading about the women on this season for The Bachelor. Some commenters rip apart their fashion choices, others discuss the contestants\u2019 faces, debating endlessly about whether this woman had fillers, that woman had Botox. I\u2019m breastfeeding my baby (it\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m up this late) and while she eats, I\u2019m feeding myself a steady stream of second-hand bile, anger and jealousy. For months, this is how I entertained myself. In the dark, by the light of my phone, I watched as mobs of anonymous users picked at various women, dissecting their choices and their appearances, all under the guise of enlightened \u201csnark\u201d. They tended to alight on certain types of women, people who were outwardly successful and rather privileged. Affluent, white, blond female writers or influencers, such as Caroline Calloway, Kathleen Hale or (once, way back when) Emily Gould. Writers who were a little snarky themselves, unapologetically critical, sometimes cruel. Sometimes these anonymous snarkers could be very funny. Sometimes they made interesting points about the expectations that are placed upon women living in 21st-century America. But more often, they were just mean. And I found it all so compelling. Until one day I didn\u2019t. I realized that I was hiking my shoulders up around my neck and clenching the muscles in my back for extended periods of time, forming anxiety-born knots under the skin. I realized that the strange slightly ill feeling in my stomach corresponded with how much time I was spending lurking online. I realized that I had been sharpening my internal claws, thinking meaner and meaner thoughts about the people on my screens and in my life. So just like that, I stopped. But even after I stopped looking, I kept wondering: why did I like this? What made me want to know so much about notorious Instagram influencer Caroline Calloway in the first place? Why was I so invested in how Bachelor contestant Victoria Fuller conducted her sex life? What was it about these dramas that made me want to watch, and what was it about these women that inspired so much gleeful pleasure? \u2022\u2022\u2022 We don\u2019t yet have a word that describes this particular online action. According to a glossary developed by Pen America, there are words for the people who interact with public figures just to be mean (trolls) and words for people who read something just because they dislike the author (hate-reads) and words for the groups that form with the purpose of harassing a single person (dogpiling). But there isn\u2019t a good word for these snark-based communities that spring up around a particular figure or the strange bonds that form between people based on mutual distaste. The Redditors on SmolBeanSnark (a subreddit devoted to hating Calloway) meet up in real life, create crafts inspired by their snarking hobby and, most importantly, spend hours upon hours updating each other on every aspect of Calloway\u2019s life.

The campaign was designed \u201cto intimidate in order to achieve political ends\u201d, he said.</p> <p>In late January, a small homemade bomb <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-hospital/small-suspected-homemade-bomb-explodes-at-hong-kong-hospital-no-injuries-idUSKBN1ZQ0EH\">exploded </a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-hospital/small-suspected-homemade-bomb-explodes-at-hong-kong-hospital-no-injuries-idUSKBN1ZQ0EH\">at Caritas hospital</a>, destroying a toilet cubicle and prompting the evacuation of some patients. In the following days unexploded devices were found at Shenzhen Bay control point and at a train station <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3048604/train-services-hong-kongs-lo-wu-mtr-station-suspended\">near the border with mainland China</a>.</p> <p>Social media messages reportedly claimed responsibility for the devices and made further threats while calling for the closure of borders with mainland China owing to the coronavirus.</p> <p>Some in Hong Kong questioned the timing of the raids and accused police of being heavy-handed. There were also accusations, which the Guardian has not been able to verify, that some arrests were in connection with the pro-democracy protest movement that has swept the region since last June, and in particular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/27/they-surrendered-hong-kong-activists-mull-next-move-as-university-siege-ends\">the siege at Polytechnic University</a>.</p> <p>Trust in the Hong Kong government and police force has plummeted over the past six months.

Police were accused of taking advantage of a lull in protests owing to coronavirus fears to target key figures.</p> <p>Also on Sunday, police were accused of a heavy-handed response to a protest in Tai Po, where people objected to the establishment of a clinic for suspected Covid-19 cases in a high-density residential area.</p> <p>Several people were taken away by police, and attendees including journalists were pepper-sprayed.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong authorities say they have seized \u201csignificant quantities of homemade explosives\u201d and arrested more than a dozen people in raids across the city. Separately, police were accused of overzealous responses at two protests on Sunday, arresting people and pepper-spraying journalists. The pre-dawn raids on Sunday were in connection with an alleged campaign to get the government to close its borders with China to stop the spread of the coronavirus, Hong Kong police said. The force said the raids across 22 locations found electrical equipment, 1.5kg of explosives and 2.6 tonnes of chemicals. Twelve men and five women aged from 21 to 53 were arrested. A senior bomb disposal officer, Alick McWhirter, said officers retrieved three homemade bombs that were \u201cclose to completion\u201d. \u201cSignificant quantities of homemade explosives ready to be used were seized [along with] and an enormous quantity of precursor chemicals ready to be manufactured into yet more homemade explosives \u2013 over 2,500kg of chemicals\u201d, McWhirter said. He said Hong Kong had faced \u201can ongoing bombing campaign \u2026 that has been both violent and indiscriminate\u201d. The campaign was designed \u201cto intimidate in order to achieve political ends\u201d, he said. In late January, a small homemade bomb exploded at Caritas hospital, destroying a toilet cubicle and prompting the evacuation of some patients. In the following days unexploded devices were found at Shenzhen Bay control point and at a train station near the border with mainland China. Social media messages reportedly claimed responsibility for the devices and made further threats while calling for the closure of borders with mainland China owing to the coronavirus. Some in Hong Kong questioned the timing of the raids and accused police of being heavy-handed. There were also accusations, which the Guardian has not been able to verify, that some arrests were in connection with the pro-democracy protest movement that has swept the region since last June, and in particular the siege at Polytechnic University. Trust in the Hong Kong government and police force has plummeted over the past six months. Last week, three high-profile pro-democracy figures were arrested including Jimmy Lai, the head of the popular newspaper Apple Daily, on charges of illegal assembly. Police were accused of taking advantage of a lull in protests owing to coronavirus fears to target key figures. Also on Sunday, police were accused of a heavy-handed response to a protest in Tai Po, where people objected to the establishment of a clinic for suspected Covid-19 cases in a high-density residential area. Several people were taken away by police, and attendees including journalists were pepper-sprayed. Prior to the protest police said the gathering was unlawful and warned against violence and \u201cillegal acts of roadblocking\u201d. According to the South China Morning Post, protesters chanted pro-democracy slogans commonly heard over the past six months. Man Nim-chi, an opposition district councillor for Tai Po, told the paper she was pepper-sprayed despite standing near journalists to act as an observer. \u201cBut one officer rushed in my direction and pepper-sprayed me in the face. It is sheer abuse of power,\u201d she said. Hui Nick Lam, a district councillor for Tai Po, told Hong Kong Free Press the police had gone \u201coverboard\u201d.

      "body": "<h2>What is Europe\u2019s green deal?</h2> <p>The European Green Deal aims to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/european-green-deal-will-change-economy-to-solve-climate-crisis-says-eu\">transform the 27-country bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy</a>, without reducing prosperity and while improving people\u2019s quality of life, through cleaner air and water, better health and a thriving natural world.</p> <p>If that sounds ambitious, it is. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it \u201cEurope\u2019s man on the moon moment\u201d. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic.</p> <p>Nearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution.</p> <p>Previous attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual.</p> <h2>How will it work?</h2> <p>The green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets \u2013 a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core \u2013 alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:53:19/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:53:19/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>All of the EU\u2019s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of \u201c50 actions for 2050\u201d for other sectors.</p> <p>Jobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. \u201cThe European green deal is our new growth strategy \u2013 a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,\u201d von der Leyen said.</p> <h2>What is the legal basis?</h2> <p>All of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals.</p> <p>East European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK \u2013 which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda \u2013 will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP.</p> <p>The new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill.</p> <p>But what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans \u2013 charged with delivering the green deal \u2013 will throw all of its might behind the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,\u201d says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. \u201cIt will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7564b0a99db119b122cfb0db2eba11c9896bbe03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7564b0a99db119b122cfb0db2eba11c9896bbe03/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What is the European Green Deal?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Will the green deal make a difference?</h2> <p>It needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 \u2013 good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that \u2013 disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:55:40/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-05T15:55:40/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>On other environmental scores, the EU\u2019s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s. Dozens of harmful chemicals have been phased out, farm animal welfare standards raised and recycling rates beat most of the world.</p> <p>But alongside those successes, the natural world has suffered a calamity across the continent: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/europe-faces-biodiversity-oblivion-after-collapse-in-french-bird-populations\">birds</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/12/car-splatometer-tests-reveal-huge-decline-number-insects\">insects</a>, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/redlist/mammals/status.htm\">mammals</a>, fish \u2026 few creatures (other than humans) have had a good time of it since the EU was created in 1992. </p> <h2><strong>How much will it cost and where will the money come from?</strong></h2> <p>At least \u20ac1 tn (\u00a3852bn) needs to be found over the next decade, according to the European commission. The biggest share, \u20ac503bn, should come from the EU budget, unleashing a further \u20ac114bn from national governments (because EU programmes often require a contribution from member states).</p> <p>The next \u20ac279bn would come mostly from the private sector: the idea is that companies would be encouraged to make risky green investments by loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, the EU lender, which recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/european-investment-bank-to-phase-out-fossil-fuels-financing\">pledged to phase out loans to fossil fuel </a>projects.</p> <p>On top of this Brussels has promised a \u20ac100bn \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism to help retrain workers who lose jobs in shuttered coal mines or steel factories.</p> <h2>But is it <em>really </em>\u20ac1 tn?</h2> <p>Even friendly experts detect wishful accounting in Brussels\u2019 figures. Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the \u20ac503bn from the EU budget as \u201cgreen investment\u201d, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to \u201cgreen\u201d the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU\u2019s auditors<a href=\"https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/INSR17_21/INSR_GREENING_EN.pdf\"> highlighted</a> how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out \u201cgreen\u201d cash with little oversight.</p> <p>Others fear that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/european-green-deal-polish-miners\"> carbon financiers will game the system</a>, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don\u2019t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four \u201cfrugal\u201d net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The \u20ac503bn is not even in the bank.</p> <p>Even if the EU realised its \u20ac1tn plan, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. Bruegel argues the \u20ac1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission\u2019s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/spain-to-close-most-coal-mines-after-striking-250m-deal\">Arag\u00f3n</a> to Silesia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed054ca77c4077958a8d6d8ff654e3943dc5fb9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed054ca77c4077958a8d6d8ff654e3943dc5fb9b/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Why does the green deal matter internationally?</h2> <p>This year \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world\u2019s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible.</p> <p>But the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">fell short of what is required to stay below 2C</a>, and since 2015 the world\u2019s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after.</p> <p>But enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/donald-trump-climate-crisis-exit-paris-agreement\">Donald Trump\u2019s US</a>, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The key player will be China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/30/obama-calls-paris-climate-talks-an-act-defiance-wake-recent-attacks\">pact between the US and China</a> was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone.</p> <p>\u201cEU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,\u201d says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. \u201cIn the face of Trump\u2019s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world\u2019s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.\u201d</p> <h2>What do critics say?</h2> <p>The EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank.</p> <p>He points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. \u201cThe AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won\u2019t be going carbon-neutral,\u201d says Grant. \u201cThis will increase the electoral strength of populists.\u201d</p> <p>Some leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/eu-green-deal-greenwash-ursula-von-der-leyen-climate\">wrote in the Guardian</a>: \u201cWill there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.\u201d</p> <h2>Will the UK be affected?</h2> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/these-three-post-brexit-bills-bulldoze-a-hole-through-environmental-protections\">various loopholes</a> that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees.</p> <p>The UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK\u2019s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot.</p> <p>On the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What\u2019s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim.

      "bodyText": "What is Europe\u2019s green deal? The European Green Deal aims to transform the 27-country bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy, without reducing prosperity and while improving people\u2019s quality of life, through cleaner air and water, better health and a thriving natural world. If that sounds ambitious, it is. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it \u201cEurope\u2019s man on the moon moment\u201d. Nothing similar has been attempted before, as the pattern of human progress since the industrial revolution has been one of relentless exploitation and despoilment of the natural world, filling the atmosphere with carbon and the seas with plastic. Nearly every major aspect of the European economy will have to be overhauled, from energy generation to food consumption, from transport to manufacturing and construction. In part, this will build on two decades of work in a few of these sectors, such as directives mandating renewable energy and cutting air pollution. Previous attempts were piecemeal, limited in scope and sometimes flaccid in execution. Energy-intensive industries, for instance, have been covered by an emissions trading scheme since 2005, but political pressure kept the price of carbon low, rendering it largely ineffectual. How will it work? The green deal will work through a framework of regulation and legislation setting clear overarching targets \u2013 a bloc-wide goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a 50%-55% cut in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels) are supposed to be at the core \u2013 alongside incentives to encourage private sector investment, with action plans for key sectors and goals such as halting species loss, cutting waste and better use of natural resources. All of the EU\u2019s budget will be subject to checks to ensure it is spent in ways that benefit the environment. That includes the common agricultural policy, scorned by green campaigners for promoting intensive farming, which will retain farm subsidies but direct more to green measures. Science, research and development budgets will take on more of a low-carbon slant, and there will be a detailed roadmap of \u201c50 actions for 2050\u201d for other sectors. Jobs will be created, the commission believes, in new high-tech industries from renewable energy to electric vehicle manufacturing and sustainable building, and efficiencies in resource use will repay the cost of the changes. \u201cThe European green deal is our new growth strategy \u2013 a strategy for growth that gives back more than it takes away,\u201d von der Leyen said. What is the legal basis? All of this will require myriad changes and detailed measures, which will have to pass through tortuous EU processes, requiring the approval of all member states and parliament, so the details will inevitably be subject to horse-trading and backroom deals. East European states have been promised financial incentives, as their economies are more fossil fuel dependent. The backing of the UK \u2013 which despite covertly watering down some measures in the past has broadly pushed for the low-carbon agenda \u2013 will be missed, predicts Jean Lambert, the former Green party MEP. The new European parliament also has more rightwing MEPs, so it may be harder to pass some measures, she says. The hole that Brexit has created in the EU budget will also be hard to fill. But what is clear is that the incoming presidency under von der Leyen and her vice-president, Frans Timmermans \u2013 charged with delivering the green deal \u2013 will throw all of its might behind the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be straightforward to get all this through,\u201d says Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental group E3G. \u201cIt will be a typical EU process. But it has become the touchstone issue for this commission.\u201d Will the green deal make a difference? It needs to. Europe has cut emissions by roughly one quarter since 1990 \u2013 good but nowhere near enough to put the bloc on track to net zero by mid-century. Current measures will not suffice for that \u2013 disruptive change is required, which is why the green deal targets are key. On other environmental scores, the EU\u2019s record is mixed. There have been vast improvements in areas such as air and water quality across EU states, western and eastern, in the past five decades, spurred by EU regulations since the 1980s. Dozens of harmful chemicals have been phased out, farm animal welfare standards raised and recycling rates beat most of the world. But alongside those successes, the natural world has suffered a calamity across the continent: birds, insects, mammals, fish \u2026 few creatures (other than humans) have had a good time of it since the EU was created in 1992. How much will it cost and where will the money come from? At least \u20ac1 tn (\u00a3852bn) needs to be found over the next decade, according to the European commission. The biggest share, \u20ac503bn, should come from the EU budget, unleashing a further \u20ac114bn from national governments (because EU programmes often require a contribution from member states). The next \u20ac279bn would come mostly from the private sector: the idea is that companies would be encouraged to make risky green investments by loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, the EU lender, which recently pledged to phase out loans to fossil fuel projects. On top of this Brussels has promised a \u20ac100bn \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism to help retrain workers who lose jobs in shuttered coal mines or steel factories. But is it really \u20ac1 tn? Even friendly experts detect wishful accounting in Brussels\u2019 figures. Economists at the Bruegel thinktank say it is a stretch to consider the \u20ac503bn from the EU budget as \u201cgreen investment\u201d, as much of the money would be spent on traditional EU policies such as farm subsidies. Previous attempts to \u201cgreen\u201d the common agricultural policy have failed dismally. In a damning report in 2017, the EU\u2019s auditors highlighted how farmers were being paid to undertake environmentally friendly measures they would have done anyway, such as crop rotation, while governments handed out \u201cgreen\u201d cash with little oversight. Others fear that carbon financiers will game the system, meaning EU cash fails to trigger truly green investment from the private sector. And don\u2019t forget, EU governments last month failed to agree a new seven-year budget, with four \u201cfrugal\u201d net payers leading the charge to cut EU spending. The \u20ac503bn is not even in the bank. Even if the EU realised its \u20ac1tn plan, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. Bruegel argues the \u20ac1tn is only one third of what is needed, if the EU follows through with the commission\u2019s plan to reduce European greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55% by 2030. Meanwhile, critics in eastern countries complain there is not enough money to help coal regions. In 2015 there were 128 coal mines alone in the EU employing more than 238,000 people from Arag\u00f3n to Silesia. Why does the green deal matter internationally? This year \u2013 coronavirus permitting \u2013 will see the most important international climate meeting since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Then, all of the world\u2019s functioning states signed up to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2C, and preferably to below 1.5C, beyond which the ravages of climate breakdown become catastrophic and irreversible. But the national pledges made at Paris on curbing greenhouse gases fell short of what is required to stay below 2C, and since 2015 the world\u2019s carbon output has risen by 4%. At the Cop26 climate talks, to be held in Glasgow this November, nations are supposed to come up with tougher targets for 2030, and preferably also with goals for reaching net zero emissions by mid-century, or soon after. But enthusiasm has ebbed since Paris, from Donald Trump\u2019s US, to Brazil, India and big oil producers such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. The key player will be China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and second biggest economy. At Paris, a pact between the US and China was the core of the deal. This time, the EU must bring China to the table alone. \u201cEU climate leadership [in the form of] the green deal is crucial to putting pressure on China and other major emitters to make more ambitious climate commitments,\u201d says Paul Bledsoe, a climate adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, who has attended more than a dozen climate negotiations since the 1990s. \u201cIn the face of Trump\u2019s climate nihilism, only the EU can show that the world\u2019s largest economy can decarbonise while continuing to provide a high standard of living for its 500 million people.\u201d What do critics say? The EU will face a backlash from its citizens, fuelled by populist politicians, for persisting with green policies, predicts Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank. He points to the gilets jaunes protests in France, which took off after rises in fuel taxes intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the rise of the AFD in Germany. \u201cThe AFD is fuelled partly by climate scepticism. Populists are keen to promote anti-greenery, as they listen to voters,\u201d he says. \u201cThe green agenda will meet more and more opposition as voters start to realise it will make them poorer and affect their lifestyles, and they will worry about Europe becoming less competitive than, say, India and China, which won\u2019t be going carbon-neutral,\u201d says Grant. \u201cThis will increase the electoral strength of populists.\u201d Some leftwing campaigners have also attacked the plans. Taking issue with the \u201cjust transition\u201d mechanism, Yanis Varoufakis and David Adler of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, wrote in the Guardian: \u201cWill there be justice for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.\u201d Will the UK be affected? Boris Johnson\u2019s government has made it clear that the UK wants to depart from EU environmental standards after Brexit. The post-Brexit environment bill, agriculture bill and fisheries bill now going through the British parliament contain various loopholes that green campaigners say would reduce in the UK the environmental protections that current EU law guarantees. The UK does officially have a 25-year environment plan, with the government pledging to leave the UK\u2019s natural realm in a better state than this generation inherited, but how that will hold up after Brexit is moot. On the climate crisis, the UK is aligned with the EU. Last summer, a target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law, and all major parties are pledged to uphold it. What\u2019s missing, though, is a clear plan of action to meet the net zero aim. That is what Europe\u2019s green deal is meant to provide, and unless the UK forms its own parallel plans soon, its 2050 target will look increasingly adrift. Who are the green agitators in Europe? The idea of a Green New Deal has been kicking around US politics since at least 2006. The European Green Deal (minus the word \u201cnew\u2019 with its radical overtones) is not yet one year old. The EU plan resulted when an unexpected political leader collided with newly-elected MEPs, energised by the global climate movement. Von der Leyen, a German defence minister, was a surprise choice to become European commission president, leapfrogging candidates who had run in the European elections in May. Those elections resulted in a record number of seats for European Greens, as climate change topped the agenda in Germany and the Nordic countries. Von der Leyen\u2019s last-minute elevation angered the European parliament, pressuring her to lean to the left, liberals and Greens to gain support. To win MEPs over, she promised a European Green Deal within 100 days of taking office. Beyond the Brussels power play, politicians were responding to the streets, as school children walked out of their classrooms, demanding action. The school strike was personal. Chief executives, heads of government and senior UN officials told EU officials their children were asking what they were doing to save the planet. As one official recounts: \u201cYou can imagine a conversation with your own children is much more confrontational than a conversation with a shareholder, or a bad headline in a newspaper.\u201d Who\u2019s in favour, who\u2019s against? It\u2019s a bit like world peace: everyone backs the European Green Deal, in theory. But there is a big hole in the ambition to be net-zero by 2050: Poland, which says it will reach climate neutrality at \u201cits own pace\u201d. And beneath the surface, tensions over Europe\u2019s green ambitions are not hard to find. At least eight countries, including Spain, Sweden and Latvia, want the EU to increase its 2030 emissions reduction target. Poland and Hungary think that is too much. Divisions will also come when hard choices have to be made: from closing coal mines, demanding more from farmers, to tougher emissions standards for the car industry. What role will the European parliament play in the green deal? EU governments agree environmental laws with the European parliament. That gives MEPs a weighty role across a swathe of new laws expected to flow from the European Green Deal: a revision of the EU\u2019s heavily criticised carbon trading scheme, new performance standards for cars and vans, an overhaul of farm policy, changes to EU rules on state subsidies that will phase out support for fossil fuels.

After so much campaigning, we have to ask: why is FGM not eradicated?</p> <p>Over the last century there have been numerous global resolutions, and FGM is now acknowledged internationally as a human rights violation. It has been criminalised in several western nations, including the UK, and in <a href=\"https://reproductiverights.org/document/female-genital-mutilation-fgm-legal-prohibitions-worldwide\" title=\"\">19 African countries</a>, FGM carries some sort of penalty.

These roots are long forgotten, even within the north-eastern African societies where it began. And this lack of knowledge has hampered efforts to tackle the issue.</p> <p>Campaigners often claim the tradition is mainly about virginity, chastity, paternity confidence or control of women\u2019s sexuality. I\u2019ve found that FGM began instead as an act of sacrifice to the divine. In other words, the initial intention was not about relations between humans but rather between humans and the gods: an act of self-preservation related to sacred blood, existence itself, and reproduction. </p> <p>In many east African societies there is a cycle of rituals that male and female children go through, from birth to childhood to adulthood and death. The history of these rituals can be uncovered in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/17/cave-paintings-found-in-somaliland\" title=\"\">archaeological sites</a> and fertility stones. Some stones are carved with symbols; landscape features include sacred trees, wells, springs and mountains. In studying them I discovered that FGM was just one part of this cycle, some of whose rituals still continue. There is the child-naming ritual, where a sheep is slaughtered; the scarification the child is subjected to by cutting or burning parts of the torso, seen as promoting fertility and healing childhood illnesses; the tradition of lip-plates; the dangerous men\u2019s stick fights and ritual hunts; and other harmful rituals, such as when women <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13648470.2016.1209636\" title=\"\">insert plant extract</a> in their cervix, or burn their abdomen to become pregnant.</p> <p>Hence, far from being an isolated practice, FGM was part of a collection of sacrificial rituals. The issues of sexual control, virginity and virtue are secondary, more recent additions.</p> <p>Although I am a survivor of the practice, having spent the early part of my life in Somalia, FGM was not uppermost in my mind when I began <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10437-015-9184-9\" title=\"\">surveying archaeological sites in Somaliland</a>. I had just one main question: why do certain cultural beliefs continue?

It is not an oddity against women: men have also been harmed through the rituals that take place ahead of a hunt. An animal killed during a ritual hunt, which takes weeks of preparation and seclusion, is considered a pure divine sacrifice.</p> <p>As with all these rituals, FGM was most likely originally meant as a collective human sacrifice to the gods to avoid a curse from the ancestors. This is why many who would themselves like FGM to be abolished still infibulate their daughters: they do not want to be the ones who bring \u201cshame\u201d and dishonour, they tell me.</p> <p>Though often long-forgotten, the tradition of communal sacrifice still leads people to believe an ancestors\u2019 curse will materialise in a lack of rain, failed crops, droughts, dead livestock and illness. Who wants to risk that? So cutting a girl is thought to be worth it, much like it was thought worth risking losing a son to a beast in a ritual hunt or the stick fights.

      "body": "<p>For over 30 years, Joyce Barnes has worked as a home healthcare aide in Richmond, Virginia, without any paid sick days. She makes $8.25 an hour and often works through illnesses because she can\u2019t afford to lose income from taking the time off.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to miss pay so I have gone to work before several times sick as a dog, masked up so my patients wouldn\u2019t catch what I have,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cEvery day I pray and I ask God to give me strength that I won\u2019t get sick so I can keep on making it and that\u2019s the way we have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Last July, Barnes contracted an illness from one of her patients that caused her a stay in a hospital for over a week. She relied on family members to help with bills to make up for the income she lost from missing work, and still has to make regular monthly payments toward the thousands of dollars of medical debt she accrued, despite having health insurance.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of medical debt I have to pay. They had to do a test on my stomach when I was sick. That one test cost me $3,000 and I\u2019m still paying it because I can\u2019t afford to pay everything back,\u201d Barnes added.</p> <p>As the coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19) has begun to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6908e1.htm\">spread</a> through the US, millions of low-wage workers in service industries are left vulnerable due to lack of proper medical benefits and paid sick leave. There are growing concerns that these workers will be extra vulnerable to the disease themselves, or, due to lack of health insurance and poverty, help its spread by continuing to work while ill.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.clasp.org/blog/low-wage-workers-least-likely-have-paid-sick-days\">More than 32 million workers</a> in the US have no paid sick days off, and low-wage workers are <a href=\"https://www.clasp.org/blog/low-wage-workers-least-likely-have-paid-sick-days\">least likely</a> to have paid sick time. These workers are also <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2019/ownership/civilian/table09a.pdf\">significantly less likely</a> to have access to healthcare and medical benefits, making them potentially especially vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak as it spreads.</p> <p>According to the latest data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2019/ownership/civilian/table31a.pdf\">69%</a> of low-wage workers, those in the 10th lowest percentile of median wage earners in the US civilian workforce, do not receive paid sick leave benefits.</p> <p>\u201cTheir earnings are low so they can\u2019t afford to take unpaid leave and when they are sick they have to keep working and expose other people in the process,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason advocates for paid leave make the case \u2013 it\u2019s not just for the worker, it\u2019s for the public good. There\u2019s a reason for the government to help provide it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Erica Groshen, a senior extension faculty member at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, explained changes in technology have made it easier for more professional workers to work from home, making them less vulnerable to getting sick and able to cope with the potential quarantine conditions of a coronavirus epidemic. Already King county in Washington state \u2013 which includes Seattle \u2013 has recommended its residents work from work.</p> <p>But low-wage workers are increasingly more vulnerable as they feel the pressure of the threat of having their work outsourced to contractors. They also often do work \u2013 fast food jobs, manual labor, care work \u2013 that cannot be done from home. That means the coronavirus could cost them their livelihoods, as well as their health.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, a widening of inequality on that front,\u201d said Groshen. </p> <p>Many low-wage workers, such as airport workers, are on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak, yet are left unprotected from contracting the virus or receiving adequate medical treatment.</p> <p>Leila Benitez, an airplane cabin cleaner at Miami international airport for eight years, has no health insurance or paid sick leave.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I finally do take a day off because I\u2019m so sick, I have to pay hundreds of dollars in medical bills to get a doctor\u2019s note,\u201d said Benitez. She often travels to the Dominican Republic, where she is from, to receive medical care because treatment and prescriptions costs a fraction of prices in the US.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m cleaning the planes, there are bodily fluids, trash, dirty tissues. We don\u2019t get enough time to wash our hands in between planes.

      "bodyText": "For over 30 years, Joyce Barnes has worked as a home healthcare aide in Richmond, Virginia, without any paid sick days. She makes $8.25 an hour and often works through illnesses because she can\u2019t afford to lose income from taking the time off. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to miss pay so I have gone to work before several times sick as a dog, masked up so my patients wouldn\u2019t catch what I have,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cEvery day I pray and I ask God to give me strength that I won\u2019t get sick so I can keep on making it and that\u2019s the way we have to do it.\u201d Last July, Barnes contracted an illness from one of her patients that caused her a stay in a hospital for over a week. She relied on family members to help with bills to make up for the income she lost from missing work, and still has to make regular monthly payments toward the thousands of dollars of medical debt she accrued, despite having health insurance. \u201cI have a lot of medical debt I have to pay. They had to do a test on my stomach when I was sick. That one test cost me $3,000 and I\u2019m still paying it because I can\u2019t afford to pay everything back,\u201d Barnes added. As the coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19) has begun to spread through the US, millions of low-wage workers in service industries are left vulnerable due to lack of proper medical benefits and paid sick leave. There are growing concerns that these workers will be extra vulnerable to the disease themselves, or, due to lack of health insurance and poverty, help its spread by continuing to work while ill. More than 32 million workers in the US have no paid sick days off, and low-wage workers are least likely to have paid sick time. These workers are also significantly less likely to have access to healthcare and medical benefits, making them potentially especially vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak as it spreads. According to the latest data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 69% of low-wage workers, those in the 10th lowest percentile of median wage earners in the US civilian workforce, do not receive paid sick leave benefits. \u201cTheir earnings are low so they can\u2019t afford to take unpaid leave and when they are sick they have to keep working and expose other people in the process,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason advocates for paid leave make the case \u2013 it\u2019s not just for the worker, it\u2019s for the public good. There\u2019s a reason for the government to help provide it.\u201d Dr Erica Groshen, a senior extension faculty member at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, explained changes in technology have made it easier for more professional workers to work from home, making them less vulnerable to getting sick and able to cope with the potential quarantine conditions of a coronavirus epidemic. Already King county in Washington state \u2013 which includes Seattle \u2013 has recommended its residents work from work. But low-wage workers are increasingly more vulnerable as they feel the pressure of the threat of having their work outsourced to contractors. They also often do work \u2013 fast food jobs, manual labor, care work \u2013 that cannot be done from home. That means the coronavirus could cost them their livelihoods, as well as their health. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, a widening of inequality on that front,\u201d said Groshen. Many low-wage workers, such as airport workers, are on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak, yet are left unprotected from contracting the virus or receiving adequate medical treatment. Leila Benitez, an airplane cabin cleaner at Miami international airport for eight years, has no health insurance or paid sick leave. \u201cWhen I finally do take a day off because I\u2019m so sick, I have to pay hundreds of dollars in medical bills to get a doctor\u2019s note,\u201d said Benitez. She often travels to the Dominican Republic, where she is from, to receive medical care because treatment and prescriptions costs a fraction of prices in the US. \u201cWhen I\u2019m cleaning the planes, there are bodily fluids, trash, dirty tissues. We don\u2019t get enough time to wash our hands in between planes. The protective gloves are thin, and often don\u2019t fit correctly.\u201d Several states and cities around the US have passed laws mandating employers provide workers with paid sick leave. A 2017 study published in the Journal of Public Economics found US cities that mandated sick leave for workers experienced up to 40% declines in seasonal flu rates. But many low-wage workers in these areas are still in positions where they have to work through an illness. In Maryland, the state passed a paid sick leave law in 2018 under which employers must provide one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, but adjunct professors often only accrue a few hours every semester and have restrictions on when and how they can use it. \u201cThis past month, I had to teach while sick and it prolonged my illness. I was worried my students were going to contract it. I felt like I couldn\u2019t take off because I can\u2019t afford to lose the money,\u201d said Val Pappas-Brown, an adjunct professor in the Baltimore area for two years. Joan Bevelaqua, an adjunct professor at several different colleges in Maryland for 20 years, explained she has never taken sick time off for fear of losing income.

      "bodyText": "Mining giant Fortescue Metals, retail giant Wesfarmers, two NRL clubs, and Catholic and Anglican welfare organisations were awarded millions of dollars from a fund for alleviating Indigenous disadvantage. The former Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion approved more than $560m worth of funding in his final six weeks in the role ahead of the announcement of the federal election in 2019. Fortescue Metals, which is owned by the mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest, received a grant of $3.828m for \u201cstrategic activities that focus on getting Indigenous Australians into work, fostering Indigenous business and assisting Indigenous people to generate economic and social benefits from effective use of their land, particularly in remote areas\u201d. The funds from the federal government\u2019s controversial Indigenous advancement strategy were approved on 5 April 2019, just six days before the Morrison government went into caretaker mode. In the six weeks from 1 March to 11 April, Scullion approved 240 grants worth around $567m, including the one-off grant to Fortescue. Scullion also approved more than $15m to retailer Wesfarmers over four years to support Indigenous employment in its businesses, including Coles, Target, Kmart and Bunnings. The Brisbane Broncos were awarded $10m for a mentoring program and the establishment of a girls\u2019 academy, while the North Queensland Cowboys received $2.7m for a boys\u2019 academy. At a Senate inquiry on Friday, current Indigenous affairs department representatives said that in 12 cases Scullion funded projects the department had advised against. One of these, they said, had not been applied for through formal channels. A $300,000 funding application to the Alice Springs-based Red Tails AFL club, to help young Indigenous men in the region, was developed by the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) because \u201cthe minister indicated that was who he wanted to support for that activity\u201d. The NIAA secretary, Ray Griggs, told the senators it was possible for the minister to initiate grants.He could not say exactly how many grants were made by agencies, and how many were approaches to them by the minister, but Griggs suspected it was \u201can admixture\u201d. \u201cWe were not involved with the process in the minister\u2019s office,\u201d Griggs said. Scullion also declined to support 28 projects that the NIAA recommended should be funded, including the now defunct National Congress of Australia\u2019s First Peoples, several school nutrition programs for Indigenous children in remote communities, and cadetships in the NSW Legal Aid Commission named for the late Indigenous judge Bob Bellear. The Fortescue Metals CEO, Elizabeth Gaines, said the company had received various funding grants from prime minister and cabinet since 2006 to support employment. \u201cWe applied for and received funding under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, as part of the Employment Parity Initiative, to support the ongoing employment, training and long-term career advancement of our Aboriginal team members with a focus on participants gaining high-value skills, building workplace and community leadership, as well as employee retention.\u201d The aim of the Employment Parity Initiative is to get 20,000 more Indigenous job seekers into jobs by 2020, Gaines said. In 2018, Scullion came under fire for allocating Indigenous advancement funds to the Northern Territory Cattlemen\u2019s Association, the NT amateur fishing lobby group and the Northern Territory Seafood Council \u2013 an industry group he used to chair \u2013 so they could oppose Aboriginal land claims. As minister he approved grants of $150,000 to the NTSC, $170,000 to the NT Amateur Fishermen\u2019s Association, and $165,000 to the NT Cattlemen\u2019s Association for \u201clegal fees, effectively \u2026 to put forward a case of detriment to the land commissioner\u201d. Under the NT Land Rights Act, those who consider a land claim would have a negative impact on their business or personal interests can argue a \u201cdetriment\u201d case about how their future access to income, land or water would suffer if the claim were approved. The $4.9bn Indigenous advancement strategy was supposed to \u201cimprove the way the government does business with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to ensure funding actually achieves outcomes\u201d, according to the government\u2019s website.",

Demonstrations were seen in over a dozen countries, from Pakistan to Argentina. </p> \n  <p>For some, the risks of protesting were great. In many cities, women were often met with counter-protestors, sometimes in the form of riot police who used tear gas to disperse crowds. </p> \n  <p>No matter the risk, women showed up and demanded to be heard, showing the fight for rights will continue well past this day for women. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e655b818f087df56e4c4af0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/joe-parkin-daniels\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T20:58:09.505Z\">8.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Bogot\u00e1, Colombia</h2> \n  <p>In Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\u2019s capital, today\u2019s demonstrations had a timely significance following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision not to modify the restrictive abortion law last Monday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cToday\u2019s marches show that the fight for our rights is not over,\u201d said Gina Borre, a pro-choice activist with the Viejas Verdes movement. \u201cEach year we are more united, more powerful.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Demonstrators, many wearing green bandanas, gathered at the Centre for Peace and Memory near downtown Bogot\u00e1 on Sunday morning, before marching towards Parque Olaya in the city\u2019s south.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a debate that always gets politicized, and their are many powerful interests, like the catholic and evangelical churches,\u201d said Olga Amparo, the coordinator of local women\u2019s rights group Casa de la Mujer. \u201cBut we are talking about healthcare and rights - which are universal.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Abortion is currently illegal in Colombia, except in cases where the life and health of the pregnant woman or the fetus are at risk, or in cases where the conception was the result of incest or rape. The court had an opportunity to loosen the law, though ultimately decided to maintain the status quo, disappointing watchdogs and activists across the region.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cBy failing to take this historic opportunity to move towards the decriminalization of abortion in Colombia, the Constitutional Court has turned its back on women and their struggle to end the cycle of violence and the control mechanisms of which they have been the victims,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, in a press release following the decision on Monday.</p> \n  <p>With the law so restrictive, many women are forced to seek clandestine, illegal abortions. Over the last decade or so, Colombia has investigated 4,802 people for having or aiding in illegal abortions, according to the country\u2019s attorney general.

The country has been seized by mass demonstrations for for over 4 months. </p> \n  <p>Chile\u2019s women share the demands of their regional peers \u2014 legal abortion, against violence, against impunity for abusers, greater equality \u2014 on top of this we\u2019ll be seeing demands for justice for women who have been assaulted by the state. </p> \n  <p><em>Violence against women in Chile</em></p> \n  <p>Since October, when Chile\u2019s uprising first broke out, the National Human Rights Organization (INDH) are investigating 433 cases against state officials to women: 247 for torture and cruelty, 112 for torture with sexual violence, 20 for unnecessary violence, 3 for frustrated homicide. </p> \n  <p>The two cases of frustrated homicide against women I know of are of 15-year-old Geraldine Alvarado, who was in Santiago\u2019s main protest square Plaza Italia, 10 dec, when a tear gas canister was shot at her head. It left a wound so deep that her skull was exposed. She was left in a coma and was on the verge of death for 5 days. </p> \n  <p>Fabiola Campillai was waiting for a bus to work when police shot her directly in the face on 26 November. Her face was completely crushed by the impact, losing vision in both eyes and her sense of smell. She\u2019s had one high-risk surgery, and soon she will need another. Still no police officer has been named or brought to trial for what they did, speaking recently Fabiola said \u201cjustice would be for them to give me back my eyes. There will never be justice for what they did to me\u201d.</p> \n  <p><em>IWD march</em></p> \n  <p>Feminist groups have sent out guidelines and precautions to women about how to stay safe during the march. This includes bringing protective eye wear and tear gas masks. Bringing laurel water and sliced lemon for tear gas relief, Milk Of Magnesia for pepper spray. </p> \n  <p>I went to four hard wear stores yesterday and all the gas masks were sold out. In one store, a mother was buying protective wear for her daughter\u2019s first Women\u2019s Day march. She said her friend \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to buy this so my daughter can protest safely\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The police are sending out women officers to guard the march, promising the event will be family friendly and safe. However protesters are highly distrustful of police. On Friday, a man died while protesting, caused by a tear gas canister impacting his head. <br></p> \n  <p>Women representing different causes will head today\u2019s march. There are representatives for trans and lesbians rights, for those representing victims of police oppression since October, migrant voices fighting against racism, sex worker groups. </p> \n  <p>All march for their own fights but unite against the violation of human rights inflicted by the state since October \u201cwe demand that they stop shooting at us mutilating us, raping us and commit to protecting humans rights\u201d, says march organiser, coordinadora 8m Santiago. </p> \n  <p>After the separatist segment of the march, all groups are welcome to join. Cis men, however, are discouraged from joining. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T14:16:29.484Z\">at 2.16pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e64f3438f087df56e4c47f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T13:31:59.428Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Toledo, Spain</h2> \n  <p>A march is underway in Toledo, central Spain, creating a sea of purple.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8408b422f6aace2470c90d1a4322ac5e6f1594a9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8408b422f6aace2470c90d1a4322ac5e6f1594a9/0_250_3712_4640/800.jpg\" alt=\"General view of a march held to commemorate International Working Women\u2019s Day held in Toledo, central Spain, 08 March 2020.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">General view of a march held to commemorate International Working Women\u2019s Day held in Toledo, central Spain, 08 March 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ismael Herrero/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e64f1f98f08c2df6d2757d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T13:25:28.643Z\">1.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Paris, France</h2> \n  <p>Demonstrations are underway in the French capital.

      "bodyText": "Alright folks, we\u2019re signing off on what was an incredible International Women\u2019s Day. Thousands of women and allies gathered in cities across the world to protest for women\u2019s rights and protection against violence. Demonstrations were seen in over a dozen countries, from Pakistan to Argentina. For some, the risks of protesting were great. In many cities, women were often met with counter-protestors, sometimes in the form of riot police who used tear gas to disperse crowds. No matter the risk, women showed up and demanded to be heard, showing the fight for rights will continue well past this day for women. Bogot\u00e1, Colombia In Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\u2019s capital, today\u2019s demonstrations had a timely significance following the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision not to modify the restrictive abortion law last Monday. \u201cToday\u2019s marches show that the fight for our rights is not over,\u201d said Gina Borre, a pro-choice activist with the Viejas Verdes movement. \u201cEach year we are more united, more powerful.\u201d Demonstrators, many wearing green bandanas, gathered at the Centre for Peace and Memory near downtown Bogot\u00e1 on Sunday morning, before marching towards Parque Olaya in the city\u2019s south. \u201cThis is a debate that always gets politicized, and their are many powerful interests, like the catholic and evangelical churches,\u201d said Olga Amparo, the coordinator of local women\u2019s rights group Casa de la Mujer. \u201cBut we are talking about healthcare and rights - which are universal.\u201d Abortion is currently illegal in Colombia, except in cases where the life and health of the pregnant woman or the fetus are at risk, or in cases where the conception was the result of incest or rape. The court had an opportunity to loosen the law, though ultimately decided to maintain the status quo, disappointing watchdogs and activists across the region. \u201cBy failing to take this historic opportunity to move towards the decriminalization of abortion in Colombia, the Constitutional Court has turned its back on women and their struggle to end the cycle of violence and the control mechanisms of which they have been the victims,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, in a press release following the decision on Monday. With the law so restrictive, many women are forced to seek clandestine, illegal abortions. Over the last decade or so, Colombia has investigated 4,802 people for having or aiding in illegal abortions, according to the country\u2019s attorney general. Nearly 500 of those cases were women under 18 years old. \u201cOur bodies means our decisions,\u201d said Natalia L\u00f3pez, a student from Bogot\u00e1. \u201cThe fight goes on.\u201d Un Violador En Tu Camino \u2013 A Rapist In Your Path The anti-rape anthem, En Violador En Tu Camino, A Rapist In Your Path, became a viral phenomenon after it was first debuted by Chilean protestors in November. The anthem has since been performed across the globe, in front of presidential mansions to outside the courthouse where Harvey Weinstein was put on trial. The spread and impact of the anthem was clear on International Women\u2019s Day when women around the world stood in formation and performed the anthem, along with the choreography. Here are some images of women performing En Violador En Tu Camino across the world today. Police clash with protestors around the world While many of today\u2019s demonstrations have occurred peacefully, riot police in multiple cities have used forced against protestors in multiple cities. In Istanbul, Turkey, police dispersed tear gas into a crowd and pushed protestors away after local officials closed down streets leading to the city\u2019s main square. Police in Kyrgyzstan arrested several protestors after they clashed with a group of men in masks who started attacking demonstrators. Police say they arrested the women because they were causing public disruption. In Santiago, Chile, police had a full-on clash with protestors, using water hoses and tear gas in attempts to disperse crowds. Many women came prepared, wearing gas masks and even sling shots to fight back against the police. Sao Paulo, Brazil A huge demonstration in Sao Paulo has women protesting for women\u2019s rights and in criticism of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro for not responding to violence against women. In the beginning of 2019, four women in Brazil were being killed everyday. Bogot\u00e1, Colombia Marches swept Colombia on Sunday morning, with demonstrations taking place in city\u2019s across the Andean nation. In Bogot\u00e1, the capital, on a bright Sunday morning, thousands of people gathered at the Centre for Memory and Peace before making their way towards Parque Olaya, in the south of the city, where a market has been set up to raise funds for women\u2019s rights groups. \u201cWe are here to demand and end to the violence we face every day,\u201d said Carla P\u00e9rez, a public relations consultant. \u201cWe are here because the streets are ours.\u201d People were marching for various causes. Some protested the government\u2019s inability to protect female social leaders - who continue to be murdered at alarming rates. Others called for the relaxation of the country\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Others took issue with the government\u2019s perceived slow-walking of the historic 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), a left rebel group. Colombia\u2019s conflict, in which 260,000 people were killed and over 7m displaced. Sexual violence was widespread, but amid massacres and mass kidnappings it tended to be ignored or met with impunity. \u201cViolence against women is systemic,\u201d said Angela Guerrero, a lawyer from Bogot\u00e1. \u201cToday we make ourselves heard.\u201d Meanwhile, Bogot\u00e1\u2019s newly elected mayor, Claudia Lopez - the city\u2019s first female mayor - gave a speech at the city\u2019s Parque Nacional across town. \u201cThe principal pandemic is brutal violence against women,\u201d she said to cheers. Santiago, Chile There are now clashes between police and protesters. Some girls told me that men are lighting barricades, provoking them. \u201cQue se vaya los machitos\u201d chant the women (get out, little men). Meanwhile women from Chile\u2019s frontline protesters move forward to confront the police. \u2018A Girl Inspiring the World\u2019 In honor of International Women\u2019s Day, British art group Sand In Your Eye made a 60-meter portrait of climate activist Greta Thunberg in Hebden Bridge earlier this week. The group worked with school children, who help the Sand In Your Eye artists with the portrait, which is made with line marker paint. Mexico City, Mexico From Maya Averbuch, who is in Mexico City: In front of Mexico\u2019s National Palace, women gathered in the morning to paint the names of victims of femicide since 2016. The used stencils to print the women\u2019s first names, from a list that included over 3,000. It was the first year they organized this protest action in the capital. Femicide, which is defined as killings of women because of their gender, has become a subject of debate in Mexico because of the rising number of dead. Last year, over 10 women were killed daily, in comparison with the six daily just three years earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s important for there to be a palace where the names of all the dead are visible,\u201d said Aurora Zarzosa, 50, one of the women who was painting. \u201cWe cannot pretend they do not exist.\u201d In recent months, women have protested not only against the fact that few of the perpetrators are ever convicted, but also that gruesome photos of the dead are printed in local newspapers. In Mexico City, the names \u2013 Diana, Rosario, Zoilae \u2013 appeared on the ground in all-white letters. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for the people who commit these crimes, because they do not have to pay a price,\u201d said Mariam Bujalil, 52. \u201cI never want to find my name here, or the names of my daughters, or of my granddaughters.\u201d Later, thousands of people marched through the historic center. In front of a pink monument of the Venus symbol that was erected in honor of victims of femicide, they took the microphone to call out people who had harmed them. Turning the private into the public was, at once, an act of catharsis, and a fierce rebuke. \u201cLast week, Citlali left the house to go to work,\u201d one woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that they forced her into a car fifty meters from her office, and nobody in the hotel heard her screams.\u201d Much of the outcry this year was focused on physical violence: One woman called out the family member who had raped her as a child, another the man who had stabbed her sister, a third a university professors who told her she could not graduate unless she slept with him. Behind them, women who were walking toward the main plaza chanted slogans, as plumes of purple smoke rose from the crowds. A small portion of marchers graffitied statues and broke the glass covering advertisements on the sidewalk, as lines of police barricaded the entrance to historic sites. In the middle of the tumult, the women with the microphone also criticized those who failed to help them in the aftermath of crimes: the health system, for not covering the costs of psychological treatment; the government, for failing to investigate; and other women, for not believing their stories of abuse. \u201cHer daughter cries for her all the time,\u201d said Blanca Alicia Gomez Vargas, holding photos of her niece above her head. \u201cThey killed her in Quer\u00e9taro, which they say is a beautiful city.\u201d Santiago, Chile Here\u2019s a look at a huge group of women performing anti-rape anthem Un Violador en Tu Camino, A Rapist In Your Path, in Chile, where the viral anthem was created by Las Tesis, a Chilean feminist collective. Buenos Aires, Argentina Argentina is another country that has seen a dramatic rise in femicides recently. In the first two months of 2020, the country had 63 femicides. Today, protestors held red roses and signs with the names of women who were victims of femicide as they marched to the presidential palace in Buenos Aires. Mexico Protests are gearing up in Mexico and are focused on the country\u2019s alarming rate of femicides, gender-based murders of women. Last year over 1,000 of the country\u2019s murders were classified as femicides. Activists have been protesting for months, voicing their frustration over Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s underwhelming reaction to the murders. Today\u2019s demonstration will transition into a nationwide strike, where million of women are planning to stay home from work for 24 hours to protest the rise in violence. Read more about what\u2019s planned here: Amsterdam, the Netherlands A huge protest was held in celebration of International Women\u2019s Day in Amsterdam. Here\u2019s a look at the city\u2019s protest. Milan, Italy A small group of women in Milan, Italy (some wearing pink face masks) came out to show their support for International Women\u2019s Day, though huge chunks of northern Italy, including Milan, have been put under lockdown amid rapid spread of coronavirus in the country. Their signs read \u201cto all women\u201d and \u201cinternational day of beautiful women\u2019s rights\u201d. Santiago, Chile At the Presidential Palace, La Moneda, approximately 2 km from the main protest square, women from the Coordinadora 8m are performing A Rapist In Your Path on repeat. Written by Chilean activist group Las Tesis, women in Santiago are among the first women who performed the song, which has since gone viral across the world. \u201cThis is an emblematic place and the lyrics of the song speak about what is happening in there\u201d says Maria Victoria, one of the performers. They\u2019ve performed it 7 times so far today, under the scorching heat of Chile\u2019s capital. At the songs close protesters shout \u201cPinera murderer!\u201d and point toward the Palace. Hello everyone, this is Lauren Aratani in the US taking over. Demonstrations are still taking place all over the world. Here are some pictures of the massive protests that are happening in Chile. I\u2019m handing over to my colleagues in the US who will continue the blog from there. Thank you all for sharing your powerful photographs, and stories of your events. If you\u2019d like to see more of the powerful photographs from IWD around the world, take a look at our photo gallery here: Italy Whilst around a quarter of the Italian population is in lock down due to coronavirus, Italian President Sergio Mattarella released a video message in which he expressed regret at the need to avoid large-scale gatherings. He said he was giving \u201ca grateful thought to the women - and there are many - who are working in hospitals... in the red (quarantine) zones to fight the spread of the virus that worries us today.\u201d Paris, France Human rights groups and politicians have criticised alleged police violence at a women\u2019s march in Paris on the eve of IWD, after nine people were arrested during scuffles between police and protesters. Pictures on Twitter appeared to show marchers left battered and bruised. Paris mayor Paris Anne Hidalgo said she was shocked at the \u201cunacceptable and incomprehensible\u201d violence. She said she stood in solidarity with demonstrators. Europe Ecology-The Greens party secretary Julien Bayou described the events as: \u201cabsolutely unjustifiable police violence\u201d. Asia Whilst number of IWD events were cancelled across Asia due to the coronavirus, including South Korea which has the most severe outbreak outside of China. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t be physically together, our minds for realising gender equality are stronger than ever,\u201d the country\u2019s gender equality minister Lee Jung-Ok said in a video message. However, marches took place in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV took the opportunity to highlight the work of female medics tackling coronavirus. London, UK In London, the Women\u2019s Strike has just begun. It encourages women to withdraw all work - whether paid, or unpaid domestic work - on IWD. \u201cThe Women\u2019s Strike rejects the decades of economic inequality, criminalization and policing, racial and sexual violence, and endless global war and terrorism,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe Women\u2019s Strike is a strike for solidarity between women \u2013 women of colour, indigenous, working class, disabled, migrant, Muslim, lesbian, queer and trans women. On 8 March, in cities and towns across the UK we will meet each other on the streets and strike against a system of power that keep us isolated and divided from one another.\u201d \u201cWe say that when women stop, the world stops with us, so we\u2019re also saying that resisting women will change the world. We\u2019re not just in solidarity with each other here today, we\u2019re ready and we\u2019re starting a common struggle to make the twenty first century the era of women\u2019s liberation,\u201d said Elif Sarican, a Kurdish women\u2019s movement organiser and speaker at the protest. Manila, Philippines In the Philippines, feminist movements have linked up with anti-imperial movements, and dissidents against the Duterte regime. Hundreds took to the streets to call for an end to imperialism, and to Duterte\u2019s rule. A large effigy of President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been accused of misogyny, was also burnt. \u201cThe violence and poverty among women are getting worse,\u201d Joms Salvador of women\u2019s group Gabriela told AFP. \u201cWhile we have 37 laws related to women\u2019s rights, on the ground what is happening is a widespread violence in the forms of domestic abuse, sexual harassment and rape,\u201d he said. Berlin, Germany In the German capital, women have participated in a \u2018purple ride\u2019 - a bicycle demonstration. Edirne, Turkey Female asylum seekers who are waiting at Turkey\u2019s Pazarkule border crossing to reach Europe have staged a demonstration demanding the gate be opened on IWD. Chile Chile\u2019s main protest square, Plaza Dignidad, is now full\u2014 and the march hasn\u2019t even officially begun yet. There\u2019s a huge 8M flag, and women are spray painting signs on the roads. A woman is on top of the horse in the square\u2019s central statue of Baquedano. She\u2019s covering her eye, a tribute to over 400 victims who have had their eyes shot by police weapons since the unrest broke out in October. Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan Here is a video of the IWD protest in Kyrgyzstan, where predominantly female protesters were arrested after masked men attacked the demonstration. Glasgow, Scotland The Clydeside branch of the International Workers of the World Union have organised a demonstration in Glasgow. They are joined by the West Dumbartonshire branch of WASPI, Women Against State Pension Inequality, some of whom are dressed as suffragettes. Dhaka, Bangladesh In the early hours of the morning of March 8, women in Dhaka, Bangladesh held a candlelight vigil to mark IWD. Buenos Aires, Argentina The Argentine Armed Forces all-women orchestra played as part of IWD celebrations on March 6. The Women\u2019s Armed Forces Orchestra brings together officers from the Army, Navy and Air Force. Sydney, Australia IWD demonstrations also took place in Sydney, Australia. Lausanne, Switzerland On the eve of IWD, women in Switzerland took part in a flashmob. Yogyakarta, Indonesia Pakistan Marches have taken place in Pakistani cities to call for gender equality. In some areas, women are still put to death under ancient \u2018honour\u2019 codes. People all over the world are sharing photographs of themselves making an \u2018equal\u2019 sign with their arms, as part of the hashtag #EachforEqual, promoting gender inequality. Here is an Amnesty International community group based in Durban, South Africa, who have been operating for 30 year with members of all ages, right up to 89 year old Coral. Below is a Lean In circle in Penang, Malaysia. Lean In circles bring women from all backgrounds together and offer peer mentorship, skill development and a space to be \u201cunapologetically ambitious\u201d. There are 44,000 Lean in circles in more than 170 countries. Manchester, England A demonstration is taking place in Manchester with Sisters Not Strangers, a campaign led by refugee and asylum-seeking women, which aims to \u201cbuild solidarity for women who have come to the UK to seek safety but have instead been made destitute\u201d. The group are singing in the city\u2019s Piccadilly Gardens to mark IWD. Paris, France Women of General Confederation of Labour, a large labour union in France, have taken to the streets to demand equality, seemingly dressed like WWII feminist icon, Rosie the Riveter. Kyiv, Ukraine Demonstrations are also taking place in Kyiv, Ukraine. Activists are calling for an end to violence against women, and wider gender equality. Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia A march is taking place in Skopje, organised The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights of North Macedonia. The protest was created with the motto \u2018You are not guilty\u2019. Moscow, Russia A running event has been held on IWD in Moscow. Hundreds of men run with tulips and gift them to women on the finish line. Alongside the tulip races, a rally is taking place organised by the group of activists We Are Khachaturyan Sisters in Moscow\u2019s Sokolniki Hyde Park. Chile Chile\u2019s 8M comes at a politically tense time - amidst a social revolt and in the run up to a historic referendum vote in April to change the country\u2019s Pinochet-era constitution. The country has been seized by mass demonstrations for for over 4 months. Chile\u2019s women share the demands of their regional peers \u2014 legal abortion, against violence, against impunity for abusers, greater equality \u2014 on top of this we\u2019ll be seeing demands for justice for women who have been assaulted by the state. Violence against women in Chile Since October, when Chile\u2019s uprising first broke out, the National Human Rights Organization (INDH) are investigating 433 cases against state officials to women: 247 for torture and cruelty, 112 for torture with sexual violence, 20 for unnecessary violence, 3 for frustrated homicide. The two cases of frustrated homicide against women I know of are of 15-year-old Geraldine Alvarado, who was in Santiago\u2019s main protest square Plaza Italia, 10 dec, when a tear gas canister was shot at her head. It left a wound so deep that her skull was exposed. She was left in a coma and was on the verge of death for 5 days. Fabiola Campillai was waiting for a bus to work when police shot her directly in the face on 26 November. Her face was completely crushed by the impact, losing vision in both eyes and her sense of smell. She\u2019s had one high-risk surgery, and soon she will need another. Still no police officer has been named or brought to trial for what they did, speaking recently Fabiola said \u201cjustice would be for them to give me back my eyes. There will never be justice for what they did to me\u201d. IWD march Feminist groups have sent out guidelines and precautions to women about how to stay safe during the march. This includes bringing protective eye wear and tear gas masks. Bringing laurel water and sliced lemon for tear gas relief, Milk Of Magnesia for pepper spray. I went to four hard wear stores yesterday and all the gas masks were sold out. In one store, a mother was buying protective wear for her daughter\u2019s first Women\u2019s Day march. She said her friend \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to buy this so my daughter can protest safely\u201d. The police are sending out women officers to guard the march, promising the event will be family friendly and safe. However protesters are highly distrustful of police. On Friday, a man died while protesting, caused by a tear gas canister impacting his head. Women representing different causes will head today\u2019s march. There are representatives for trans and lesbians rights, for those representing victims of police oppression since October, migrant voices fighting against racism, sex worker groups. All march for their own fights but unite against the violation of human rights inflicted by the state since October \u201cwe demand that they stop shooting at us mutilating us, raping us and commit to protecting humans rights\u201d, says march organiser, coordinadora 8m Santiago. After the separatist segment of the march, all groups are welcome to join. Cis men, however, are discouraged from joining. Toledo, Spain A march is underway in Toledo, central Spain, creating a sea of purple. Paris, France Demonstrations are underway in the French capital. A number of Mexican women are there protesting against femicide in Mexico. Baghdad, Iraq A demonstration is taking place in the capital of Baghdad to call for gender equality. If you\u2019re on the go, but still want to mark IWD, here\u2019s some podcast suggestions from Miranda Sawyer. This from Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent: Hundreds of rallies and demonstrations are kicking off across Spain, which has seen huge crowds gather to mark International Women\u2019s Day over recent years. Nationwide events are going ahead despite the coronavirus alert, although Spain\u2019s health authorities have asked people showing symptoms consistent with the virus to stay at home. Protests are due to be held in all the country\u2019s big cities and towns including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Granada, Bilbao, Palma de Mallorca, Valladolid and Santander. Fourteen women have been murdered by their partners in Spain so far this year, while 99 died at the hands of their partners in 2019. Since the government began recording gender-based violence deaths in 2003, a total of 1,047 women have been murdered. Organisers and campaigners have urged women across Spain to take to the streets \u201cto demand that the state, the Catholic hierarchy, the patriarchal powers - both economic and political - and the sexist culture (of our friends, fathers, brothers and neighbours) respect our autonomy and freedom to take decisions when it comes to our sexuality, our bodies and our life plans\u201d. Today\u2019s manifesto also roundly rejects those who seek to use women\u2019s rights as a means to justify violence against women. \u201cWe reject the use people make of the rights of women, lesbians and trans people to favour and legitimise racist and reactionary policies and discourses,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe want all of us to be free.\u201d Spain\u2019s equality minister, Irene Montero, tweeted: \u201cToday we are taking to the streets because they belong to us, too, and so that we can live free of sexist violence, so that we can share out time, riches and care provision, and so that we can love whoever we want and be whoever we want. We are doing it for those who came before and those who will coe in the future.\u201d Earlier on Sunday, Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, called on anyone who thought they may have the coronavirus to \u201cavoid the demonstrations, stay home and self-isolate\u201d. London, UK Demonstrators from climate activist group Extinction Rebellion have been protesting in London for IWD, arguing that the \u201cclimate is a women\u2019s issue.\u201d Thirty one women formed a topless chain blocking Waterloo Bridge in London, with the words \u2018Climate Rape\u2019, \u2018Climate Murder\u2019, \u2018Climate Abuse\u2019, \u2018Climate Inequality\u2019 and \u2018Climate Justice\u2019 written on their bodies. The group said the action was to highlight \u201cthe disproportionate impact of the climate and ecological emergency on women, and the resulting increase in hardship, violence and rape.\u201d \u201cThe UK action is in solidarity with everyone on the streets for International Women\u2019s Day with the message that \u2018climate is a women\u2019s issue\u2019 and calls on women in the UK to recognise this is happening to our sisters in the global south now and will be a reality faced by all women if decisive action is not taken,\u201d a statement added. They chose Waterloo Bridge because of its nickname of \u2018The Ladies Bridge\u2019, as many of the welders, stonemasons and labourers that built the bridge during the second world war were women. The action in the UK is part of a wave of Extinction Rebellion IWD, spanning Colombia, Spain, Turkey, The Gambia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda, DRC, Belgium, Israel, The Philippines, Switzerland, Argentina and the UK. Sarah Mintram, former teacher and member of the Extinction Rebellion International Support Team, who took part in the action in London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s mainly women in poorer countries in the global south that are experiencing the increase in violence but this will be the reality for all women if the climate and ecological crisis continues to go unaddressed.\u201d \u201cWe are here to raise the alarm about what is happening to our sisters around the world and to tell women in the UK the climate and ecological emergency is your issue \u2013 it will affect you as a woman if we do not persuade our government to take urgent action starting now.\u201d Baghdad, Iraq Celebrations have been taking place in Tahrir Square in the capital of Baghdad to mark IWD. Some were seen wearing face masks, seemingly in response to fears around coronavirus. Iraq currently has 47 confirmed cases, and four deaths from the virus. Scandinavia, Finland, and Iceland The Prime Ministers of Iceland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden have released a joint statement reaffirming their commitments to gender equality. The statement also highlights their \u201cgrave concern over the current pushback against women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights\u201d and calls on other world leaders to reject this. \u201cWe have witnessed a surge in regressive policies around the world, often undermining universal human rights,\u201d it says. You can read the full statement here. Iceland has topped the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report for the past 11 years, with Nordic countries making up four of the top five gender equal countries. London, UK The March4Women is set to kick off in an hour\u2019s time in the British capital. The march combines feminist and climate movements, and will be joined by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Musicians and actors including Emeli Sand\u00e9, who will perform, and the Kaiser Chief\u2019s Ricky Wilson will be in attendance, as will activists including Sandi Toksvig, Bianca Jagger and Helen Pankhurst. The March4Women aims to spotlight on the women on the front lines of the climate crisis, and call for action from world leaders. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be marching alongside women and allies this International Women\u2019s Day. The gender inequality we still see in our city, country and globally is unacceptable. \u201cAs Mayor, and as a proud feminist, I\u2019m determined that no woman or girl should be disadvantaged just because of their gender and want London to lead the way in changing that.\u201d It will begin with an opening rally at Royal Festival Hall, as part of the Women of the World festival, and will march over the river Thames, meet crowds at Whitehall place, before moving to Parliament Square for music and a final rally. A new campaign to promote the National Domestic Abuse Helpline has been launched in the UK on IWD, with the support of celebrities including Olivia Coleman and Lorraine Kelly. The helpline\u2019s campaign has been launched by the charity Refuge, who provide specialist support for women and children experiencing domestic violence. They want every woman to know the number of the National Domestic Abuse Helpline, 0808 2000 247, and the charity will be projecting it on to the largest advertising display in Europe, London\u2019s Piccadilly lights, at midday. TV presenter Lorraine Kelly said: \u201cIt is a disgrace that in 2020 we live in a world where so many women experience domestic abuse - the numbers are shocking. No woman should live in fear. That needs to change - today.\u201d Kelly and Coleman have both changed the pictures on their social media profiles to the helpline, to help promote it. Chief executive of Refuge Sandra Horley said: \u201cRefuge\u2019s freephone 24 hour national domestic abuse helpline is at the heart of how this country responds to domestic abuse - it is a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of women across the country. \u201c0808 2000 247 is a number that every woman should know. Today, International Women\u2019s Day, Refuge and an amazing band of high-profile women will work to make this a reality. Women\u2019s lives depend on it.\u201d It is estimated that one in three women experience some form of domestic abuse in their lifetimes. Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan Dozens of protesters, mostly female, have been arrested at a rally calling for gender equality in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, after masked men attacked them and tore up their placards. The detentions came after the men wearing face masks and pointed national hats attacked the crowd, tearing up their posters, popping balloons with toy pistols and throwing eggs at the women before fleeing the scene, AFP report. Erlan Atantayev, deputy head of the Sverdlovsky police department where the women were taken, told AFP that the protesters had been arrested for their own safety, and because police had not been informed about the rally beforehand. \u201cClashes began between the demonstrators and men wearing the face masks,\u201d said Atantayev. \u201cWe detained (the women) for violation of public order.\u201d He added that some demonstrators could face fines for resisting arrest, and that police were conducting \u201cexplanatory work\u201d with the protesters they had detained. Police also detained three male attackers but allegedly did not chase after those who ran away. Journalist Nurjamal Djanibekova told AFP that one of the attackers broke her phone to stop her from filming the attack. She said that 70 people were being held in the Sverdlovsky police station. A ban was placed on demonstrations in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, apparently to stop the spread of coronavirus. However, this was later lifted after the city administration withdrew their request. David Schneider, co-writer of the screenplay for critically acclaimed comedy Death of Stalin, has poked fun at those complaining about the existence of IWD. Australia The Australian government has announced a number of new policies to support women in an IWD announcement. The federal government revealed the identity of the country\u2019s first Ambassador for Gender Equality. The role will be held by Julie-Ann Guivarra, a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and replaces the role of Ambassador for Women and Girls, a position that had been held by former Liberal MP Sharman Stone since 2017. As part of her role, Ms Guivarra will \u201cwork to ensure that gender equality, and empowerment of women and girls, is a central focus of Australia\u2019s diplomatic, development, and regional security efforts,\u201d Minister for Women, Senator Payne, said. The government has also pledged $20 million into an interest-free loan program to help victims of domestic violence pay for basic goods, such as furniture and bills. The scheme would make loans of up to $2000 available to women who have experienced domestic violence, Social Services Minister Anne Ruston announced on this years IWD day. \u201cWomen leaving violence often face financial hardship and we hope these loans go some way to help them meet the costs of the basics,\u201d she said. The announcement also revealed that women leaving abusive relationships would be given individual financial counsellors to help them get back on track. The government also said it would be providing $2.8 million over two years for local support services in each state and territory, including shelters and crisis help. Senator Ruston said with Sunday marking International Women\u2019s Day, it was important for Australians to reflect on what they could to stop family violence. \u201cWe should be ashamed of ourselves in Australia that we have the kind of domestic violence perpetration that we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cUntil we change people\u2019s behaviour, we\u2019re just going to be responding to domestic violence and we have to start preventing it.\u201d Paris, France Members of the women\u2019s movement FEMEN have staged a protest on the Place de la Concorde in Paris, calling for an end to patriarchy. The demonstration appears to reference the current outbreak of coronavirus, with some placards saying \u201cstop the patriarchal virus\u201d and \u201cstop the patriarchal pandemic\u201d. Whilst topless, the activists\u2019 outfits resemble hazmat suits. Russia The youth section of Russia\u2019s ruling party, United Russia Young Guard, has organised marches marking IWD. Want to celebrate IWD from the comfort of your sofa? My colleague Guy Lodge has compiled the best films to watch this IWD, celebrating the work of female directors. Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan A demonstration on Victory Square in the capital of Bishkek has led to the arrest of several protesters from the women\u2019s movement, FEMEN. FEMEN are known around the world for their protests, which are usually conducted topless by women with slogans written across their bodies. In 2015, studies showed that 11,800 women in Kyrgyzstan are kidnapped to be married, a process known as bride kidnapping, every year. One fifth of these are victims of violence including rape. You can read more about gender inequality and the fight against it in Kyrgyzstan and other former USSR countries in this article from Joanna Lillis, published on IWD five years ago. Chile More than a million women in Chile are set to take to the streets today, as IWD demonstrations build on a wave of social unrest that took off in October last year. The unrest began in response to rising metro fares, but has grown to address wider issues of social injustice, inequality and costs of living. You can read more about the social movement erupting in Chile, and its impact on IWD, from Charis McGowan here: Mexico City, Mexico Femicides in Mexico have more than doubled in the past five years, and this is set to be a theme of IWD events in the country. A march in Mexico\u2019s capital is expected to bring record numbers of women on to the streets. They\u2019re heading to the public square across from the national palace to call for an end to violence against women. \u201cI\u2019m going to march for each and every woman in this country, for the dead and the living, for the victims of violence,\u201d Carmen Rojas, 52, in Mexico City, told Reuters. \u201cWe have to raise our voices.\u201d Yesterday, on the eve of IWD, around 200 protesters made a \u201cfeminist chain\u201d in Mexico City to protest against gender-based violence. Hello, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) 2020. We\u2019ll be looking at the IWD events taking place around the world. If you\u2019re celebrating, protesting, or hosting, let us know! You can tweet me @mollyblackall. What is IWD? According to the United Nations, who sponsor the event, IWD is \u201cis a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women, who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities.\u201d IWD has taken place each year on March 8 since 1977, when the UN General Assembly invited member states to announce the day as the UN Day for women\u2019s rights and world peace. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cI am Generation Equality: Realizing women\u2019s rights\u201d. UN coverage of the day highlights the obstacles still faced by women around the world, reminding us that women earn 23% less than men globally, and make up just 24% of parliamentary seats worldwide.",

All over the globe, thousands of women took to the streets, including South Americans campaigning for access to abortions and topless demonstrations in London and Paris. Women and children carried placards with the words \u201cHelp us\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Kill Us \u2014 We Are Human\u201d at the Pazarkule border crossing between Turkey and Greece on Sunday, where thousands of migrants have gathered since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan decided to open the Turkish side of the border. In France a clutch of virus deaths on Saturday took the death toll to 16, but Paris hosted several rallies \u2014 one of which was marred by violence that organisers blamed on police. Other protests around the world were also met with force. In Istanbul, Turkey, police fired teargas on a crowd and pushed protesters away after local officials closed down streets leading to the city\u2019s main square. A demonstration in Kyrgyzstan also turned violent as police detained dozens of protesters \u2013 mainly women \u2013 after masked men attacked them and tore up their placards in the capital Bishkek. A police spokesman said they were detained for their own safety and because police had not been warned about the rally.

In the Philippines, a group of anti-imperialists, dissidents and feminists burnt an effigy of President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been criticised for misogyny. In London, 31 women from the Extinction Rebellion group formed a topless chain across Waterloo Bridge, saying their bare breasts symbolised \u201cthe vulnerability of women around the world in the face of climate breakdown\u201d. Many had written slogans across their naked chests including \u201cClimate Rape\u201d, \u201cClimate Murder\u201d and \u201cClimate Abuse\u201d.

Anyone hoping that this book, which is billed as a memoir, will offer a more intimate glimpse of the writer, might be disappointed in that regard; Solnit does not go in for soul-baring, and even in this personal history she keeps her gaze focused outward, on what her particular encounters can tell us about the prevailing culture of publishing, or the art world, or the environmental movement, or the city at the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her work has become increasingly concerned with stories: who gets to tell theirs, whose are given airtime</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBecoming a writer formalises something essential about becoming a human: the task of figuring out what stories to tell and how to tell them and who you are in relation to them, which you choose and which choose you,\u201d she writes. Over the years, her work has become increasingly concerned with stories: who gets to tell theirs, whose are given airtime, whose discredited, or erased so comprehensively that we do not even notice they are missing. The trajectory of her life has taken her from invisibility to prominence, and though she is careful to acknowledge her own privilege in certain areas, she has enough experience of being young, female and poor to speak with authority about what it means to feel powerless and nonexistent \u2013 sometimes even actively to choose nonexistence in the face of harassment, \u201csince existence was so perilous\u201d.</p> <p>This disappearance is primarily, for Solnit, a question of the erasure of women by men. Though her work initially explored the marginalisation of other groups \u2013 queer artists, Native Americans \u2013 her writing always circles back to this central, most personal iteration of silencing. She has written elsewhere about growing up with a physically abusive father, and though she doesn\u2019t delve into great detail here, she mentions it more than once as an instance of early immersion in a culture of endemic inequality, where male aggression was the norm: \u201cI am the daughter of a man who considered it his right to hit women and children and did as his father did before him.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/27/rebecca-solnit-interview-essays-feminism-trump-the-mother-of-all-questions\">Rebecca Solnit: \u2018The essay is powerful again. We\u2019re in a golden age\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moving to the city in her teens taught her that this violence and entitlement was pervasive. One early chapter opens with a charming description of the elegant little desk given her by a friend many years ago, at which she has written most of her books. Then comes the sucker punch: \u201cA year or so before she gave me the desk, my friend was stabbed 15 times by an ex-boyfriend to punish her for leaving him.\u201d</p> <p>As a metaphor, it is critical to the writer she became: \u201cSomeone tried to silence her. Then she gave me a platform for my voice.\u201d</p> <p>This question of whose voices are audible has become a central theme of Solnit\u2019s writing in recent years, and at times <em>Recollections</em> does cover ground traversed in previous essay collections, most obviously as it catches up with her present work. But it is a rare writer who has both the intellectual heft and the authority of frontline experience to tackle the most urgent issues of our time. One of the reasons she has won so many admirers is the sense that she is driven not by anger but by compassion and the desire to offer encouragement, \u201ca word that, though it carries the stigma of niceness, literally means to instil courage\u201d.</p> <p>That voice of hope is more essential now than ever, and this memoir is a valuable glimpse into the grit and courage that enabled her to keep telling sidelined stories when the forces opposing her seemed monolithic.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Recollections of My Non-Existence </em>by Rebecca Solnit is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

Anyone hoping that this book, which is billed as a memoir, will offer a more intimate glimpse of the writer, might be disappointed in that regard; Solnit does not go in for soul-baring, and even in this personal history she keeps her gaze focused outward, on what her particular encounters can tell us about the prevailing culture of publishing, or the art world, or the environmental movement, or the city at the time. \u201cBecoming a writer formalises something essential about becoming a human: the task of figuring out what stories to tell and how to tell them and who you are in relation to them, which you choose and which choose you,\u201d she writes. Over the years, her work has become increasingly concerned with stories: who gets to tell theirs, whose are given airtime, whose discredited, or erased so comprehensively that we do not even notice they are missing. The trajectory of her life has taken her from invisibility to prominence, and though she is careful to acknowledge her own privilege in certain areas, she has enough experience of being young, female and poor to speak with authority about what it means to feel powerless and nonexistent \u2013 sometimes even actively to choose nonexistence in the face of harassment, \u201csince existence was so perilous\u201d. This disappearance is primarily, for Solnit, a question of the erasure of women by men. Though her work initially explored the marginalisation of other groups \u2013 queer artists, Native Americans \u2013 her writing always circles back to this central, most personal iteration of silencing. She has written elsewhere about growing up with a physically abusive father, and though she doesn\u2019t delve into great detail here, she mentions it more than once as an instance of early immersion in a culture of endemic inequality, where male aggression was the norm: \u201cI am the daughter of a man who considered it his right to hit women and children and did as his father did before him.\u201d Moving to the city in her teens taught her that this violence and entitlement was pervasive. One early chapter opens with a charming description of the elegant little desk given her by a friend many years ago, at which she has written most of her books. Then comes the sucker punch: \u201cA year or so before she gave me the desk, my friend was stabbed 15 times by an ex-boyfriend to punish her for leaving him.\u201d As a metaphor, it is critical to the writer she became: \u201cSomeone tried to silence her. Then she gave me a platform for my voice.\u201d This question of whose voices are audible has become a central theme of Solnit\u2019s writing in recent years, and at times Recollections does cover ground traversed in previous essay collections, most obviously as it catches up with her present work. But it is a rare writer who has both the intellectual heft and the authority of frontline experience to tackle the most urgent issues of our time. One of the reasons she has won so many admirers is the sense that she is driven not by anger but by compassion and the desire to offer encouragement, \u201ca word that, though it carries the stigma of niceness, literally means to instil courage\u201d. That voice of hope is more essential now than ever, and this memoir is a valuable glimpse into the grit and courage that enabled her to keep telling sidelined stories when the forces opposing her seemed monolithic. \u2022 Recollections of My Non-Existence by Rebecca Solnit is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

Or you could continue through aromatic pine forests to the peaceful Ermita de la Victoria. But for unbeatable island views, follow the footpath behind the hermitage for Mirador de Penya del Migdia. There are chains on tougher parts of the path, while far below is the blue only the Med can be. Spring is perfect as autumn can be rainy \u2013 less than ideal for walking along cliff edges. No idea how they got the cannon to the top! Antony Fairy chimneys, French Pyrenees Forty minutes\u2019 drive inland from Argel\u00e8s on France\u2019s C\u00f4te Vermeille, in the foothills of the Pyrenees, lies Ille-sur-T\u00eat and Les Orgues. Free parking and a \u20ac5 ticket gives access to a meandering dust track. It\u2019s an easy 15-minute walk, enhanced by quirky metal sculptures, before you arrive at the main event: stunning rock formations, the likes of which can\u2019t be seen outside the US or Turkey. Les Orgues translates as \u201corgan pipes\u201d, which might best describe these extraordinary sand and clay structures; children might prefer \u201cfairy chimneys\u201d. Take water if visiting during the summer and enjoy a cooling drink at the cafe at the bottom. A small giftshop sells honey and other artisanal produce.

It also added stops in Flint and Dearborn, a working-class city with a large Muslim population that is a stronghold of support. Biden, by contrast, has only spent about $500,000 on TV ads in Michigan and among few stops in the state a fundraiser in Grosse Pointe, one of the wealthiest cities, stands out. In 2016, in part, Sanders won Michigan because he was there much more than Clinton. His 2020 get-out-the-vote swing is \u201cexactly what he needs to do\u201d, said state congressman Yousef Rabhi, a progressive in Ann Arbor who endorsed Sanders. \u201cBernie Sanders is showing up, he\u2019s here on the ground \u2026 and you need to be here, be present to win,\u201d Rabhi said. \u201cHe\u2019s holding rallies, getting people who are young, old and from all backgrounds revved up and excited to vote for him.\u201d Critics also note that one of the few stops Biden has made in Michigan in recent years ended up helping an incumbent Republican defeat a Democrat in the 2018 midterms. The incident \u2013 in which Biden heaped praise on Fred Upton in a speech that was used in Republican ads \u2013 infuriated local party officials. Sanders is seen as stronger on the environment and the only candidate to voice opposition to Line 5, a controversial oil pipeline that would run through the Great Lakes. He is also hammering Biden on his support for the Nafta trade deal, which many view as responsible for decimating Michigan\u2019s working class amid mass factory closures. Clinton\u2019s support for the deal was partly behind her losses here, and Rabhi said Biden\u2019s votes on Nafta were also a serious liability, and would be in a contest against Trump. However, said Michigan pollster Bernie Porn: \u201cTrade doesn\u2019t seem to have the same resonance in 2020.\u201d That seems backed up by the results of Super Tuesday. Biden won white working-class voters in eight states, a phenomenon that lifted him in Minnesota, which has a similar electorate. Sanders won Minnesota with 62% of the vote in 2016, but only got 30% this year. Porn noted that the failure of young people to turn out was partly responsible, and said reversing that trend was critical for Sanders\u2019 hopes in Michigan. \u201cIn just about every other state Bernie has come up short in terms of younger voters, so the question is, in Michigan, \u2018Can he generate turnout among younger voters that he has not generated in most of the other states?\u2019\u201d There are other variables. Elizabeth Warren has dropped out and that could bump Sanders\u2019 support. However, the Massachusetts senator hasn\u2019t endorsed anyone and some polling shows many of her supporters back Biden. Still, Sanders\u2019 base remains optimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s too much unknown to count him out in Michigan,\u201d Allen said.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Rosie Spaughton</strong></h2> <p>Games were never something I was very good at. Relationships on the other hand, came easily. A young, blonde, confident bisexual with two older brothers, I found boys totally unintimidating and girls mesmerising to be around. Flirting was my main language, and I couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would ever have dating woes.</p> <p>My brothers, on the other hand, never seemed to have girlfriends (or kept them extremely secret) and instead stayed in their shared room that had a computer, a television and an Xbox. I watched them play hours and hours of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/oct/17/worms-and-team17\">Worms</a>, Dungeon Keeper, Halo, Grand Theft Auto and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a>. I sat behind them, fascinated by all the guns and aliens, but I was never allowed to play. If I ever did manage to grab hold of a controller I was useless. No one had the time or the patience to help me get better. So I went back to hunting down my snogging victim, and they continued to hunt down the Covenant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Playing games with her family had impacted her life, and before we even moved in together she wanted to share that whimsical competitiveness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Years later, when I met my now-wife Rose, she told me about her favourite pastime of beating her brother at Top Spin on Nintendo GameCube and how she grew up watching her sister spend hours meticulously building the most perfect theme park on Rollercoaster Tycoon. Playing games with her family had impacted her life, and before we even moved in together she wanted to share that whimsical competitiveness with me. Rose set up her Xbox 360 and the first game we ever played together was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/18/how-we-made-grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a>. To my astonishment, my inability to drive in what could even remotely be considered a straight line was met, not with frustration, but complete joy. The kind of joy you get when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/14/tomb-raider-lara-croft-alicia-vikander-kickass-heroine\">Lara Croft</a> goes swimming and starts to breathe really heavily.</p> <p>Rose was hooked on my utter ineptitude, making me play game after game while she wept at my inability to do anything. She thought it was so funny she started to film it, and put it on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OLop0WVGjc&amp;t=736s\">our YouTube vlogging channel</a>. Our audience was so obsessed with these videos, it led us to start a comedy gaming channel; Let\u2019s Play Games, where my complete lack of skill became our trademark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c24b408f08b4c62dbfa104bb3cdedaa4edfacab8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c24b408f08b4c62dbfa104bb3cdedaa4edfacab8/0_0_1277_717/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Complete lack of skill\u2019 \u2026 Rosie, left, and Rose.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Complete lack of skill\u2019 \u2026 Rosie, left, and Rose.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Let's Play Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the first time in my life, someone actually enjoyed watching me play.</p> <p>Rose taught me everything she knew about gaming. Her knowledge, teamed with her determination to exact revenge on innocent bystanders who were simply respawning in GTA, was hot. Plus I liked the noises when she tapped on the controller.</p> <p>I learned about different consoles, different types of games and I quickly figured out for myself which was my favourite.</p> <p>There is only one game I have ever been any good at and that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/14/fortnite-has-reached-the-end-changing-video-games-for-good\">Fortnite</a>. Having been an enthusiastic fan of the movie <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/14/1\">Battle Royale</a> and later The Hunger Games, it is my perfect game. I love the idea that there can only be one winner. Now I have a headset and a microphone, I\u2019ve made new friends both online and in real life. I enjoy an ongoing competition with my little sister over who is further up the battlepass rankings, and it is something I can do in the evenings with Rose to truly relax. When it\u2019s been a stressful day, or when someone has wound me up, there\u2019s nothing I love more than to take a pickaxe to some buildings or shotgun blast some bananas. Gaming, like relationships, brings people joy \u2013 it\u2019s just that both require practice and confidence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aexaAjpbnyA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aexaAjpbnyA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Own goals \u2026 Rose and Rosie play Fifa 20</figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>Rose Ellen Dix</strong></h2> <p>Rosie wasn\u2019t lying when she said playing games with my family impacted my life. I was a Sega and Nintendo girl, while Rosie spent most of her childhood tied to a tree. Sure, accidentally wiping Commander Keen from the family computer and replacing the folder with one entitled \u201cPoo poo wee wee\u201d caused an immense amount of upset. Fortunately, as a seven-year-old I was forgiven, but I\u2019ve done plenty of questionable things since.</p> <p>One that\u2019s gone down in family history is the story of MeatSim 6. The first-person shooter <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-64/Perfect-Dark-269635.html\">Perfect Dark</a> was one of my favourite N64 games, the spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/05/goldeneye-007-game-review\">GoldenEye 007</a>, and my first experience of a strong female lead.</p> <p>The game included a co-op \u201ccombat simulator\u201d mode where players could choose from a variety of foes and then fight them together. My brother and I would usually take on a type called MeatSims: the least intelligent and lowest difficulty combatant in the simulator \u2013 apart from my brother. I thought it would be somewhat entertaining to rename my usual Player 2 to MeatSim 6 and enable friendly fire, thereby disguising myself as an enemy automaton. Then I repeatedly killed him with single shots to the back of the head and he couldn\u2019t understand how he was being victimised so artfully by the game\u2019s bottom-rung AI. His suspicion grew fast, but not as fast as my kill count. The moral of the story is never trust those closest to you, and don\u2019t underestimate your little sister\u2019s thirst for an indefensible kill. This is how I was raised.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Whether she's falling down a cliff, running into her own goal or driving into oncoming traffic, some spark of humanity forces me to congratulate her on her success. Is it love? Or pity?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t hold the same contempt for Rosie as I did for John growing up, so playing games with my wife is a far less bloodthirsty affair. I have a vicious competitive streak, but Rosie\u2019s novice skill level, with the exception of Fortnite of course, is something I find no pleasure in crushing. Whether she\u2019s falling down a cliff in Red Dead Redemption, running into her own goal on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aexaAjpbnyA\">Fifa 2020</a>, or driving into oncoming traffic on GTA5, some spark of humanity forces me to congratulate her on her success. Is it love? No. It\u2019s pity. But either way, playing games as a couple has brought reams of cry-laugh moments, especially when Rosie tried making a quick getaway from the San Andreas police department in a hearse. On an upward incline.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/18/rose-and-rosie-youtube-stars-interview-rose-ellen-dix-rosie-spaughton\">Rose and Rosie: 'We don't really have a filter'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As an adult I\u2019m drawn back to the games I grew up with, and I get great pleasure introducing Rosie to them. Was I mentally scarred by the messy footpaths in Theme Park, the time pressures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/tetris\">Tetris</a>, or the lack of actual support that Tails offered in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/gallery/2011/jun/24/12-best-sonic-hedgehog-games\">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>? Yes I was. But it\u2019s an endearing trauma. Not dissimilar to the trauma I inflict on my characters in The Sims.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgno06EziR-pK7k90W76CHg\">Playing video games together</a> allows us to unwind in the healthiest of ways and it reminds us that sometimes, you just have to screw over your partner to get ahead.</p>",

Years later, when I met my now-wife Rose, she told me about her favourite pastime of beating her brother at Top Spin on Nintendo GameCube and how she grew up watching her sister spend hours meticulously building the most perfect theme park on Rollercoaster Tycoon. Playing games with her family had impacted her life, and before we even moved in together she wanted to share that whimsical competitiveness with me. Rose set up her Xbox 360 and the first game we ever played together was Grand Theft Auto. To my astonishment, my inability to drive in what could even remotely be considered a straight line was met, not with frustration, but complete joy. The kind of joy you get when Lara Croft goes swimming and starts to breathe really heavily. Rose was hooked on my utter ineptitude, making me play game after game while she wept at my inability to do anything. She thought it was so funny she started to film it, and put it on our YouTube vlogging channel. Our audience was so obsessed with these videos, it led us to start a comedy gaming channel; Let\u2019s Play Games, where my complete lack of skill became our trademark. For the first time in my life, someone actually enjoyed watching me play. Rose taught me everything she knew about gaming. Her knowledge, teamed with her determination to exact revenge on innocent bystanders who were simply respawning in GTA, was hot. Plus I liked the noises when she tapped on the controller. I learned about different consoles, different types of games and I quickly figured out for myself which was my favourite. There is only one game I have ever been any good at and that is Fortnite. Having been an enthusiastic fan of the movie Battle Royale and later The Hunger Games, it is my perfect game. I love the idea that there can only be one winner. Now I have a headset and a microphone, I\u2019ve made new friends both online and in real life. I enjoy an ongoing competition with my little sister over who is further up the battlepass rankings, and it is something I can do in the evenings with Rose to truly relax. When it\u2019s been a stressful day, or when someone has wound me up, there\u2019s nothing I love more than to take a pickaxe to some buildings or shotgun blast some bananas. Gaming, like relationships, brings people joy \u2013 it\u2019s just that both require practice and confidence. Rose Ellen Dix Rosie wasn\u2019t lying when she said playing games with my family impacted my life. I was a Sega and Nintendo girl, while Rosie spent most of her childhood tied to a tree. Sure, accidentally wiping Commander Keen from the family computer and replacing the folder with one entitled \u201cPoo poo wee wee\u201d caused an immense amount of upset. Fortunately, as a seven-year-old I was forgiven, but I\u2019ve done plenty of questionable things since. One that\u2019s gone down in family history is the story of MeatSim 6. The first-person shooter Perfect Dark was one of my favourite N64 games, the spiritual successor to GoldenEye 007, and my first experience of a strong female lead. The game included a co-op \u201ccombat simulator\u201d mode where players could choose from a variety of foes and then fight them together. My brother and I would usually take on a type called MeatSims: the least intelligent and lowest difficulty combatant in the simulator \u2013 apart from my brother. I thought it would be somewhat entertaining to rename my usual Player 2 to MeatSim 6 and enable friendly fire, thereby disguising myself as an enemy automaton. Then I repeatedly killed him with single shots to the back of the head and he couldn\u2019t understand how he was being victimised so artfully by the game\u2019s bottom-rung AI. His suspicion grew fast, but not as fast as my kill count. The moral of the story is never trust those closest to you, and don\u2019t underestimate your little sister\u2019s thirst for an indefensible kill. This is how I was raised. I don\u2019t hold the same contempt for Rosie as I did for John growing up, so playing games with my wife is a far less bloodthirsty affair. I have a vicious competitive streak, but Rosie\u2019s novice skill level, with the exception of Fortnite of course, is something I find no pleasure in crushing. Whether she\u2019s falling down a cliff in Red Dead Redemption, running into her own goal on Fifa 2020, or driving into oncoming traffic on GTA5, some spark of humanity forces me to congratulate her on her success. Is it love? No. It\u2019s pity. But either way, playing games as a couple has brought reams of cry-laugh moments, especially when Rosie tried making a quick getaway from the San Andreas police department in a hearse. On an upward incline. As an adult I\u2019m drawn back to the games I grew up with, and I get great pleasure introducing Rosie to them. Was I mentally scarred by the messy footpaths in Theme Park, the time pressures of Tetris, or the lack of actual support that Tails offered in Sonic the Hedgehog 2? Yes I was. But it\u2019s an endearing trauma. Not dissimilar to the trauma I inflict on my characters in The Sims. Playing video games together allows us to unwind in the healthiest of ways and it reminds us that sometimes, you just have to screw over your partner to get ahead.",

      "body": "<p>Some people see being single as an active, positive choice, but for several years that wasn\u2019t my experience. I railed against it, resenting the fact that I was alone. I had dated a lot, but why couldn\u2019t I find the right man? Why had someone I really liked rejected me? Why did all my friends have husbands or boyfriends and kids, while I spent ages lurching from lust to loneliness and back again? It didn\u2019t seem fair.</p> <p>Each time I had a bad experience, or a good one, I had a tendency to tell all my female friends, providing endless information about the man who said I was awesome but kept cancelling, the date whose dog was more interested in me than he was, or the bloke I knew as a teenager with whom my mother set me up as an adult (predictably, a disaster).</p> <p>With many of my friends settled in long-term relationships, they naturally turned to me to hear about adventures in single-land, or would ask to see a photo of whomever I had been on a date with the night before. \u201cI love your stories,\u201d a friend said during a group dinner last year. I took that as a compliment \u2013 as a writer, my job is to tell stories. But although I thrived on friends\u2019 reactions to my hilarious tales, that only provided a short-term high. Deep down, all I really wanted was for my stories to end with love and happiness.</p> <p>Then one day last autumn, I had a revelation: I was the one who had perpetuated these narratives, prepared to spill everything to anyone who asked. Telling all and sundry about my love life meant people would \u2013 kindly \u2013 follow up, asking how things were going. But when something bad happened, I had to update them on that too, so that the \u201cpoor me\u201d or \u201chilarious me\u201d storylines continued.</p> <p>So I decided to start keeping my love life private, choosing how much to reveal and to whom. I could still have great, open conversations with all my friends about other topics, but when the inevitable \u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d question came up, I began to be vague about it, or simply said no.

Would I offend someone if I didn\u2019t spill the beans? Actually, no. Boundaries are good. When recently a single friend needed help writing a dating profile, she asked to see mine. But it felt like a step too far and I politely declined. Another asked why things did not work out with a guy I dated a few months ago, but I gently said I didn\u2019t feel like going into detail and that I would let her know when I was with someone great. It sometimes felt harsh to shut down questions from people who cared about me, because we were used to discussing everything, but the more I got used to it, the easier it became.</p> <p>I am sure that my lack of oversharing has benefited my friendships, too; it may be a relief for friends not to feel they have to ask about my love life or provide a sympathetic ear all the time.</p> <p>I also discovered that always talking about dating, or discussing my lack of a relationship, was making me define myself solely as a single woman. Telling people that I have decided to talk less about my love life, and even hearing myself say it out loud, has helped me stick to my decision. Now that I keep that side of me relatively private, I am embracing other aspects of my personality and life: my work, the joy of having two gorgeous nephews, my newfound fitness regime and a love of being outdoors. I have also started to really appreciate my independence and I absolutely relish a day to myself.</p> <p>Now, when something funny or exciting happens in my dating life, I smile to myself and maybe just text one close single friend about it. And if something sad occurs, instead of group texting, I sit with the feeling, sleep on it and then contact one or two people if it feels right. I know that from a mental health perspective, allowing those emotions to percolate is a good thing for me; texting a million friends might have resulted in loads of sympathy, but it only served to distract me from my feelings. Ultimately, the only person who can decide whether someone I am dating is the right kind of man to have a relationship with is me. </p>",

It\u2019s hard to keep up with all the ways the country\u2019s political culture has deteriorated over the relatively short period since the referendum. The language of betrayal and treachery, at first a shock on the front pages that pronounced British judges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/04/enemies-of-the-people-british-newspapers-react-judges-brexit-ruling\" title=\"\">\u201cenemies of the people\u201d</a>, quickly became normalised as the withdrawal agreement negotiations turned into a sort of war re-enactment. Brexit became not a matter of bloodless negotiation with a large trading bloc, where both parties naturally wanted to maximise their positions, but an exercise in national chest-thumping as EU technocrats looked on bemused.</p> <p>The false binary of British or European was created. A new traitor, the \u201ccitizen of nowhere\u201d, was identified. If they were not 100% with us, they must be against us. Britain prevailing and making a success of Brexit became a matter of believing, of having faith in your country: even the act of questioning or worrying about the future became suspect.</p> <p>Some of it we can laugh at.

We can be almost entertained by the awkward patriotic virtue-signalling of Conservative MPs sipping good old English cuppas. Rishi Sunak, of Winchester, Oxford and Stanford, and only recently of Yorkshire when he became an MP just five years ago, tweeted a picture of himself with the caption: \u201cQuick Budget prep break making tea for the team. Nothing like a good <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1230849813119471616?s=20\" title=\"\">Yorkshire brew</a>.\u201d</p> <p>But the rest isn\u2019t funny. And any hope that it would subside with the delivery of Brexit, that the fever would break once it became clear that there was no conspiracy to thwart the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, has disappeared with Johnson\u2019s new government. In fake \u201cpatriot games\u201d, he and Cummings have built a team around themselves that is more fortress than government, in a party that has barricaded itself against the country and against Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/08/ideologues-downing-st-opposition-events-johnson-cummings\">The ideologues of Downing St now face the opposition of events</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We should call things what they are.

Every flag-waving gimmick, every stunt, every media swipe at an elected \u201cbureaucrat\u201d for doing their job leads to this. It is no longer limited to a conflict between leavers or remainers, or internecine scuffles within the government itself. Loyalty tests are now determining whether we receive vital information from our closest neighbours on a pandemic, and who sits on the boards of public institutions.

Strengthening Britain\u2019s position against the EU will happen literally over our dead bodies. Soon, there will no criteria for how a public interest role is filled other than the candidate\u2019s fealty and acquiescence to the control centre of a government that has put ideological loyalty above professional ability. Consider Alok Sharma, the secretary of state for business and new, UK-appointed president of the vital UN climate conference in Glasgow at the end of this year. Yet he has voted against setting decarbonisation targets, and has opposed incentives for renewable energy, and requiring the energy industry to have a carbon capture and storage strategy. Under Johnson\u2019s government of vassals, the ability to do a job well seems to have become a disqualifying feature, lest someone\u2019s vocational excellence and integrity undermine their pliancy. It was only a matter of time before \u201chaving enough of experts\u201d turned into blocking those experts from doing their jobs \u2013 whether to make our lives safer, or our cultural life richer. It\u2019s hard to keep up with all the ways the country\u2019s political culture has deteriorated over the relatively short period since the referendum. The language of betrayal and treachery, at first a shock on the front pages that pronounced British judges \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, quickly became normalised as the withdrawal agreement negotiations turned into a sort of war re-enactment. Brexit became not a matter of bloodless negotiation with a large trading bloc, where both parties naturally wanted to maximise their positions, but an exercise in national chest-thumping as EU technocrats looked on bemused. The false binary of British or European was created. A new traitor, the \u201ccitizen of nowhere\u201d, was identified. If they were not 100% with us, they must be against us. Britain prevailing and making a success of Brexit became a matter of believing, of having faith in your country: even the act of questioning or worrying about the future became suspect. Some of it we can laugh at. Nonsense about \u201cpatriotic breakfasts\u201d the British negotiating team ate this month before talks began reveals only the juvenile pettiness of Tory HQ. We can be almost entertained by the awkward patriotic virtue-signalling of Conservative MPs sipping good old English cuppas. Rishi Sunak, of Winchester, Oxford and Stanford, and only recently of Yorkshire when he became an MP just five years ago, tweeted a picture of himself with the caption: \u201cQuick Budget prep break making tea for the team. Nothing like a good Yorkshire brew.\u201d But the rest isn\u2019t funny. And any hope that it would subside with the delivery of Brexit, that the fever would break once it became clear that there was no conspiracy to thwart the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, has disappeared with Johnson\u2019s new government. In fake \u201cpatriot games\u201d, he and Cummings have built a team around themselves that is more fortress than government, in a party that has barricaded itself against the country and against Europe. We should call things what they are. As we slip further into a dark timeline, being pro-EU is no longer simply a defunct remain position, it is a way for the Tories to sort people into us and them. This is authoritarianism. And it has to be challenged. We ignore culture-war skirmishes at our peril. Every flag-waving gimmick, every stunt, every media swipe at an elected \u201cbureaucrat\u201d for doing their job leads to this. It is no longer limited to a conflict between leavers or remainers, or internecine scuffles within the government itself. Loyalty tests are now determining whether we receive vital information from our closest neighbours on a pandemic, and who sits on the boards of public institutions. They may seem like separate isolated, containable incidents. But that\u2019s what we always say about the first stages of a spreading virus. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2020 to remove an incorrect reference to Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Boris Johnson to chair Cobra meeting Hello, Warren Murray here with a stockpile of news \u2013 plenty to share round. Share markets are braced for their biggest falls since the global financial crisis after the trading week began with panic selling amid the double threat of coronavirus-driven recession and a Saudi-triggered oil price war. There are early projections for the FTSE100 to plunge by more than 6% at the open, while the Dow Jones is on course to lose 4.9% in New York later in the day. Turning away from the markets for a moment: Boris Johnson will this morning chair his first emergency Cobra meeting on the coronavirus in a week to consider whether tougher measures are needed. The number of British cases has increased by a third to 278 while the number of deaths has risen to three. Charities are working out plans to feed up to 3 million disadvantaged students who rely on free school meals and might be left to go hungry if there are school closures. Meanwhile a cross-Whitehall unit has been set up to counter coronavirus-related disinformation, including from Russia and China, with civil servants working closely with social media companies to rebut false and inaccurate claims. Further afield, Italy has been plunged into chaos as fatalities increased more than 50% to 366 and government plans to lock down large parts of the country\u2019s north, holding about 25% of the population, were leaked to the media. The stranded cruise ship Grand Princess is expected to finally dock in Oakland, California today. Saudi Arabia has cordoned off the oil-rich region of Shia Qatif, suspended air and sea travel to nine countries and closed schools and universities. The wave of selling on stock markets in the Asia-Pacific was the worst since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, with Australia losing 7.33%, the Nikkei down nearly 6% and Hong Kong down 3.5%. The Japanese yen and gold have spiked as investors seek safe havens. Follow all coronavirus developments today at our live blog. * * * Man \u2018carrying knives\u2019 shot dead \u2013 Overnight, police in Westminster have shot dead a man who they said produced knives when he was approached. The Metropolitan police said the case was not terror-related. The shooting is understood to have happened in the Whitehall area of London, which is packed full of sensitive government and official buildings. Under the law, any shooting by the police has to be investigated by the independent police watchdog. * * * Salmond trial begins \u2013 Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland, goes on trial today on multiple charges of sexual assault, including one of attempted rape \u2013 charges he has strongly denied, and to which he has pleaded not guilty. Salmond is accused of assaulting 10 women over an eight-year period, including nine incidents alleged to have taken place at Bute House, the first minister\u2019s official residence in Edinburgh. The crown case will be led by Alex Prentice QC while Scotland\u2019s most senior advocate, Gordon Jackson QC, will appear for Salmond. The trial will be overseen by Lady Dorrian. Our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, sets the scene. * * * \u2018Waive veteran visa fees\u2019 \u2013 Commonwealth veterans who served with the UK military are facing visa fees of thousands of pounds if they want to stay following discharge. On Commonwealth Day the Royal British Legion is calling for the immediate abolition of the fees, which have left some facing deportation. The armed forces recruit up to 1,350 Commonwealth personnel each year, mostly from Africa, the Caribbean and Fiji. After four years or more they are eligible to apply to stay but, as an example, a service leaver and partner with two children face nearly \u00a310,000 in fees. Charles Byrne from the Legion said: \u201cThis is a poor way of saying thank you to people we encouraged to leave their countries and come to serve in the British armed forces \u2026 we urge the home secretary to take action to help Commonwealth military veterans who have served this country loyally and abolish all visa application fees.\u201d * * * Missile salvo \u2013 North Korea has fired three unidentified projectiles off its eastern coast, a week after launching two short-range missiles, South Korea\u2019s military has said. The projectiles were launched on Monday from the coastal town of Sondok, which has a military airfield. Britain, Germany, France, Estonia and Belgium have raised last week\u2019s missile firings at the UN security council, calling them a provocative action violating UN resolutions. * * * Renewables fill coal hole \u2013 Carbon emissions from the global electricity system fell by 2% last year while power from coal plants fell 3%, the climate thinktank Ember says. The biggest drop in almost 30 years came as the US and the EU turned to cleaner energy sources \u2013 and despite China\u2019s use of coal plants actually climbing. Ember has warned that its findings rely on many one-off factors including milder winters across many countries. \u201cProgress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,\u201d said the report, which reveals that renewable wind and solar power rose by 15% in 2019 to make up 8% of the world\u2019s electricity. Today in Focus podcast: Hadley Freeman\u2019s family secrets When the Guardian writer found an old shoebox full of pictures and documents in the back of a wardrobe, it began a quest to find the real story of her family\u2019s history and her grandmother\u2019s escape to America from the Nazis. Plus: Annette McGivney on the problem with almond milk. Lunchtime read: China\u2019s blanket security may not go away Chinese citizens are living under a new level of government intrusion: getting into one\u2019s apartment or workplace requires scanning a QR code, and writing down your name and ID number, temperature and recent travel history. Phone companies track people\u2019s movements and social media platforms are used to report others who may be sick. Some cities are offering people rewards for informing on sick neighbours. Chinese companies are rolling out facial recognition to detect elevated temperatures and people not wearing face masks. Apps can alert people to whether they are near or have been in contact with an infected person. From top officials to local community workers, those enforcing the rules repeat the same refrain: this is an \u201cextraordinary time\u201d, feichang shiqi, requiring extraordinary measures. But as the number of new infections appears to fall, residents and observers are asking whether these new measures might be here to stay. Sport Eddie Jones has revealed he will hold talks with the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, over potentially extending his contract through to the 2023 World Cup. The England coach has improved the national side, writes Robert Kitson, but calamitous PR, the perverse selections and occasional verbal excesses overshadow his role. Joe Marler will discover today if he faces punishment for grabbing Alun Wyn Jones\u2019s genitals during the Six Nations victory over Wales, while Gregor Townsend insisted that Mohamed Haouas\u2019s first-half red card was not the determining factor in Scotland\u2019s 28-10 victory over France. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r believes Manchester United are heading back towards the top after his team, inspired by Bruno Fernandes, recorded a third victory over Manchester City this season at Old Trafford. The Englishman Tyrrell Hatton claimed his first win on the PGA Tour by one shot from Marc Leishman at the Arnold Palmer Invitational but Rory McIlroy failed to mount a challenge. A narrow 1-0 win over Japan at the SheBelieves Cup did little to answer the numerous questions asked about England\u2019s future under coach Phil Neville. Wigan returned to the top of Super League and underlined their early-season position as the team to beat, although they were given a stern test by an injury-hit, resilient Hull KR side. Lastly, Italian Formula One teams have started arriving in Australia, and there is no chance of the opening grand prix of the season being cancelled or being held behind closed doors despite fears over the coronavirus, say race organisers. Business As if the coronavirus wasn\u2019t enough to shake the business world, February\u2019s poor weather and the burden of business rates are creating a perfect storm for the retail sector.

Some experts predicted it could fall even further unless the Saudis and Russians returned to the bargaining table. \u201cI think all forecasts are out the window,\u201d said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. \u201cIt seems like a race to the bottom to secure order(s).\u201d The turmoil on international markets came as the outbreak continued to deepen around the world and bring more restrictions on movements from governments: Italy was plunged into chaos as the number of fatalities increased by more than 50% to 366 and government plans to lock down large parts of the country\u2019s north, or about 25% of the population, were leaked to the media. The stranded cruise ship Grand Princess was expected to finally dock in Oakland, California on Monday as arrangements were made for its 3,500 crew and passengers, some of whom have contracted the virus. The number of deaths in the US rose to 21 with more than 550 confirmed cases. Saudi Arabia cordoned off the oil-rich, predominantly Shia region ofQatif, suspended air and sea travel to nine countries and closed schools and universities as the number of cases in the kingdom continued to increase. Organisers of the Australian Grand Prix, set to kick off the Formula One season in Melbourne on Sunday, said there was \u201cno chance\u201d the race would be called off despite rising concerns about the event\u2019s large crowds facilitating the spread of the disease. As concern grew over a possible recession in Australia as a result of the virus, a wave of selling on stock markets in Asia Pacific was the worst since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 heralded the onset of the global financial crisis. The Australian share market closed down 7.33% as energy companies saw double-digit losses. The Nikkei in Japan was down 5% while shares in Hong Kong were off 3.5%. US 10-year government bond yields fell to fresh record lows and the Japanese yen and gold spiked as investors piled into safe havens. Futures trading in Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P500 index of leading companies was suspended when losses reached the so-called \u201climit down\u201d of 5%. \u201cThere is genuine panic in the price action \u2026\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at the web trading platform Pepperstone in Melbourne. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this for years.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said the market would not bottom out until the US situation was clearer. \u201cWe need a clear sign that the outbreak in the US is contained but we\u2019re not there yet because the number of cases and deaths is still on the rise. We have to see what happens with containment measures there, such as travel restrictions and shutdowns.\u201d The ratings agency Moody\u2019s said on Monday that the risk of a global recession was rising as the spread of the coronavirus causes a simultaneous supply and demand shock throughout the world economy. Joachim Fels, the chief economist of the world\u2019s biggest bond trader, Pimco, said in a note to clients that a recession in the US and Europe was a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d. \u201cThe worst for the economy is yet to come over the next several months,\u201d he said, according to Bloomberg, citing the impact of the virus on demand and supply, weaker Chinese manufacturing and a hit on the global tourism industry. The OECD said last week that a severe outbreak of the coronavirus could cut global growth by 0.5 to 1.5%. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said they were setting aside billions of pounds for developing world countries to support ailing health systems and offset the worst of the impact from falling commodity prices. The accountants BDO said a dramatic rebound in optimism among British businesses since the beginning of the year could be jeopardised by a more severe outbreak of the virus. It said the services sector enjoyed the biggest rise in optimism last month following the end of the Brexit stalemate. The report said the rise in confidence reflected the underlying improvement in business conditions as a result of a more certain political and economic outlook. It follows three months of marginal increases in optimism, as businesses appeared to be in wait-and-see mode in the immediately after the general election, the firm said. Kaley Crossthwaite of BDO LLP said: \u201cWe have just witnessed the most significant uplift in business optimism in 10 years, and the impact of greater political and economic certainty brought by a new majority government should not be underestimated. \u201cHowever, businesses will now be spending the coming weeks focused on mitigating the uncertainty caused by coronavirus. \u201cThe next month will be crucial in determining whether this optimism can remain, or if the \u2018Boris bounce\u2019 will be brought back down to earth by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d",

The new strategy adopted by Riyadh appears to target Russia and US shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months. Other Opec producers, such as Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, are expected to follow Saudi Arabia\u2019s lead with price cuts and increased production from April. The Saudi decision came after marathon talks at the Opec headquarters in Vienna, when the Russian energy minister, Alexander Novak, said that from 1 April neither Opec nor non-Opec countries had any restrictions on production. The sources said April\u2019s production would be significantly higher than 10m bpd, possibly closer to 11m bpd. In the past couple of months, Saudi Arabia has been pumping 9.7m bpd. Saudi Arabia has an oil output capacity of 12m bpd, giving it the ability to swiftly increase production. China\u2019s fast-growing economy was responsible for around 80% of global oil demand growth last year according to the IEA, but the coronavirus has forced the country to shut factories and refineries across the key industrial province of Hubei, and left tankers of crude stranded off its coast. The IEA\u2019s latest report pins global oil demand at 99.9m barrels a day this year, but it admitted that Covid-19 could drive demand lower than these predictions if countries failed to contain the virus. The world\u2019s oil demand could contract by as much as 730,000 barrels a day in 2020 in a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario. If the virus is contained quickly around the world, global oil demand could grow by 480,000 barrels a day, according to the IEA. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis is adding to the uncertainties [which] the global oil industry faces as it contemplates new investments and business strategies,\u201d the IEA\u2019s Birol said. \u201cThe impact of the coronavirus on oil markets may be temporary. But the longer-term challenges facing the world\u2019s suppliers are not going to go away, especially those heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues.\u201d",

A new report on the world\u2019s electricity generation revealed the steepest cut in carbon emissions since 1990 as the US and the EU turned to cleaner energy sources. Overall, power from coal plants fell by 3% last year, even as China\u2019s reliance on coal plants climbed for another year to make up half the world\u2019s coal generation for the first time. Coal generation in the US and Europe has halved since 2007, and last year collapsed by almost a quarter in the EU and by 16% in the US. The report from climate thinktank Ember, formerly Sandbag, warned that the dent in the world\u2019s coal-fired electricity generation relied on many one-off factors, including milder winters across many countries. \u201cProgress is being made on reducing coal generation, but nothing like with the urgency needed to limit climate change,\u201d the report said.

To meet the Paris climate goals, the world needs to record a compound growth rate of 15% for wind and solar generation every year \u2013 which will require \u201ca colossal effort\u201d, the report warned. The electricity generation report was published as a separate piece of research claimed that 38 out of 75 of the world\u2019s largest asset managers are stalling on taking action on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The latest ranking by Asset Owners Disclosure Project, a scheme managed by the investment campaign group ShareAction, found that the 38 asset managers have weak or nonexistent policy commitments and fail to account for their real-world impacts across their mainstream assets.

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence put pressure on regulators to delay safety warnings about a new drone it planned to fly over British skies to avoid tipping off protesters, according to official documents obtained by the Guardian. They reveal how the ministry was embroiled in a behind-the-scenes row with British safety regulators over the US-built drone, which was being flown from North Dakota to a military base in Gloucestershire. The drone, named \u201cProtector\u201d, will be able to attack targets in many parts of the world with precision missiles and laser-guided bombs. With a wingspan of 24 metres, it can remain airborne for up to 40 hours with a maximum speed of 240mph. It will replace the current generation of drones, known as Reapers, which are not permitted to fly over Britain because of safety issues. Normally civilian pilots flying commercial jets, private planes and gliders in British airspace are given 60 days\u2019 notice to stay clear of specific blocks of airspace, known as temporary danger areas, to avoid mid-air crashes. However, the documents reveal that the MoD wanted regulators to give only six days\u2019 warning to the public. The ministry wanted to prevent protesters organising a demonstration about the drone, according to the documents. Regulators said that the longer the delay in issuing the warnings over the Protector flight to Gloucestershire, which took place in the summer of 2018 and was the first time a drone had made a transatlantic journey through British civilian airspace, the higher the risk of other planes crashing into the drone. They complained that they had received \u201chuge\u201d pushback from the MoD to delay as long as possible, despite the danger to gliders holding a competition close to the route that the Protector drone was scheduled to take. The MoD is spending more than \u00a31.1bn to buy a 16-strong squadron of Protector drones that will be able to fly for twice as long as the Reapers they are replacing. They are scheduled to start operating by 2024 from a Lincolnshire airbase. The MoD is buying the drones from the US arms manufacturer General Atomics and chose to call it Protector in contrast to the previous American model, named Predator. General Atomics flew one of the new drones to an airbase in Fairford, Gloucestershire from its test centre in North Dakota in the US in July 2018. The firm displayed the drone at a huge airshow where more than 100,000 spectators viewed hundreds of military aircraft from around the world. Emails released under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed the row between the MoD and the Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for aviation safety in the UK. A month before the scheduled 11 July flight, a CAA official wrote to a colleague: \u201cGeneral Atomics had wished to issue a press release last week or early this week but the MoD has blocked this due to concerns about the potential for \u2018anti [military] drone\u2019 protests hampering the arrival at Fairford if the flight is publicised too early.\u201d The official said \u201cclearly there is a conflict between the MoD\u2019s concerns\u201d and that the CAA needed to warn others that designated blocks of airspace had to be closed off. On 19 June, a CAA official wrote there was an MoD worry about anti-drone protesters \u201chindering this flight or causing a scene\u201d. Another CAA official said the MoD wanted the warnings publicised on 5 July, when usually they would be issued at least 60 days before specific sections of airspace were closed. \u201cWe have significant concerns this is too late,\u201d the official wrote. \u201cThe longer we leave it to notify, the higher the risk of airspace infringements.\u201d One official wrote that \u201cpatience is running thin thanks to the MoD\u201d, while another said: \u201cWe are running out of time here and the MoD now trying to run this is inducing frustration.\u201d On 20 June, a CAA official emailed General Atomics to say that gliders were organising a big competition about 10 miles north of the drone\u2019s intended flight path. \u201cWe feel this is now a huge push to go public, so the British Gliding Association and other airspace users can plan accordingly to remain clear of the [drone\u2019s] airspace,\u201d the official wrote. The CAA ended up overruling the MoD and issued a safety warning to the public on 25 June \u2013 about two weeks before the drone flew to Fairford over Wales. Anti-drone protesters said the military\u2019s clandestine pressure on the independent British safety regulator over the flight was extremely worrying. Chris Cole, founder of the Drone Wars group that campaigns to ban drones, said the CAA would make significant decisions on the safety of the new generation of military drones. \u201cThe fact that the MoD has already successfully exerted pressure to get the CAA to bend safety rules in relation to the flight of a Protector is extremely disturbing,\u201d he said. According to Cole, the 2018 flight was a PR exercise also designedto help convince safety regulators that the Protector drone \u2013 unlike the current generation of Reapers \u2013 could be flown regularly in Britain\u2019s skies. Responding to a request for comment, an MoD spokesperson said the ministry \u201chad worked collegiately with the CAA, and multiple other parties to ensure the successful participation\u201d of the drone at the airshow. \u201cThis meticulous planning ensured that the flight was completely routine, demonstrating the ability of the crew and aircraft to safely integrate into civilian airspace,\u201d they said.",

The trial, expected to last between three to four weeks, takes place in court three of the high court in Edinburgh, a squat neo-Georgian building constructed between the wars on a stretch of the Royal Mile called the Lawnmarket. More than 40 newspaper and broadcasting journalists, including some from overseas media, are expected to attend the hearings.

Now convenor of the Faculty of Advocates human rights and rule of law committee, McCall is also a part-time sheriff and chair of the Scottish arm of the legal rights campaign group Justice, after serving on the Scottish human rights commission, where she helped produce an action plan for justice for child abuse survivors. \u201cShe\u2019s easily one of the best QCs in the country; she\u2019s a proper lawyer,\u201d said one colleague. \u201cShe\u2019s very well respected throughout the profession and has attracted a great deal of instructions as a result of it.\u201d An understated lawyer with nearly 40 years\u2019 experience, Prentice has prosecuted some of Scotland\u2019s most high-profile cases, including winning murder convictions against Nat Fraser in 2012 and David Gilroy in the same year although no bodies were found, and the perjury case against the Solidarity leader Tommy Sheridan.

I got into my pyjamas and had a nightcap. I then looked at my watch and it was 10 past six.\u201d</p> <p>Coles is still adjusting to the quietness of a household that has recently halved in size. David\u2019s death at 42 was unexpected, the result of an underlying health condition that had caused internal bleeding. When he was rushed to A&amp;E in an ambulance for surgery, Coles assumed it was just another day; he had a carol service that evening to prepare for. But David never recovered from the operation.</p> <p>Coles is sitting on a worn beige sofa in the living room of his village vicarage in Finedon, Northamptonshire, his dog collar poking out from behind a grey jumper. One dachshund (Pongo, nine) is draped over his lap, snoring, the other (Daisy, 11) is nestled against his side. Coles did have three more dachshunds \u2013 Audrey, Horatio and General Custer \u2013 but after David died, he found five were too many to look after. He reluctantly rehomed them with David\u2019s mother and brother, and his dentist. \u201cThey went to good homes, but it was so hard,\u201d he says. \u201cSeeing them go, with their little dog faces, was just horrible.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s a title he has often spurned, Coles is Britain\u2019s de facto celebrity vicar, a result of his pop-stardom with the Communards in the mid-80s \u2013 which included the No 1 dance smash Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way, and his position as one of the most high-profile gay clergymen in the world. His warmth and ability to distil the most complicated ideas have drawn fans from the unlikeliest of places (he was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/11174830/Meet-Richard-Coles-the-atheists-favourite-vicar.html\" title=\"\">once described</a> as the \u201catheist\u2019s favourite vicar\u201d).</p> <p>Millions of listeners tune in to hear his measured, soothing tones on BBC Radio 4\u2019s hugely popular morning show Saturday Live. His television work has ranged from competing on MasterChef and Strictly Come Dancing to hosting Songs of Praise and Have I Got News For You. He is also a prolific presence on Twitter \u2013 so much so that he has given it up for Lent. </p> <p>Being a gay former pop star, who swears and admits to having taken drugs, has made him a modernising force in the Church of England just by virtue of being there. And to many, he represents the best of what the church can be.</p> <p>Yet now, a man who so often helps others to examine life\u2019s moral questions has found himself in need of help. He is now looking to others for guidance to help him through grief. The flock is leading the shepherd. One widow gave Coles her late husband\u2019s accordion, an instrument he\u2019s always been keen to learn (he can so far play three songs, including the Godfather theme).</p> <p>\u201cAfter David died, there was a woman at the hospital who had been widowed, too. She said, \u2018You\u2019re going to be mad, for a while. People will never be as nice to you again as they are now, so milk it for all you can.\u2019\u201d Coles can attest to the madness. The day after David\u2019s death, he went to the supermarket and came back with three different types of parmesan.</p> <p>A lot about grief has surprised him: the volume of \u201csadmin\u201d you have to do when someone dies, how much harder it is travelling for work alone (\u201cI always used to call David when I stayed in a hotel on my own\u201d), the sting of typing out a text message to his partner, then realising he is no longer there.</p> <p>The hardest part has been looking ahead. \u201cI\u2019ve had to subtract David from the future and that has taken all the future with it,\u201d says Coles. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit blank. I think: \u2018What the fuck am I going to do? Play the accordion and go to bed at 10 past six, I guess. Of course, it\u2019s not the end of my life. But it feels like it\u2019s over sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Coles, 57, was born in Kettering, not far from his present parish. He was always, as he writes in his 2014 memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/15/fathomless-riches-reverend-richard-coles-review\" title=\"f\">Fathomless Riches</a>, \u201cscreamingly gay\u201d. Not being able to pass as straight never bothered him. \u201cIf you come from somewhere like Kettering, you feel a moral responsibility to fly the flag of flamboyance,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Coles came out to his mother when he was 16 by playing Tom Robinson\u2019s record Glad to Be Gay very loudly four times in a row. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d84b7f5fc363f320775a012e6ab649a33bd602ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d84b7f5fc363f320775a012e6ab649a33bd602ff/38_0_1320_792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coles and his late partner David Oldham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coles and his late partner David.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Richard Coles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once out, however, things unravelled for him. \u201cI had a mental crisis after I came out,\u201d he says. \u201cI think, for some time, I hadn\u2019t been open about my sexuality and when I was, there was a release of inner tension, and that became a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>He attempted suicide and was diagnosed with clinical depression; he was admitted to St Andrews psychiatric hospital in Northampton. \u201cLife seemed to be pretty futile, and I just couldn\u2019t see why you would want to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Depression has been a constant companion for Coles. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt as desolate as I felt then,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you look around the world sometimes and wonder why you wouldn\u2019t be depressed. But there\u2019s so much to not be depressed about too.\u201d</p> <p>It would be some time before he found the church. He moved to London in the 1980s, immersing himself in the city\u2019s growing gay scene. He met Bronski Beat\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/17/jimmy-somerville-smalltown-boy-bronski-beat-communards-interview\" title=\"j\">Jimmy So</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/17/jimmy-somerville-smalltown-boy-bronski-beat-communards-interview\" title=\"j\">merville </a>in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/28/gays-the-word-bookshop-sold-obscene-material-archive-1985\" title=\"g\">Gay\u2019s The Word</a> bookshop in Bloomsbury. Although Coles didn\u2019t harbour an ambition to be a pop star, he had been a choirboy and played saxophone at school, and Somerville asked him to join the band.

Coles had a scare when he was diagnosed with shingles, a viral condition often associated with HIV. He had a test and waited the necessary 10 days for the results. During that period he had a fierce row with Somerville \u2013 their relationship was notoriously tempestuous \u2013 in which he told the singer that he was HIV positive. He also told many of his friends. But the test result came back negative.</p> <p>\u201cI lied about having HIV,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was such a stupid thing to have done. I was lying in a grave in my mind [waiting for the results] and because I had a fight with Jimmy I blurted out that I was HIV positive \u2013 I think just to shut him up, actually. Then I kind of went with it. I had to do the rounds and tell people that I wasn\u2019t [HIV positive], which was humiliating. Especially because there were people who were not making it up.\u201d</p> <p>Is it his biggest regret? \u201cIt was not my finest hour,\u201d he says, \u201cand it was tough asking people for forgiveness for having done it, but they did, actually. Of course I regret it.\u201d</p> <p>Coles lost many friends during the HIV epidemic, including the gay activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/21/mark-ashton-gay-pride-film\" title=\"M\">Mark Ashton</a>, who was portrayed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/14/pride-film-review-mark-kermode-power-in-unlikely-union\" title=\"2\">2014 film Pride</a>. \u201cHalf the people you knew died,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d be dead in a week. It was just so traumatic. We were so young. I really still miss some of the people. Mark Ashton \u2013 what would he have become? So many men were in their 20s and 30s. God knows what they would have been. I just wish they hadn\u2019t died.\u201d</p> <p>The epidemic brought Coles closer to God, in a similar way, he says, to the spike in the number of men who sought ordination after the second world war. He spent much of his youth as an atheist (even setting up an atheist society at school), but after the years of fame, drugs and grief, he consulted a psychiatrist, who suggested he see a priest.</p> <p>Something struck him; he later did a degree in theology and in 2003 was selected to train for the priesthood in the Church of England. Does he ever see a tension between his past and present lives? \u201cAs a punk-inspired homosexual pop star, I think vicar actually kind of works, really,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very countercultural now. It really is, and there\u2019s something continuous between the two things. Although perhaps not everyone will see it that way.\u201d Certainly, Coles is a great performer and public speaker.</p> <p>He says he never had any issue reconciling his faith and his sexuality \u2013 being gay was just \u201ca variation on the universal theory of human sexuality\u201d \u2013 and he has had nothing but support from his congregation and his C of E bosses (although some parishioners did leave Finedon when he was appointed vicar in 2011). The Church of England\u2019s stance on LGBT equality, in particular same-sex marriage, has left Coles struggling to represent it at times, however.</p> <p>\u201cI did choose a profession that is probably the last to hold out against [LGBT] equality,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so awful\u2026 Sometimes I\u2019m ashamed of it and I think: \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When news of his partner\u2019s death broke, Coles received homophobic letters and emails rejoicing in his loss. \u201cOne began, \u2018I cannot begin to tell you how glad I am to hear the news that David has died,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe funny thing is, it didn\u2019t affect me at all because I had enough real shit to be dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>The police took the letters, assuring Coles that he had been the victim of a hate crime, although an investigation came to nothing.</p> <p>It was through the church that Coles met his partner, after giving a sermon. David, who was 15 years his junior, approached him after a service and said there were some spiritual questions he would like to talk over.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the minute we met \u2013 boom!\u201d Coles says. \u201cI never for a minute thought \u2013 no matter what happened \u2013 we would ever part.\u201d</p> <p>The couple became civil partners in 2011. \u201cHe said that if I didn\u2019t make an honest man of him, he would go off with somebody else.\u201d</p> <p>Coles laments the fact that he couldn\u2019t marry David. The Church of England forbids same-sex marriage and doing so could have led to both men losing their bishop\u2019s licence, which allowed them to work as priests \u2013 they planned to wait until they had retired. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've had to subtract David from the future. What am I going to do? Play the accordion and go to bed at 10 past six?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even in a civil partnership, priests must commit to celibacy. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous but it\u2019s where we are,\u201d says Coles, who has always spoken candidly about the fact that he and David were celibate. \u201cIt kind of worked and it was OK for us, it sort of suited our lives. But I minded having to.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what David was like, Coles says his partner brought out the best in him. \u201cI have to be right, and think things through, and work out my position,\u201d says Coles.</p> <p>\u201cDavid would have none of that. Sometimes, he thought I was a pompous dick. I\u2019d never had anyone tell me that before. He saved me from the worst things of myself. For some reason, I could take it from him in ways I couldn\u2019t from other people.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest row we ever had was the day Margaret Thatcher died,\u201d he says. \u201cI gave a whoop of triumph. To me, \u2018ding-dong the witch is dead\u2019 was the thing. I hated her all my adult life. He gave me a real bollocking about that.\u201d</p> <p>David had bought a burial plot long before his death \u2013 and one for a bemused Coles. \u201cHe came home one day, and he said: \u2018I\u2019ve bought our graves.\u2019 I said: \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 He said: \u2018It\u2019s a northern thing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Does being a vicar make it any easier to handle death? \u201cChristianity doesn\u2019t get you out of death,\u201d says Coles. \u201cIt just says there\u2019s something beyond it. But it doesn\u2019t get you out of loss or grief, or bereavement. It doesn\u2019t spare you any of that. On the contrary, I think it probably intensifies it.\u201d</p> <p>What does he think David would make of him giving an interview about grief to a national newspaper? \u201cHe would be rude about it,\u201d says Coles, laughing. \u201cHe would go, \u2018It\u2019s not about you.\u2019 He was very good, though. He knew that I needed to have the fires of my rampant ego stoked. And he was always very supportive of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01167e0bdc84f7fe0b4befeeda611f55156ccb1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01167e0bdc84f7fe0b4befeeda611f55156ccb1b/1474_948_3946_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coles at the vicarage where he lives with his two dachshunds Daisy and Pongo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coles at the vicarage where he lives with his dachshunds Daisy and Pongo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite losing his partner so abruptly, so young, Coles\u2019 faith has not been tested. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a religious sort of thing at all,\u201d says Coles. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any sense of him being in heaven and looking down, checking my behaviour.

Not being able to pass as straight never bothered him. \u201cIf you come from somewhere like Kettering, you feel a moral responsibility to fly the flag of flamboyance,\u201d he says.

He moved to London in the 1980s, immersing himself in the city\u2019s growing gay scene. He met Bronski Beat\u2019s Jimmy Somerville in Gay\u2019s The Word bookshop in Bloomsbury. Although Coles didn\u2019t harbour an ambition to be a pop star, he had been a choirboy and played saxophone at school, and Somerville asked him to join the band. In 1985, they broke away and formed the Communards. \u201cI didn\u2019t particularly want to be a pop star, so when it came along it was never something I longed for, and never something I couldn\u2019t imagine not doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI was stupid and I had a lot of money I didn\u2019t really do anything with, so I just spent it on lots of ecstasy.\u201d His soaring success with the Communards in the late 80s was marred by the HIV epidemic.

He spent much of his youth as an atheist (even setting up an atheist society at school), but after the years of fame, drugs and grief, he consulted a psychiatrist, who suggested he see a priest. Something struck him; he later did a degree in theology and in 2003 was selected to train for the priesthood in the Church of England. Does he ever see a tension between his past and present lives? \u201cAs a punk-inspired homosexual pop star, I think vicar actually kind of works, really,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very countercultural now. It really is, and there\u2019s something continuous between the two things. Although perhaps not everyone will see it that way.\u201d Certainly, Coles is a great performer and public speaker. He says he never had any issue reconciling his faith and his sexuality \u2013 being gay was just \u201ca variation on the universal theory of human sexuality\u201d \u2013 and he has had nothing but support from his congregation and his C of E bosses (although some parishioners did leave Finedon when he was appointed vicar in 2011). The Church of England\u2019s stance on LGBT equality, in particular same-sex marriage, has left Coles struggling to represent it at times, however. \u201cI did choose a profession that is probably the last to hold out against [LGBT] equality,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so awful\u2026 Sometimes I\u2019m ashamed of it and I think: \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake.\u2019\u201d When news of his partner\u2019s death broke, Coles received homophobic letters and emails rejoicing in his loss. \u201cOne began, \u2018I cannot begin to tell you how glad I am to hear the news that David has died,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe funny thing is, it didn\u2019t affect me at all because I had enough real shit to be dealing with.\u201d The police took the letters, assuring Coles that he had been the victim of a hate crime, although an investigation came to nothing. It was through the church that Coles met his partner, after giving a sermon. David, who was 15 years his junior, approached him after a service and said there were some spiritual questions he would like to talk over. \u201cFrom the minute we met \u2013 boom!\u201d Coles says. \u201cI never for a minute thought \u2013 no matter what happened \u2013 we would ever part.\u201d The couple became civil partners in 2011. \u201cHe said that if I didn\u2019t make an honest man of him, he would go off with somebody else.\u201d Coles laments the fact that he couldn\u2019t marry David. The Church of England forbids same-sex marriage and doing so could have led to both men losing their bishop\u2019s licence, which allowed them to work as priests \u2013 they planned to wait until they had retired. Even in a civil partnership, priests must commit to celibacy. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous but it\u2019s where we are,\u201d says Coles, who has always spoken candidly about the fact that he and David were celibate. \u201cIt kind of worked and it was OK for us, it sort of suited our lives. But I minded having to.\u201d Asked what David was like, Coles says his partner brought out the best in him. \u201cI have to be right, and think things through, and work out my position,\u201d says Coles. \u201cDavid would have none of that. Sometimes, he thought I was a pompous dick. I\u2019d never had anyone tell me that before. He saved me from the worst things of myself. For some reason, I could take it from him in ways I couldn\u2019t from other people. \u201cThe biggest row we ever had was the day Margaret Thatcher died,\u201d he says. \u201cI gave a whoop of triumph. To me, \u2018ding-dong the witch is dead\u2019 was the thing. I hated her all my adult life. He gave me a real bollocking about that.\u201d David had bought a burial plot long before his death \u2013 and one for a bemused Coles. \u201cHe came home one day, and he said: \u2018I\u2019ve bought our graves.\u2019 I said: \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 He said: \u2018It\u2019s a northern thing.\u2019\u201d Does being a vicar make it any easier to handle death? \u201cChristianity doesn\u2019t get you out of death,\u201d says Coles. \u201cIt just says there\u2019s something beyond it. But it doesn\u2019t get you out of loss or grief, or bereavement. It doesn\u2019t spare you any of that. On the contrary, I think it probably intensifies it.\u201d What does he think David would make of him giving an interview about grief to a national newspaper? \u201cHe would be rude about it,\u201d says Coles, laughing. \u201cHe would go, \u2018It\u2019s not about you.\u2019 He was very good, though. He knew that I needed to have the fires of my rampant ego stoked. And he was always very supportive of that.\u201d Despite losing his partner so abruptly, so young, Coles\u2019 faith has not been tested. \u201cIt\u2019s not been a religious sort of thing at all,\u201d says Coles. \u201cI\u2019ve never had any sense of him being in heaven and looking down, checking my behaviour. I don\u2019t sense him in the room \u2026 none of that at all. He\u2019s just not here. \u201cBut I am a Christian and I don\u2019t think this is all there is. Everything that was good about me and David, that\u2019s not finished. Nothing in that has flickered or faded at all.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted 24 hours a day on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "body": "<p>Speaking breathlessly between sips of tea, Su Pollard is talking about her stage debut, which took place at the age of six. She was playing one of the Angel Gabriel\u2019s sidekicks in a nativity play and, for some reason, had been made to stand on a cardboard box. \u201cI was telling Mary, \u2018Fear not! Angel Gabriel will \u2013\u2019 And then I disappeared into the box. The teacher hadn\u2019t made it strong enough.\u201d</p> <p>Little Su, demonstrating the professionalism that would come to define her career, climbed out and finished her line: \u201c\u2013 be coming to give you a sign.\u201d As the audience howled in delight, she realised that it was her destiny to make people laugh. Or at least so she says, with the advantage of hindsight. There is something very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/05/how-we-made-chumbawumba-tubthumping\">Chumbawamba</a> about Pollard: the woman best known for playing Peggy, the chalet cleaner in the BBC sitcom <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6j3nnn\">Hi-de-Hi!</a>, keeps getting knocked down, but she gets up again. She\u2019s so dogged in her relentless cheerfulness, so unstoppable once she gets going.</p> <p>Sitting opposite me at a hotel in London\u2019s Covent Garden, Pollard is about to tour the country in one of the few straight roles she has taken on since that debut 64 years ago. Fingers crossed, she won\u2019t be upstaged or injured by the scenery. But it remains a possibility since she is playing an extreme hoarder called Birdie who lives alone in her flat, surrounded by a lifetime\u2019s tat, of which more later.</p> <p>Hopefully Pollard won\u2019t go all Mrs Malaprop as she did during her professional debut in 1972. Appearing in a musical called The Desert Song, she was supposed to tell John Hanson: \u201cCome one step nearer and I\u2019ll fire!\u201d But instead she said: \u201cFire one step nearer and I\u2019ll come!\u201d It might have destroyed some careers, but not Pollard\u2019s. She carried on regardless, starring in panto, TV, more musicals and her own one-woman touring show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4513cfb2fa587590a47f3b48bea7c5b1327c846\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4513cfb2fa587590a47f3b48bea7c5b1327c846/430_578_2954_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Second place to a dog \u2026 Su Pollard on Opportunity Knocks in 1974.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Second place to a dog \u2026 Su Pollard on Opportunity Knocks in 1974.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fremantle Media/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fast-forward two years and she\u2019s in the final of TV talent show Opportunity Knocks, only to be beaten into second place by a dog. The Jack Russell terrier, Pollard recalls, was being held in the arms of a man who sang Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin. At certain notes, the dog would howl in tune. Britain had talent in those days, but not much. One theory about what was going on was advanced by Pollard\u2019s ex-husband Peter Keogh in his memoir My Hi-De-High Life: Before, After and During Su Pollard. Keogh speculated that the dog only howled because, at key moments, the singer put a finger up its backside.</p> <p>But Pollard reckons her rendition of I\u2019m Just a Girl Who Cain\u2019t Say No (also from Oklahoma!, curiously) failed to win her first place because she had removed her glasses and so sang into a speaker rather than the camera. \u201cPlus the fact that the dog was owned by a headmaster who got his pupils to vote for it. If only I\u2019d sung I Don\u2019t Know How to Love Him from Jesus Christ Superstar \u2013 it might have been a different story.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was that traumatic incident on the set of Hi-de-Hi! when Pollard was playing the back end of a horse. Unaccountably, there was a real horse on set that took a shine to the fake one\u2019s rear end. \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d she could be heard screaming from inside the costume as it tried to mount her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9feb91585c600e880cf42f71e5dafb86770ad2a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9feb91585c600e880cf42f71e5dafb86770ad2a6/227_72_1281_1601/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Help!

She and her three-piece had been making hardy miners sob into their pints with My Way and You Don\u2019t Love Me. When Pollard came off stage, she was asked if she\u2019d like a beer. Which, sensibly, she did.</p> <p>Then the patriarchy reared its ugly head. \u201cI was at the bar,\u201d she says, \u201cand the chairman came up and said, \u2018This is a men-only bar. You can\u2019t drink here.\u2019 I said, \u2018This is prehistoric.\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m not having it. You can drink over there.\u2019 And he pointed to an area outside. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to drink there.\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s not seemly. You\u2019re sacked.\u2019 I was well peeved.\u201d Understandably \u2013 and not just because she\u2019d been earning \u00a335 for two 20-minute slots. \u201cIt was in clubs like that where I made my name,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never occurred to me to get a solicitor and fight my corner. I was only a girl.\u201d</p> <p>Today, the 70-year-old is trying to overcome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/jul/18/hi-de-hi-repeats-as-the-bad-boys-of-brexit-meet-su-pollard\">a less expected setback</a>. Last year, it was reported that she attended a drinks party for Tory MPs and their spouses at No 10, as the guest of her friend, the Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Under the headline \u201cHi-de-Hi, Theresa!\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6585705/Hi-di-hi-di-Theresa-Sitcom-star-Su-Pollard-causes-havoc-Number-10-berates-PM.html\">the Mail on Sunday wrote</a>: \u201cSitcom star Su Pollard causes havoc at Number 10 as she wolf-whistles and berates PM and demands that she speeds up Brexit.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I gave Theresa May's husband Philip a big kiss on the cheek and said: 'I wish someone had my back like you have hers'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Guests were reportedly rendered speechless by Pollard\u2019s antics, although someone did manage to blab to the press. \u201cBreaking off a conversation with energy minister Claire Perry,\u201d the report continued, \u201cMrs May said, \u2018Hello there, Su.\u2019 The actress and singer shouted back, \u2018Hi-de-Hi, Theresa!\u2019\u201d Pleasantries over, the conversation foundered. \u201cThe prime minister is not great at the smalltalk at the best of times, so it looked pretty painful. Su just kept saying, \u2018We want <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>\u2019 and, \u2018What\u2019s happening with Brexit, why is it taking so long?\u2019 and, \u2018We want Brexit now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Pollard takes a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened at all. What happened was I had a lovely chat with Philip [May\u2019s husband]. I said, \u2018I wish someone had my back like you have hers.\u2019 I gave him a big kiss on the cheek. And then we talked about cakes.\u201d Cakes? Not Brexit? \u201cWhich would you rather talk about?\u201d Good point.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a political person at all,\u201d she says. Actually, that\u2019s not quite right. When Pollard tells me where she lives in London, I ask if she voted for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/emily-thornberry\">Emily Thornberry</a>, her local Labour MP. She declines to answer but does say: \u201cI really like Emily Thornberry. She\u2019s a strong woman, tough as old boots. I admire that in a woman. She\u2019s continually writing to me, asking if I can help, but I try to be unbiased.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b065093777323abbec85401c8fa62d6d2850922c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b065093777323abbec85401c8fa62d6d2850922c/0_208_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hoarder and her tat \u2026 Pollard as Birdie in her new show Harpy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hoarder and her tat \u2026 Pollard as Birdie in her new show Harpy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Karla Gowlett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I take a sidelong look at Pollard and wonder if Thornberry has really thought this through. Today, Pollard is gamely sporting a chain mail-effect jumper she bought from a shop called Utopia in Islington that really sets off her zebra-pattern shoes. \u201cI do dress flamboyantly and I don\u2019t care what anyone thinks,\u201d she says. \u201cEver since I walked down Chapel Market and someone yelled out, \u2018Hi-de-Hi!\u2019 and I yelled back, \u2018Ho-de-Ho!\u2019 I\u2019ve not hidden away. Why should I?\u201d More sips of tea. \u201cI could always go out with a bag over my head. People would ask, \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 And I\u2019d reply, \u2018Mystery Bag. It\u2019s Mystery Bag.\u2019\u201d Don\u2019t do that, Su.</p> <p>Pollard\u2019s English eccentricity and doughty spirit is no doubt what attracted Philip Meeks to write the role of Birdie for her. \u201cWe were in panto together,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was the dame and I was the evil queen. He kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ve written something with you in mind; will you look at it?\u2019 I finally did and was really touched.\u201d</p> <p>The play, called Harpy, starts with Pollard singing into a hairbrush while the neighbours bang on the wall. Then we start to realise something\u2019s not quite right. Towers of tat seem poised to tumble on her and yet Birdie negotiates her way through this labyrinth singing, chatting to her fish, conversing with her unseen off-stage social worker and, like a Beckett heroine, keeping up a monologue that suggests her grip on reality is fragile. \u201cWhat\u2019s that Japanese woman called who sorts out your home?\u201d Marie Kondo. \u201cMarie Condom! Birdie needs Marie Condom.\u201d She giggles as Mrs Malaprop rides again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd20fcb3d866b5ca13b2ef5ecf44f78571cf0c3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd20fcb3d866b5ca13b2ef5ecf44f78571cf0c3e/0_0_6122_4469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018What a way to talk about a woman!\u2019 \u2026 Pollard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What a way to talk about a woman!\u2019 \u2026 Pollard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI know Philip was inspired by someone who lived near him. But we all know hoarders, don\u2019t we?\u201d Are you one? \u201cNot as much as Birdie, because I have clear-outs. I remember taking a lovely decanter I\u2019d had for 30 years to a charity shop. It had just sat there unused. And the woman in the shop said, \u2018That\u2019s lovely. I\u2019ll have that.\u2019 Can\u2019t blame her.\u201d</p> <p>Pollard thinks the play is important for the light it throws on attitudes to solitary, often elderly people. \u201cBirdie gets called harpy and harridan and hag. What a way to talk about a woman! It\u2019s about respect and care for the elderly. And also, how we tend to judge people we don\u2019t bother trying to understand. As the play unfolds, we learn that something happened to Birdie when she was younger \u2013 I won\u2019t say what. But it\u2019s meant to be both funny and poignant in dramatising mental health.\u201d</p> <p>Like Birdie, Pollard lives alone. \u201cThat\u2019s the only parallel! I\u2019m nothing like her. There is no psychic wound keeping me at home. I\u2019m loving working and I\u2019ll never retire. I feel as though I\u2019m ageless.\u201d She\u2019s also childless. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that. I\u2019ve never wanted grandchildren scampering around the place.

She carried on regardless, starring in panto, TV, more musicals and her own one-woman touring show. Fast-forward two years and she\u2019s in the final of TV talent show Opportunity Knocks, only to be beaten into second place by a dog. The Jack Russell terrier, Pollard recalls, was being held in the arms of a man who sang Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin. At certain notes, the dog would howl in tune. Britain had talent in those days, but not much. One theory about what was going on was advanced by Pollard\u2019s ex-husband Peter Keogh in his memoir My Hi-De-High Life: Before, After and During Su Pollard. Keogh speculated that the dog only howled because, at key moments, the singer put a finger up its backside. But Pollard reckons her rendition of I\u2019m Just a Girl Who Cain\u2019t Say No (also from Oklahoma!, curiously) failed to win her first place because she had removed her glasses and so sang into a speaker rather than the camera. \u201cPlus the fact that the dog was owned by a headmaster who got his pupils to vote for it. If only I\u2019d sung I Don\u2019t Know How to Love Him from Jesus Christ Superstar \u2013 it might have been a different story.\u201d Then there was that traumatic incident on the set of Hi-de-Hi! when Pollard was playing the back end of a horse. Unaccountably, there was a real horse on set that took a shine to the fake one\u2019s rear end. \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d she could be heard screaming from inside the costume as it tried to mount her. But perhaps Pollard\u2019s most heroic moment came in 1965 when, aged 15, she played Basford Hall Miners\u2019 Welfare Club in her native Nottingham. She and her three-piece had been making hardy miners sob into their pints with My Way and You Don\u2019t Love Me. When Pollard came off stage, she was asked if she\u2019d like a beer. Which, sensibly, she did. Then the patriarchy reared its ugly head. \u201cI was at the bar,\u201d she says, \u201cand the chairman came up and said, \u2018This is a men-only bar. You can\u2019t drink here.\u2019 I said, \u2018This is prehistoric.\u2019 He said, \u2018I\u2019m not having it. You can drink over there.\u2019 And he pointed to an area outside. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to drink there.\u2019 He said, \u2018It\u2019s not seemly. You\u2019re sacked.\u2019 I was well peeved.\u201d Understandably \u2013 and not just because she\u2019d been earning \u00a335 for two 20-minute slots. \u201cIt was in clubs like that where I made my name,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never occurred to me to get a solicitor and fight my corner. I was only a girl.\u201d Today, the 70-year-old is trying to overcome a less expected setback. Last year, it was reported that she attended a drinks party for Tory MPs and their spouses at No 10, as the guest of her friend, the Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell. Under the headline \u201cHi-de-Hi, Theresa!\u201d, the Mail on Sunday wrote: \u201cSitcom star Su Pollard causes havoc at Number 10 as she wolf-whistles and berates PM and demands that she speeds up Brexit.\u201d Guests were reportedly rendered speechless by Pollard\u2019s antics, although someone did manage to blab to the press. \u201cBreaking off a conversation with energy minister Claire Perry,\u201d the report continued, \u201cMrs May said, \u2018Hello there, Su.\u2019 The actress and singer shouted back, \u2018Hi-de-Hi, Theresa!\u2019\u201d Pleasantries over, the conversation foundered. \u201cThe prime minister is not great at the smalltalk at the best of times, so it looked pretty painful. Su just kept saying, \u2018We want Brexit\u2019 and, \u2018What\u2019s happening with Brexit, why is it taking so long?\u2019 and, \u2018We want Brexit now.\u2019\u201d Pollard takes a breath. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened at all. What happened was I had a lovely chat with Philip [May\u2019s husband]. I said, \u2018I wish someone had my back like you have hers.\u2019 I gave him a big kiss on the cheek. And then we talked about cakes.\u201d Cakes? Not Brexit? \u201cWhich would you rather talk about?\u201d Good point. \u201cI\u2019m not a political person at all,\u201d she says. Actually, that\u2019s not quite right. When Pollard tells me where she lives in London, I ask if she voted for Emily Thornberry, her local Labour MP. She declines to answer but does say: \u201cI really like Emily Thornberry. She\u2019s a strong woman, tough as old boots. I admire that in a woman. She\u2019s continually writing to me, asking if I can help, but I try to be unbiased.\u201d I take a sidelong look at Pollard and wonder if Thornberry has really thought this through. Today, Pollard is gamely sporting a chain mail-effect jumper she bought from a shop called Utopia in Islington that really sets off her zebra-pattern shoes. \u201cI do dress flamboyantly and I don\u2019t care what anyone thinks,\u201d she says. \u201cEver since I walked down Chapel Market and someone yelled out, \u2018Hi-de-Hi!\u2019 and I yelled back, \u2018Ho-de-Ho!\u2019 I\u2019ve not hidden away. Why should I?\u201d More sips of tea. \u201cI could always go out with a bag over my head. People would ask, \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 And I\u2019d reply, \u2018Mystery Bag. It\u2019s Mystery Bag.\u2019\u201d Don\u2019t do that, Su. Pollard\u2019s English eccentricity and doughty spirit is no doubt what attracted Philip Meeks to write the role of Birdie for her. \u201cWe were in panto together,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was the dame and I was the evil queen. He kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ve written something with you in mind; will you look at it?\u2019 I finally did and was really touched.\u201d The play, called Harpy, starts with Pollard singing into a hairbrush while the neighbours bang on the wall. Then we start to realise something\u2019s not quite right. Towers of tat seem poised to tumble on her and yet Birdie negotiates her way through this labyrinth singing, chatting to her fish, conversing with her unseen off-stage social worker and, like a Beckett heroine, keeping up a monologue that suggests her grip on reality is fragile. \u201cWhat\u2019s that Japanese woman called who sorts out your home?\u201d Marie Kondo. \u201cMarie Condom! Birdie needs Marie Condom.\u201d She giggles as Mrs Malaprop rides again. \u201cI know Philip was inspired by someone who lived near him. But we all know hoarders, don\u2019t we?\u201d Are you one? \u201cNot as much as Birdie, because I have clear-outs. I remember taking a lovely decanter I\u2019d had for 30 years to a charity shop. It had just sat there unused. And the woman in the shop said, \u2018That\u2019s lovely. I\u2019ll have that.\u2019 Can\u2019t blame her.\u201d Pollard thinks the play is important for the light it throws on attitudes to solitary, often elderly people. \u201cBirdie gets called harpy and harridan and hag. What a way to talk about a woman! It\u2019s about respect and care for the elderly. And also, how we tend to judge people we don\u2019t bother trying to understand. As the play unfolds, we learn that something happened to Birdie when she was younger \u2013 I won\u2019t say what. But it\u2019s meant to be both funny and poignant in dramatising mental health.\u201d Like Birdie, Pollard lives alone. \u201cThat\u2019s the only parallel! I\u2019m nothing like her. There is no psychic wound keeping me at home. I\u2019m loving working and I\u2019ll never retire. I feel as though I\u2019m ageless.\u201d She\u2019s also childless. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that. I\u2019ve never wanted grandchildren scampering around the place. I can look after myself, thanks very much.\u201d Harpy is at King\u2019s theatre, Portsmouth, 12-13 March. Then touring until 2 May.",

      "bodyText": "A charity led by the archbishop of Canterbury is preparing to help feed children if schools are closed by coronavirus, amid fears the withdrawal of free school dinners could leave up to 3 million children at risk of hunger. Feeding Britain, which runs food poverty schemes in 12 areas of England including Cornwall, Leicester, Barnsley and South Shields, is exploring how to set up emergency programmes similar to those used to feed the poorest children during the summer holidays. The Akshaya Patra Foundation, which serves thousands of hot meals to children every summer in London boroughs, is also \u201cprepared to enter crisis mode\u201d, while food projects in Bristol and Huddersfield said they were exploring how their schemes to feed hundreds of children in school holidays could be adapted to help cope with emergency closures. \u201cFor so many families now, schools are the first line of defence against hunger,\u201d said Andrew Forsey, the national director of Feeding Britain, whose president is the Most Rev Justin Welby. \u201cIn many cases it is breakfast as well as lunch, so if the schools close it\u2019s two meals we have to find. There is early-stage planning going on around ensuring supplies of food and the extent of voluntary support that could be drawn upon if some schools do need to close.\u201d Downing Street said on Tuesday that school closures would be among \u201cdistancing strategies\u201d used if the virus became established in the UK. On Thursday, Italy closed all of its schools and colleges for a month. FareShare, a charity that distributes food to more than 700 holiday food projects, has said it wants to recruit more volunteers to tackle the fallout from coronavirus. An immediate challenge is likely to be finding a way to deliver meals in a way that maintains the distance between people that school closures are meant to achieve. The Bristol project said it could involve delivering food parcels door-to-door. Forsey also said panic-buying that cleared supermarket shelves could hinder efforts as many free meal programmes relied on retailers\u2019 donations. MPs have estimated 3 million children are at risk of being hungry in the school holidays \u2013 made up of more than a million children who qualify for free school meals, and about 2 million who are disqualified from free school meals because their parents work but remain in poverty. Donna Sealey, a charity worker at the Ambition Lawrence Weston food project in Bristol, which fed 175 children over the summer, said: \u201cIf it is a week off, many can scrape along, but a month would be a significant amount of time. By the second week, you haven\u2019t got any money or food. We would kick in the programme to do something similar to the six-week school holiday.\u201d Sealey said problems could be worsened because many families relied on money from zero-hours contract work, which meant if they had to look after their children their earnings would dry up. Teachers have said that closures are likely to most disadvantage the educations of pupils at state primaries because they lack the IT infrastructure of private schools and state secondaries. A survey has found that while a majority of state secondary school teachers said they could set work for their pupils remotely, fewer than one in 10 state primary school teachers said their school was able to broadcast lessons to pupils by video. Only about one in six said they had the technology to set and receive work from pupils, according to the survey by the Teacher Tapp app. Nearly 30% of teachers at primary and secondary independent schools said they already had the capacity to deliver lessons by video. \u201cState schools can\u2019t take for granted that every child has their own device at home and limitless data access,\u201d said the former teacher Laura McInerney, a Guardian education columnist and co-founder of the app.",

In England, as with the US, there is another problem: the sense that, in some people\u2019s eyes, the association of whole chunks of the country with support for the populist right has put them beyond the pale. In the midst of our polarised politics, it is worth remembering that the most representative face of these people and places is not some verbose racist, discovered by a team of television researchers and presented to the viewing public as an authentic spokesperson. It is likely to be someone much quieter, who is well aware of shrinking horizons and vanishing prospects, and looking with uncertainty into a future of dependency, ill health and an early death. This, it seems to me, is the social crisis of our times. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

Data included people\u2019s names, dates of birth, email addresses, city location, friends list, page likes and Facebook messages for those who had granted the app access to the messages. \u201cWe consider the design of the Facebook platform meant that users were unable to exercise reasonable choice and control about how their personal information was disclosed,\u201d Falk said. \u201cFacebook\u2019s default settings facilitated the disclosure of personal information, including sensitive information, at the expense of privacy.\u201d At the time, Facebook said 311,127 Australians between March 2014 and May 2015 had data shared with the app, accounting for 0.4% of users affected by the breach. However, the court documents reveal just 53 people in Australia installed the app. 87m users worldwide were affected by the scandal. The OAIC says in its court filing that the design of Facebook made it so that users were unable to consent or control over how their data was disclosed, and to date, Facebook has not been able to tell the OAIC which Australian users were affected. The Guardian and Observer revealed data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica worked with Donald Trump\u2019s election team and the Leave campaign in the UK Brexit referendum. The data was used to build a software program to predict and influence voters. Facebook discovered the information had been harvested by a third party in late 2015, but failed to alert users at the time. In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company had been engaging with the OAIC on this matter for two years. \u201cWe\u2019ve made major changes to our platforms, in consultation with international regulators, to restrict the information available to app developers, implement new governance protocols and build industry-leading controls to help people protect and manage their data,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re unable to comment further as this is now before the federal court.\u201d Each contravention comes with a maximum penalty of $1.7m. The OAIC is alleging multiple breaches but did not indicate whether penalties would be sought for all 311,127 users affected. The relief sought just asks the court to order Facebook to \u201cpay civil pecuniary penalties\u201d under the Privacy Act \u201cas applicable for contraventions that occurred during the relevant period.\u201d According to the court documents, Cambridge Analytica provided written confirmation in January 2016 that all users\u2019 personal information obtained through the app had been deleted, but the company did not take any independent steps to ensure the data had been deleted or destroyed. In the UK Facebook was fined \u00a3500,000 for the breach, while in the US, the federal trade commission fined the company US$5bn. In October last year, the OAIC was criticised for taking its time in resolving the investigation.",

      "bodyText": "Josh Frydenberg says the Morrison government will use the tax and transfer system to get financial support to Australian households as quickly as possible as part of a looming stimulus package to counter the negative economic impact of the coronavirus. Ahead of a cabinet deliberation about the stimulus package expected on Tuesday, the treasurer was asked by reporters on Monday how the government intended to administer assistance to households, given the Coalition has criticised the Rudd government\u2019s stimulus package deployed during the global financial crisis. As recently as late last week, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, declared households should not expect Kevin Rudd-style cash payments to stimulate the economy in the wake of the coronavirus. Frydenberg told reporters on Monday when it came to households: \u201cWe have our existing systems, the tax and transfer systems. In terms of the specific details, I will leave that to our announcement, but what we will be focused is ensuring the support gets out there as fast as possible.\u201d The treasurer said the multibillion-dollar package, which the government has been working up over the past couple of weeks in anticipation of a sustained economic hit from both the bushfires and the coronavirus, would be \u201cvery comprehensive and very substantial\u201d. \u201cThe economic response will be substantial, it will be targeted and it will be focused on supporting those people and those businesses that need our support during this period,\u201d the treasurer said. Frydenberg hinted the government would roll out the first phase of assistance to households and business imminently, then likely revisit again at the May budget. He said the measures would be \u201cscalable\u201d. The treasurer said the virus had inflicted supply and demand side constraints on economies, including Australia, \u201cand that\u2019s where our package will be focused\u201d. The government has signalled a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners through changes to deeming rates, and immediate support for small and medium-sized businesses will form part of the looming package. Frydenberg said on Monday the stimulus package, which is expected to be announced before the prime minister and the premiers meet this Friday in Sydney for the Council of Australian Governments, would not include updated economic forecasts taking into account the hits inflicted on the budget by the summer bushfire crisis and the virus. Forecasts, he said, would be updated in the May budget. Last week, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, revealed that the department was forecasting a 0.7% contraction in economic growth in the March quarter, equivalent to lost activity worth about $3.5bn. Speaking in Brisbane, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, encouraged the Morrison government to move quickly and substantively with the stimulus package. \u201cWe need to make sure that whatever the government announces is not too little too late. \u201cWe need to make sure that whatever they announce is big enough and fast enough to make a genuine difference in a floundering economy,\u201d Chalmers said. The shadow treasurer also advocated support for workers whose incomes will be disrupted by the illness, and for businesses. \u201cWe need the government to focus on those most affected by these challenges \u2013 whether it be workers without paid sick leave, whether it be businesses in the affected sectors having trouble with cashflow\u201d. The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, will meet on Tuesday with unions and employer groups. Australia\u2019s 3.3-million-strong casual workforce is posing particular challenges now the coronavirus is being transmitted in the community. The government\u2019s advice to workers to self-isolate and work from home in the event of illness is not a solution available for many casual and service industry workers. Labor has proposed a Newstart-like payment be made available to workers forced to self-isolate. The ACTU national secretary, Sally McManus, wants to put compensation for casual workers on the table, highlighting the flow-on effects from workers suddenly being denied an income. \u201cIt should be just paid leave,\u201d McManus said, suggesting employers be compensated by the government once the crisis has passed. Porter\u2019s office said Tuesday\u2019s meeting was a first-step discussion about the potential issues facing Australia\u2019s business community and workforce. Frydenberg said the government was \u201cvery conscious\u201d workers would be concerned about job security, and would be an issue discussed at Porter\u2019s roundtable on Tuesday. The treasurer urged businesses to be cooperative and flexible. Advocates have also drawn attention to the government\u2019s plan to scrap the sickness allowance, as part of a plan to roll seven social services payments into the one JobSeeker payment. That is due to take affect on 20 March, with those impacted being told to apply for the JobSeeker payment, which comes with mutual obligations those self-isolating will most likely be unable to meet. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, has already ruled out any changes to Newstart, saying any future raises to the rate would be part of measures separate to the coming stimulus plan.",

The Alpha Tauri cars and the Ferrari cars are on their way from Avalon [airport] as we speak, so it\u2019s really good. The key personnel are on their planes.</p> <p>\u201cInterestingly, the only two people who didn\u2019t hail from Italy were Sebastian Vettel, who came out of Switzerland, and Charles Leclerc coming out of Monaco via Nice. All the others are on their way, and we\u2019re expecting [them] in the next 12 to 24 hours.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny Mikakos, the minister for health, said the fact there had been no reported cases of community transmission of the virus in Victoria meant the grand prix could go ahead.</p> <p>\u201cAt this point in time our advice around the grand prix and other public mass gathering events remains unchanged,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to enable people to go about and live their lives as normally as possible, of course taking greater precautions than they would normally.\u201d</p> <p>More than 300,000 people usually attend the race weekend, raising fears over the spread of the virus this year, but Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Brett Sutton said there was no need yet to advise against events on such a scale.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a time and a place for the cancellation of public gatherings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe timing is important because when community transmission is at significant levels it has an effect.</p> <p>\u201cWhen there is undetected or very small numbers of community transmission occurring that is not necessarily the time. It loses the will of the population to engage in what is required and has very little effect on the epidemic curve.</p> <p>\u201cMake no mistake, we will hit the button on the things that are required for social distancing at the point they\u2019re required.\u201d</p> <p>That threshold, he said, would come when there is \u201csignificant community transmission\u201d.</p> <p>Last week the Australian government announced enhanced screening measures for travellers arriving from Italy, although it stopped short of imposing an outright travel ban, as it has done for China, Iran and South Korea.</p> <p>Under the new measures, team mechanics and staff have been subject to rigorous checks before their departure from Italy and then upon arrival in Australia. If a traveller fails those health checks, they will be refused entry to the country.</p> <p>Professor Brendan Murphy, the Australian government\u2019s chief medical officer, said he did not believe there was a risk in staging the grand prix weekend, which starts on Friday with free practice and concludes with the main race on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cObviously people have been talking about the Italian Ferrari team, but they\u2019ve been carefully screened on the way in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no evidence of community transmission in Victoria at the moment. I\u2019m not feeling at all concerned going to mass gatherings or walking down the streets in Victoria.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Italian Formula One cars have arrived in Australia and there is no chance of the opening grand prix of the season being cancelled, postponed or being held behind closed doors, despite fears over the coronavirus. Andrew Westacott, CEO of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, said on Monday the race will proceed as planned at Albert Park, after it was announced the next race on the calendar, the Bahrain GP on 22 March, will be run without spectators present. April\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix has already been postponed. The growing spread of the virus had led to concern over whether the Australian GP would be affected, but when questioned about the possibility of Melbourne following Bahrain by excluding fans, Westacott was adamant it would not. \u201cNot a chance,\u201d Westacott told SEN. \u201cWhen you look at 86,000 at the MCG last night, and the footy the week after, we\u2019ve got to go around things sensibly and keep moving on through life while taking the necessary precautions. \u201cThe interesting thing is the Italian freight. The Alpha Tauri cars and the Ferrari cars are on their way from Avalon [airport] as we speak, so it\u2019s really good. The key personnel are on their planes. \u201cInterestingly, the only two people who didn\u2019t hail from Italy were Sebastian Vettel, who came out of Switzerland, and Charles Leclerc coming out of Monaco via Nice. All the others are on their way, and we\u2019re expecting [them] in the next 12 to 24 hours.\u201d Jenny Mikakos, the minister for health, said the fact there had been no reported cases of community transmission of the virus in Victoria meant the grand prix could go ahead. \u201cAt this point in time our advice around the grand prix and other public mass gathering events remains unchanged,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to enable people to go about and live their lives as normally as possible, of course taking greater precautions than they would normally.\u201d More than 300,000 people usually attend the race weekend, raising fears over the spread of the virus this year, but Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Brett Sutton said there was no need yet to advise against events on such a scale. \u201cThere is a time and a place for the cancellation of public gatherings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe timing is important because when community transmission is at significant levels it has an effect. \u201cWhen there is undetected or very small numbers of community transmission occurring that is not necessarily the time. It loses the will of the population to engage in what is required and has very little effect on the epidemic curve. \u201cMake no mistake, we will hit the button on the things that are required for social distancing at the point they\u2019re required.\u201d That threshold, he said, would come when there is \u201csignificant community transmission\u201d. Last week the Australian government announced enhanced screening measures for travellers arriving from Italy, although it stopped short of imposing an outright travel ban, as it has done for China, Iran and South Korea. Under the new measures, team mechanics and staff have been subject to rigorous checks before their departure from Italy and then upon arrival in Australia. If a traveller fails those health checks, they will be refused entry to the country. Professor Brendan Murphy, the Australian government\u2019s chief medical officer, said he did not believe there was a risk in staging the grand prix weekend, which starts on Friday with free practice and concludes with the main race on Sunday. \u201cObviously people have been talking about the Italian Ferrari team, but they\u2019ve been carefully screened on the way in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no evidence of community transmission in Victoria at the moment. I\u2019m not feeling at all concerned going to mass gatherings or walking down the streets in Victoria.\u201d",

We are completely exposed to the monitoring of the government,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Experts say the virus, which emerged in Wuhan in December, has given authorities a pretext for accelerating the mass collection of personal data to track citizens, a dangerous prospect given that the country does not have stringent laws governing personal data.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mission creep,\u201d said Maya Wang, senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. According to Wang, the virus is likely to be a catalyst for a further expansion of the surveillance regime, as major events like the 2008 Olympics held in Beijing or the Shanghai Expo in 2010 were. \u201cThe techniques of mass surveillance became more permanent after these events,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWith the coronavirus outbreak the idea of risk scoring and restrictions on movement quickly became reality,\u201d she said. \u201cOver time we see more and more intrusive use of technology and less ability of people to push back.\u201d</p> <p>Many Chinese residents see the extra layers of public monitoring as additional bureaucratic hurdles, more frustrating than sinister, that further demonstrate the government\u2019s ineffectiveness in handling the outbreak.</p> <p>China\u2019s surveillance dragnet, while proudly promoted by officials, is full of loopholes. An ex-inmate infected with the virus managed to travel from Wuhan to Beijing last month, well after quarantine measures had gone into effect, prompting widespread criticism over how she left.</p> <p>Citizens are particularly critical of a system called Health Code, which users can sign up for through Alipay or WeChat, that assigns individuals one of three colour codes based on their travel history, time spent in outbreak hotspots and exposure to potential carriers of the virus. The software, used in more than 100 cities, will soon allow people to check the colours of other residents when their ID numbers are entered.</p> <p>One resident complained on Weibo that he had driven through Hubei without stopping but his colour code changed to yellow from green, indicating he would need to be quarantined. \u201cI can\u2019t even go out to buy bread or water,\u201d another in Jiangsu province said, after his code inexplicably changed to yellow following a work trip.</p> <p>Many described the app as \u201cfor appearances,\u201d or <em>xingshi zhuyi</em>, a way for lower level officials to impress their higher ups with added strictures on citizens.</p> <p>\u201cI have a health code, a pass for my residential compound, and another certificate of health and still I can\u2019t get into my home,\u201d one commentator said. \u201cThis is garbage.

Experts say the virus, which emerged in Wuhan in December, has given authorities a pretext for accelerating the mass collection of personal data to track citizens, a dangerous prospect given that the country does not have stringent laws governing personal data. \u201cIt\u2019s mission creep,\u201d said Maya Wang, senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. According to Wang, the virus is likely to be a catalyst for a further expansion of the surveillance regime, as major events like the 2008 Olympics held in Beijing or the Shanghai Expo in 2010 were. \u201cThe techniques of mass surveillance became more permanent after these events,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the coronavirus outbreak the idea of risk scoring and restrictions on movement quickly became reality,\u201d she said. \u201cOver time we see more and more intrusive use of technology and less ability of people to push back.\u201d Many Chinese residents see the extra layers of public monitoring as additional bureaucratic hurdles, more frustrating than sinister, that further demonstrate the government\u2019s ineffectiveness in handling the outbreak. China\u2019s surveillance dragnet, while proudly promoted by officials, is full of loopholes. An ex-inmate infected with the virus managed to travel from Wuhan to Beijing last month, well after quarantine measures had gone into effect, prompting widespread criticism over how she left. Citizens are particularly critical of a system called Health Code, which users can sign up for through Alipay or WeChat, that assigns individuals one of three colour codes based on their travel history, time spent in outbreak hotspots and exposure to potential carriers of the virus. The software, used in more than 100 cities, will soon allow people to check the colours of other residents when their ID numbers are entered. One resident complained on Weibo that he had driven through Hubei without stopping but his colour code changed to yellow from green, indicating he would need to be quarantined. \u201cI can\u2019t even go out to buy bread or water,\u201d another in Jiangsu province said, after his code inexplicably changed to yellow following a work trip. Many described the app as \u201cfor appearances,\u201d or xingshi zhuyi, a way for lower level officials to impress their higher ups with added strictures on citizens. \u201cI have a health code, a pass for my residential compound, and another certificate of health and still I can\u2019t get into my home,\u201d one commentator said. \u201cThis is garbage. Please release us regular people,\u201d another said. Low-tech security measures have been employed as much as high-tech ones. An army of workers guard entry points to public spaces, ordering pedestrians to log their information or questioning residents about their recent movements. Religious sites like mosques have been closed. Many cities and counties have banned group gatherings, including small dinner parties. In February, Sichuan province officials broke up a group playing mahjong party and forced the participants to read out an apology, captured on video. \u201cWe were wrong. We promise there will not be a next time and we will also monitor others,\u201d the group of 10 men said, heads slightly bowed. Other videos posted online have shown local officials pushing residents to the ground for not wearing a face mask or tying a man to a pole. Local law enforcement in Wuhan were recently fired after a video of them beating a man for selling vegetables on the street was posted online. An article by the official state news agency Xinhua last week reminded citizens that those who violate virus prevention and control measures could be subject to three years in prison, and up to seven for particularly serious cases, as outlined in China\u2019s criminal code. \u201cIntrusive surveillance is already the \u2018new normal\u2019. The question for China is what, if any, is a level of surveillance that the population refuses to tolerate,\u201d said Stuart Hargreaves, an associate professor at Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s law school, focusing on privacy and information law. Some worry current measures will continue in part because citizens are growing accustomed to them. Alex Zhang, 28, who lives in Chengdu, refers to Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben\u2019s theory on the state of exception, and how measures taken during a state of emergency can be prolonged. \u201cThis type of governance and thinking for dealing with the epidemic can also be used for other issues - like the media, citizen journalists or ethnic conflicts. Because this method has been used before, citizens will accept it. It becomes normal,\u201d he said. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

If a health minister is truly flabbergasted at the lived reality of being a doctor in an overstretched system, where is she receiving her advice? If she is being falsely reassured that all doctors are allowed to take sick leave, they just choose not to do so, who is doing the reassuring? If the health minister lacks confidence in doctors, will the public follow suit? It is one thing for a patient to be misinformed but a health minister wields power, with which comes responsibility. In navigating the newest challenge to population health, it is worth remembering the oldest adage of medicine, primum non nocere. First, do no harm. \u2022 Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar. Her latest book is called A Better Death",

These stations are largely staffed by women, focus entirely on family violence and offer services such as childcare, financial counsellors, legal help and psychologists for women trying to leave abusive relationships.

Meanwhile, the latest data, from the Centre for Retail Research, shows that 18,466 jobs have been lost in UK retail up to 27 February 2020, with store closures standing at 1,213. In January, more than 3,000 retail jobs were lost in a week as baby products group Mothercare and jeweller Links of London closed 94 stores for good. Last month fashion retailer Ted Baker said it would axe 160 roles as it grapples with declining sales, profits and a \u00a358m accounting error. Diane Wehrle, a director at Springboard, said: \u201cIf further proof of the fragility of high streets were needed, it was provided in February when the impact of the severe and ongoing rain led to a drop in footfall of -7.8%. \u201cWhile an average of 17 days of rain across the UK over the month led to shoppers staying away from high streets, shopping centres and retail parks still appealed to many by virtue of either their covered environment or ease of access and proximity of parking.\u201d She added that while coronavirus did not have a noticeable impact on footfall in February, the month ended before the warning of its increased severity was made. \u201cMoving forward, it is likely that shopper activity will be stemmed as consumers become more wary about interacting in public spaces,\u201d she said. The retail crisis has made the calls for the reform of business rates \u2013 which will raise more than \u00a38bn from retailers in the coming year \u2013 even more urgent in the eyes of the retail industry. The commercial equivalent of council tax has been blamed for making a bad situation worse, with the new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, reportedly considering fleshing out the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto commitment to carry out a \u201cfundamental review\u201d. Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the department store chain Beales, has blamed the group\u2019s annual \u00a32.8m business rate bill for scuppering attempts to rescue the 23-store chain, which is now being closed with the loss of 1,000 jobs.",
